'''The Algatron''' was a proposed and prototyped waste filtration and recycling system to be implemented on [[NASA]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and built by a pair of sanitary engineers at the [[University of California, Berkley]] [[William J. Oswald]] and [[Clarence Golueke]], the Algatron relied on algae to provide carbon Dioxide absorption and oxygen generation as well as "microbiological waste conversion" for "humans sealed within an isolated capsule.".&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, Golueke, and Horning, "Closed Ecological Systems," 45&lt;/ref&gt; A working model was built by Oswald and Golueke in 1965 or 1966 under a contract by from the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid,. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of two stacked cylinders lined with Algae, the cylinders would spin in opposite directions. With ports to allow sunlight in, nutrients (the waste and urine) were introduced via some overflow mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Algatron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/21/algatron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise that the Algatron represented, and the ways in which Oswald and Golueke "understood that the closed environment of the space capsule was itself just the a microcosm of the closed system of the earth's biosphere," the technology would never get past the prototype stage. NASA instead decided to go with fecal bags to deal with waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians developed a similar system, the BIOS-3, which got as far enough as a successful test run with human occupants in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''art of the Third Reich''' was the government-approved art produced in [[Nazi Germany]] between 1933 and 1945. Upon becoming dictator in 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] gave his personal artistic preference the force of law to a degree rarely known before.

In the case of Germany, the model was to be [[Ancient Greek art|classical Greek]] and [[Roman art]], seen by [[Hitler]] as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; It was, furthermore, to be comprehensible to the average man.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy p335"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 335. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art was to be both [[heroic art|heroic]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]].&lt;ref name="Richard Overy p335"/&gt; The Nazis viewed the culture of the [[Weimar period]] with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from conservative [[aesthetics]] and partly from their determination to use culture as [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Adam110" /&gt;

==Theory== 
As indicated by historian Henry Grosshans in his book ''Hitler and the Artists'', Adolf Hitler who [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|came to power in 1933]] (quote): "saw Greek and [[Roman art]] as uncontaminated by Jewish influences. Modern art was [perceived by him as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler – wrote Grosshans – even though only [[Max Liebermann|Liebermann]], [[Ludwig Meidner|Meidner]], [[Otto Freundlich|Freundlich]], and [[Marc Chagall]], among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The supposedly "Jewish" nature of art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented "depraved" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race.

By propagating the theory of [[degenerate art]], the Nazis combined their [[anti-Semitism]] with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts in this regard were unquestionably aided by a popular hostility to Modernism that predated their movement.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', p. 161. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that such art had reflected Germany's condition and [[moral bankruptcy]] was widespread, and many artists acted in a manner to overtly undermine or challenge popular values and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 358. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-073-26, München, Haus der Deutschen Kunst.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The ''House of German Art'' in Munich]]

In July 1937, two officially sponsored exhibitions opened in [[Munich]]: ''Entartete Kunst'', (the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]), displayed modern art in a deliberately chaotic installation accompanied by defamatory labels that encouraged the public to jeer; in contrast, the ''[[:de:Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung|Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung]]'' (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial ''[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]'' (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. "The audience entered the portals of the new museum, already dubbed "Palazzo Kitschi" and "Munich Art Terminal", to a stultifying display carefully limited to idealized German peasant families, commercial art nudes, and heroic war scenes, including not just a few works by jurist [[Adolf Ziegler|Ziegler]] himself."&lt;ref name="Nicholas.1995.p.20"&gt;Nicholas.(1995).p.20&lt;/ref&gt; "...The show was essentially a flop and attendance was low. Sales were even worse and Hitler ended up buying most of the works for the government."&lt;ref name="Nicholas.1995.p.20"/&gt; At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, pp. 124-125"&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The early twentieth century was characterized by startling changes in artistic styles. In the visual arts, such innovations as [[cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[surrealism]], following hot on the heels of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[post-Impressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], were not universally appreciated. The majority of people in Germany, as elsewhere, did not care for the new art which many resented as elitist, morally suspect and too often incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
During recent years, Germany had become a major center of ''[[avant-garde]]'' art. It was the birthplace of [[Expressionism]] in [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], the [[Atonal music|atonal]] musical compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the jazz-influenced work of [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. [[Robert Wiene]]'s'' [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' brought expressionism to [[Film|cinema]].

===Creation of the ''Reichskulturkammer''===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34639, Joseph Goebbels und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Goebbels with film director [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in 1937]]
In September 1933 the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with [[Joseph Goebbels]], Hitler's ''Reichminister für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda'' (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and [[Propaganda]]) in charge.&lt;ref name="overy361"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 361. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual divisions in the Chamber of Culture for the Reich included: "press, radio, literature, movies, theater, music, and visual arts." &lt;ref name="Baez, 2004 pp. 211"&gt;Baez, 2004 pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt; "The purpose of this chamber was to stimulate the [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] of German culture and to prohibit, for example, atonal Jewish music, the blues, surrealism, cubism, and Dadaism." &lt;ref name="Baez, 2004 pp. 211"/&gt;

===Laws targeting culture in the Third Reich===
By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="Adam53" /&gt; Goebbels made clear that: "In the future only those who are members of the chamber will be allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfil the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded."&lt;ref name="Adam53"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless there was, during the period 1933–1934, some confusion within the Party on the question of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]]. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[Erich Heckel]] exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, "We National Socialists are not un-modern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, a faction led by Rosenberg despised Expressionism, leading to a bitter ideological dispute which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.

# Document No. 2030-PS: ''Decree Concerning the Duties of the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda of June 1933'' stated that: "The Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination of the nation, of propagandizing the State, of cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the public at home and abroad; furthermore, he is in charge of the administration of all institutions serving these purposes" &lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2030-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the jurisdiction of the Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to include "enlightenment in foreign countries; art; art exhibitions; moving pictures and sport abroad" … [and increased jurisdiction in domestic] "Press (including the Institute for Journalism); Radio; National anthem; German Library in Leipzig; Art; Music (including the Philharmonic Orchestra); Theater; Moving Pictures; Campaign against dirty and obscene literature" … Propaganda for tourism." Signed by The Reich Chancellor, Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2030-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School&lt;/ref&gt;
# Document No. 2078-PS: ''Decree concerning the establishment of the Reichs Ministry of Science, Education and Popular Culture of 1 May 1934'' stated that: "The Chancellor of the Reich will determine the various duties of the Reich Ministry for Science, Education, and Popular Culture." &lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2078-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by The President of the Reich, von Hindenburg, and The Chancellor of the Reich, Adolf Hitler.
# Document No. 1708-PS: ''The program of the NSDAP'' stated that: only members of the German race can be citizens (Jews, specifically are denied citizenship), and that non-members of the race can only live in Germany as registered ‘guests’. Point 23 stated: "We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.&lt;ref&gt;Document No. 1708-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Fordham University: The Jesuit University of New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genres in the Third Reich==
Belief in a Germanic spirit—defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the Nazis; [[Richard Wagner]] celebrated such ideas in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning before World War I the well-known German architect and painter [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]]'s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and architecture, supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 29-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi art bears a close similarity to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda art style of [[Socialist Realism]], and the term [[heroic realism]] has sometimes been used to describe both artistic styles. Among the well-known artists endorsed by the Nazis were the sculptors [[Josef Thorak]] and [[Arno Breker]], and painters [[Werner Peiner]], [[Arthur Kampf]], [[Adolf Wissel]] and [[Conrad Hommel]]. In July 1937, four years after it came to power, the Nazi party put on two art exhibitions in [[Munich]]. The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of, depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealized soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of [[German art]]: modern, abstract, non-representational—or as the Nazis saw it, "degenerate".

According to Klaus Fischer, "Nazi art, in short, was colossal, impersonal, and stereotypical. People were shorn of all individuality and became mere emblems expressive of assumed eternal truths. In looking at Nazi architecture, art, or painting one quickly gains the feeling that the faces, shapes, and colors all serve a propagandistic purpose; they are all the same stylized statements of Nazi virtues—power, strength, solidity, Nordic beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:Closs St Georg mit Hakenkreuz.jpg|thumb|A Nazi St George killing the dragon (Flealeaf of a book about Heraldry)]]
[[File:1897_Dettmann_Bei_den_Wasserrosen_im_Moor_anagoria.JPG|thumb|Water-lilies by the Nazi painter [[Ludwig Dettmann]] (listed in the [[Gottbegnadeten list|God-gifted list]])]]

Art of the Third Reich was characterized by a style of [[Romantic realism]] based on [[Greek art|classical models]]. While banning modern styles as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]], the Nazis promoted paintings that were narrowly traditional in manner and that exalted the "[[blood and soil]]" values of [[racial purity]], [[militarism]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)#Cultural attitudes to obedience|obedience]]. Other popular themes for Nazi art were the [[Volk (German word)#Nazi era|Volk]] at work in the fields, a return to the simple virtues of [[Heimat]] (love of homeland), the manly virtues of the National Socialist struggle, and the lauding of the female activities of child bearing and raising symbolized by the phrase ''[[Kinder, Küche, Kirche]]'' ("children, kitchen, church").

In general, painting—once purged of "degenerate art"—was based on traditional [[genre painting]].&lt;ref name="Adam110"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Titles were purposeful: "Fruitful Land", "Liberated Land", "Standing Guard", "Through Wind and Weather", "Blessing of Earth", and the like.&lt;ref name="Adam110" /&gt; Hitler's favorite painter was [[Adolf Ziegler]] and Hitler owned a number of his works. [[Landscape painting]] featured prominently in the Great German Art exhibition.&lt;ref name="Frederic Spotts p 176"&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', p 176 {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While drawing on [[German Romanticism]] traditions, it was to be firmly based on real landscape, Germans' [[Lebensraum]], without religious moods.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants were also popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; This art showed no sign of the mechanization of farm work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The farmer labored by hand, with effort and struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Not a single painting in the first exhibition showed urban or industrialized life, and only two in the exhibition in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', p. 427, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi theory explicitly rejected "materialism", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, "realism" was a seldom used term.&lt;ref name="Adam138"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity.&lt;ref name="Adam138" /&gt; The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; with physical perfection required for the nude paintings.&lt;ref name="sontag3"&gt;[[Susan Sontag]]",[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/feb/06/fascinating-fascism/?page=3 Fascinating Fascism]"&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the cause of there being very few anti-Semitic paintings; while such works as ''Um Haus and Hof'', depicting a Jewish speculator dispossessing an elderly peasant couple exist, they are few, perhaps because the art was supposed to be on a higher plane.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly political paintings were more common but still very rare.&lt;ref name="Frederic Spotts p 176"/&gt; Heroic imagery, on the other hand, was common enough to be commented on by a critic: "The heroic element stands out. The worker, the farmer, the soldier are the themes .... Heroic subjects dominate over sentimental ones".&lt;ref name="censure"&gt;''[http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/art5.htm The Greater German Art Exhibitions]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131032526/http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/art5.htm |date=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of war, [[military art|war paintings]] became far more common.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The images were romanticized, depicting heroic sacrifice and victory.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Still, landscapes predominated, and among the painters exempted from war service, all were noted for landscapes or other pacific subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', pp. 176-178. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Hitler and Goebbels found the new paintings disappointing, although Goebbels tried to put a good face on it with the observation that they had cleared the field, and that these desperate times drew many talents into political life rather than cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the ''Great German Art Exhibition'' in Munich Hitler said in 1939:

{{quote|The first goal of our new German creation of art [...] has surely been achieved. Analogous to the recovering of architectural art which began here in Munich, here also started the purification in the sphere of painting and sculpture, that maybe had been even more devastated. The whole swindle of a decadent or pathological trend-art has been swept away. A decent common level has been reached. And this means a lot. Only out of this can the truly creative genius arise."&lt;ref&gt;Max Domarus, Hitler: Reden und Proklamationen 1932–1945. Kommentiert von einem Zeitzeugen. Wiesbaden, 1973, page 1218, {{ISBN|3-927068-00-4}}. Original Text: "... das erste Ziel unseres neuen deutschen Kunstschaffens [...] ohne Zweifel schon heute erreicht [sei]. So wie von dieser Stadt München die baukünstlerische Gesundung ihren Ausgang nahm, hat hier auch vor drei Jahren die Reinigung eingesetzt auf dem vielleicht noch mehr verwüsteten Gebiet der Plastik und der Malerei. Der ganze Schwindelbetrieb einer dekadenten oder krankhaften, verlogenen Modekunst ist hinweggefegt. Ein anständiges allgemeines Niveau wurde erreicht. Und dieses ist sehr viel. Denn aus ihm erst können sich die wahrhaft schöpferischen Genies erheben." (07/14/1939)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1938, nearly 16,000 works by German and non-German artists had been seized from German galleries and either sold abroad or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Arno Breker, Albert Speer (1940).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Arno Breker]] sculpting a bust of [[Albert Speer]], the Reich armaments minister]]

The monumental possibilities of sculpture offered greater material expression of the theories of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Adam177"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great German Art Exhibition'' promoted the genre of sculpture at the expense of painting.&lt;ref name="Adam177" /&gt; As such, the nude male was the most common representation of the ideal Aryan; the artistic skill of [[Arno Breker]] elevated him to become the favourite sculptor of Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 Caroline Fetscher, "Why Mention Arno Breker Today?", ''The Atlantic Times'', August 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083704/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Josef Thorak]] was another official sculptor whose monumental style suited the image the Third Reich wished to communicate to the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821298,00.html Art: Bigger Than Life]"&lt;/ref&gt; Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the physical form of the ideal Nazi man and woman showed no imperfections.&lt;ref name="sontag3"/&gt;

===Music===
Music was expected to be [[Tonality|tonal]] and free of [[jazz]] influence; [[Nazism and cinema|films]] and plays were [[censorship|censored]]. "Musical fare alternated between light music in the form of folk songs or popular hits (''Schlager'') and such acceptable classical music as [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]], and Italian Opera."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's urban centers in the 1920s and 30s were buzzing with jazz clubs, cabaret houses and avant garde music. In contrast, the National Socialist regime made concentrated efforts to shun modern music (which was considered degenerate and Jewish in nature) and instead embraced classical German music. Highly favored was music which alluded to a mythic, heroic German past such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Anton Bruckner]] was highly favored as his music was regarded as an expression of the [[zeitgeist]] of the German [[volk]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyerman &amp; Jamison 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The music of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (and atonal music along with it), [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and many others was banned because the composers were Jewish or of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hindemith]] fled to Switzerland in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael|title=The Concerto : A Listener's Guide|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019802634X|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8oXNX2tY8AC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than fit his music into Nazi ideology. Some operas of [[Georg Friederich Händel]] were either banned outright for themes sympathetic to Jews and Judaism or had new librettos written for them. German composers who had their music performed more often during the Nazi period were [[Max Reger]] and [[Hans Pfitzner]]. [[Richard Strauss]] continued to be the most performed contemporary German composer, as he had been prior to the Nazi regime. However, even Strauss had his opera [[Die Schweigsame Frau|The Silent Woman]] banned in 1935 due to his Jewish librettist [[Stefan Zweig]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1994, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music by non-German composers was tolerated if it was classically inspired, tonal, and not by a composer of Jewish origin or having ties to ideologies hostile to the Third Reich. The Nazis recognized [[Franz Liszt]] for having German origin and fabricated a genealogy that purported that [[Frédéric Chopin]] was German, and the Nazi [[Hans Frank|Governor-General of occupied Poland]] even had a "Chopin Museum" built in [[Kraków]]. Music of the Russian [[Peter Tchaikovsky]] could be performed in Nazi Germany even after [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Operas by [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]] got frequent play.  The most performed modern non-German composers prior to the outbreak of war were [[Claude Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the outbreak of war, the music of German allies became more often performed, including the Hungarian [[Béla Bartók]], the Italian [[Ottorino Resphigi]] and Finnish Jean Sibelius. Composers of enemy nations (such as Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky) were largely banned and almost never performed – although there were some exceptions.

There has been controversy over the use of certain composers' music by the Nazi regime, and whether that implicates the composer as implicitly Nazi. Composers such as Richard Strauss,&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1992&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the first director of the Propaganda Ministry's music division, and [[Carl Orff]] have been subject to extreme criticism and heated defense.&lt;ref&gt;Kater 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kater 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were quickly prohibited from performing or conducting classical music in Germany. Such conductors as [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Ignatz Waghalter]], [[Josef Krips]], and [[Kurt Sanderling]] fled Germany. Upon the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, the conductor [[Karel Ančerl]] was blacklisted as a Jew and was sent in turn to [[Theresienstadt]] and [[Auschwitz]].

====Musicologists of the Third Reich====
As the Nazi regime accrued power in 1933, musicologists were directed to rewrite the history of German music in order to accommodate Nazi mythology and ideology. [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Hans Pfitzner]] were notable preexisting composers who conceptualized a united order (''Volksgemeinschaft'') where music was an index of the German community. In a time of disintegration, Wagner and Pfitzner wanted to revitalize the country through music. In a book written about Hans Pfitzner and Wagner, published in Regensburg in 1939 followed not only the birth of contemporary musical parties, but also of political parties in Germany. The Wagner-Pfitzner stance contrasted ideas of other notable artists—[[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]]—who wanted music to be autonomous from politics, Nazi control and application. Although Wagner and Pfitzner came before the Third Reich, their sentiments and thoughts, Wagner's ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', were appropriated by Hitler and his propagandists—notably [[Joseph Goebbels]]. According to Michael Meyer, "The very emphasis on rootedness and on tradition music underscored Nazi understanding of itself in a dialectic terms: old gods were mobilized against the false values of the immediate past to offer legitimacy to the epiphany of Adolf Hitler and the music representation of his realm."{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Composers, librettists, educators, critics, and especially musicologists, through their public statements, intellectual writings, and journals contributed to the justification of a totalitarian blueprint to be implanted through nazification. All music was then composed for the occasions of Nazi pageantries, rallies, and conventions. Composers dedicated so called 'consecration fanfares,' inaugurations fanfares and flag songs to the Fuhrer. When the Fuhrer assumed power the Nazi revolution was immediately expressed in musicological journalism. Certain progressive journalism pertaining to modern music was purged. Journals that had been sympathetic to the ‘German viewpoint,’ entrenched in Wagnerian ideals, like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'' and ''Die Musik'', showed confidence in the new regime and affirmed the process of intertwining government policies with music. Joseph Goebbels used the ''Völkischer Beobachter'', a journal that was disseminated to the general public in addition to elites and party officials, as an organ of Reich Culture. By the end of the 1930s the ''Mitteilungen der Reichsmusikkammer'' became another prominent journal that reflected the music policy, organizational and personnel changes in musical institutions.

In the early years of the Third Reich, the musicologists and musicians redirected the orientation of music, defining what was "German Music" and what was not. Nazi ideology was applied to the evaluation of musicians for hero status; musicians defined in the new German musical era were given titles of prophets, while their accomplishments and deeds were seen as direct accomplishments of the Nazi regime. The contribution of German musicologists led to the justification of Nazi power and a new German music culture in whole. The musicologists defined the greater German values that musicians would have to identify with, because their duty was to integrate music and National Socialism in way that made them look inseparable. Nazi myth making and ideology was forced upon the new musical path of the Third Reich rather than truly embedded in the rhetoric of German music.

===Graphic design===
The poster became an important medium for propaganda during this period. Combining text and bold graphics, posters were extensively deployed both in Germany and in the areas occupied. Their [[typography]] reflected the Nazis' official ideology. The use of [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] was common in Germany until 1941, when [[Martin Bormann]] denounced the typeface as "Judenlettern" and decreed that only [[Roman type]] should be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/tools/citex?clienttype=1&amp;subtype=1&amp;mode=1&amp;version=1&amp;id=118830484&amp;redirect=/journal/118830484/abstract/ Newton, Gerald, 2003, "''Deutsche Schrift'': The Demise and Rise of German Black Letter", ''German Life and Letters'', 56:2 (abstract).]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[sans-serif]] typefaces were condemned as [[cultural Bolshevism]], although [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] continued to be used owing to its practicality.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis 2001, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery frequently drew on [[heroic realism]].&lt;ref name="design"&gt;eye magazine, "[http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=62&amp;fid=270 Designing heroes]"&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi youth and the SS were depicted monumentally, with lighting posed to produce grandeur.&lt;ref name="design"/&gt;
Graphic design also played a part in the Third Reich through the use of the [http://www.dailyslave.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/swastika2.jpg swastika.]&lt;ref name="Hitler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.time.com/world-war-ii/nazi-propaganda-and-the-myth-of-aryan-invincibility/#1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103024627/http://life.time.com/world-war-ii/nazi-propaganda-and-the-myth-of-aryan-invincibility/ |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swastika was in existence long before Hitler came into power—serving purposes that were much more benign than the ones it [the swastika] is associated with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_swastika_constructing_the_symbol|title=Typotheque: The Swastika: Constructing The Symbol by Steven Heller|author=|date=|website=www.typotheque.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the stark, graphic lines used to create a swastika, it was a symbol that was very easy to remember.&lt;ref name= "Hitler"/&gt;

===Literature===
The Reich Chamber of Literature ''Reichsschriftstumskammer''&lt;ref&gt;Mosse 1966, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
Literature was under the jurisdiction of Goebbels's Ministry of Propaganda and Popular Enlightenment. According to Grunberger, "At the beginning of the war this department supervised no less than 2,500 publishing houses, 23,000 bookshops, 3,000 authors, 50 national literary prizes, 20,000 new books issued annually, and a total of 1 million titles constituting the available book market."&lt;ref name="Grunberger 1971, p. 361"&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was Europe's biggest producer of books—in terms both of total annual production and the number of individual new titles appearing each year.&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, at 650 million RM, the average sales value of the books produced took third place in the statistics on goods, after coal and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Socialist literature commission, set itself the goal of eradicating the literature of the ‘System Period’, as Weimar was contemptuously called, and of propagating volkisch-nationalist literature in the Nazis state.&lt;ref name="Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28"&gt;Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Literature was recognized early on as an essential political tool in the Third Reich as virtually 100 percent of the German population was literate.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; "The most widely-read-or displayed-book of the period was Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'', a collection (according to [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]) of 164,000 offences against German grammar and syntax; by 1940, it was, with 6 million copies sold, the solitary front-runner in the German best-seller list, some 5 million copies ahead of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and others."&lt;ref name="Grunberger 1971, p. 361"/&gt;

Richard Grunberger says, "In 1936 literary criticism as hitherto understood was abolished; henceforth reviews followed a pattern: a synopsis of content studded with quotations, marginal comments on style, a calculation of the degree of concurrence with Nazi doctrine and a conclusion indicating approval or otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Reich permitted much foreign literature to be read, in part because they believed that the writings of authors such as [[John Steinbeck]] and [[Erskine Caldwell]] substantiated the Nazis' condemnation of Western society as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the United States entered the war, all foreign authors were strictly censored. Themes in Nazi literature were defined as a range of "permissible literary expression" largely limited to four subjects: war, [[Nazism and race]], [[blood and soil]], and the [[Nazi movement]]."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, pp. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Fronterlebnis'' (War as a Spiritual Experience)====

This was one of the most popular themes during the interwar period. Writers celebrated the "heroics of front-line soldiers in [World War I], ... the thrill of combat and the sacredness of death when it is in the service of the fatherland."&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; Popular writers in this genre included [[Ernst Jünger]] and Werner Beumelburg [[:de:Werner Beumelburg|(de)]], an ex-officer.&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"&gt;Fischer 1997, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent books include [[Ernst Junger]]'s ''Storm of Steel'' (1920), ''Struggle as Inner Experience'' (1922), ''Storms'' (1933), ''Fire and Blood'' (1925), ''The Adventurous Heart'' (1929), and ''Total Mobilization'' (1931).

====''Blut und Boden'' (Blood and Soil)====

Novels in this theme often featured an instinctive and soil-bound peasant community that warded off alien outsiders who sought to destroy their way of life.&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; 
The most popular novel of this kind was [[Hermann Lons]]'s ''[[Der Wehrwolf|Wehrwolf]]'' published in 1910.

====Historical ethnicity====
Klaus Fischer says Nazi literature emphasized "Historic Ethnicity—that is, how a group of people defines itself in a process of historical growth. Writers tried to highlight prominent episodes in the history of the German people; they stressed the German mission for Europe, analyzed the immutable racial essence of Nordic man, and warned against subversive or un-German forces—the Jews, Communists, or Western liberals."&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; Prominent writers included: [[Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer]] (''Die Bauhutte: Elemente einer Metaphysik der Gerenwart''; The building hut: Elements of a contemporary metaphysics, 1925), [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (''Der Mythus des 20.Jahrhunderts''; The myth of the twentieth century, 1930), [[Josef Weinheber]], [[Hans Grimm]] (''Volk ohne Raum''; People [[Lebensraum|without living space]], 1926), and [[Joseph Goebbels]] (''Michael'', 1929).

===Architecture===
{{main|Nazi architecture}}
Hitler favored hugeness, especially in architecture, as a means of impressing the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; "A once mediocre artist and aspiring architect, Hitler also pronounced upon the "decadence" of modern art and pushed his planners to create monumental buildings in older [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] or [[art deco]] styles." &lt;ref&gt;Sivers, Desnoyers and Stow 2012, p.1008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
{{main|Nazism and cinema}}
"The Reich Film Chamber (''Reichsfilmkammer'') controlled the lively German film industry, while a Film Credit Bank (also under Goebbels' control) centralized the financial aspects of film production." &lt;ref&gt;Mosse 1966, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1363 feature pictures were made in the Third Reich (208 of these were banned after World War II for containing Nazi Propaganda).&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1969, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Every film made in the Third Reich (including features, shorts, newsreels, and documentaries) had to be passed by Joseph Goebbels himself before they could be shown in public.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1969, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plakat_der_ewige_Jude,_1937.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for ''The Eternal Jew'' exhibition, 1937]]
Mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture, possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, until the outbreak of the war, most Hollywood films could be screened, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. While performance of atonal music was banned, the prohibition of jazz was less strictly enforced. [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] were popular, and leading English and American jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war; thereafter, dance bands officially played "swing" rather than the banned jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

A film premiered in Berlin on November 28, 1940, which was clearly a tool used to promote Nazi Ideology. The release of the film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (The Eternal Jew) was only two months prior to the announcement made by German officials of the establishment of the ghetto in [[Łódź]]. The film was portrayed in the Nazi press as a documentary to emphasize the cinema as truth, when in reality it was nothing more than propaganda to raise hatred against the Jewish community in its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 80, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker, [[Fritz Hippler]], used numerous visual techniques to portray Jews as a filthy, degenerate, and disease infested population. Purporting to provide the viewer with an in depth look at the Jewish lifestyle, the film showed staged scenes of Łódź (soon to be ghetto) with the presence of flies and rats, to suggest a dangerous-to-life area of Europe; which in turn only perpetuated underlying superstition and fear to the viewer. To add to this staged and exaggerated scene of filth was a warning released by officials of The [[Reich]]: an advisory that Łódź is an area of widespread infectious disease. The film director utilized racist cinema to bolster the illusion that Jews were parasites and corruptors of German culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 80, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippler made use of [[voice-over]]s to cite hate speeches or fictitious statistics of the Jewish population. He also borrowed numerous scenes from other films, and presented them out of context from the original: for example, a scene of a Jewish businessman in the United States hiding money was accompanied with a bogus claim that Jewish men get taxed more than non-Jews in the United States, which was used to insinuate that Jews withhold money from the government. Through the repetitive use of side angles of Jewish people, who were filmed (without knowledge) while looking over their shoulder at the camera, ''Der ewige Jude'' created a visual suggesting a shifty and conspiring nature of Jews. Yet another propaganda technique was superposition. Hippler superimposed the [[Star of David]] onto the tops of world capitals, insinuating an illusion of Jewish world domination.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;
	
''Der ewige Jude'' is notorious for its anti-Semitism and its use of cinema in the fabrication of propaganda, to satisfy Hitler and to embrace the Germanic ideology that would fuel a nation in support of an obsessive leader.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
"On the lighter side, a Jewish actor named Leo Reuss fled Germany to Vienna, where he dyed his hair and beard and became a specialist in ‘Aryan’ roles, which were greatly praised by the Nazis. Having had his fun, Reuss revealed he was a Jew, signed a contract with MGM, and departed for the United States" &lt;ref name="Hull 1969, p. 127"&gt;Hull 1969, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hitler Museum==
{{main|Führermuseum}}

[[File:Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect looted art HD-SN-99-02758.JPEG|thumb|200px|right|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (right) inspects stolen artwork in a salt mine in [[Merkers]], accompanied by [[Omar Bradley]] (left) and [[George S. Patton]] (center)]]
Apart from auctioning art that was to be purged from Germany's collection, Germany's art that was considered as especially favourable by Hitler were to be combined to create a massive art museum in Hitler's hometown of [[Linz]], Austria for his own personal collection. The museum to-be by 1945 had thousands of pieces of furniture, paintings, sculptures and several other forms of fine craft. The museum was to be known as the "[[Führermuseum]]". By the late spring of 1940 art collectors and museum curators were in a race against time to move thousands of pieces of collectables into hiding, or out of soon-to-be-occupied territory where it would be vulnerable to confiscation by German officials—either for themselves, or for the Führer. On June 5, a particularly important movement of thousands of paintings occurred, which included the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', and all were hidden in the Loc-Dieu Abbey located near [[Martiel]] during the chaos of invasion by German forces. Art dealers did their best to hide artwork in the best places possible; [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]] managed to move over 150 great pieces to a [[Libourne]] bank, which included works by [[Monet]], [[Matisse]], Picasso, and van Gogh. Other collectors did whatever they could to remove France's artistic treasures to the safest locations feasible at the time; filling cars, or large crates en route to [[Vichy]], or south through France and into Spain to reach transport by boat. Art dealer Martin Fabiani moved mass quantities of pictures: drawings and paintings to be boarded onto a ship so that the prized possessions were to be in safer keeping on British soil in [[Bermuda]], although when the ship's contents arrived, complications arose over proof of ownership of foreign assets from France. British consuls were wary of exports and carefully inspected shipments from France, after which Fabiani's assets were relocated to Canada, in the charge of the [[Registrar General of Canada|Registrar]] of the [[Exchequer Court of Canada]] where they were to remain until the end of the war. Similar shipments landed in New York, all in an effort to protect artistic treasures from confiscation, theft, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of June, Hitler controlled most of the European continent. As people were detained, their possessions were confiscated; if they were lucky enough to escape, their belongings left behind or in storage became the property of Germany. By the end of August, officials of the Reich were granted permission to access any shipping containers and remove any desirable items inside. As well as looting goods that were to be shipped out of occupied territories, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] authorized the removal of any objects found in houses during the invasion, after which a long and thorough search was in effect for European treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Hitler in Paris 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Speer]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Arno Breker]], in Paris (1940)]]

Artwork became an important commodity in the German economy: no one in German or axis-controlled countries was allowed to invest outside of the new Germanic-controlled territory, which in turn created a self-contained market. With few options available for investments, art was of great importance to anyone with cash, including the [[Führer]] himself, as a safe form of investment, and even in trade for the lives of others. At the height of trading in 1943, art was used by [[Pieter de Boers]], who was the head of Dutch association of Art Dealers, and the largest seller to Germans in the Netherlands, in the exchange of the release of his Jewish employee. Demand began to increase dramatically, forcing prices to rise, and only furthering the desire to discover hidden treasures within occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

As exploration continued within [[occupied France]], and by order of the Führer, a list was created which included all of the great works of art in France, and the German Currency Unit began to open private bank units which contained countless collectors' property and possible items on the list. The owner of the vault was required to be present. One particular investigation of a vault was that of Pablo Picasso; he chose a rather clever tactic when soldiers searched the contents of his vault. He packed his own artworks with countless other artists’ works of his collection in a chaotic manner, with the result that the investigators thought that nothing in the collection was significant, and took nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

As confiscations began to pile up in massive quantities, the items filled the Louvre, and forced Reich officials to use the [[Jeu de Paume]], a small museum, for additional space, and for proper viewing of the collection. The grand stockpile of art was ready for Hitler to choose from: the Führer had first choice for his own collection; second were objects that would complete collections of the [[Reichsmarschall]]; third was intended for whatever was useful to support Nazi ideology; a fourth category was created for German museums. Everything was supposed to be appraised and paid for, with proceeds being directed to French war-orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, pp. 125,126,128,129&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler also ordered the confiscation of French works of art owned by the state and the cities. Reich officials decided what was to stay in France, and what was to be sent to [[Linz]]. Further orders from the Führer also included the return of artworks that were looted by [[Napoleon]] from Germany in the past. Napoleon is considered the unquestioned record holder in the act of confiscating art.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art theft===
{{main|Nazi plunder}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|280px|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing in front of [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome in 1944 with a picture taken from the Biblioteca del [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale di Napoli]] before the Allied forces' arrival in the city ''Carlo III di Borbone che visita il papa Benedetto XIV nella coffee-house del Quirinale a Roma'' by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]] inv. Q 205)]]
Later, as the occupiers of Europe, the Germans trawled the museums and private collections of Europe for suitably "Aryan" art to be acquired to fill a bombastic new gallery in Hitler's home town of [[Linz]]. At first a pretense was made of exchanges of works (sometimes with [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] masterpieces, considered degenerate by the Nazis), but later acquisitions came through forced "donations" and eventually by simple looting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/articles-and-papers/symposium-papers/conducting-research-art-looting.html Conducting Research at the National Archives into Art Looting, Recovery, and Restitution] by Ernest Latham, US National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

The purge of art in Germany and occupied countries was extremely broad. The Nazi theft is considered to be the largest art theft in modern history including paintings, furniture, sculptures, and anything in between considered either valuable, or opposing Hitler's purification of German culture. During the Second World War, art theft by German forces was devastating, and the resurfacing of missing stolen art continues today, along with the fight for rightful ownership. Not only did the [[Reich]] confiscate and reallocate countless masterpieces from occupied territories during the war, but also put to auction a large portion of Germany's collection of great art from museums and art galleries. In the end, the confiscation committees removed over 15,000 works of art from German public collections alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Warsaw 1944 by Bałuk - 26320.jpg|thumb|left|Column of lorries in front of a [[Zachęta|Warsaw museum]] [[World War II looting of Poland|loaded with stolen art treasures]], 1944]]

It took four years to "refine" the Nazi art criteria; in the end what was tolerated was whatever Hitler liked, and whatever was most useful to the German government from the point of view of creating propaganda. A thorough head-hunting of artists within Germany was in effect from the beginning of the Second World War, which included the elimination of countless members within the art community. Museum directors that supported modern art were attacked; artists that refused to comply with Reich-approved art were forbidden to practice art altogether. To enforce the prohibition of practicing art, agents of the [[Gestapo]] routinely made unexpected visits to artist's homes and studios. Wet brushes found during the inspections or even the smell of turpentine in the air was reason enough for arrest. In response to the oppressive restrictions, many artists chose to flee Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, pp. 10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Degenerate-Auction.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A confiscated self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]] is auctioned at Gallerie Fisher, Lucerne, in 1939.

Retrieved December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Before the impending war and a time of simply looting occupied nation's art treasures, but during the Reich's efforts to free Germany of conflicting art, authorities of the Nazi party realized the potential revenue of Germany's own collection of art that was considered [[degenerate art]] which was to be purged from German culture. The Reich began to collect and auction countless pieces of art—for example, "on June 30, 1939 a major auction took place at the elegant Grand Hotel National in the Swiss resort town of [[Lucerne]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; All of the paintings and sculptures had recently been on display in museums throughout Germany. This collection offered over 100 paintings and sculptures by numerous famous artists, such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]; all of which were considered "degenerate" pieces by Nazi authorities and were to be banished from Germany. An auction of this magnitude was viewed as suspicious by potential buyers, who feared that the profits would end up funding the Nazi party: "The auctioneer had been so worried about this perception that he had sent letters to leading dealers assuring them that all profits would be used for German museums".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all of the proceeds from the auction were deposited into "German controlled-accounts", and the museums "... as all had suspected, did not receive a penny".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Klaus Fischer – "Many German writers, artists, musicians, and scientists not only stayed but flourished under the Nazis, including some famous names such as [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Max Planck]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and many others".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, pp.374-375&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944 the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] prepared a list of 1,041 artists considered crucial to National Socialist culture, and therefore exempt from war service. This [[Gottbegnadeten list]] provides a well-documented index to the painters, sculptors, architects and filmmakers who were regarded by the Nazis as politically sympathetic, culturally valuable, and still residing in Germany at this late stage of the war.

==Degenerate art forms==
[[File:'Stormtroops Advancing Under Gas', etching and aquatint by Otto Dix, 1924.jpg|thumb|right|240px|'Stormtroops Advancing Under Gas', [[etching]] and [[aquatint]] by [[Otto Dix]], 1924. Dix was among the artists condemned as ''entartet''. The distorted bodies, reflecting the horror and despair of war, were at odds with the desire to glorify the martial vigor and confidence of the German people.]]

{{main|Degenerate art}}
Hitler's rise to power on January 31, 1933, was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy: [[book burnings]] were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, artists were forbidden to utilize any colors not apparent in nature, to the "normal eye",&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; and curators who had shown a partiality to modern art were replaced by Nazi Party members.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; "Through the Ministry of Propaganda or the ERR, the Nazis destroyed or quarantined the culture of all the nations they invaded."&lt;ref name="Baez 2004, p. 211"&gt;Baez 2004, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; "A four-man purge tribunal (Professor Ziegler, Schweitzer-Mjolnir, Count Baudissin and Wolf willrich) toured galleries and museums all over the Reich and ordered the removal of paintings, drawings and sculptures that were regarded as 'degenerate'." &lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; "The swathe these four apocalyptic Norsemen cut through Germany's stored-up artistic treasure has been estimated at upwards of 16,000 paintings, drawings, etchings and sculptures: 1,000 pieces by [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]], 700 by [[Haeckel]], 600 each by [[Schmidt-Rottluff]] and [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], 500 by [[Beckmann]], 400 by [[Kokoschka]], 300-400 each by [[Hofer]], [[Max Pechstein|Pechstein]], [[Barlach]], [[Feininger]] and [[Otto Muller]], 200-300 each by [[Otto Dix|Dix]], [[Grosz]] and [[Corinth]], 100 by [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck|Lehmbruck]], as well as much smaller numbers of [[Cézanne]]s, [[Picasso]]s, Matisses, [[Gauguin]]s, [[Van Gogh]]s, Braques, Pisarros, Dufys, Chiricos and [[Max Ernst]]."&lt;ref name="Grunberger.1971.p.425"&gt;Grunberger 1971, p.425&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, 4000 of those works seized were "burned in the courtyard of the headquarters of the Berlin Fire-brigade."&lt;ref name="Grunberger.1971.p.425"/&gt;

The term ''Entartung'' (or "degeneracy") had gained popularity in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author [[Max Nordau]] devised the theory presented in his 1892 book, ''Entartung''.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Nordau drew upon the writings of the [[criminology|criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]], whose ''The Criminal Man'', published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were "born criminals" whose [[atavism|atavistic]] personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of [[modern art]], explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. Explaining the [[painterly|painterliness]] of [[Impressionism]] as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish (as was Lombroso), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German National Socialists during the [[Weimar Republic]] as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for [[Aryan race|Aryan]] purity in art.

Germany lost "thousands of intellectuals, artists, and academics, including many luminaries of Weimar culture and science", according to Raffael Scheck.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, Raffael.(2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer says that "as soon as Hitler seized power, many intellectuals rushed to the exits."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proscribed literature===
According to Pauley, "literature was the first branch of the arts to be affected by the Nazis."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"&gt;Pauley, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; "As early as April 1933, the Nazis had compiled a long blacklist of ''left'', democratic, and Jewish authors which included several famous authors of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"/&gt; Large scale [[book burning]]s were staged across Germany in May 1933. Two thousand five hundred writers, including Nobel prize winners and writers of worldwide best sellers, left the country voluntarily or under duress, and were replaced by people without international reputations."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"/&gt;

In June, 1933 the ''Reichsstelle zur Forderung des deutschen Schrifttums'' (Reich Office for the Promotion of German Literature) was established.&lt;ref name="Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28"/&gt; Jan-Pieter Barbian says, "On the level of the state, the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda and the Reich Chamber of Literature had to share responsibility for literary policy with the new Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and Public Instruction and the Foreign Office."&lt;ref name="Barbian_9"/&gt; "The full repertoire—which also included the consistent removal of Jews and political opponents—was brought to bear during the twelve years of Nazi rule: on writers and publishers; book wholesaling; the retail, door-to-door, and mail-order book libraries, public libraries, and research libraries."&lt;ref name="Barbian_9"&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November 1933 and January 1934 publishers were informed "that supplying and distributing the works named is undesirable for national and cultural reasons and must therefore cease."&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers, who often faced enormous economic losses when books were banned, received letters stating that the "authorities responsible would proceed against any indiscretion in the most rigorous manner".&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Companies which had published primarily "the fiction of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], and [[New Objectivity]]; modern translated literature; and critical nonfiction ... suffered enormous economic losses."&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"/&gt; A few of the hardest hit publishers were Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, S.Fischer Verlag, Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlags-AG, Rowohlt, Ullstein Verlags-AG, and Kurt Wolff Verlags.&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"/&gt; In 1935, the same year that "[[Goebbels]] assumed complete control over censorship," the Reichsschrifttumskammer banned the work of 524 authors.&lt;ref name="Baez 2004, p. 211"/&gt; "The Office for the Supervision of Ideological Training and Education of the NSDAP...became another watchdog of the state, spying on writers, developing black lists, encouraging book burnings, and emptying museums of 'non-German' works of art."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.365&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments varied, some individuals were censored or had their work destroyed or publicly ridiculed, while others were incarcerated in concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

"During World War II, 1939–1945, identical indexes of forbidden literature were applied by the Nazis in all occupied countries as well as in Germany's allied countries: Denmark, Norway, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, and of course, Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Karolides 2011, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book burnings===
{{main|Nazi book burnings}}
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|right|upright|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin.]]
Described as a cleaning action or ''Sauberung'',&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.366&lt;/ref&gt; [[book burnings]], known as the ''Bücherverbrennung'' in Germany, and sometimes referred to as the "[[bibliocaust]]", began on May 10, 1933, when the Association of German Students confiscated some 25,000 books from the [[Institute for Sexual Research]] and several captured Jewish libraries, which were burned in [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]].&lt;ref name="Baez_209-210"&gt;Baez 2011, pp. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; Like a lit fuse, the bonfire triggered book burning in other cities all over Germany, including Frankfurt and Munich, where the burnings were part of an orchestrated program, including music and speeches.&lt;ref name="Baez_209-210"/&gt; "Political police groups like the SA, the SS, and the Gestapo unleashed a campaign of intimidation that often frightened people into burning their own books."&lt;ref&gt;Baez 2011, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

"The blind writer [[Helen Keller]] published an ''Open Letter to German Students:'' 'You may burn my books and the books of the best minds in Europe, but the ideas those books contain have passed through millions of channels and will go on.'"&lt;ref&gt;Baez 2011, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate Art exhibition===
Modern artworks were purged from German museums. Over 5,000 works were initially seized, including 1,052 by [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]], 759 by [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], 639 by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and 508 by [[Max Beckmann]], as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; These became the material for a defamatory exhibit, ''[[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Entartete Kunst]]'' ("Degenerate Art"), featuring over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums, that premiered in [[Munich]] on July 19, 1937, and remained on view until November 30 before travelling to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. In this exhibition, the artworks were deliberately presented in a disorderly manner, and accompanied by mocking labels. "To 'protect' them, children were not allowed in."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the ''Entartete Kunst'' exhibition, the ''[[:de:Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung|Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung]]'' (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial ''[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]'' (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, pp. 124-125"/&gt;

The Degenerate Art Exhibition included works by some of the great international names—[[Paul Klee]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]—along with famous German artists of the time such [[Max Beckmann]], [[Emil Nolde]], and [[Georg Grosz]]. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist", says [[Jonathan Petropoulos]], professor of European History at [[Claremont McKenna College]] and author of several books on art and politics in the Third Reich. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician—but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favor of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and [[Bolsheviks]], although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category—art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticized German soldiers, art that offended the honor of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled "the insanity room". The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticize the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors—three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24819441|title=Why Hitler put 'degenerate' art on show|first=Lucy|last=Burns|date=6 November 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
Austerity urbanism can be described in several ways and gathers different components. The following lines present the main definitions and interpretations of the concept.

First, austerity urbanism is based upon two main notions : [[austerity]] and [[urbanism]].

Generally speaking, austerity is ''“a situation in which people’s living standards are reduced because of economic difficulties”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/austerity|title="Austerity" definition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Austerity is also described as ''“a condition of enforced or extreme economy”'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''.'' Here, austerity refers to the reduction of investment, as well as expenditure in general, by the state due to an economy in jeopardy. 

Recent episodes of austerity are often linked with [[neoliberalism]], which is the latest form of [[capitalism]]. Its main idea is to restrict the power of public institutions as well as government spending and to give precedence to the [[market economy]], in order to increase the role of the [[private sector]] in the society as well as maintain [[Public sector|public sectors]] in good financial health. Given that the private sector is in charge in the neoliberal system, public expenditures are less likely to occur. This is what leading to austerity in bad economic times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Jonathan|last2=Blanco|first2=Ismael|date=2017|title=Austerity urbanism : Patterns of neo-liberalisation and resistance in six cities of Spain and the UK.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0308518X17701729|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=49|pages=1517-1536|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Second, austerity urbanism is a type of urbanism that shows the repercussions of austerity. The critical situation of the economy has a significant effect on the development of cities. Investors, due to economic crisis and lack of attractive investment options, reduce the amount of money they invest in cities, leaving neighborhoods or entire cities worse off. In other words, an episode of austerity may leave municipalities with no alternative about the lack of investment of private actors, and create difficulties to manage the development of their cities. Moreover, the possibility for actors from the private sector to withdraw at any moment puts municipalities in a position where they may not have the means to manage their urban development themselves&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Finally, austerity urbanism happens when the private sector reduces its investment. Due to the lack of funds of the municipalities, neighborhoods are at risk of not receiving proper investment. At that point, individuals or local associations may take control and launch their own urban initiatives in places neglected by municipalities. This process often leads to attracting, once again, the private sector after those places have been reshaped for temporary use by the local community. In the meantime, the actions of local communities work as transitional uses before future developments&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Origins ==
To understand the emergence of austerity urbanism, it is necessary to explore first the notion of austerity and its impacts throughout history as austerity urbanism appears later as a consequence of such a context.

The notion of austerity is not new in the history of humankind, but as an explicit concept, it did not start to be until the beginning of the 20th century. The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] was amongst the first ones to use it. In the wake of [[World War I]], he made known his disagreement on the [[Treaty of Versailles]], opining that it was not a good idea to impose an economy of austerity on Germany. He argued that it would also weaken other countries in Europe. The risk was also that the impoverishment of Germany could raise fierce opposition to the treaty in Germany and maybe even a revolution. At that time, Keynes supported a more interventionist economic policy and was therefore against a deliberate austerity build up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dostaler|first=Gilles|date=2007|title=Les fondements philosophiques de l'oeuvre de Keynes.|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/DOSLFP|journal=The Proceedings of the Twenty-First World Congress of Philosophy : Logic and Philosophy of the Sciences|volume=5|pages=155-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 1930s, the notion of austerity reappeared with the [[Great Depression]] and its consequences, Europe as a whole being in a situation of austerity. This crisis framework appeared again after the [[World War II|Second World War]], plunging several European countries into a state of misery, which can be qualified as austerity. At this moment, it was clear that the continent needed to rebuild its devastated lands and cities.

This state of austerity gradually faded away during "[[Trente Glorieuses|The Glorious Thirty]]" but resurfaced quickly in the 1980s with the general awareness of ecological limits and key resource depletion which suggested the rethinking of the socio-economic system. Then, with the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime crisis]] in 2007-2008, the notion of austerity came back strongly and explicitly especially in the economic and urban realm. Indeed, the changing economic conditions led to the emergence of the concept of austerity urbanism. In austerity urbanism, cities have to take care of themselves since ''“municipal governments act as cost-saving business actors that envisage running cities like corporations”'' &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2015|title=Austerity urbanism : The neoliberal crisis of American cities|url=http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/wp-content/files_mf/peck_austerity_urbanism_eng.pdf|journal=Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung : New York|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even if the situation is not uniform across cities, nor completely comparable, the manifestation of austerity became ''“evident at the urban scale”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Nowadays, there are several ideological undercurrents involved in the austerity narrative. On the one hand, the “economy of means” current suggests that one must stop living beyond one's means. In order to reduce the negative consequences of austerity urbanism, such as the rise of youth unemployment as well as poverty, social exclusion and the increasing debt prevailing in most Western economies for example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyadike-Danes|first=Michael|last2=Fitoussi|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Le Cacheux|first3=Jacques|date=1983|title=De l'austérité budgétaire en période de récession.|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/ofce_0751-6614_1983_num_5_1_958|journal=Observations et diagnostics économiques : revue de l'OFCE|volume=5|pages=121-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is considered necessary to be cautious regarding public expenses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|date=2015|title=Les conséquences économiques de l’austérité.|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-economie-politique-2015-3-p-102.htm|journal=L'Économie politique|volume=|pages=102-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this can result in the mistrust in the institutions and this increasing dissatisfaction leads to the weakening of the aforesaid institutions. On the other hand, when austerity reaches its limits, it can also open up new opportunities and therefore generate great possibilities in the urbanistic field, such as citizen-led initiatives taking place in unusual spaces or forms, in an attempt from the population to counteract the crisis situation and austerity measures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

To sum up, there is therefore a crisis-linked austerity situation in opposition to an ideological vision of prudence, which tend to maintain a pressure for unnecessary cost-avoidance. Between these two perspectives, it may be quite difficult to carry out urban planning assignments, as it necessarily implies investments at a time when funds are seemingly lacking. This is the global context in which the notion of austerity urbanism emerged, whose definition was proposed in 2012 by various authors, including Fran Tonkiss and Jamie Peck. The notion of austerity in urban planning is evolving, not being always a negative assertion, but also valuing the opportunities and innovative solutions that are created within the practice of urban planning. The notion of austerity urbanism is in fact more and more linked to that of [[tactical urbanism]] and improvisational urbanism, emphasizing in particular the growing importance of citizen solidarity. These connotations complement what has to be considered, altogether, as a progressive vision of urbanism where the game is to take advantage of a crisis to allow for new collective achievements to emerge.

== Practical interventions under conditions of austerity ==
Planning under austerity can lead to alternative and critical spatial practices, that are described by [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] as a strategy for ''“dealing with the existing city [in] the search for underused space and time, and its readaptation for a desired activity. We can explore the use of streets as play areas, or the possibilities for using roof tops, empty stores, abandoned buildings, waste lots, odd bits of land, or the large areas presently sterilized by such mono-cultures as parking lots, expressways, railroad yards, and airports”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City Sense and City Design: Writings and Projects of Kevin Lynch|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|publisher=MIT Press.|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Banerjee|editor-first=T.|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=771-788|chapter=The Possible City (1968)|editor-last2=Southworth|editor-first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These makeshift, informal and often temporary urban interventions were categorized by Fran Tonkiss in four protocols for planning under austerity, depending on the degree of facilitation by existing policies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

# The ''“Positive model”'' provides the best conditions for the development of such self-organized interventions as it integrates their informal nature into formal processes, by offering building permits for instance.
# The ''“Permissive model”'' neither facilitates, nor excludes unconventional planning strategies, being based on a tolerant approach regarding them.
# The “''Proscription model''” on the other hand leaves almost no space for negotiation and improvisation initiatives by criminalizing or implementing punitive measures against them.
# The ''“Abandonment model”'' positions these interventions as an urbanism of last resort, in response to the complete roll back of the state in terms of territorial governance.

[[File:Berlin-Kreuzberg Prinzessinnengärten 1.jpg|thumb|Prinzessinnengärten, Berlin Kreuzberg]]
In reality, these four approaches are often combined, as the case of [[Squatting in England and Wales|squatting]] in some British cities that is a mix of the third and the fourth model. Indeed, in 2012, residential squatting was criminalized in England, and at the same time, budget cutback made it difficult to positively promote alternative practices, despite the ambitions of the [[Big Society]] political ideology. This situation was paradoxical considering that at that time the number of empty houses in the country well exceeded the number of squatters in the UK&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

On a more micro-scale level, interstitial urbanism such as [[community gardening]] is another form of alternative urban interventions, open to improvisation and adaptation. Such initiatives can take place on brownfields, waste ground like the [[:de:Prinzessinnengärten|Prinzessinnengärten]] in Berlin or even in-between two buildings, as it is the case with the self-managed space on the rue [http://www.urbantactics.org/projets/passage56/ Saint-Blaise 56] in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petcou|first=Constantin|last2=Petrescu|first2=Doina|date=2007|title=Agir l’espace : notes transversales, observations de terrain et questions concrètes pour chacun de nous|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-multitudes-2007-4-page-101.htm|journal=Multitudes|volume=31|pages=101-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a context of austerity, these sites represent an important testing ground for urban experimentation as well as providing local services and spaces to counteract the lack of public policy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== The case of Todmorden, England ===
[[File:Todmorden.jpg|thumb|Urban vegetable gardens along the Rochdale canal, Todmorden]]
[[Todmorden]] is a northern English town that engaged in austerity urbanism following the [[deindustrialization]]. Between the 1970s and 2010, the city lost about half of its population, mostly being workers that became unemployed. In response to the crisis, citizens had the idea of producing food in public spaces, cultivating vegetables in [[Urban horticulture|urban gardens]] located in every unused space around the city like next to the train station, the main road or even the police station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pages.rts.ch/emissions/abe/5974537-sous-les-paves-des-legumes.html#5974539|title=RTS documentary about the Incredible Edible project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Todmorden is in fact the first city in the world to have launched, in 2008, a food [[self-sufficiency]] initiative, called the [[Incredible Edible]]. Nowadays, the project is still successfully going and contributes to strengthening social bonds and solidarity among the population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf|title=Diversifying Foods and Diets: Using Agricultural Biodiversity to Improve Nutrition and Health.|last=Paull|first=John|publisher=Earthscan, Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Franzo|editor-first=J.|location=Oxford|pages=336-345|chapter="Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity|editor-last2=Hunter|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Borelli|editor-first3=T.|editor-last4=Mattei|editor-first4=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==
Temporary urbanism can involve risks. Indeed, temporary and self-organized projects could also be used to keep unused lands attractive while the economy is in crisis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and therefore facilitating the state withdrawal from its responsibilities. As Margit Mayer pointed out, ''“principles such as self-management, self-realization and all kinds of unconventional or insurgent creativity (…) have lost the radical edge they used to entail in the context of the overbearing Keynesian welfare state - in today’s neoliberal urbanism they have been usurped as essential ingredients of sub-local regeneration programs”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Margit|date=2013|title=First World Urban Activism: Beyond Austerity Urbanism and Creative City Politics.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13604813.2013.757417|journal=City|volume=17|pages=5-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept itself of austerity urbanism is the subject of different critical points of views. From a [[Free market|free-market]] perspective, austerity is a necessary, if temporary, measure to assure the financial health of the public sector where it has been spending too much and faces a large amount of debt and deficit. This perspective relates to the orthodox neoclassical economic theory which argues, against a Keynesian ideology, that public investments are bad for the economy in a long term. For the free-market advocates, austerity is a way to purge non-efficient institutions and enterprises and let new technologies and strategies emerge in a [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeterian]] creative destruction perspective. Translated to urban planning theories, austerity means that it is beneficial for the economy to cut public investments in urban development and let private initiatives and the private sector run cities. Entrepreneurial urbanism argues that the public sector should function more like the private sector and seek to make returns on investment on public spending and be competitive to decrease the distortions of public intervention in the market&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

On the other hand, heterodox economy, radical geography, other fields of research, and left wing or Marxists political parties see austerity as a punitive and non-justified policy related to a pejorative perception of neoliberalism. Increasing inequalities, gaps in the rights to the city, and social injustice, austerity urbanism leads to what [[David Harvey]] describes as ''“accumulation by dispossession''”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. In this point of view, austerity should be stopped and new social strategies of urban development should be organized to fight the commodification and financialisation of cities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

A '''cam follower''', also known as a '''track follower''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Cam follower selection guide | url = http://www.rbcbearings.com/camfollowers/selguide.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a specialized type of [[roller bearing|roller]] or [[needle bearing]] designed to follow [[cam]] lobe profiles. Cam followers come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the cam follower mounts to its mating part; ''stud'' style cam followers use a [[Threaded rod|stud]] while the ''yoke'' style has a hole through the middle.&lt;ref name="mcgill"&gt;{{Citation | title = McGill CAMROL Bearings | url = http://www.alliedbearings.com/mfg_prod/bearings/ept_brgs/camrolrevised2.pdf | accessdate = 2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Cam follower-stud style.png|thumb|right|A cross-sectional view of a stud type cam follower]]

The modern stud type follower was invented and patented in 1937 by Thomas L. Robinson of the McGill Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
 | inventor-last = Robinson | inventor-first = Thomas L. | publication-date = 1937-11-16 | title = Bearing | country-code = US | patent-number = 2099660}}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced using a standard bearing and bolt. The new cam followers were easier to use because the stud was already included and they could also handle higher loads.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

While roller cam followers are similar to roller bearings, there are quite a few differences. Standard ball and roller bearings are designed to be pressed into a rigid housing, which provides circumferential support. This keeps the outer race from deforming, so the race cross-section is relatively thin. In the case of cam followers the outer race is loaded at a single point, so the outer race needs a thicker cross-section to reduce [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]]. However, in order to facilitate this the roller diameter must be decreased, which also decreases the [[dynamic bearing capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Difference from standard bearings | url = http://www.rbcbearings.com/camfollowers/difference.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''End plates'' are used to contain the needles or bearing axially. On stud style followers one of the end plates is integrated into the inner race/stud; the other is [[press fit|pressed]] onto the stud up to a shoulder on the inner race. The inner race is [[induction hardening|induction hardened]] so that the stud remains soft if modifications need to be made. On yoke style followers the end plates are [[peening|peened]] or pressed onto the inner race or [[liquid metal injection|liquid metal injected]] onto the inner race. The inner race is either induction hardened or [[through hardening|through hardened]].&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

Another difference is that a [[lubrication]] hole is provided to relubricate the follower periodically. A hole is provided at both ends of the stud for lubrication. They also usually have a [[black oxide]] finish to help reduce corrosion.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

==Types==
There are many different types of cam followers available.

===Anti-friction element===
The most common anti-[[friction]] element employed is a ''full complement'' of [[needle roller]]s. This design can withstand high radial loads but no [[wikt:thrust load|thrust loads]]. A similar design is the ''caged needle roller'' design, which also uses needle rollers, but uses a [[cage (enclosure)|cage]] to keep them separated. This design allows for higher speeds but decreases the load capacity. The cage also increases internal space so it can hold more lubrication, which increases the time between relubrications. Depending on the exact design sometimes two rollers are put in each pocket of the cage, using a cage design originated by RBC Bearings in 1971.

For heavy-duty applications a ''roller'' design can be used. This employs two rows of rollers of larger diameter than used in needle roller cam followers to increase the dynamic load capacity and provide some thrust capabilities. This design can support higher speeds than the full complement design.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

For light-duty applications a ''bushing'' type follower can be used. Instead of using a type of a roller a plastic [[Bushing (bearing)|bushing]] is used to reduce friction, which provides a maintenance free follower. The disadvantage is that it can only support light loads, slow speeds, no thrust loads, and the temperature limit is {{convert|200|F|C}}. A bushing type stud follower can only support approximately 25% of the load of a roller type stud follower, while the heavy and yoke followers can handle 50%.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt; Also all-metallic heavy-duty bushing type followers exist.&lt;ref name="hotrod2010"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hotrod.com/how-to/engine/hrdp-1004-cam-lifter-technology/ | title = Cam and Lifter Technology - What's New In Cams | last = Davis | first = Marlan | date = 2010-04-01 | website = Hot Rod | publisher = | access-date = 2016-01-17 | quote = After years of experimentation with different materials and manufacturing processes, it's developed the EZ Roll Red Zone needleless, single roller bushing design that replaces the roller needles.

Crower says the bushed lifter allows greater load handling for aggressive camshaft profiles and are fully rebuildable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape===
The outer diameter (OD) of the cam follower (stud or yoke) can be the standard cylindrical shape or be [[wikt:crown|crowned]]. Crowned cam followers are used to keep the load evenly distributed if it deflects or if there is any misalignment between the follower and the followed surface. They are also used in [[Turntablism|turntable]] type applications to reduce skidding. Crowned followers can compensate for up to 0.5° of misalignment, while a cylindrical OD can only tolerate 0.06°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Misalignment | url = http://www.rbcbearings.com/camfollowers/misalignment.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only disadvantage is that they cannot bear as much load because of higher [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]]es.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

===Stud===
Stud style cam followers usually have a ''standard'' sized stud, but a ''heavy'' stud is available for increased [[static load capacity]].&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

====Drives====
The standard driving system for a stud type cam follower is a slot, for use with a flat head screwdriver. However, hex sockets are available for higher torquing ability, which is especially useful for eccentric cam followers and those used in [[blind hole]]s. Hex socket cam followers from most manufacturers eliminate the relubrication capability on that end of the cam follower. RBC Bearings' Hexlube cam followers feature a relubrication fitting at the bottom of the hex socket.

====Eccentricity====
Stud type cam followers are available with an [[eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] stud. The stud has a bushing pushed onto it that has an eccentric outer diameter. This allows for adjustability during installation to eliminate any [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]]. The adjustable range for an eccentric bearing is twice that of the eccentricity.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

===Yoke===
Yoke type cam followers are usually used in applications where minimal deflection is required, as they can be supported on both sides. They can support the same static load as a heavy stud follower.&lt;ref name="mcgill"/&gt;

==Track followers==
All cam followers can be track followers, but not all track followers are cam followers. Some track followers have specially shaped outer diameters (OD) to follow tracks. For example, track followers are available with a V-groove for following a V-track, or the OD can have a flange to follow the lip of the track.&lt;ref name="mcgill2"&gt;{{Citation | title = Cam followers | url = http://www.emerson-ept.com/eptroot/public/prod/dynamic_frame.asp?strMain=http%3A//www.emerson-ept.com/EPTroot/public/prod/McGCamFl/McGCamF.htm | accessdate = 2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized track followers are also designed to withstand thrust loads so the anti-friction elements are usually [[bearing ball]]s or of a [[tapered roller bearing]] construction.&lt;ref name="mcgill2"/&gt;

'''Carbon monoxide''' ('''CO''') is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that is slightly less dense than air. It is toxic to [[hemoglobin|hemoglobic]] animals (both [[Hemoglobin#Analogues in non-vertebrate organisms|invertebrate]] and vertebrate, including humans) when encountered in concentrations above about 35 [[parts-per notation|ppm]], although it is also produced in normal animal metabolism in low quantities, and is thought to have some normal biological functions. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short lived, having a role in the formation of [[ground-level ozone]].
 
Carbon monoxide consists of one [[carbon]] atom and one [[oxygen]] atom, connected by a [[triple bond]] that consists of two [[covalent bond]]s as well as one [[Dipolar bond|dative]] covalent bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Molecular orbitals in Carbon Monoxide CO |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]] |url=http://www.chemtube3d.com/orbitalsCO.htm |accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[oxocarbon]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with other triply-bonded diatomic molecules having ten valence electrons, including the [[cyanide]] anion, the [[nitrosonium]] cation and molecular [[nitrogen]]. In [[coordination complex]]es the carbon monoxide [[ligand]] is called [[metal carbonyl|carbonyl]].

==History==
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes. An ancient method of execution was to shut the criminal in a bathing room with smoldering coals. What was not known was the mechanism of death. Greek physician [[Galen]] (129–199 AD) speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;Penney, David G. (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XsnPIfP0oBcC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Carbon Monoxide Toxicity''], CRC Press, p. 5, {{ISBN|0-8493-2065-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, the French chemist [[:fr:Joseph-Marie-François de Lassone|de Lassone]] produced CO by heating [[zinc oxide]] with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was [[hydrogen]], as it burned with a blue flame. The gas was identified as a compound containing [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]] by the Scottish chemist [[William Cruickshank (chemist)|William Cruikshank]] in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, W. (1801) [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4tEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Some observations on different hydrocarbonates and combinations of carbone with oxygen, etc. in reply to some of Dr. Priestley's late objections to the new system of chemistry,"] ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts'' [a.k.a. ''Nicholson's Journal''], 1st series, '''5''' : 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cruickshank, W. (1801) [https://books.google.com/books?id=t4tEAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA201 "Some additional observations on hydrocarbonates, and the gaseous oxide of carbon,"] ''Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts'', 1st series, '''5''' :  201–211.&lt;/ref&gt; Its toxic properties on dogs were thoroughly investigated by [[Claude Bernard]] around 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvgNKPxb43IC&amp;pg=PA38|page=38|title=Molecules of death|author1=Waring, Rosemary H. |author2=Steventon, Glyn B. |author3=Mitchell, Steve C. |publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2007|isbn=978-1-86094-814-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], a gas mixture including carbon monoxide was used to keep [[motor vehicle]]s running in parts of the world where [[gasoline]] and [[diesel fuel]] were scarce. External (with a few exceptions) charcoal or [[wood gas generator]]s were fitted, and the mixture of atmospheric nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and small amounts of other gases produced by [[gasification]] was piped to a gas mixer. The gas mixture produced by this process is known as [[wood gas]]. Carbon monoxide was also used on a large scale during [[the Holocaust]] at some [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|Nazi German extermination camps]], the most notable by [[gas van]]s in [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], and in the [[Action T4]] "[[euthanasia]]" program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_04R6DoPxLoC&amp;pg=PT323|page=323|title=A history of modern Germany, 1800–2000|author=Kitchen, Martin |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-0041-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of [[carbon]]-containing compounds; it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), such as when operating a [[stove]] or an [[internal combustion engine]] in an enclosed space. In the presence of oxygen, including atmospheric concentrations, carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame, producing carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Mike. [http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/co/coh.htm Carbon Monoxide – Molecule of the Month], Winchester College, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coal gas]], which was widely used before the 1960s for domestic lighting, cooking, and heating, had carbon monoxide as a significant fuel constituent. Some processes in modern technology, such as [[blast furnace|iron smelting]], still produce carbon monoxide as a byproduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KQqLicqcTM8C&amp;pg=PA36|page=36|title=Crossing the Energy Divide: Moving from Fossil Fuel Dependence to a Clean-Energy Future|author1=Ayres, Robert U.  |author2=Ayres, Edward H. |publisher=Wharton School Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-13-701544-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large quantity of CO byproduct is formed during the oxidative processes for the production of chemicals.

Worldwide, the largest source of carbon monoxide is natural in origin, due to [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reactions in the [[troposphere]] that generate about 5{{e|12}} kilograms per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.176.4032.290|title=Carbon Monoxide Balance in Nature|year=1972|last1=Weinstock|first1=B.|last2=Niki|first2=H.|journal=Science|volume=176|pages=290–2|pmid=5019781|issue=4032|bibcode = 1972Sci...176..290W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes, forest fires, other forms of combustion, and [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].

In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

==Molecular properties==
Carbon monoxide has a [[molar mass]] of 28.0, which, according to the [[ideal gas law]], makes it slightly less dense than air, whose average molar mass is 28.8.

The [[bond length]] between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is 112.8&amp;nbsp;[[picometre|pm]].&lt;ref name=gilliam&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gilliam, O. R. |author2=Johnson, C. M. |author3=Gordy, W. |title=Microwave Spectroscopy in the Region from Two to Three Millimeters|year=1950|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=78|issue=2|pages=140–144|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.140|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..140G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bond length is consistent with a triple bond, as in molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a similar bond length (109.76&amp;nbsp;pm) and nearly the same [[molecular mass]]. Carbon–oxygen double bonds are significantly longer, 120.8&amp;nbsp;pm in [[formaldehyde]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRC91|page=9–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boiling point (82&amp;nbsp;K) and melting point (68&amp;nbsp;K) are very similar to those of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (77&amp;nbsp;K and 63&amp;nbsp;K, respectively). The [[bond-dissociation energy]] of 1072&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol is stronger than that of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (942&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and represents the strongest chemical bond known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond_energies_lengths.html Common Bond Energies (D) and Bond Lengths (r)]. wiredchemist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ground state|ground]] [[electronic state]] of carbon monoxide is a [[singlet state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Highly Excited Triplet States of Carbon Monoxide| first=C. R. |last=Vidal|date=28 June 1997 |url=http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828201131/http://www.mpe.mpg.de/lab/CO/co.html|archivedate=2006-08-28|accessdate= August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; since there are no unpaired electrons.

===Bonding and dipole moment===
The carbon monoxide has a very high [[bond-dissociation energy]], the strongest of any neutral molecule, 11.65 eV.  Carbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 [[electrons]] in the [[valence shell]]. Following the [[octet rule]] for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a [[triple bond]], with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or [[dipolar bond]]. This causes a C←O [[Chemical polarity|polarization]] of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C→O polarization, since oxygen is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon. In the free carbon monoxide, a net negative charge δ&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small [[bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.122&amp;nbsp;[[Debye|D]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Scuseria | first1=Gustavo E. | last2=Miller | first2=Michael D. | last3=Jensen | first3=Frank | last4=Geertsen | first4=Jan |title=The dipole moment of carbon monoxide|journal=J.

The molecule is therefore asymmetric: oxygen has more electron density than carbon, and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative. By contrast, the [[isoelectronic]] dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment.

If carbon monoxide acts as a [[Metal carbonyl|ligand]], the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end, depending on the structure of the [[coordination complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lupinetti | first1 = Anthony J. | last2 = Fau | first2 = Stefan | last3 = Frenking | first3 = Gernot | last4 = Strauss | first4 = Steven H. | title = Theoretical Analysis of the Bonding between CO and Positively Charged Atoms| journal = J.

Theoretical and experimental studies show that, despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen, the dipole moment points from the more-negative carbon end to the more-positive oxygen end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanco | first1 = Fernando | last2 = Alkorta | first2 = Ibon | last3 = Solimannejad | first3 = Mohammad | last4 = Elguero | first4 = Jose | title = Theoretical Study of the 1:1 Complexes between Carbon Monoxide and Hypohalous Acids | journal = J.

The [[oxidation state]] of carbon in carbon monoxide is +2 in each of these structures. It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen. Only the two non-bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon. In this count, carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom.

===Toxicity===
&lt;!--Please keep this section short, there is no need to elaborate here. Details will be more useful in the [[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] article.--&gt;
{{Main|Carbon monoxide poisoning}}

[[Carbon monoxide poisoning]] is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries.&lt;ref name="Toxicology2002-omaye"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Omaye ST| title=Metabolic modulation of carbon monoxide toxicity|journal=Toxicology|year=2002|pages=139–150|volume=180|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0300-483X(02)00387-6|pmid=12324190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon monoxide is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, but highly toxic. It combines with [[hemoglobin]] to produce [[carboxyhemoglobin]], which usurps the space in hemoglobin that normally carries oxygen, but is ineffective for delivering oxygen to bodily tissues. Concentrations as low as 667 [[Parts per notation|ppm]] may cause up to 50% of the body's hemoglobin to convert to carboxyhemoglobin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=1592720|year=1992|last1=Tikuisis|first1=P|last2=Kane|first2=DM|last3=McLellan|first3=TM|last4=Buick|first4=F|last5=Fairburn|first5=SM|title=Rate of formation of carboxyhemoglobin in exercising humans exposed to carbon monoxide|volume=72|issue=4|pages=1311–9|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1152/jappl.1992.72.4.1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A level of 50% carboxyhemoglobin may result in seizure, coma, and fatality. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] limits long-term workplace exposure levels above 50 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=OSHA CO guidelines |url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/carbonmonoxide/recognition.html |publisher=OSHA |accessdate=May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126010501/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/carbonmonoxide/recognition.html |archivedate=January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as [[headache]], [[nausea]], [[vomiting]], [[dizziness]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], and a feeling of weakness. Affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning. Infants may be irritable and feed poorly. Neurological signs include confusion, disorientation, visual disturbance, [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] (fainting), and seizures.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal" /&gt;

Some descriptions of carbon monoxide poisoning include [[retina]]l hemorrhages, and an abnormal cherry-red blood hue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ganong|first=William F|title= Review of medical physiology|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLa8vDBXDD4C&amp;dq=Ganong+WF.+Review+of+Medical+Physiology.+Norwalk+Ct:+Appleton+%26+Lange,+1995&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=May 2009|edition=22|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-144040-0|page=684|chapter=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most clinical diagnoses these signs are seldom noticed.&lt;ref name="Blumenthal"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blumenthal|first=Ivan|date=1 June 2001|title=Carbon monoxide poisoning|journal=J R Soc Med|volume=94|issue=6|pages=270–272|pmid=11387414|pmc=1281520|doi=10.1177/014107680109400604}}&lt;/ref&gt; One difficulty with the usefulness of this cherry-red effect is that it corrects, or masks, what would otherwise be an unhealthy appearance, since the chief effect of removing deoxygenated hemoglobin is to make an asphyxiated person appear more normal, or a dead person appear more lifelike, similar to the effect of red colorants in embalming fluid. The "false" or unphysiologic red-coloring effect in anoxic CO-poisoned tissue is related to the meat-coloring commercial use of carbon monoxide, discussed below.

Carbon monoxide also binds to other molecules such as [[myoglobin]] and [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] [[cytochrome oxidase]]. Exposures to carbon monoxide may cause significant damage to the [[heart]] and [[central nervous system]], especially to the [[globus pallidus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Prockop LD, Chichkova RI |title=Carbon monoxide intoxication: an updated review|journal=J Neurol Sci|year=2007|pages=122–130|volume=262|issue=1–2|pmid=17720201|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.037}}&lt;/ref&gt; often with [[sequelae|long-term chronic pathological conditions]]. Carbon monoxide may have severe adverse effects on the [[fetus]] of a pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2y6zOSQcn14C&amp;pg=PA325|page=325|title=Maternal, fetal, &amp; neonatal physiology: a clinical perspective|author=Tucker Blackburn, Susan |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4160-2944-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normal human physiology===
{{see also|Gaseous signaling molecules}}
Carbon monoxide is produced naturally by the human body as a [[signaling molecule]]. Thus, carbon monoxide may have a physiological role in the body, such as a [[neurotransmitter]] or a [[vasodilation|blood vessel relaxant]].&lt;ref name="endogenous_co"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=L|title=Carbon Monoxide: Endogenous Production, Physiological Functions, and Pharmacological Applications|journal=Pharmacol Rev|volume=57|issue=4|pages=585–630|date=December 2005|pmid=16382109|doi=10.1124/pr.57.4.3|last2=Wang|first2=R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of carbon monoxide's role in the body, abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases, including neurodegenerations, hypertension, heart failure, and pathological inflammation.&lt;ref name="endogenous_co" /&gt; Relative to inflammation, carbon monoxide has been shown to inhibit the movement of [[leukocyte]]s to inflamed tissues, stimulate leukocyte [[phagocytosis]] of bacteria, and reduce the production of pro-inflammatory [[cytokine]]s by leukocytes. In animal model studies, furthermore, carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial [[sepsis]], pancreatitis, hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury, colitis, osteoarthritis, lung injury, lung transplantation rejection, and neuropathic pain while promoting skin wound healing. These actions are similar to those of [[Specialized pro-resolving mediators]] which act to dampen, reverse, and repair the tissue damage due to diverse inflammation responses. Indeed, carbon monoxide can act additively with one of these mediators ([[Resolvin]] D1) to limit inflammatory responses. The studies implicate carbon monoxide as a physiological contributor to limiting inflammation and suggest that its delivery by inhalation or carbon monoxide-forming drugs may be therapeutically useful for controlling pathological inflammatory responses.&lt;ref name="pmid26095908"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wallace JL, Ianaro A, Flannigan KL, Cirino G | title = Gaseous mediators in resolution of inflammation | journal = Seminars in Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 227–33 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26095908 | doi = 10.1016/j.smim.2015.05.004 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26208702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uehara EU, Shida Bde S, de Brito CA | title = Role of nitric oxide in immune responses against viruses: beyond microbicidal activity | journal = Inflammation Research | volume = 64 | issue = 11 | pages = 845–52 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26208702 | doi = 10.1007/s00011-015-0857-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26498251"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakahira K, Choi AM | title = Carbon monoxide in the treatment of sepsis | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

CO functions as an endogenous signaling molecule, modulates functions of the cardiovascular system, inhibits blood platelet aggregation and adhesion, suppresses, reverses, and repairs the damage caused by inflammatory responses.

===Atmospheric presence===

[[File:Carbon Monoxide concentrations in spring..jpg|thumb|Carbon Monoxide concentrations in Northern Hemisphere spring as measured with the MOPITT instrument.]]

Carbon monoxide (CO) is present in small amounts (about 80 ppb) in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. About half of the carbon monoxide in Earth's atmosphere is from the burning of [[fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and biomass (such as [[forest fires|forest]] and [[bushfire]]s).&lt;ref name=Seinfeld2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seinfeld |first1=John |last2=Pandis |first2=Spyros |date=2006 |title=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics: From Air Pollution to Climate Change |url= |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page= |isbn=978-0-471-72018-8 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the rest of carbon monoxide comes from chemical reactions with [[organic compound]]s emitted by human activities and plants. Small amounts are also emitted from the ocean, and from geological activity because carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high [[pressure]]s in the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kcllhZcy53cC&amp;pg=PA243|page=243|title=Metal-Carbon Bonds in Enzymes and Cofactors|author1=Sigel, Astrid  |author2=Sigel, Roland K. O. |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|year=2009|isbn=978-1-84755-915-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because natural sources of carbon monoxide are so variable from year to year, it is difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas.

Carbon monoxide has an indirect effect on [[radiative forcing]] by elevating concentrations of direct [[greenhouse gas]]es, including [[methane]] and [[troposphere|tropospheric]] [[ozone]]. CO can react chemically with other atmospheric constituents (primarily the [[hydroxyl]] [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]], OH&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) that would otherwise destroy methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gnaNHeU4rgQC&amp;pg=PA106|page=106|title=Global climate change linkages: acid rain, air quality, and stratospheric ozone|author=White, James Carrick|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=978-0-444-01515-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually oxidized to [[carbon dioxide]] and ozone. Carbon monoxide is both short-lived in the atmosphere (with an average lifetime of about one to two months) and spatially variable in concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bulletin.cmos.ca/mopitt-atmospheric-pollution/ |title=MOPITT, Atmospheric Pollution, and Me: A Personal Story |last=Drummond |first=James |date=February 2, 2018 |website= |publisher=Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society |access-date=August 1, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[atmosphere of Venus]] carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than 169 [[nanometre|nm]].

Due to its long lifetime in the mid-troposphere, carbon monoxide is also used as tracer of transport for pollutant plumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.5194/acp-10-10655-2010 | title = IASI carbon monoxide validation over the Arctic during POLARCAT spring and summer campaigns | year = 2010 | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = Law | first2 = K.

===Urban pollution===
Carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas, chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines (including vehicles, portable and back-up generators, lawn mowers, power washers, etc.), but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels (including wood, coal, charcoal, oil, paraffin, propane, natural gas, and trash).

Large CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pommier | first1 = M. | last2 = McLinden | first2 = C.

{{Main|Tropospheric ozone}}
Carbon monoxide is, along with [[aldehyde]]s, part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form [[photochemical smog]]. It reacts with hydroxyl radical (&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;OH) to produce a radical intermediate &lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;HOCO, which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form [[peroxy]] radical (HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;) and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1029/2002JD002415|title=Potential for photochemical ozone formation in the troposphere over the North Atlantic as derived from aircraft observationsduring ACSOE|year=2002|author1=Reeves, Claire E. |author2=Penkett, Stuart A. |author3=Bauguitte, Stephane |author4=Law, Kathy S. |author5=Evans, Mathew J. |author6=Bandy, Brian J. |author7=Monks, Paul S. |author8=Edwards, Gavin D. |author9=Phillips, Gavin |author10=Barjat, Hannah |author11=Kent, Joss |author12=Dewey, Ken |author13=Schmitgen, Sandra |author14=Kley, Dieter |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=107|pages=4707|issue=D23|bibcode = 2002JGRD..107.4707R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO) to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and hydroxyl radical. NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives O(&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P) via photolysis, thereby forming O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; following reaction with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
Since hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is:
:CO + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + hν → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
(where hν refers to the [[photon]] of light absorbed by the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule in the sequence)

Although the creation of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical step leading to low level [[ozone]] formation, it also increases this ozone in another, somewhat mutually exclusive way, by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QkErAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA23|page=23|title=Ozone and other photochemical oxidants|publisher=National Academies|year=1977|isbn=978-0-309-02531-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor pollution===
In closed environments, the concentration of carbon monoxide can easily rise to lethal levels. On average, 170 people in the United States die every year from carbon monoxide produced by non-automotive consumer products.&lt;ref name="cpsc"&gt;[[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], [http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/466.html Carbon Monoxide Questions and Answers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109204227/http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/466.html |date=2010-01-09 }}, accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the [[Florida Department of Health]], "every year more than 500 Americans die from accidental exposure to carbon monoxide and thousands more across the U.S. require emergency medical care for non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning"&lt;ref name=EPHT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |title=Tracking Carbon Monoxide |publisher=Environmental Public Health Tracking – Florida Dept. of Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927164735/http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/programs/Environmental_Public_Health_Tracking/HTML_pages/Data_Carbon_Monoxide.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These products include malfunctioning fuel-burning appliances such as furnaces, ranges, water heaters, and [[gas heater|gas]] and [[kerosene heater|kerosene]] room heaters; engine-powered equipment such as portable generators; fireplaces; and charcoal that is burned in homes and other enclosed areas. The American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) reported 15,769 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning resulting in 39 deaths in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101204014524/http://www.aapcc.org/dnn/NPDSPoisonData/AnnualReports/tabid/125/Default.aspx "AAPCC Annual Data Reports 2007"]. American Association of Poison Control Centers.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the CPSC reported 94 generator-related carbon monoxide poisoning deaths.&lt;ref name="cpsc" /&gt; Forty-seven of these deaths were known to have occurred during power outages due to severe weather, including [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="cpsc" /&gt; Still others die from carbon monoxide produced by non-consumer products, such as cars left running in attached garages. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimates that several thousand people go to hospital emergency rooms every year to be treated for carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, [http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showCarbonMonoxideLanding.action Carbon Monoxide Poisoning], accessed 2009-12-04&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence in blood===
Carbon monoxide is absorbed through breathing and enters the blood stream through gas exchange in the lungs. It is also produced in [[heme#Degradation|heme catabolism]] and enters the blood from the tissues, and thus is present in all normal tissues, even if not inhaled.

Normal circulating levels in the blood are 0% to 3%,{{clarify|reason=what is this the percentage of? Clearly not of blood volume or mass!|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=167&amp;contentid=carbon_monoxide_blood|title=Carbon Monoxide (Blood) -  Health Encyclopedia - University of Rochester Medical Center|website=www.urmc.rochester.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; are higher in smokers. Carbon monoxide levels cannot be assessed through a physical exam. Laboratory testing requires a blood sample (arterial or venous) and laboratory analysis on a CO-Oximeter. Additionally, a noninvasive carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO) test method from Pulse CO-Oximetry exists and has been validated compared to invasive methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Roth D. |author2=Herkner H. |author3=Schreiber W. |author4=Hubmann N. |author5=Gamper G. |author6=Laggner A.N. |author7=Havel C. |title=Accuracy of Noninvasive Multiwave Pulse Oximetry Compared With Carboxyhemoglobin From Blood Gas Analysis in Unselected Emergency Department Patients|pmid=21459480|url=http://www.osuem.com/education/journalClub/accuracy+of+noninvasive+multiwave+pulse+ox.pdf|year=2011|volume=58|issue=1|pages=74–9|doi=10.1016/j.annemergmed.2010.12.024|journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space ===
Outside of Earth, carbon monoxide is the second-most common molecule in the [[interstellar medium]], after [[molecular hydrogen]].  Because of its asymmetry, this [[polar molecule]] produces far brighter [[spectral line]]s than the hydrogen molecule, making CO much easier to detect.  Interstellar CO was first detected with [[radio telescope]]s in 1970. It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies, as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light, which requires [[space telescopes]]. Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the [[molecular cloud]]s in which most [[star formation|stars form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Annual Review of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | year=1991 | volume=29 | pages=195–237 | author=Combes, Françoise | title=Distribution of CO in the Milky Way | doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.29.090191.001211 | bibcode=1991ARA&amp;A..29..195C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beta Pictoris]], the second brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Pictor]], shows an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared emission]] compared to normal stars of its type, which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas (including carbon monoxide)&lt;ref name="LAT-20140308"&gt;{{cite news |last=Khan |first=Amina |title=Did two planets around nearby star collide?

Solid carbon monoxide is a component of [[comet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1998A&amp;A...330..375G |title=Making a comet nucleus |author1=Greenberg |first1=J.

However, there is very little CO in the atmosphere of [[Pluto]], which seems to have been formed from comets. This may be because there is (or was) liquid water inside Pluto. Carbon monoxide can react with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → {{chem|H|2}} + {{chem|CO|2}}

This is called the [[water-gas shift reaction]] when occurring in the gas phase, but it can also take place (very slowly) in aqueous solution.
If the hydrogen partial pressure is high enough (for instance in an underground sea), [[formic acid]] will be formed:

:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HCOOH

These reactions can take place in only a few million years even at temperatures such as found at Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Christopher Glein and Hunter Waite |title=Primordial N2 provides a cosmo chemical  explanation  for the  existence of Sputnik Planitia, Pluto |journal=Icarus |volume=313 |pages=79–92 |date=May 11, 2018 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2018.05.007 |arxiv=1805.09285|bibcode=2018Icar..313...79G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mining ===
Miners refer to carbon monoxide as "white damp" or the "silent killer". It can be found in confined areas of poor ventilation in both surface mines and underground mines. The most common sources of carbon monoxide in mining operations are the internal combustion engine and explosives however in coal mines carbon monoxide can also be found due to the low temperature oxidation of coal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/illness_prevention/healthtopics/carbonmonoxide.htm|title=MSHA - Occupational Illness and Injury Prevention Program - Health Topics - Carbon Monoxide|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide's production.&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 200. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial production===
A major industrial source of CO is [[producer gas]], a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen, formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon. In an oven, air is passed through a bed of [[coke (fuel)|coke]]. The initially produced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO. The reaction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon to give CO is described as the [[Boudouard reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Higman, C |author2=van der Burgt, M | title = Gasification | publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-7506-7707-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above 800&amp;nbsp;°C, CO is the predominant product:

:CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + C → 2 CO (ΔH = 170 kJ/mol)

Another source is "[[water gas]]", a mixture of [[hydrogen]] and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of [[steam]] and carbon:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + C → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO (ΔH = +131 kJ/mol)

Other similar "[[syngas|synthesis gas]]es" can be obtained from [[natural gas]] and other fuels.

Carbon monoxide can also be produced by [[high-temperature electrolysis]] of carbon dioxide with [[solid oxide electrolyzer cell]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zheng|first1=Yun|last2=Wang|first2=Jianchen|last3=Yu|first3=Bo|last4=Zhang|first4=Wenqiang|last5=Chen|first5=Jing|last6=Qiao|first6=Jinli|last7=Zhang|first7=Jiujun|title=A review of high temperature co-electrolysis of H                            O and CO to produce sustainable fuels using solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs): advanced materials and technology|journal=Chem. Soc. Rev.|date=2017|volume=46|issue=5|pages=1427–1463|doi=10.1039/C6CS00403B|pmid=28165079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal [[oxide]] [[ore]]s with carbon, shown in a simplified form as follows:

:MO + C → M + CO

Carbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air.

:2 C(s) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 CO(g)

Since CO is a gas, the reduction process can be driven by heating, exploiting the positive (favorable) [[entropy]] of reaction. The [[Ellingham diagram]] shows that CO formation is favored over CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in high temperatures.

===Laboratory preparation===
Carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[formic acid]] or [[oxalic acid]], for example with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name="koch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="coleman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Georg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brauer|first=Georg|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry Vol. 1, 2nd Ed|date=1963|publisher=Academic Press|location=Newyork|isbn=978-0121266011|page=646|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TLYatwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Handbook+of+Preparative+Inorganic+Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered [[zinc]] metal and [[calcium carbonate]], which releases CO and leaves behind [[zinc oxide]] and [[calcium oxide]]:

:Zn + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → ZnO + CaO + CO

[[Silver nitrate]] and [[iodoform]] also afford carbon monoxide:

:CHI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CO + 3AgI

Finally, metal [[oxalate]] salts release CO upon heating, leaving a [[carbonate]] as byproduct:

: {{chem|Na|2|C|2|O|4}} → {{chem|Na|2|C|O|3}} + {{chem|CO}}

==Coordination chemistry==

[[File:MO COeng.svg|thumb|left|200px|Energy level scheme of the σ and π orbitals of carbon monoxide]]
[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-HOMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|HOMO]] of CO is a σ [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]
[[Image:Carbon-monoxide-LUMO-phase-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|150px|The [[HOMO/LUMO|LUMO]] of CO is a π* [[antibonding]] [[molecular orbital|MO]].]]

Most metals form [[coordination complex]]es containing covalently attached carbon monoxide. Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide [[ligands]]. This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate [[back-donation]] from the metal d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;-orbital, to the π* [[molecular orbital]] from CO. The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO, also donates electron density to the d&lt;sub&gt;x²−y²&lt;/sub&gt; on the metal to form a [[sigma bond]]. This electron donation is also exhibited with the [[cis effect]], or the labilization of CO ligands in the cis position. [[Nickel carbonyl]], for example, forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and [[nickel]] metal:
: Ni + 4 CO → Ni(CO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (1 bar, 55 °C)
For this reason, nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide. Nickel carbonyl decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces, and this method is used for the industrial purification of [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mond L, Langer K, Quincke F | title= Action of carbon monoxide on nickel| journal=Journal of the Chemical Society|year=1890| pages=749–753|doi = 10.1039/CT8905700749| volume= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls, the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal; the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal. In these situations, carbon monoxide is called the '''carbonyl''' [[ligand]]. One of the most important metal carbonyls is [[iron pentacarbonyl]], Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:

[[Image:IronPentacarbonylStructure.png|150px|Structure of iron pentacarbonyl.]]
[[Image:Iron-pentacarbonyl-3D-balls.png|120px|Iron pentacarbonyl.]]

Many metal-CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents, not from CO. For instance, [[iridium(III) chloride|iridium trichloride]] and [[triphenylphosphine]] react in boiling [[2-Methoxyethanol|2-methoxyethanol]] or [[dimethylformamide|DMF]] to afford [[Vaska's complex|IrCl(CO)(PPh&lt;SUB&gt;3&lt;/SUB&gt;)&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;]].

Metal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using [[infrared spectroscopy of metal carbonyls|infrared spectroscopy]].

==Organic and main group chemistry==
In the presence of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with [[alkene]]s to form [[carboxylic acids]] in a process known as the Koch–Haaf reaction.&lt;ref name = koch&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=Koch, H. |author2=Haaf, W.|title=1-Adamantanecarboxylic Acid|year=1973|collvol=5|collvolpages=20|prep=cv5p0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gattermann–Koch reaction]], [[Aromatic hydrocarbon|arenes]] are converted to [[benzaldehyde]] derivatives in the presence of [[aluminium chloride|AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[hydrogen chloride|HCl]].&lt;ref name = coleman&gt;{{OrgSynth|title=''p''-Tolualdehyde|author=Coleman, G. H. |author2= Craig, David |last-author-amp=yes |collvol=2|collvolpages=583|year=1943|prep=cv2p0583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organolithium compounds (e.g. [[butyl lithium]]) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.

Although CO reacts with [[carbocation]]s and [[carbanion]]s, it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;Chatani, N.; Murai, S. "Carbon Monoxide" in Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. {{doi|10.1002/047084289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With main group reagents, CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions. [[halogenation|Chlorination]] of CO is the industrial route to the important compound [[phosgene]]. With [[borane]] CO forms the adduct [[Borane carbonyl|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BCO]], which is [[isoelectronic]] with the [[acylium|acetylium]] cation [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CCO]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. CO reacts with [[sodium]] to give products resulting from C-C coupling such as [[acetylenediol|sodium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|Na|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}. It reacts with molten [[potassium]] to give a mixture of an organometallic compound, [[acetylenediol|potassium acetylenediolate]] 2{{chem|K|+}}·{{chem|C|2|O|2|2-}}, [[benzenehexol|potassium benzenehexolate]] 6{{chem|K|+}} {{chem|C|6|O|6|6-}},&lt;ref name="wbuechIV"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Büchner | first1 = W. | last2 = Weiss | first2 = E. | title = Zur Kenntnis der sogenannten "Alkalicarbonyle" IV[1] Über die Reaktion von geschmolzenem Kalium mit Kohlenmonoxid | journal = Helvetica Chimica Acta | volume =47 |issue =6 |pages =1415–1423 | year = 1964 |doi=10.1002/hlca.19640470604}}

The compounds [[cyclohexanehexone]] or triquinoyl (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[cyclopentanepentone]] or leuconic acid (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts, can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide.

At pressures of over 5 [[pascal (unit)|gigapascals]], carbon monoxide converts into a [[polycarbonyl|solid polymer of carbon and oxygen]].  This is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is a powerful explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/j150659a007|title=New phases and chemical reactions in solid carbon monoxide under pressure|year=1984|last1=Katz|first1=Allen I.|last2=Schiferl|first2=David|last3=Mills|first3=Robert L.|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=88|pages=3176–3179|issue=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1021/cm0524446|title=Pressure-Induced Polymerization of Carbon Monoxide: Disproportionation and Synthesis of an Energetic Lactonic Polymer|year=2006|last1=Evans|first1=W.

==Uses==

===Chemical industry===
Carbon monoxide is an [[industrial gas]] that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elschenbroich |first1=C. |last2=Salzer |first2=A. |title=Organometallics: A Concise Introduction |edition=2nd |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2006 |isbn=978-3-527-28165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the [[hydroformylation]] reaction of [[alkene]]s, carbon monoxide, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hydroformylation is coupled to the [[Shell higher olefin process]] to give precursors to [[detergent]]s.

[[Phosgene]], useful for preparing isocyanates, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes, is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and [[chlorine]] gas through a bed of porous [[activated carbon]], which serves as a [[catalyst]].  World production of this compound was estimated to be 2.74 million tonnes in 1989.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann's| author1 = Wolfgang Schneider | author2 =  Werner Diller | title = Phosgene | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_411}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:CO + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Methanol]] is produced by the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide. In a related reaction, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C-C bond formation, as in the [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels. This technology allows [[coal]] or biomass to be converted to diesel.

In the [[Monsanto process]], carbon monoxide and [[methanol]] react in the presence of a homogeneous [[rhodium]] [[catalyst]] and [[hydroiodic acid]] to give [[acetic acid]]. In the more recent [[Cativa process]], an [[iridium]] catalyst is used. These two processes for the carbonylation are responsible for most of the industrial production of [[acetic acid]].

An industrial scale use for pure carbon monoxide is purifying [[nickel]] in the [[Mond process]].

Carbon monoxide can also be used in the [[water-gas shift reaction]] to produce [[hydrogen]].

===Meat coloring===
Carbon monoxide is used in [[modified atmosphere]] packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with [[myoglobin]] to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment [[metmyoglobin]]. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat.&lt;ref name="Meatsci1999_SORHEIM"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sorheim, S |author2=Nissena, H |author3=Nesbakken, T |title=The storage life of beef and pork packaged in an atmosphere with low carbon monoxide and high carbon dioxide|journal=Journal of Meat Science|year=1999|pages=157–164|volume=52|issue=2|doi=10.1016/S0309-1740(98)00163-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.

The technology was first given "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) status by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 2002 for use as a secondary packaging system, and does not require labeling.

===Medicine===
{{see also|Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules}}
In biology, carbon monoxide is naturally produced by the action of [[heme oxygenase]] 1 and 2 on the [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] breakdown. This process produces a certain amount of carboxyhemoglobin in normal persons, even if they do not breathe any carbon monoxide.

Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in 1993,&lt;ref name = verma/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; as well as one of three gases that naturally modulate inflammatory responses in the body (the other two being [[nitric oxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]), carbon monoxide has received a great deal of clinical attention as a biological regulator. In many tissues, all three gases are known to act as [[anti-inflammatories]], [[vasodilators]], and encouragers of [[neovascular]] growth.&lt;ref name="Li2009" /&gt; However, the issues are complex, as neovascular growth is not always beneficial, since it plays a role in tumor growth, and also the damage from ''wet'' [[macular degeneration]], a disease for which smoking (a major source of carbon monoxide in the blood, several times more than natural production) increases the risk from 4 to 6 times.

There is a theory that, in some nerve cell [[synapse]]s, when [[long-term memories]] are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells have been shown to contain [[guanylate cyclase]], an [[enzyme]] that is activated by carbon monoxide.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties. These properties have potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury, transplant rejection, atherosclerosis, severe sepsis, severe malaria, or autoimmunity. Clinical tests involving humans have been performed, however the results have not yet been released.&lt;ref name="clinical-trial"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison gas may carry a medical benefit|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/10/16/poison_gas_may_carry_a_medical_benefit/?page=full|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=October 16, 2009|accessdate=October 16, 2009 | first=Carolyn Y. | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metallurgy===

Carbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent, and whilst not known, it has been used in [[pyrometallurgy]] to reduce [[metal]]s from [[ore]]s since ancient times. Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides, reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures, forming [[carbon dioxide]] in the process. Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is, in gaseous phase, in the reactor, but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen-carrying ore, carboniferous agent such as coke and high temperature. The [[blast furnace]] process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide.

===Lasers===

Carbon monoxide has also been used as a [[active laser medium|lasing medium]] in high-powered infrared [[laser]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ionin | first1 = A. | last2 = Kinyaevskiy | first2 = I. | last3 = Klimachev | first3 = Y. | last4 = Kotkov | first4 = A. | last5 = Kozlov | first5 = A. | title = Novel mode-locked carbon monoxide laser system achieves high accuracy | doi = 10.1117/2.1201112.004016 | journal = SPIE Newsroom | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===

Carbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars. [[Carbon monoxide/oxygen engine]]s have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the [[atmosphere of Mars]] by [[zirconia]] [[electrolysis]], without using any [[Water on Mars|Martian water resources]] to obtain hydrogen, which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen-based fuel.&lt;ref name=landis2001&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Landis |title=Mars Rocket Vehicle Using In Situ Propellants |journal=Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets |date=2001 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=730–735 |doi=10.2514/2.3739 |bibcode = 2001JSpRo..38..730L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[blast furnace gas]] collected at the top of blast furnace, still contains some 10% to 30% of carbon monoxide, and is used as fuel on [[Cowper stove]]s and on Siemens-Martin furnaces on [[open hearth furnace|open hearth steelmaking]].

The '''Census of Coral Reefs''' (CReefs) is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that surveys the [[biodiversity]] of [[coral reef]] ecosystems internationally.  The project works to study what species live in coral reef ecosystems, to develop standardized protocols for studying coral reef ecosystems, and to increase access to and exchange of information about coral reefs scattered throughout the globe.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pifsc.noaa.gov/cred/creefs.php NOAA Article about the CReefs Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CReefs project uses the implementation of autonomous reef-monitoring structures (ARMS) to study the species that inhabit coral reefs.  These structures are placed on the sea floor in areas where coral reefs exist, where they are left for one year. At the end of the year, the ARMvS is pulled to the surface, along with the species which have inhabited it, for analysis. &lt;ref&gt;[http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/reef-monitoring-structure/ Smithsonian Institution ARMS page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral reefs are thought to be the most organically different of all marine ecosystems.  Major declines in key reef ecosystems suggest a decline in reef population throughout the world due to environmental stresses. The vulnerability of coral reef ecosystems is expected to increase significantly in response to climate change. The reefs are also being threatened by induced coral bleaching, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, and changing storm tracks. Reef biodiversity could be in danger of being lost before it is even documented, and researchers will be left with a limited and poor understanding of these complex ecosystems.

In an attempt to enhance global understanding of reef biodiversity, the goals of the CReefs Census of Coral Reef Ecosystems were to conduct a diverse global census of coral reef ecosystems. And increase access to and exchange of coral reef data throughout the world. Because coral reefs are the most diverse and among the most threatened of all marine ecosystems, there is great justification to learn more about them.

==Co-benefits in policy-making==
Co-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;

==Co-benefits in research ==
Different research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the [[Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The [[Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German [[Bundestag]]. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries. These four target countries are [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], and [[Vietnam]]. The project team, thereby, cooperates with national authorities and knowledge partners to develop key insights that enable them to mobilise these co-benefits in their countries and accelerate domestic processes aimed at achieving their international climate protection commitments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cobenefits.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Media Initiative''' (DMI) was a British [[broadcast engineering]] project launched by the [[BBC]] in 2008. It aimed to modernise the Corporation's production and archiving methods by using connected digital production and [[Digital asset management|media asset management]] systems. After a protracted [[Software development process|development process]] lasting five years with a spend of £98 million between 2010 and 2012, the project was finally abandoned in May 2013.&lt;ref name=bbc_abandons&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC abandons £100m digital project|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22651126|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpr-close&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC closes Digital Media Initiative|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/digital-media-initiative.html|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=24 May 2013|agency=BBC press release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial impetus and relaunch==
The technology programme was initiated by the director of BBC Technology [[Ashley Highfield]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=beta-bust /&gt; It aimed to streamline broadcast operations by moving to a fully digital, [[tapeless]] production workflow at a cost of £81.7 million. Forecast to deliver cost savings to the BBC of around £18 million, DMI was [[outsourcing|contracted out]] to the technology services provider [[Siemens IT Solutions and Services|Siemens]] with consulting by [[Deloitte]]. Among the production features to be provided by DMI were a media ingest system; a [[Digital asset management|media asset management]] system, unifying audio, video and stills archival; an online [[storyboard]]ing system; and [[metadata]] storage and sharing. A core part of the system was formed by using Cinegy, a production suite originally developed prior to the DMI project by the BBC and selected by Siemens in 2008.&lt;ref name=cinegy&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinegy &amp; Siemens, Enabling Media Technology for Digital Media Initiative at Major UK Broadcaster |url=http://www.cinegy.com/jml/index.php/en/news-mainmenu-141/news-archive-mainmenu-66/143-cinegy-a-siemens.html |work=Cinegy company website |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209140231/http://www.cinegy.com/jml/index.php/en/news-mainmenu-141/news-archive-mainmenu-66/143-cinegy-a-siemens.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Austerberry&gt;{{cite book|last=Austerberry|first=David|title=Digital Asset Management|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1136033610|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DMI Programme Director was television producer and entrepreneur [[Raymond P.

Costs of the project rose after a number of technical problems and delays, and in 2009 the BBC terminated its contract with Siemens.&lt;ref name=broadcast-dmi&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Katherine|title=BBC ditches Siemens from £80m DMI scheme|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/broadcasters/bbc-ditches-siemens-from-80m-dmi-scheme/5008953.article|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=Broadcast|date=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC losses were estimated to be £38.2m,&lt;ref name=ITProPortal-dmi&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Loses £38 Million In Failed Digital Media Initiative |url=http://www.itproportal.com/2011/04/07/bbc-loses-38-million-failed-digital-media-initiative/|work=ITProPortal|accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  partially offset by a £27.5m settlement paid by Siemens, leaving a loss of £10.7m to the BBC. The BBC was criticised by the UK [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] (NAO) in 2011 for its handling of the project.&lt;ref name=guardian-dmi&gt;{{cite news|last=Plunkett|first=John|title=BBC IT project criticised by audit office|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/01/bbc-it-audit-office|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In evidence given to the NAO, the Director of the BBC's Future Media and Technology division, [[Erik Huggers]], stated that Siemens had been selected to run the project without a [[tendering]] process because the BBC already had a 10-year support contract with the company. He also remarked that transfer of [[Risk management|risk]] on the project to Siemens had resulted in a distant relationship with Siemens which made it hard to monitor project [[Milestone (project management)|milestone]]s and the completion of [[deliverable]]s.&lt;ref name=nao-evidence&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral evidence Taken before the Public Accounts Committee|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpubacc/808/808.pdf|work=The BBC’s management of its Digital Media Initiative|publisher=House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts|page=20|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, it was reported that BBC staff who worked on a number of projects including DMI had suffered from severe [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] and had been treated at [[Priory Group|The Priory]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-dmi&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC spends £19,000 treating stressed out staff at The Priory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/9074284/BBC-spends-19000-treating-stressed-out-staff-at-The-Priory.html|accessdate=15 February 2012|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 February 2012|location=London|first=Katherine|last=Rushton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in 2013-14==
According to a report in ''The Guardian'', problems emerged in April 2013 during the coverage by [[BBC News]] of the [[death and funeral of Margaret Thatcher]]. News staff, attempting to source material on [[analog recording|analog]] [[videotape]] from the [[BBC Archives]], were unable to [[Digital reformatting|transfer footage to digital format]] due to the huge demand for limited transfer facilities at the newly refurbished [[Broadcasting House#Second phase|New Broadcasting House]] in central London. Requested tapes were reportedly transported around London by taxi and via the [[London Underground|Tube]], and video transfer work was carried out by external production companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC's Thatcher coverage highlights problems with non-digital archives|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/apr/11/bbc-thatcher-coverage|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=11 February 2012|location=London|first=Tara|last=Conlan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later it emerged that tape editing equipment might have to be installed at Broadcasting House in specially cooled areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC's troubled £133m digital video archive delays 'tapeless' future|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/03/bbc-digital-video-archive|accessdate=3 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2013|location=London|first=Tara|last=Conlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late May 2013 the [[Director-General of the BBC]], [[Tony Hall, Baron Hall of Birkenhead|Lord Hall]], announced that the project was to be abandoned and that the BBC's [[chief technology officer]], [[John Linwood (BBC)|John Linwood]], was to be suspended pending an external investigation into the management of the DMI project.&lt;ref name=bbc_abandons /&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcpr-close /&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian_axe&gt;{{cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|title=BBC axes £98m technology project to avoid 'throwing good money after bad'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/24/bbc-technology-project-digital-media-initiative|accessdate=25 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently revealed that a senior BBC manager had expressed grave doubts about DMI to the BBC Chairman [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten]] one year before the project was cancelled. He had also claimed that there was a "very significant risk" that the National Audit Office had been misled about the actual progress of DMI in 2011. Other BBC executives had also voiced similar concerns for about two years before DMI was abandoned.&lt;ref name=guardian-patten&gt;{{cite news|last=Conlan|first=Tara|title=BBC Digital Media Initiative project doomed to failure, Lord Patten was told|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/05/bbc-digital-media-initiative-failure-patten|accessdate=5 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAO commenced an inquiry into the failure of the project and commissioned accountancy firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] to carry out an investigation. At a hearing held on 10 June 2013 at the BBC's [[MediaCityUK]] site in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], MPs [[Margaret Hodge]] and [[Stewart Jackson]] commented on evidence given by the then Director General [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]] to the NAO in 2011 and to the BBC Trust, and took the view that he had misled the enquiry. BBC Trust member [[Anthony Fry (business executive)|Anthony Fry]] remarked that the DMI had been a "complete catastrophe" and said that the project was "probably the most serious, embarrassing thing I have ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halliday|first=Josh|title=BBC accused of misleading parliament over 'catastrophic' digital media project|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/10/bbc-chiefs-accused-misleading-parliament|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Revoir|first=Paul|title=BBC boss 'misled' MPs about £100m IT fiasco: Senior Labour backbencher accuses Mark Thompson of failing to 'tell the truth' |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2339283/BBC-boss-misled-MPs-100m-IT-fiasco-Senior-Labour-backbencher-accuses-Mark-Thompson-failing-tell-truth.html|accessdate=11 June 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 January 2014, the BBC confirmed that the contract of former technology chief John Linwood  had been terminated the  previous July due to the failure of the Digital Media Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25886417 "Former BBC technology boss sacked over failed project"], ‘’BBC’’, 24 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 April 2014, the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts presented the "BBC Digital Media Initiative, Fifty-second Report of Session 2013–14" in which it defines the project as a "complete failure" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/bbc-dmi-report-substantive/ "BBC's Digital Media Initiative a complete failure"], ‘’BBC’’, 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Emerald Buddha.jpg|thumb|230px|Emerald Buddha, in the winter season attire]]
The '''Emerald Buddha''' ({{lang-th|พระแก้วมรกต}} {{transl|th|''Phra Kaeo Morakot''}}, or {{lang|th|พระพุทธมหามณีรัตนปฏิมากร}} {{transl|th|''Phra Phuttha Maha Mani Rattana Patimakon''}}) is considered the [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] of the [[Thailand|Kingdom of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="bicentennial"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt; It is a [[figurine]] of the meditating [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] seated in [[Yoga|yogic]] posture, made of a semi-precious green stone ([[jade]] or [[jasper]] rather than [[emerald]]), clothed in [[gold]],&lt;ref name=gardner&gt;{{cite book |title=Gardner’s Art through the Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rofCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page= 1045 |edition=15th |editor=Fred S Kleiner |isbn=9781285838151 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and about {{convert|26|in|cm|0}} tall.&lt;ref name="bangkok"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangkokforvisitors.com/ratanakosin/grand-palace/emerald-buddha-temple/emerald-buddha-chapel.php |title=Chapel of the Emerald Buddha |work=Bangkok For Visitors }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the ''Temple of the Emerald Buddha'' ([[Wat Phra Kaew]]) on the grounds of the [[Grand Palace, Bangkok|Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]].&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;

==History==
[[File:The Grand Palace (8278415631).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The [[Wat Phra Kaew]] chapel where the Emerald Buddha is now kept in Bangkok]]
Historical sources indicate that the statue surfaced in northern [[Thailand]] in the Lanna kingdom in 1434. One account of its discovery tells that lightning struck a [[Stupa|chedi]] in [[Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai|Wat Pa Yia]] (Bamboo Forest Monastery, later renamed [[Wat Phra Kaew, Chiang Rai|Wat Phra Kaew]]) in [[Chiang Rai]], revealing a Buddha covered with [[stucco]] inside. The Buddha was then placed in the abbot's residence, who later noticed that stucco on the nose had flaked off, revealing a green interior. The abbot removed  the stucco and found a Buddha figure carved from a green semi-precious stone, which became known as ''Phra Kaew Morakot'' or in English the Emerald Buddha. ("Emerald" refers to its "green colour" in Thai, not its composition.)&lt;ref name=SubhadradisDiskul&gt;{{cite book|last=Diskul|first=Subhadradis|title=History of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha|publisher=Bureau of the Royal Household|publication-place=Bangkok|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams2&gt;{{Cite book|last=Williams|first=China|author2=Aaron Anderson |author3=Brett Atkinson |author4=Becca Blond |author5=Tim Bewer |title= Thailand|pages=350–352|accessdate=27 March 2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oc0LoROKM0MC&amp;pg=PA350#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher= Lonely Planet|year=2010|isbn= 9781742203850}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some art historians describe the Emerald Buddha as belonging to the [[Chiang Saen District#History|Chiang Saen Style]] of the 15th century AD, which would mean it is of Thai [[Lanna]] origin.

[[File:Wat Phra Kaeo Chiang Rai.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Wat Phra Kaeo, Chiang Rai|Wat Phra Kaeo]] in Chiang Rai, where the Emerald Buddha was found]]
King Sam Fang Kaen of Lanna wanted it in his capital, [[Chiang Mai]], but the elephant carrying it insisted, on three separate occasions, on going instead to [[Lampang]]. This was taken as a divine sign, and the Emerald Buddha stayed in Lampang in a specially-built temple (now [[Wat Phra Kaeo Don Tao]]) for the next 32 years.  In 1468, it was moved to Chiang Mai by King Tiloka, where it was kept in a niche in a large stupa called [[Wat Chedi Luang|Chedi Luang]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ait.ac.th/wutt/wat.html |title=The History of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha |author= M.C. Subhaddradis Diskul|work= Asian Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emerald Buddha remained in Chiang Mai until 1552, when it was taken to [[Luang Prabang]], then the capital of the [[Laos|Lao]] kingdom of [[Lan Xang]]. Some years earlier, the crown prince of Lan Xang, [[Setthathirath]], had been invited to occupy the vacant throne of Lanna as his mother was the daughter of the king of Chiang Mai who had died without a son.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; However, Prince Setthathirath also became king of Lan Xang when his father, [[Photisarath]], died. He returned home, taking the revered Buddha figure with him.{{cn|date=March 2017}} 
[[File:Ho Phra Keo 0528.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Haw Phra Kaew]] in Vientiane where it was held for 214 years]]

In 1564, King Setthathirath moved it to [[Vientiane]], which he had made his new capital due to Burmese attacks and where the Buddha image was housed in [[Haw Phra Kaew]].&lt;ref name=KarenSchurNarula&gt;{{cite book|last=Narula|first=Karen|title=Voyage of the Emerald Buddha|publisher=Oxford University Press|publication-place=Kuala Lumpur|year=1994|page=88|isbn=978-9-676-53057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Buddha image would stay in Vientiane for the next 214 years.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1779, the Thai General [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|Chao Phraya Chakri]] put down an insurrection, captured Vientiane and took the Emerald Buddha to Siam. It was installed in a shrine close to [[Wat Arun]] in [[Thonburi]], its new capital. Chao Phra Chakri then took over the reins and founded the [[Chakri Dynasty]] of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]. He adopted the title [[Rama I]] and shifted his capital across the Menam Chao Phra river to its present location in Bangkok, and constructed the new [[Grand Palace]] including [[Wat Phra Kaew]] within its compound. Wat Phra Kaew was consecrated in 1784, and the Emerald Buddha was moved with great pomp and pageantry to its current home in the ''[[Ubosoth]]'' of the Wat Phra Kaew temple complex on 22 March 1784.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;

==Legends==
[[File:EmeraldBuddha-Thailand-PeterMaas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|View of the Emerald Buddha in rainy season attire on its pedestal]]
The legend of the Emerald Buddha is related in number of sources such as ''[[Jinakalamali]]'', ''Amarakatabuddharupanidana'', and in particular ''Ratanabimbavamsa'' or ''The Chronicle of the Emerald Buddha'' written in Pali by Brahmarājapañña in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNnsCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;lpg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Buddhist Studies in Honour of I.B.

Nagasena alledegly had the help of Hindu god [[Vishnu]] and the demigod [[Indra]], 500 years after Buddha attained [[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]]. He was said to have predicted:&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
This figure of the Buddha is assuredly going to give to religion the most brilliant importance in five lands, that is in Lankadvipa ([[Sri Lanka]]), Ramalakka, [[Dvaravati]], [[Chieng Mai]] and [[Lan Xang|Lan Chang]] ([[Laos]]).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
The legends state that after remaining in Pataliputra for three hundred years, it was taken to [[Sri Lanka]] to save it from a civil war. A version of the legend stated that in 457, King Anuruth of [[Burma]] sent a mission to Ceylon to ask for [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist scriptures]] and the Emerald Buddha, in order to support [[Buddhism]] in his country. These requests were granted, but the ship lost its way in a storm during the return voyage and landed in [[Cambodia]]. When the Thais captured [[Angkor Wat]] in 1432 (following the ravage of the bubonic plague), the Emerald Buddha was taken to [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Kamphaeng Phet]], Laos and finally [[Chiang Rai]], where the ruler of the city hid it until it was found in 1434.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric|last=Roeder|title=The Origin and Significance of the Emerald Buddha|journal=Explorations in Southeast Asian Studies|volume=3|publisher=Center for Southeast Asian Studies, University of Hawai'i at Manoa|publication-place=Honolulu|year=1999|pages=1, 18|url=https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/2542/The%20Origin%20and%20Significance%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Buddha.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The image==

The Buddha image is made of a semi-precious green stone,&lt;ref name="bicentennial"/&gt; described variously as jade or jasper rather than emerald,&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brittanica&gt;{{citation|contribution=Emerald Buddha (sculpture)|title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|contribution-url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/185722/Emerald-Buddha|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "emerald" here refers to its colour rather than the stone.&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/thailand/bangkok-wat-phra-kaew-emerald-buddha|title= Wat Phra Kaew, Bangkok|accessdate=27 March 2010|publisher=Sacred Destinations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image has not been analyzed to determine its exact composition or origin.

The figure is {{convert|19|in|cm|0}} wide at the lap, and {{convert|26|in|cm|0}} high.&lt;ref name="bangkok"/&gt; The Buddha is in a seated position, with the right leg resting on the left one, a style that suggest it might have been carved in the late Chiangsaen or Chiangmai school, not much earlier than the fifteenth century A.D.  However, the meditation pose of the statue was not popular in Thailand but looks very much like some of the Buddha images of Southern India and Sri Lanka, which led some to suggest an origin in India or Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Seasonal attire==

[[Image:Emerald buddha2.jpg|thumb|150px|Closeup of Emerald Buddha in summer season attire]]
The Emerald Buddha is adorned with three different sets of gold seasonal costume; two were made by Rama I, one for the summer and one for the rainy season, and a third made by Rama III for the winter or cool season.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;  The clothes are changed by the [[King of Thailand]], or another member of the royal family in his stead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thaibuddhist.com/cool-season-robes-for-the-emerald-buddha/ |title=Cool Season Robes for the Emerald Buddha|date= 19 November 2013 |author= Richard Barrow |work=Buddhism in Thailand }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a ceremony at the changing of the seasons – in the 1st Waning of [[lunar month]]s 4, 8 and 12 (around March, August and November).&lt;ref name="nam"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQkHTnTfup8C&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Moon Thailand|author= Suzanne Nam |page=31 |publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing|edition= 5th |date = 7 February 2012 |asin=B007HMCIS6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the three seasons, the three set of costumes for the Emerald Buddha:&lt;ref name="bicentennial"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sights of Rattanakosin |publisher=Committee for the Rattanakosin Bicentennial Celebration |editor=Pasit Charoenwong|year=1982 |isbn=978-9747919615 |pages=85–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nam"/&gt;
* Hot/summer season – a stepped, pointed headpiece; a breast pendant; a sash; a number of armlets, bracelets and other items of royal attire. All items are made of enameled gold and embedded with precious and semi-precious stones.
* Rainy season – a pointed headpiece of enameled gold studded with sapphires; a gold-embossed monk's robe draped over one shoulder.
* Cool/winter season – a gold headpiece studded with diamonds; a jewel-fringed gold-mesh shawl draped over the rainy season attire.

The sets of gold clothing not in use at any given time are kept on display in the nearby Pavilion of Regalia, Royal Decorations and Thai Coins on the grounds of the Grand Palace, where the public may view them.

==Ceremonies==

Early in the Bangkok period, the Emerald Buddha used to be taken out of its temple and paraded in the streets to relieve the city and countryside of various calamities (such as [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and [[cholera]]). However, this practice was discontinued during [[Rama IV]]'s reign as it was feared that the image could get damaged during the procession and also a practical line of thinking that Rama IV, a former monk, held: "Diseases are caused by germs, not by evil spirits or the displeasure of the Buddha".&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;

The image also marks the changing of the seasons in Thailand, with the king presiding over the seasonal ceremonies. It is a significant ritual held at this temple three times a year, whereby the dress of the deity is changed at the start of each of the three seasons.  The astrological dates for the ritual ceremonies, at the changing of the seasons, followed are in the 1st [[Waning Moon]] of [[Lunar calender|Lunar Months]] 4, 8 and 12 (around March, July and November). Rama I initiated this ritual for the hot season and the rainy season, Rama III introduced the ritual for the winter season.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sacred/&gt; The robes, which adorn the image, represent those of monks and the King, depending on the season, a clear indication of highlighting its symbolic role "as Buddha and the King", which role is also enjoined on the Thai King who formally dresses the Emerald Buddha image.&lt;ref name=gardner /&gt; The costume change ritual is performed by the Thai king who is the highest master of ceremonies for all [[Buddhist rite]]s.  During the ceremony, the king first climbs up to the pedestal, cleans the image by wiping away any dust, and changes the gold headdress of the Emerald Buddha.  The king then worships nearby while an attendant performs the elaborate ritual of changing garments.&lt;ref name="nam" /&gt;  The king also sprays holy water upon his subjects waiting outside the ordination hall, a privilege previously afforded only to the princes and officials who were attending the ceremony inside the ubosoth.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Ceremonies are also performed at the Emerald Buddha temple at other occasions such as the [[Chakri Day]] (begun on 6 April 1782), a national holiday to honour founding of the Chakri dynasty. The King and Queen, entourage of the royal family as well as the Prime Minister, officials in the Ministry of Defence, and other government departments, offer prayers at the temple.&lt;ref name=EricRoeder/&gt;

'''Emotional geography'''  is a subtopic within [[human geography]], dealing with the relationships between [[emotion]]s and [[Location (geography)|geographic place]]s and their contextual environments.

Emotional geography specifically focuses on how human emotions relate to, or affect, the [[Social environment|environment]] around them.&lt;ref name=HumGeo&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Derek |title=The Dictionary of Human Geography |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1-4443-5995-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Enzyme Function Initiative''' ('''EFI''') is a large-scale collaborative project aiming to develop and disseminate a robust strategy to determine [[enzyme]] function through an integrated sequence–structure-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=New NIGMS ‘Glue Grant’ Takes Aim at Unknown Enzymes |publisher=NIGMS |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Results/gluegrant_051510.htm |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427131544/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/News/Results/gluegrant_051510.htm |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was funded in May 2010 by the [[National Institute of General Medical Sciences]] as a Glue Grant which supports the research of complex biological problems that cannot be solved by a single research group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/ |title=Glue Grants |accessdate=2012-04-27 |work= |publisher=NIGMS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603062033/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/ |archivedate=2013-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAR-07-412&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-07-412.html|title=PAR-07-412: Large-Scale Collaborative Project Awards (R24/U54) |accessdate=2012-04-27 |work= |publisher=NIH/NIGMS }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EFI was largely spurred by the need to develop methods to identify the functions of the enormous number proteins discovered through [[Genomics|genomic]] sequencing projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Researchers Awarded $33.9 Million Grant to Study Enzyme Functions |publisher=UIUC News Bureau |date=2010-05-20 |url=http://news.illinois.edu/news/10/0520gerlt.html |accessdate=2012-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivation ==
The dramatic increase in genome sequencing technology has caused the number of [[Peptide sequence|protein sequences]] deposited into public databases to grow apparently exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/TrEMBLstats/ |accessdate=2012-04-27 |title=UniProtKB/TrEMBL Protein Database Release Statistics |work= |publisher=UniProtKB/TrEMBL Protein Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To cope with the influx of sequences, databases use computational predictions to auto-annotate individual protein's functions.  While these computational methods offer the advantages of being extremely high-throughput and generally provide accurate broad classifications, exclusive use has led to a significant level of misannotation of enzyme function in protein databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000605 |title=Annotation Error in Public Databases: Misannotation of Molecular Function in Enzyme Superfamilies |year=2009 |editor1-last=Valencia |editor1-first=Alfonso |last1=Schnoes |first1=Alexandra M. |last2=Brown |first2=Shoshana D. |last3=Dodevski |first3=Igor |last4=Babbitt |first4=Patricia C. |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=e1000605 |pmid=20011109 |pmc=2781113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus although the information now available represents an unprecedented opportunity to understand cellular metabolism across a wide variety of organisms, which includes the ability to identify molecules and/or reactions that may benefit human quality of life, the potential has not been fully actualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=130–42 |doi=10.1038/nchembio0805-130 |title=Assignment of protein function in the postgenomic era |year=2005 |last1=Saghatelian |first1=Alan |last2=Cravatt |first2=Benjamin F |journal=Nature Chemical Biology |volume=1 |issue=3 |pmid=16408016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological community's ability to characterize newly discovered proteins has been outstripped by the rate of genome sequencing, and the task of assigning function is now considered the rate-limiting step in understanding biological systems in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/gb-2006-7-1-r8 |year=2006 |last1=Brown |first1=Shoshana |last2=Gerlt |first2=John |last3=Seffernick |first3=Jennifer |last4=Babbitt |first4=Patricia |journal=Genome Biology |volume=7 |pages=R8 |pmid=16507141 |title=A gold standard set of mechanistically diverse enzyme superfamilies |issue=1 |pmc=1431709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integrated strategy for functional assignment ==
The EFI is developing an integrated sequence-structure based strategy for functional assignment by predicting the [[Substrate specificity|substrate specificities]] of unknown members of mechanistically diverse [[Protein family|enzyme superfamilies]].&lt;ref name=EFIBIOCHEM&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gerlt JA, Allen KN, Almo SC, Armstrong RN, Babbitt PC, Cronan JE, Dunaway-Mariano D, Imker HJ, Jacobson MP, Minor W, Poulter CD, Raushel FM, Sali A, Shoichet BK, Sweedler JV|title=The Enzyme Function Initiative.|journal=Biochemistry|date=Nov 22, 2011|volume=50|issue=46|pages=9950–62|pmid=21999478|doi=10.1021/bi201312u|pmc=3238057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach leverages conserved features within a given superfamily such as known chemistry, identity of [[active site]] functional groups, and composition of specificity-determining residues, motifs, or structures to predict function but relies on multidisciplinary expertise to streamline, refine, and test the predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=486–91 |doi=10.1038/nchembio.2007.11 |title=Prediction and assignment of function for a divergent N-succinyl amino acid racemase |year=2007 |last1=Song |first1=Ling |last2=Kalyanaraman |first2=Chakrapani |last3=Fedorov |first3=Alexander A |last4=Fedorov |first4=Elena V |last5=Glasner |first5=Margaret E |last6=Brown |first6=Shoshana |last7=Imker |first7=Heidi J |last8=Babbitt |first8=Patricia C |last9=Almo |first9=Steven C |journal=Nature Chemical Biology |volume=3 |issue=8 |pmid=17603539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05981 |title=Structure-based activity prediction for an enzyme of unknown function |year=2007 |last1=Hermann |first1=Johannes C. |last2=Marti-Arbona |first2=Ricardo |last3=Fedorov |first3=Alexander A. |last4=Fedorov |first4=Elena |last5=Almo |first5=Steven C. |last6=Shoichet |first6=Brian K. |last7=Raushel |first7=Frank M. |journal=Nature |volume=448 |issue=7155 |pages=775–779 |pmid=17603473 |pmc=2254328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1668–77 |doi=10.1016/j.str.2008.08.015 |title=Discovery of a Dipeptide Epimerase Enzymatic Function Guided by Homology Modeling and Virtual Screening |year=2008 |last1=Kalyanaraman |first1=C |last2=Imker |first2=H |last3=Fedorov |first3=A |last4=Fedorov |first4=E |last5=Glasner |first5=M |last6=Babbitt |first6=P |last7=Almo |first7=S |last8=Gerlt |first8=J |last9=Jacobson |first9=M |journal=Structure |volume=16 |issue=11 |pmid=19000819 |pmc=2714228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integrated sequence-strategy under development will be generally applicable to deciphering the ligand specificities of any functionally unknown protein.&lt;ref name="EFIBIOCHEM"/&gt;

== Organization ==
By NIGMS program mandate, Glue Grant consortia must contain core resources and bridging projects.&lt;ref name=PAR-07-412/&gt; The EFI consists of six scientific cores which provide bioinformatic, structural, computational, and data management expertise to facilitate functional predictions for enzymes of unknown function targeted by the EFI. At the beginning of the grant, these predictions were tested by five Bridging Projects representing the amidohydrolase, enolase, GST, HAD, and isoprenoid synthase enzyme superfamilies. Three Bridging Projects now remain.&lt;ref name="EFIBIOCHEM"/&gt; In addition, the Anaerobic Enzymology Pilot Project was added in 2014 to explore the Radical SAM superfamily and Glycyl Radical Enzyme superfamily.

=== Scientific cores ===

The bioinformatics core contributes [[bioinformatic]] analysis by collecting and curating complete sequence data sets, generating sequence similarity networks, and classification of superfamily members into subgroups and families for subsequent annotation transfer and evaluation as targets for functional characterization.

The protein core develops cloning, expression, and [[protein purification]] strategies for the enzymes targeted for study.

The structure core fulfills the [[structural biology]] component for EFI by providing high resolution structures of targeted enzymes.

The computation core performs ''in silico'' [[Docking (molecular)|docking]] to generate rank-ordered lists of predicted substrates for targeted enzymes using both experimentally determined and/or homology modeled protein structures.

The microbiology core examines ''in vivo'' functions using genetic techniques and [[metabolomics]] to compliment ''[[in vitro]]'' functions determined by the Bridging Projects.

The data and dissemination core maintains a public database for experimental data (EFI-DB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2545–55 |doi=10.1021/bi052101l |title=Leveraging Enzyme Structure−Function Relationships for Functional Inference and Experimental Design:  The Structure−Function Linkage Database† |year=2006 |last1=Pegg |first1=Scott C.-H. |last2=Brown |first2=Shoshana D. |last3=Ojha |first3=Sunil |last4=Seffernick |first4=Jennifer |last5=Meng |first5=Elaine C. |last6=Morris |first6=John H. |last7=Chang |first7=Patricia J. |last8=Huang |first8=Conrad C. |last9=Ferrin |first9=Thomas E. |journal=Biochemistry |volume=45 |issue=8 |pmid=16489747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFI-DB&gt;{{cite web|title=EFI-DB Experimental Database|url=http://kiemlicz.med.virginia.edu/efi/|publisher=Enzyme Function Initiative|accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bridging projects ===
The [[enolase superfamily]] contains evolutionarily related enzymes with a (β/α)7β‑barrel (TIM‑barrel) fold which primarily catalyze metal-assisted epimerization/racemization or β-elimination of carboxylate substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=59–70 |doi=10.1016/j.abb.2004.07.034 |title=Divergent evolution in the enolase superfamily: The interplay of mechanism and specificity |year=2005 |last1=Gerlt |first1=John A. |last2=Babbitt |first2=Patricia C. |last3=Rayment |first3=Ivan |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=433 |pmid=15581566 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haloacid dehydrogenase superfamily]] contains evolutionarily related enzymes with a Rossmanoid α/β fold with an inserted "cap" region which primarily catalyze metal-assisted nucleophilic catalysis, most frequently resulting in phosphoryl group transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1003–34 |doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2006.06.049 |title=Evolutionary Genomics of the HAD Superfamily: Understanding the Structural Adaptations and Catalytic Diversity in a Superfamily of Phosphoesterases and Allied Enzymes |year=2006 |last1=Burroughs |first1=A. Maxwell |last2=Allen |first2=Karen N. |last3=Dunaway-Mariano |first3=Debra |last4=Aravind |first4=L. |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=361 |issue=5 |pmid=16889794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isoprenoid synthase (I) superfamily contains evolutionarily related enzymes with a mostly all α-helical fold and primarily catalyze trans-prenyl transfer reactions to form elongated or cyclized [[isoprene]] products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=3412–42 |doi=10.1021/cr050286w |title=Structural Biology and Chemistry of the Terpenoid Cyclases |year=2006 |last1=Christianson |first1=David W. |journal=Chemical Reviews |volume=106 |issue=8 |pmid=16895335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anaerobic Enzymology bridging project will explore radical-dependent enzymology, which allows the execution of unusual chemical transformations via an iron-sulfur cluster cleaving S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) and producing a radical intermediate, or alternatively, abstraction of a hydrogen from glycine producing a glycyl radical. The superfamilies containing these enzymes are largely unexplored and thus, ripe with the potential for functional discoveries. The acquisition of an anaerobic protein production pipeline coupled with the installation of a Biosafety Level 2 anaerobic chamber for culturing human gut microbes has readied the EFI to pursue anaerobic enzymology.

=== Participating investigators ===
Twelve investigators with expertise in various disciplines make up the EFI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://enzymefunction.org/about/people |title=People |publisher=Enzyme Function Initiative |accessdate=2012-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Deliverables ==
The EFI's primary deliverable is development and dissemination of an integrated sequence/structure strategy for functional assignment.  The EFI now offers access to two high-throughput docking tools, a web tool for comparing protein sequences within entire protein families, and a web tool for composing a genome context inventory based on a protein sequence similarity network. Additionally, as the strategy is developed, data and clones generated by the EFI are made freely available via several online resources.&lt;ref name="EFIBIOCHEM"/&gt;

== Funding ==
The EFI was established in May 2010 with $33.9 million in funding over a five-year period (grant number GM093342).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/OutcomeAssessment |title=NIGMS Glue Grants Outcomes Assessment |accessdate=2012-04-27 |work= |publisher=NIGMS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427104459/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/Collaborative/GlueGrants/OutcomeAssessment/ |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">The '''European Space Information System''' (ESIS) project was initiated in 1988 as a service for homogeneous access to heterogeneous databases on the network. At the time, [[DECNET]], EARN and Bitnet were the main academic links. The project pre-dated the World Wide Web, which immensely pushed technology in 1993 to allow homogeneous access to data.

Initially, the ESIS project was to link databases of the [[European Space Agency]] together with centres of excellence that included the [[Centre de Données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] and its [[SIMBAD]] service, the [[European Southern Observatory]] and the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre (CADC), as well as the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] for Space Physics data &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/m11524u2g46307u6/ The European Space Information System (ESIS) P. Giommi, S.G. Ansari, P. Donzelli, A. Micol, 1995, Experimental Astronomy Vol. 6 No. 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outcome of the project yielded a set of applications to browse catalogues, access images, spectra and lightcurves, as well as access to bibliographic information. The main astronomical missions that influenced ESIS at the time were the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[EXOSAT]] and [[International Ultraviolet Explorer|IUE]], while Space Physics was mainly focused on the [[Cluster mission]]. 

Having been a pioneer project in its days, many of the original concepts used then (such as catalogue browsing, searching in an area of the sky) were later embedded in other astronomical data services worldwide. ESIS provided the building blocks and the prototypes to what is today being implemented in the Virtual Observatory projects, such as the [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].

The greatest success of ESIS was the transfer of its Catalogue Browser to the CDS, which later became better known as the [[VizieR]] Catalogue Service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet86/ansa86.htm Transfer of ESIS to scientific institutes S.G. Ansari, P. Donzelli, E. Simonsen, F. Ochsenbein, 1996, ESA Bull., No. 86, p. 43 - 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic background==
[[File:Bhaktisiddhanta.jpg|thumb|alt=A man in his 50s sitting with a pen in hand and pensively looking forward|[[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]] (1874-1937), the subject of Sardella's monograph.]]
Ferdinando Sardella studied at the [[University of Gothenburg]], and graduated with [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] and [[Bachelor of Theology|B.Th.]] degrees. Following his [[Master of Arts|MA]] in theology with the history of religions as his major subject,&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella|url=http://www.ochs.org.uk/people/ferdinando-sardella|work=The Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Uppsala&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella|url=https://uppsala.academia.edu/FerdinandoSardella|work=Academia.edu|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sardella obtained a [[Ph.D.]] degree in 2010 at his alma mater on [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati]], a prominent [[Bengali people|Bengali]] proponent of the ''bhakti'' tradition of [[Gaudiya Vaisnavism]] in the 20th century and founder of a movement called the [[Gaudiya Math]].&lt;ref name=Gothenburg&gt;{{cite web|title=Ferdinando Sardella, Senior lecturer, History of Religions|url=http://lir.gu.se/english/staff/teachers-and-researchers/ferdinando-sardella/|work=University of Gothenburg|accessdate=16 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201224359/http://lir.gu.se/english/staff/teachers-and-researchers/ferdinando-sardella/|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploring the Gaudiya Vaisnava bhakti school along with its philosophy and practice as taught by Bhaktisiddhanta, Sardella showed it to be a personalistic current that challenged the predominantly [[monism|monistic]] perception of Hinduism in the West. Hitherto relatively unknown, this strand of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] ''bhakti'' later on gained global spread in the form of the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]], or the [[Hare Krishna movement]], inspired by Bhaktisiddhanta's teachings.&lt;ref name=Gothenburg/&gt; In 2010 the [[Donner Institute]], attached to [[Abo Akademi University]], gave Sardella's dissertation their first newly established award  for "outstanding research into religion".&lt;ref name=Gothenburg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Donner institute|url=http://www.abo.fi/forskning/donnerska_institutet|work=Åbo Akademi University|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboAward"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abo.fi/forskning/di_priset|title = The DI Prize for Outstanding Research into Religion|accessdate = 19 January 2014|website = Abo Akademi University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the dissertation was published by [[Oxford University Press]] as a monograph that  [[Gavin Flood]] in his review called "a significant contribution to scholarship not only of the modern Gaudiya Vaisnava movement but also of the religious history of Bengal within the last half of the colonial period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flood|first=Gavin|title=Modern Hindu Personalism  The History, Life, and Thought of Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati|url=http://global.oup.com/academic/product/modern-hindu-personalism-9780199865901?cc=se&amp;lang=en&amp;tab=reviews|work=Oxford University Press, USA|accessdate=20 January 2014|authorlink=Gavin Flood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hankycode.jpg|thumb|An assortment of handkerchiefs]]
{{LGBT symbols}}

The '''handkerchief code''' (also known as the '''hanky code''', the '''bandana code''', and '''flagging'''&lt;ref name=Andrews2010 &gt;{{cite book | last=Andrews | first=Vincent | year=2010 | title=The Leatherboy Handbook | publisher=The Nazca Plains Corp. | isbn=978-1-61098-046-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Color coding|color-coded system]], employed usually among the [[gay]] male [[casual sex|casual-sex]] seekers or [[BDSM]] practitioners in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, to indicate preferred [[sexual fetish]]es, what kind of sex they are seeking, and whether they are a [[top (sex)|top]]/[[dominance and submission|dominant]] or [[bottom (sex)|bottom]]/submissive.

Wearing a handkerchief on the left side of the body typically indicates one is a "top" (one considered active in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief), while wearing it on the right side of the body would indicate one is a "bottom" (one considered passive in the practice of the fetish indicated by the color of the handkerchief).  The hanky code was widely used in the 1970s by gay and [[bisexual]] men.

==Origin==
[[File:Handkerchief code.jpg|thumb|Hanky code]]

The wearing of various colored bandanas around the neck was common in the mid- and late-nineteenth century among [[cowboy]]s, [[Railroad engineer|steam railroad engineer]]s, and [[miner]]s in the [[Western United States]]. It is thought that the wearing of [[Kerchief|bandanas]] by gay men originated in [[San Francisco]] after the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], when, because of a shortage of women, men dancing with each other in [[square dance]]s developed a code wherein the man wearing the blue bandana took the male part in the square dance, and the man wearing the red bandana took the female part (these bandanas were usually worn around the arm or hanging from the belt or in the back pocket of one's [[jeans]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} . It is thought that the modern hanky code started in New York City in late 1970 or early 1971 when a journalist for the ''[[Village Voice]]'' joked that instead of simply wearing keys to indicate whether someone was a "top" or a "bottom", it would be more efficient to subtly announce their particular sexual focus by wearing different colored hankies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Susan |last1= Stryker |authorlink= Susan Stryker |first2= Jim |last2= Van Buskirk |title= Gay by the Bay: A History of Queer Culture in the San Francisco Bay Area |location= San Francisco |publisher= [[Chronicle Books]] |year= 1996 |page= 18 |isbn= 0-8118-1187-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources attribute the expansion of the original red–blue system into today’s code to marketing efforts around 1971 by the San Francisco [[department store]] for erotic merchandise, The Trading Post, promoting handkerchiefs by printing cards listing the meanings of various colors.&lt;ref name="gay-semiotics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fischer |first=Hal |date=1977 |title=Gay Semiotics ♂ |url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/HalPages/GaySempg2.html |location=San Francisco |publisher=NFS Press |isbn=0-917986-03-2|quote=In San Francisco, the signs began appearing around 1971. The Trading Post, a department store specializing in erotic merchandise, began promoting handkerchiefs in the store and printing cards with their meanings. The red and blue handkerchiefs and their significance were already in existence, and meanings were assigned to other colors as well. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alan Selby, founder of Mr. S Leather in San Francisco, claimed that he created the first hanky code with his business partners at Leather 'n' Things in 1972, when their bandana supplier inadvertently doubled their order and the expanded code would help them sell the extra colors they had received.&lt;ref name="selby"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Jordy|date=2017|title=The Mayor of Folsom Street, The Auto/Biography of "Daddy Alan" Selby aka Mr. S|publisher=Fair Page Media LLC|isbn=978-0-9989098-0-6|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

This table is drawn from [[Larry Townsend]]'s ''The Leatherman's Handbook II'' (the 1983 second edition; the 1972 first edition did not include this list) and is generally considered authoritative. Implicit in this list is the concept of left/right polarity, left as usual indicating the top, dominant, or active partner; right the bottom, submissive, or passive partner.  Negotiation with a prospective partner remains important because, as Townsend noted, people may wear hankies of any color "only because the idea of the hankie turns them on" or "may not even know what it means".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=Larry|title=The Leatherman's Handbook II |year=1983 |publisher=Modernismo Publications |location=New York |isbn=0-89237-010-6 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer lists found on the web are more elaborate and the many color codes in them are less often used in practice, although some of these colors are offered for sale at LGBT stores along with free cards listing their meanings.

[[File:Kagal book.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|right|''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) by Jacob Brafman, in the Russian language original.]]
'''Iakov Aleksandrovich Brafman''' (1825—28 December 1879), commonly known as '''Jacob Brafman''', was a [[Russian Jew]] from near [[Minsk]], who became notable for converting first to [[Lutheranism]] and then the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He was a leading polemicist against the [[qahal|kahal]] (the communal Jewish theocratic government in Russia) and the [[Talmud]]. Brafman's works ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868) and ''The Book of the Kahal'' (1869) were foundational texts in establishing a theoretical basis to modern [[anti-Jewish]] thought in Russia and established a framework for themes later covered in ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]''.
==Background==
Brafman was born in 1825 and lived in [[Kletsk]], a ''[[shtetl]]'' near [[Minsk]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]]. His father was a [[rabbi]]. The Jews had lived in the town since the 16th century, when it was part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but had in Brafman's fathers lifetime become part of the [[Russian Empire]] following the [[Second Partition of Poland]]. Brafman grew up in poor conditions and was orphaned at a young age, being raised by relatives. Despite being under age, local agents of the ''[[qahal|kahal]]'' (the communal Jewish government ran by rabbis in the Pale, which dealt with taxation and conscription), placed Brafman on a list of "volunteers" for the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. Not being particularly fond of this idea, Brafman fled the reach of the kahal and went to Minsk, where he tried to establish himself as a [[photographer]].

Once in Minsk, Brafman converted to [[Lutheranism]] for a time, before in 1858 converting to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. There was a state visit to Minsk in that year by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] and Brafman submitted a memorandum on how Jews in Russia should best be proselytized into Orthodox Christianity and educated into "useful" subjects. The dichtomy of useful and usless Jews had been established by Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]]. Nicholas saw "use" in bourgeois Jews who were willing to assimilate into Russian society and could be utilised in academic and agricultural professions, while seeing as "useless" the poorer adherents of [[Orthodox Judaism]] who lived in the ''shtets'' and kept themselves apart from wider society. Brafman's writing was sent to [[St. Petersburg]] and subsequently earned him the chair of [[Hebrew]] Studies at the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Minsk in 1860.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Brafman_Iakov_Aleksandrovich|publisher=YIVO Encyclopedia|title=Brafman, Iakov Aleksandrovich|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brafman vs. the Kahal==
Brafman moved to [[Vilna]] in 1866 and began writing vehemently against the ''kahal'' and Jewish organisations more generally. Brafman; who had his own personal conflict with the ''kahal'' as a young man; argued that the kahal existed as a tyranny against individual Jews, while also being a system which enabled the exploitation of their non-Jewish neighbours.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} He argued that the mentality of the ''kahal'' was the main barrier to [[Jewish assimilation]]. Brafman worked on studying Jewish community books of the ''kahal'' from Minsk from the years 1794 and 1833, with his own commentary added to try and prove his thesis; at the same time the Rabbinical Seminary of Vilna was providing their own Russian translation. Brafman published his findings as ''The Book of the Kahal: Materials for the Study of the Jewish Life'' (1869). Brafman joined the [[Imperial Russian Geographical Society]] in 1870 and became a respected figure in academia.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

One of the main problems with Brafman's thesis was that the ''kahal'' system itself in the Russian Empire had been dissolved under Nicholas I in 1844.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; For Brafman he posited a [[conspiracy theory]] that the ''kahal'' in fact continued to exist as a secret [[State within a state|shadow government]] among Jews, with reactionary rabbis working to keep control over the "average Jew" and to undermine Christian business interests at the same time. Brafman's works chimed well with the [[Slavophiles]] then active in Russia and the political theory of ''[[Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality]]'', which sought to distance Russian civilisation from French and British [[liberalism]]. Brafman's other major work, ''The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods'' (1868), took aim at international Jewish organisations, particularly those based in [[France]]. His main object for criticism was the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' under prominent [[freemason]], [[Adolphe Crémieux]].{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} For Brafman this was the "kahal of kahals" and as part of an [[international Jewish conspiracy]] controlled the other ''kahals''.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}} He saw this as the successor of the [[Grand Sanhedrin]] ([[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s Rabbinic Assembly of 1807).&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

==Influence==
Brafman also took aim at the [[Talmud]], claiming that the Jews, using Talmudic principles, would exclude adherents of other religions from trade and industry and themselves accumulate all capital and landed property.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}}&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt; Brafman's works, which included the idea of a secret Jewish shadow government and the aspects of an internationally orchestrated "conspiracy" against all Christian nations, crossing over with masonic involvement, provided an essential framework for what would become, ''[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]'', authored by agents of the [[Okhrana]] at the turn of the 20th century.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=60}}

Brafman was particularly well received by [[conservative]] Slavophiles in Russia. [[Vsevolod Krestovskii]], one of the most widely read Russian writers of the day, was inspired by Brafman to write a trilogy of novels; ''The Darkness of Egypt'', ''Tamara Bendavid'' and ''The Triumph of Baal''.{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=61}} For Krestovskii, the "kahal of kahals" in Paris, with a network of Jewish spies was used to back up British-French militarism against Russia, causing defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] of the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] (British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] in particular is singled out as an "arch-villain").{{sfn|Webman|2012|p=61}}

[[Hal Draper]], an American Trotskyist, in his book ''Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution'' claimed that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]; one of the Russian founding figures of [[anarchism]]; was likely inspired by Brafman's writings on Jews.{{sfn|Draper|1989|p=296}} In the case of Bakunin, in a letter written in December 1871, he made the claim that Jews were a "collective parasite", and claimed that "this world is presently, at the disposal of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] on the one hand and the [[Rothschilds]] on the other," putting a conspiratorial spin on this theme as part of his rivalry with the Marxian socialists in the [[First International]].{{sfn|Draper|1989|p=296}}

'''The Jewish People Policy Institute''' ('''JPPI'''; {{lang-he|המכון למדיניות העם היהודי}}; formerly: '''The Jewish People Policy Planning (JPPPI)'''), is a [[Non-profit organization]] with the purpose of promoting and securing the [[Jew|Jewish people]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish People Policy Institute|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/jewish_people_policy_institute|publisher=NY-The Jewish Week|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is a professional policy planning apparatus and a strategic thought process for the Jewish people in the most fundamental subjects concerning the Jewish people. The institute is served by most prominent public figures from the government, academia, the private sector in Israel and Jewish communities around the world, who constitute the [[think tank]] of this body.

The JPPI's viewpoint is all-Jewish and long term, and a cornerstone of its work is the premise that Israel is the core of the Jewish people. Its think tank systematically and professionally examines the challenges, threats and opportunities that the Jewish people are coping with, and develops principles for policies and strategic alternatives. In addition, it may recommend on immediate steps needed to be taken in order to secure the continuity and prosperity of the Jewish people.

JPPI was founded in 2002 by the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], and is run as an independent body. It is headed by a board of directors that is now chaired by [[Dennis Ross]], the special advisor for the Persian Gulf Southwest Asia in U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration. Its current President is Avinoam Bar-Yosef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conference to discuss Jewish world's budget|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4296104,00.html|accessdate=16 November 2013|newspaper=[[Ynet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Johnson State College,''' a small public [[liberal arts college]], founded in 1828 by John Chesamore at [[Johnson, Vermont|Johnson]] in the U.S. state of [[Vermont]], is now the Johnson campus of Northern Vermont University.  Johnson's president is [[Council of Presidents|Elaine C. Collins]] and its board chair is [[M. Jerome Diamond]]. In 2018, it was merged with the former [[Lyndon State College]] to create [[Northern Vermont University]].

== History and governance ==
[[File:William Samuel Johnson (portrait by Gilbert Stuart).jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[William Samuel Johnson]] (1727-1819), American jurist, statesman and educator. Both the college and the town are named for him. Painted by [[Gilbert Stuart]].]]
Both the college, and the town of Johnson are named for [[William Samuel Johnson]] (1727-1819), American jurist, statesman and educator.  The town of Johnson, and a part of neighboring Cambridge, Vermont together once made up the [[King's College Tract]], a land grant chartered by [[King George III]] in 1774 for the eventual expansion of King's College in New York, today's Columbia University.  Following the Declaration of Independence, and the emergence of the [[Vermont Republic]], the town was instead granted to William Samuel Johnson by Vermont's Council of Censors in 1782. Johnson represented Connecticut in the Continental Congress, and argued for Vermont's admission to the federal Union.  He later became president of Columbia University. John Chesamore founded Johnson State College as Johnson Academy, a grammar school instructing students in Greek, Latin, algebra and geometry.  In 1867 the school became a Vermont state "[[normal school]]", a term based on the French ''école normale'' – a school to educate teachers.  Early on Johnson embraced the ideas of learning from experience, and the role of the student in directing some part of their curriculum.  The college was among the first Vermont universities to introduce electives.  Through the early to mid-twentieth century Johnson emerged as a college of the liberal arts and natural sciences.

A commitment to educating the whole student in an interdisciplinary manner, begun in the 1920s and 1930s, set in place a history of bringing visiting poets, playwrights, politicians, and artists to the college.  That tradition continues, bringing filmmakers, political and spiritual leaders, and artists.  Recent visitors to the campus include Japanese and Cuban drummers, New Orleans jazz musicians, and Buddhist monks who installed an environmental art work at Lower Pond.

The original campus was built in the village of Johnson and over time, the college expanded; slowly building higher upon what is now called College Hill, finally settling upon a plateau above the village with a view of Sterling Mountain and the Sterling Mountain Range.  Today the college is a part of the [[Vermont State Colleges]], a consortium of five colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor, and [[Council of Presidents]], each college with its own president and deans.

On July 1, 2018, Johnson State College and [[Lyndon State College]] were merged, creating [[Northern Vermont University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.edu/who-we-are/northern-vermont-university|title=Northern Vermont University - Johnson - Johnson State College|website=www.jsc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Johnson State College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]]. The Badgers are a member of the [[North Atlantic Conference]] (NAC). Men's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track &amp; field, and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. In 2018, women's triathlon was added to the varsity sports roster, representing the only NCAA institution in New England to carry women's triathlon as a varsity sport.

== Philosophy and academic programs ==

=== Education by engagement ===

Johnson emphasizes the self-development of undergraduate students with what the college terms "education by engagement."  The student is engaged not solely on her or his degree program but as an adult citizen with emphasis on their place in, and contribution to, their society, nation, and world.  After a year of interdisciplinary study, students file a Plan of Study during the sophomore year.  This becomes a guiding yet flexible road map for completion of students' degree work.  Degree programs include the natural sciences, business, fine and performing arts, education, mathematics, literature, health sciences, writing and literature, and hospitality and tourism management.  Precepts of Vermont educator-philosopher [[John Dewey]] (1859-1952) inform Johnson's emphasis on students' self evolution with emphasis on "learning by doing" and "learning by teaching."  The college emphasizes the individual's civic contribution to their larger society.

=== Faculty and students ===

The college has a faculty-student ratio of 1:14. Ninety-one percent of the college's faculty hold a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate level terminal degree in their area of instruction.  Nearly 60% of undergraduate students come from Vermont, with approximately 40% coming from other U.S. states and more than a dozen nations.

Graduate programs at Johnson include an M.F.A. in Studio Arts, a Master of Arts in Education, and Master of Arts in Counseling. Parts of these programs can be completed with a low residency requirement. Portions of the  M.F.A. in Studio Arts program includes course work in conjunction with the [[Vermont Studio Center]], located in the village of Johnson.

===The Dibden Center for the Arts===

Named for Arthur J. Dibden, president of Johnson State College 1967-69, Dibden oversaw the expansion and development of the fine and performing arts programs. The center is located on the southwest side of the campus and houses the college's Dance, Music, and Theater programs as well as gallery exhibition space for the Fine Arts programs. The striking late modernist building, whose sculptural roofline echoes the contours of the Sterling Mountain Range–its backdrop to the south, is the work of architect Robert Burley. Burley apprenticed in the studio of [[Eero Saarinen]]. The large 500-seat Dibden Theater with  a 44' proscenium stage is the centerpiece of the performing arts facilities at the center. Excellent acoustics are achieved by a system of hardwood baffles along the walls and ceilings. Practice and instruction rooms wrap around the theater and the [[Julian Scott]] Memorial Gallery on the front of the center showcases exhibitions of fine art and design by the college's fine art students as well as travelling exhibitions and the work of visiting artists. The Dibden Center for the Arts houses the faculties of the Department of Music and the Department of Theater, a recording studio, music studios, practice rooms, classrooms and a piano laboratory. Recitals and concerts, theater and contemporary dance performances, and open rehearsals bring performing arts into the daily life of the college. The [[Vermont Symphony Orchestra]] performs regularly at the center. Several performing arts series available to the college community, are also available to the public by subscription. The Dibden Center is an important fine and performing arts venue for all of Vermont. One of the best aspects of Dibden is the fact that it is fully student run, both working Front of House and backstage, so there is always learning and working opportunity for students that seek work opportunities and those who would like to learn more about the theater.

[[File:Johnson State College Library and Learning Center.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The new Library and Learning Center in the main quadrangle's northwest corner. The LLC building, is home to the Department of Humanities, and the Department of Writing and Literature.]]

===Library and Learning Center===

Johnson's Library and Learning Center (LLC) opened in 1996 and incorporates the collections of the older John Dewey Library with expanded collections and new technology. The print collection includes 130,000+ volumes and over 700 journals and periodicals. The LLC houses the largest collections of fine arts publications in Vermont and is a designated [[National Archives and Records Administration]] repository. The contemporary, [[green design]] building makes use of passive and active solar heating. Its south-southwest orintetation for reading rooms utilizes natural light. The LLC is built of terra cotta brick, Vermont gray granite, Vermont blue-gray slate, steel, and green-tinted glass. The LLC was designed by the architectural firm of Gossens Bachman Architects and has won numerous awards for its architecture and environmental efficiency. Awards include the 1997 [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) Vermont "Excellence in Architecture Award." The LLC also houses the faculties of the Department of Humanities, and the Department of Writing and Literature. A skybrige links the LLC with Wilson Bentley Hall. The LLC has become a community centerpiece and serves as a gateway to the northwest side of the quadrangle. An informal outdoor amphitheater facing the quadrangle has become a popular outdoor social area in warmer weather.

===John Dewey Hall ===

John Dewey Hall on the south side of the quadrangle was built in 1963 in the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] to house the college's library. It is named for the philosopher and educator [[John Dewey]]. The building is lit by natural light from a  panoramic glass clerestory around the perimeter of the building. Today the building houses the college bookstore, the office of the Dean of Students, the Student Association, the Registration and Advising Center, TRIO, academic advising, and career &amp; internship offices.

===Visual Arts Center===

Johnson's Visual Arts Center (VAC) houses the college's Visual Arts Programs, which was renovated in 2012, with studios for design, drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, sculpture, ceramics and woodworking. The Digital Imaging Laboratory (DIL) is also located here with state-of-the-art oversized high-resolution laser CMYK and [[Inkjet printer]]s. The VAC augments exhibition space at the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery in the Dibden Center with a gallery for exhibiting works in progress and student projects. Exhibitions play a major role in both academic and student life at Johnson. Students have opportunities to show their work beginning in their freshman year. Exhibition programs support and expand the studio curriculum, providing students with frequent opportunities to share their work and receive input; and, by exhibiting faculty and visiting artists' work, providing insights into teachers’ approaches to making art and critique. Exhibitions in many mediums both of work produced within the college, and by work exhibited by visiting artists exposes students to a wide range of contemporary thinking and art-making methods. Fine arts majors in the freshman and sophomore levels most commonly exhibit work in the VAC. Students in their junior and senior years, especially those presenting thesis level work exhibit in the Julian Scott Memorial Gallery at the Dibden Center for the Arts.

[[File:Bentley Science Building, Johnson State College (Johnson, VT - September 2004).jpg|300px|right|thumb|Bentley Hall with the Sterling Mountain Range in the background.]]

===Wilson Bentley Science Hall===

Named for the scientist-artist, [[Wilson Bentley]] (1865–1931) who first photographed snowflakes in the nineteenth century in nearby Jericho, Vermont. Bentley brought an objective scientific eye to the examination of snow and ice crystals via hugely magnified images called photomicrographs. Bentley published a monograph titled ''Snow Crystals'' which documented more than 2000 snowflakes and ice crystals. Wilson Bentley Hall, designed by noted architect Robert Burley, houses the faculties of the Department of Mathematics, and the Department of Environmental and Health Sciences. A 200-seat lecture hall with digital projection facilities, an interactive television studio, and laboratories for biology, chemistry, physical sciences, cartography, and geographic information systems. Bentley Hall also houses a state-of-the-art interactive multimedia computer laboratory and is a designated [[National Science Foundation]] research facility.

The [[Babcock Nature Preserve]], located ten miles from Johnson in Eden, Vermont is a 1,000 acre (4&amp;nbsp;km²) tract of forest land owned and maintained by the college for scientific and educational study. A large, environmentally significant bog, and three large ponds dominate the physical landscape. The Babcock Nature Preserve is a natural laboratory for field biology, ornithology and environmental sciences courses. The summer field program at the Babcock Nature Preserve features a number of intensive courses designed to provide field experience in the environmental and natural sciences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16621">In [[computer science]], a '''loop invariant''' is a property of a [[Computer program|program]] [[Control flow#Loops|loop]] that is true before (and after) each iteration. It is a [[logical assertion]], sometimes checked within the code by an [[Assertion (software development)|assertion]] call. Knowing its invariant(s) is essential in understanding the effect of a loop.

In [[formal verification|formal program verification]], particularly the [[Hoare logic|Floyd-Hoare approach]], loop invariants are expressed by formal [[predicate logic]] and used to prove properties of loops and by extension [[algorithm]]s that employ loops (usually [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]] properties).
The loop invariants will be true on entry into a loop and following each iteration, so that on exit from the loop both the loop invariants and the loop termination condition can be guaranteed.

From a programming methodology viewpoint, the loop invariant can be viewed as a more abstract specification of the loop, which characterizes the deeper purpose of the loop beyond the details of this implementation. A survey article &lt;ref&gt;Carlo A. Furia, [Bertrand Meyer] and Sergey Velder. "Loop invariants: analysis, classification, and examples."ACM Computing Surveys.  vol. 46, no. 3, February 2014([http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/methodology/invariants.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; covers fundamental algorithms from many areas of computer science (searching, sorting, optimization, arithmetic etc.), characterizing each of them from the viewpoint of its invariant.

Because of the similarity of loops and [[recursion|recursive]] programs, proving partial correctness of loops with invariants is very similar to proving correctness of recursive programs via [[structural induction|induction]].  In fact, the loop invariant is often the same as the inductive hypothesis to be proved for a recursive program equivalent to a given loop.

[[Loop-invariant code motion]], which involves moving code out of the loop if that does not change the effect of the program, is not directly related to loop invariants, which are properties of the loop overall.



==Informal example==
The following [[C (programming language)|C]] [[subroutine]] &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; returns the maximum value in its argument array &lt;code&gt;a[]&lt;/code&gt;, provided its length &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is at least 1.
Comments are provided at lines 3, 6, 9, 11, and 13. Each comment makes an assertion about the values of one or more variables at that stage of the function.
The highlighted assertions within the loop body, at the beginning and end of the loop (lines 6 and 11), are exactly the same. They thus describe an invariant property of the loop.
When line 13 is reached, this invariant still holds, and it is known that the loop condition &lt;code&gt;i!=n&lt;/code&gt; from line 5 has become false. Both properties together imply that &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; equals the maximum value in &lt;code&gt;a[0...n-1]&lt;/code&gt;, that is, that the correct value is returned from line 14.
&lt;!---Usage of (source) tag see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi---&gt;
&lt;source lang="c" line highlight="6,11"&gt;
int max(int n,const int a[]) {
    int m = a[0];
    // m equals the maximum value in a[0...0]
    int i = 1;
    while (i != n) {
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]
        if (m &lt; a[i])
            m = a[i];
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i]
        ++i;
        // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]
    }
    // m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1], and i==n
    return m;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Following a [[defensive programming]] paradigm, the loop condition &lt;code&gt;i!=n&lt;/code&gt; in line 5 should better be modified to &lt;code&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/code&gt;, in order to avoid endless looping for illegitimate negative values of &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;. While this change in code intuitively shouldn't make a difference, the reasoning leading to its correctness becomes somewhat more complicated, since then only &lt;code&gt;i&gt;=n&lt;/code&gt; is known in line 13. In order to obtain that also &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; holds, that condition has to be included into the loop invariant. It is easy to see that &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt;, too, is an invariant of the loop, since &lt;code&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/code&gt; in line 6 can be obtained from the (modified) loop condition in line 5, and hence &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; holds in line 11 after &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; has been incremented in line 10. However, when loop invariants have to be manually provided for formal program verification, such intuitively too obvious properties like &lt;code&gt;i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; are often overlooked.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[partial correctness]] of a [[while loop]] is governed by the following rule of inference:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\{C\land I\}\;\mathrm{body}\;\{I\}} {\{I\}\;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}\;\{\lnot C\land I\}}&lt;/math&gt;

This means:
* If some property &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is preserved by the code &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; —more precisely, if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; holds after the execution of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; whenever both &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; held beforehand— ''(upper line)'' then
* &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are guaranted to be false and true, respectively, after the execution of the whole loop &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt;, provided &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; was true before the loop ''(lower line)''.

In other words: The rule above is a deductive step that has as its premise the [[Hoare triple]] &lt;math&gt;\{C\land I\}\;\mathrm{body}\;\{I\}&lt;/math&gt;.  This triple is actually a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] on machine states.  It holds whenever starting from a state in which the boolean expression &lt;math&gt;C\land I&lt;/math&gt; is true and successfully executing some code called &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt;, the machine ends up in a state in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is true.  If this relation can be proven, the rule then allows us to conclude that successful execution of the program &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{while}\ (C)\ \mathrm{body}&lt;/math&gt; will lead from a state in which &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is true to a state in which &lt;math&gt;\lnot C\land I&lt;/math&gt; holds.  The boolean formula &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; in this rule is known as the loop invariant.

The loop invariant plays an important role in the intuitive argument for soundness of the Floyd-Hoare rule for &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops.  The loop invariant has to be true before each iteration of the loop body, and also after each iteration of the loop body.  Since a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is precisely the repeated iteration of the loop body, it follows that if the invariant is true before entering the loop, it must also be true after exiting the loop.

===Example===
The following example illustrates how this rule works.  Consider the program

 while (x &lt; 10)
     x := x+1;

One can then prove the following Hoare triple:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\leq10\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{x=10\}&lt;/math&gt;

The condition ''C'' of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10&lt;/math&gt;.  A useful loop invariant &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; has to be guessed; it will turn out that &lt;math&gt;x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is appropriate.  Under these assumptions it is possible to prove the following Hoare triple:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x&lt;10 \land x\leq10\}\; x := x+1 \;\{x\leq10\}&lt;/math&gt;

While this triple can be derived formally from the rules of Floyd-Hoare logic governing assignment, it is also intuitively justified: Computation starts in a state where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10 \land x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is true, which means simply that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;10&lt;/math&gt; is true.  The computation adds 1 to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; is still true (for integer x).

Under this premise, the rule for &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops permits the following conclusion:

:&lt;math&gt;\{x\leq10\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1 \;\{\lnot(x&lt;10) \land x\leq10\}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the post-condition &lt;math&gt;\lnot(x&lt;10)\land x\leq10&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to 10, but it is not less than 10) is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to &lt;math&gt;x=10&lt;/math&gt;, which is what we wanted to show.

The property &lt;math&gt;0 \leq x&lt;/math&gt; is another invariant of the example loop, and the trivial property &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{true}&lt;/math&gt; is another one.
Applying the above inference rule to the former invariant yields &lt;math&gt;\{0 \leq x\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{10 \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;.
Applying it to invariant &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{true}&lt;/math&gt; yields &lt;math&gt;\{\mathrm{true}\}\; \mathbf{while}\ (x&lt;10)\ x := x+1\;\{10 \leq x\}&lt;/math&gt;, which is slightly more expressive.

==Programming language support==

===Eiffel===
The [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] programming language provides native support for loop invariants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Meyer|Meyer, Bertrand]], ''Eiffel: The Language,'' [[Prentice Hall]], 1991, pp. 129–131.&lt;/ref&gt; A loop invariant is expressed with the same syntax used for a [[class invariant]]. In the sample below, the loop invariant expression &lt;code&gt;x&amp;nbsp;&lt;=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;/code&gt; must be true following the loop initialization, and after each execution of the loop body; this is checked at runtime.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;    from
        x := 0
    invariant
        x &lt;= 10
    until
        x &gt; 10
    loop
        x := x + 1
    end&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Whiley===
The [[Whiley (programming language)|Whiley]] programming language also provides first-class support for loop invariants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Designing a Verifying Compiler: Lessons Learned from Developing Whiley | doi=10.1016/j.scico.2015.09.006 | volume=113 | journal=Science of Computer Programming | pages=191–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loop invariants are expressed using one or more &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, as the following illustrates:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="whiley"&gt;
function max(int[] items) -&gt; (int r)
// Requires at least one element to compute max
requires |items| &gt; 0
// (1) Result is not smaller than any element
ensures all { i in 0..|items| | items[i] &lt;= r }
// (2) Result matches at least one element
ensures some { i in 0..|items| | items[i] == r }:
    //
    nat i = 1
    int m = items[0]
    //
    while i &lt; |items|
    // (1) No item seen so far is larger than m
    where all { k in 0..i | items[k] &lt;= m }
    // (2) One or more items seen so far matches m
    where some { k in 0..i | items[k] == m }:
        if items[i] &gt; m:
            m = items[i]
        i = i + 1
    //
    return m
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; function determines the largest element in an integer array.  For this to be defined, the array must contain at least one element.  The [[postconditions]] of &lt;code&gt;max()&lt;/code&gt; require that the returned value is: (1) not smaller than any element; and, (2) that it matches at least one element.  The loop invariant is defined inductively through two &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, each of which corresponds to a clause in the postcondition.  The fundamental difference is that each clause of the loop invariant identifies the result as being correct up to the current element &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, whilst the postconditions identify the result as being correct for all elements.

==Use of loop invariants==

A loop invariant can serve one of the following purposes:
# purely documentary 
# to be checked within in the code by an assertion call
# to be verified based on the [[Hoare logic|Floyd-Hoare approach]]

For 1., a natural language comment (like &lt;code&gt;// m equals the maximum value in a[0...i-1]&lt;/code&gt; in the [[#Informal example|above]] example) is sufficient.

For 2., programming language support is required, such as the [[C (programming language)|C]] library [[assert.h]], or the [[#Eiffel|above]]-shown &lt;code&gt;invariant&lt;/code&gt; clause in Eiffel. Often, run-time checking can be switched on (for debugging runs) and off (for production runs) by a compiler or a runtime option.{{citation needed|reason=hope that C's or/and Eiffel assert.h supports that?|date=May 2016}}

For 3., some tools exist to support mathematical proofs, usually based on the [[#Floyd–Hoare logic|above]]-shown Floyd–Hoare rule, that a given loop code in fact satisfies a given (set of) loop invariant(s).

The technique of [[abstract interpretation]] can be used to detect loop invariant of given code automatically. However, this approach is limited to very simple invariants (such as &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;=n &amp;&amp; i%2==0&lt;/code&gt;).

==Distinction from loop-invariant code==
{{see|Loop-invariant code motion}}
A loop invariant (loop-invariant ''property'') is to be distinguished from loop-invariant ''code''; note "loop invariant" (noun) versus "loop-invariant" (adjective).
Loop-invariant code consists of statements or expressions that can be moved outside the body of a loop without affecting the semantics of a program; such transformations, called [[loop-invariant code motion]], are performed by some compilers to [[optimizing compiler|optimize]] programs.
A loop-invariant code example (in the [[C programming language]]) is
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    x = y+z;
    a[i] = 6*i + x*x;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
where the calculations &lt;code&gt;x = y+z&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x*x&lt;/code&gt; can be moved before the loop, resulting in an equivalent, but faster, program:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x = y+z;
t1 = x*x;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    a[i] = 6*i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In contrast, e.g. the property &lt;code&gt;0&lt;=i &amp;&amp; i&lt;=n&lt;/code&gt; is a loop invariant for both the original and the optimized program, but is not part of the code, hence it doesn't make sense to speak of "moving it out of the loop".

Loop-invariant code may induce a corresponding loop-invariant property.{{clarify|reason=I guess, once the notion of 'loop-invariant code' is defined in a sufficiently formal way, it can be proven that loop-invariant code *always* induces a corresponding loop invariant property.|date=March 2016}} For the above example, the easiest way to see it is to consider a program where the loop invariant code is computed both before and within the loop:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
x1 = y+z;
t1 = x1*x1;
for (int i=0; i&lt;n; ++i) {
    x2 = y+z;
    a[i] = 6*i + t1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
A loop-invariant property of this code is &lt;code&gt;(x1==x2 &amp;&amp; t1==x2*x2) || i==0&lt;/code&gt;, indicating that the values computed before the loop agree with those computed within (except before the first iteration).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7100">'''[[Time-domain reflectometry]]''' or TDR is a [[Measurement|measurement technique]] which correlates the frequency-dependent electric and [[dielectric]] properties of materials such as [[soil]], [[Agriculture#Agricultural production systems|agrarian products]], [[snow]], [[wood]] or [[concrete]] to their moisture content.

Measurement usually involves inserting a sensor into the substance to be tested and then applying either Standard Waveform Analysis to determine the average moisture content along the sensor or Profile Analysis to provide moisture content at discrete points along the sensor. A spatial location can be achieved by appropriate installation of several sensors.
[[File:Simple Time Domain Reflectometer Diagram.png|thumb|right|Functional principle of a TDR meter]]

== Standard Waveform Analysis ==
[[File:TDR-Waveguide Moisture Measurement.jpg|thumb|right|A TDR waveguide with exposed wires]]
In the waveform analysis a sensor (usually a probe) is placed in the material to be tested. The sensor contains a [[waveguides|waveguide]] consisting of two or three parallel wires which is connected via a [[coaxial cable]] to a voltage [[Pulse (physics)|pulse generator]] which sends precisely defined voltage pulses into the sensor. As the pulse travels along the waveguide its progress varies depending on the moisture content of the material being examined. When the pulse reaches the end of the waveguide it is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]]. This reflection is visualised in a TDR [[waveform]] using an [[oscilloscope]] connected to the sensor. The intensity of the pulse in the probe is measured and related to moisture content, with higher voltage indicating an increase of moisture. By comparing the measured reflection to the initial pulse the average moisture content and relative [[Permittivity|permitivity]] of the sample can be calculated by using an [[equivalent circuit]] as a reference.

Standard waveform analysis can be used either manually (hand held instruments) or [[Automaton|automatically]] for monitoring moisture content in several areas such as [[hydrology]], [[agriculture]] and [[construction]].

== Profile Analysis ==
Standard Waveform Analysis is unable to provide a spatial moisture profile. More sophisticated methods such as Profile Analysis are required. This method uses a variety of techniques to add spatial information to the measurement results.

* '''Reconstruction algorithm''': One approach is to model the pulse propagation in the waveguide and calibrate the model against laboratory measurement. By comparing real sample measurements to the model, the moisture distribution can be inferred. 
:The usefulness of this method is limited by the complexity of the algorithms, the limited amplitude resolution and interference in the TDR equipment.

* '''Alteration of Cross Section''': Altering the cross section of the waveguide alters the pulse reflections and creates artificial reflections at each alteration of the cross section. This enables segmentations of the waveguide by applying a different cross section to each segment. 
:However the difficulty of distinguishing the artificial pulse reflection from a real variance prevents the use of this technique for automated data analysis.

[[File:Moisture Detection in Buildings with TDR.png|thumb|Moisture detection in buildings using profile analysis]]
* '''Subdivision''': The waveguide is subdivided into segments by using [[PIN diode]]s. Each segment provides its own pulse reflection thus showing the moisture content in that segment alone. This enables the moisture content to be mapped to the individual segments and therefore shows the spatial moisture distribution.
:As the length of the waveguide increases the reflections become weaker and eventually disappear. This limits the use of this method as do the influence of the diode [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] on the signal and manufacturing costs associated with the complexity of the waveguide compared to other methods.

* '''Length Variation''': This method uses several waveguides with different lengths mounted parallel to each other. As a separate waveguide must be connected for each area, the costs of this method are very high.

Profile analysis allows fully automatic measurement and monitoring of spatial moisture content and thus a leak monitoring of building [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[landfill]] barriers and [[Deep geological repository|geological repositories]] in [[Salt mining|salt mines]].

'''''Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming''''' is a 2010 non-fiction book by American [[History of science|historians of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway]]. It identifies parallels between the [[global warming controversy]] and earlier controversies over [[tobacco smoking]], [[acid rain]], [[DDT]], and the [[ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]]. Oreskes and Conway write that in each case "keeping the controversy alive" by spreading doubt and confusion after a scientific consensus had been reached, was the basic strategy of those opposing action.&lt;ref name = stek&gt;{{cite news |author=Steketee, Mike |title=Some sceptics make it a habit to be wrong |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/some-sceptics-make-it-a-habit-to-be-wrong/story-fn59niix-1225956414538 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they say that [[Fred Seitz]], [[Fred Singer]], and a few other [[contrarian]] scientists joined forces with conservative [[think tank]]s and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Naomi |last1=Oreskes |first2=Erik M. |last2=Conway |title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpMh3nh3JI0C&amp;pg=PP4 |year=2010 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-59691-610-4 |page=6 |ref=harv}} [http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/index.html merchantsofdoubt.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and Fred Singer, two of the subjects, have been critical of the book. Other reviewers have been more favorable. One reviewer said that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best [[science book]] of the year.&lt;ref name=Mckie8/&gt; It was made into a film, ''[[Merchants of Doubt (film)|Merchants of Doubt]]'', directed by [[Robert Kenner]], released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/ | title=Merchants of Doubt | publisher=Sony Pictures Classics | accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:S Fred Singer 2011.jpg |thumb|right |[[Fred Singer]] (2011), a prominent opponent of greenhouse gas regulation.]]
Oreskes  and Conway write that a handful of [[Conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] scientists, with strong ties to particular industries, have "played a disproportionate role in debates about controversial questions".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; The authors write that this has resulted in "deliberate obfuscation" of the issues which has had an influence on [[Public opinion on climate change|public opinion]] and [[Climate change policy of the United States|policy-making]].&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kitcher, Philip |authorlink=Philip Kitcher |title=The Climate Change Debates |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=328 |issue=5983 |pages=1231–2 |date=June 4, 2010 |doi=10.1126/science.1189312 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5983/1230-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes the so-called Merchants of Doubt, some predominantly American science key players, above all [[William Nierenberg|Bill Nierenberg]], [[Fred Seitz]], and [[Fred Singer]]. All three are physicists: Singer was a [[rocket scientist]], whereas Nierenberg and Seitz worked on the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite news |author=Brown, Seth |title='Merchants of Doubt' delves into contrarian scientists |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2010-06-01-deathmerchants01_ST_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been active on topics like acid rain, tobacco smoking, global warming and pesticides. The book claims that these scientists have challenged and diluted the [[scientific consensus]] in the various fields, as of the [[dangers of smoking]], the effects of acid rain, the existence of the ozone hole, and the existence of [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; Seitz and Singer have been involved with institutions such as [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and [[George C. Marshall Institute]] in the United States. Funded by [[corporation]]s and conservative [[Foundation (United States law)|foundations]], these organizations have opposed many forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] or regulation of U.S. citizens. The book lists similar tactics in each case: "discredit the science, disseminate false information, spread confusion, and promote doubt".&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

The book states that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and [[Robert Jastrow]] were all fiercely [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and they viewed government regulation as a step towards [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. The authors argue that, with the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives.&lt;ref name=ocmerch/&gt; Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and [[market fundamentalism|market fundamentalists]] most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded.&lt;ref name=ocmerch&gt;{{harvnb|Oreskes|Conway|2010|pp=248–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science.&lt;ref name ="RG" /&gt; The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".&lt;ref name=rm&gt;{{cite news |author=McKie, Robin |title=A dark ideology is driving those who deny climate change |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/01/climate-change-robin-mckie |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main conclusion of the book is that there would have been more progress in policymaking, if not for the influence of the contrarian "experts", which tried on ideological reasons to undermine trust in the science base for regulation.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grundmann|first1=Reiner|title=Debunking sceptical propaganda|journal=BioSocieties|date=29 August 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=370–374|doi=10.1057/biosoc.2013.15|url=https://www.academia.edu/4754580/Debunking_skeptical_propaganda_Book_review_of_Oreskes_Conway_Merchants_of_Doubt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusions were already drawn, among others on [[Frederick Seitz]] and [[William Nierenberg]] in the book ''[[Requiem for a Species|Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change]]'' (2010) by Australian academic [[Clive Hamilton]].

==Reception==

[[Philip Kitcher]] in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' says that Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway are "two outstanding historians".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; He calls ''Merchants of Doubt'' a "fascinating and important study". Kitcher says that the apparently harsh claims against Nierenberg, Seitz, and Singer are "justified through a powerful dissection of the ways in which prominent climate scientists, such as [[Roger Revelle]] and [[Ben Santer]], were exploited or viciously attacked in the press".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;

In ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', Will Buchanan says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Oreskes and Conway are seen to demonstrate that the doubt merchants are not "objective scientists" as the term is popularly understood. Instead, they are "science-speaking mercenaries" hired by corporations to process numbers to prove that the corporations’ products are safe and useful. Buchanan says they are salesmen, not scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Will (June 22, 2010). [http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt Merchants of Doubt: How “scientific” misinformation campaigns sold untruths to consumers] ''The Christian Science Monitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bud Ward published a review of the book in ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''. He wrote that Oreskes and Conway use a combination of thorough scholarly research combined with writing reminiscent of the best investigative journalism, to "unravel deep common links to past environmental and public health controversies".&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, Bud (July 8, 2010). [http://www.yaleclimatemediaforum.org/2010/07/merchants-of-doubt/ Reviews: Leaving No Doubt on Tobacco, Acid Rain, Climate Change], ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate science, the authors' leave "little doubt about their disdain for what they regard as the misuse and abuse of science by a small cabal of scientists they see as largely lacking in requisite climate science expertise".&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;

Phil England writes in ''[[The Ecologist]]'' that the strength of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: [[Jim Hoggan]]’s ''Climate Cover-Up'', [[George Monbiot]]’s ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning'' and [[Ross Gelbspan]]’s ''The Heat is On'' and ''Boiling Point''. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which [[Exxon Mobil]] has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting [[climate change denial]] and doubt.&lt;ref&gt;England, Phil (September 10, 2010). [http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/592288/merchants_of_doubt.html Merchants of Doubt] ''[[The Ecologist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''[[The Economist]]'' calls this a powerful book which articulates the politics involved and the degree to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines that the authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16374460 All guns blazing: A question of dodgy science], (June 17, 2010), ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Proctor]], who coined the term "[[agnotology]]" to describe the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, wrote in ''[[American Scientist]]'' that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is a detailed and artfully written book. He set it in the context of other books which cover the "history of manufactured ignorance":&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, Robert (September–October 2010). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/manufactured-ignorance Book Review: Manufactured Ignorance], ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Michaels (epidemiologist)|David Michaels]]’s ''[[Doubt is their Product]]'' (2008), [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]]’s ''[[The Republican War on Science]]'' (2009), [[David Rosner]] and Gerald Markowitz’s ''[[Deceit and Denial]]'' (2002), and his own book ''[[Cancer Wars]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Proctor" /&gt;

Robin McKie in ''[[The Guardian]]'' states that Oreskes and Conway deserve considerable praise for exposing the influence of a small group of [[Cold War]] ideologues. Their tactic of spreading doubt has confused the public about a series of key scientific issues such as global warming, even though scientists have actually become more certain about their research results. McKie says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' includes detailed notes on all sources used, is carefully paced, and is "my runaway contender for best science book of the year".&lt;ref name=Mckie8&gt;McKie, Robin (August 8, 2010). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/merchants-of-doubt-oreskes-conway "Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway".] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]]'s review in ''[[BioSocieties]]'' journal, acknowledges that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in a black and white manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of [[knowledge policy]], because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides ''all the (formal) hallmarks of science'', Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.&lt;ref name="RG" /&gt;

William O’Keefe and Jeff Kueter from the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], which was founded by Seitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Begley|first1=Sharon|title=Global Warming Deniers: A Well-Funded Machine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-deniers-well-funded-machine-99295|website=Newsweek|date=4 August 2007|quote=...a central cog in the denial machine: the George C. Marshall Institute, a conservative think tank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  say that although ''Merchants of Doubt'' has the appearance of a scholarly work, it discredits and undermines the reputations of people who in their lifetime contributed greatly to the American nation. They say that it does this by questioning their integrity, impugning their character, and questioning their judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=O’Keefe | first= William |last2= Kueter| first2=Jeff | date=June 2010 | url=http://marshall.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/OKeefe-and-Kueter-Clouding-the-Truth-A-Critique-of-Merchants-of-Doubt.pdf |title=Clouding the Truth: A Critique of Merchants of Doubt |publisher=[[George C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10901">The '''National Humanities Center''' ('''NHC''') is an independent institute for advanced study in the [[humanities]]. The NHC operates as a privately incorporated nonprofit and is not part of any university or federal agency. The center was planned under the auspices of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which saw a need for substantial support for academic research in the humanities, and began operations in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3822762| jstor = 3822762| title = The National Humanities Center| year = 1978| last1 = Ritvo | first1 = H. | journal = Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences| volume = 32| pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[Research Triangle Park]], [[North Carolina]], United States, near the campuses of [[Duke University]], [[North Carolina State University]], and the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], NHC fellows enjoy library privileges at these three universities, as well as the NHC's own reference facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/library/libraryguide.htm|title=Library Guide|publisher=National Humanities Centeer|accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Humanities Center is one of the nine members of the [[Some Institutes for Advanced Study]] consortium–which are modeled after the  Princeton, New Jersey, [[Institute for Advanced Study]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiko-berlin.de/|title=WIKO - Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin|work=wiko-berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

The National Humanities Center offers dedicated programs in support of humanities scholarship and teaching as well as a regular schedule of public events, conferences and interactive initiatives to engage the public in special topics and emerging issues.

'''Fellowship Program''' – Each year, the NHC admits approximately forty Fellows chosen from among hundreds of applicants from institutions in the United States and abroad representing a broad range of disciplines. In addition, a few senior scholars are invited by the Center's trustees to assume fellowships. The National Humanities Center has no permanent fellows or faculty.

NHC Fellows are given substantial support to pursue their individual research and writing projects. Interdisciplinary seminars provide fellows the opportunity to share insights and criticism. Since 1978 the NHC has welcomed over 1,300 Fellows who have published more than 1,500 books. Many of these studies have proven to be influential in their fields and been recognized by the quality of their scholarship and writing.

'''Education Programs''' – The National Humanities Center is distinctive among centers for advanced study in its commitment to linking scholarship to improved teaching. Programs in American studies developed at the NHC provide teachers with new materials and instructional strategies designed to make them more effective in the classroom.

Through its [[AmericaInClass.org]] site, the NHC allows participants to learn directly from leading scholars. Workshops and institutes are also used to assemble, discuss and share extensive archives of primary source materials – arranged in  online collections and accompanied with discussion questions and instructional planning guides for classroom use. The NHC makes these materials available without charge.

TeacherServe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/index.htm|title=TeacherServe® from the National Humanities Center|work=nationalhumanitiescenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NHC's online interactive curriculum enrichment service, supplements its training and primary source collections with essays by leading scholars, instructional activities, and links to online resources to enrich teachers' understanding of topics and suggest approaches for more effective classroom teaching.

'''Outreach''' – The National Humanities Center hosts a variety of public events, both to stimulate public awareness of humanities scholarship and to address special topics.  In recent years, events have included appearances by [[A. S. Byatt]], [[Michael Ignatieff]], [[Oliver Sacks]], [[Michael Pollan]], [[Elaine Scarry]], [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Raymond Tallis]], [[Wang Hui (intellectual)|Wang Hui]], and [[E. O. Wilson]].

From 2006 to 2009 the NHC sponsored an initiative exploring emerging issues in human self-understanding.  This initiative, which involved fellowships, guest lectures, faculty seminars, and three annual conferences on "The Human and The Humanities" brought leading scientists from disciplines as diverse as neurolinguistics, primatology, and information technology together with literary critics, historians, and philosophers in dialogue about how their research interests and recent discoveries were both interconnected and overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/daedalus/09_summer_cover.pdf |title=Cover |publisher=the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences |date=Summer 2009 |work=Daedalus |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/the-third-replicator/?ref=opinion | work=The New York Times | title=The Third Replicator | first=Susan | last=Blackmore | date=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This initiative led to the creation of OnTheHuman.org which includes an archive of discussions by leading scholars on related subjects and materials for use in developing curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hastac.org/node/736 |title=National Humanities Center Launches New Website for ASC Project |publisher=HASTAC |date=2007-04-19 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the NHC hosted an academic conference on "The State and Stakes of Literary Study" bringing together leading figures from the study of literature to discuss changes in the field, emerging directions, and the contributions that are being made by literary scholars, not only in the education of students but in public understanding of contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard |first=Jennifer |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Literary-Scholars-Ponder-Their/64792/ |title=Literary Scholars Ponder Their Discipline and Its Direction - Research |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |publisher=Chronicle.com |date=2010-03-21 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/18/moral-camouflage-or-moral-monkeys/ | work=The New York Times | title=Moral Camouflage or Moral Monkeys? | first=Peter | last=Railton | date=2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the NHC launched another three-year, interdisciplinary initiative exploring the subject of human rights through the lens of the humanities. With scholarly conferences and other activities, this initiative seeks to examine conventional assumptions underpinning human rights discourse and stimulate discussion among leading scholars from the US and abroad who are engaged in these topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/newsrel2012/prhumanrightsconf.htm |title=Center Announces 1st Annual Conference on "Human Rights and the Humanities" |publisher=National Humanities Center |date=2012-01-10 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nationalhumanitiescenter.org/newsrel2012/pr2ndhumanrightsconf.htm |title=Center Announces 2nd Annual Conference on "Human Rights and the Humanities" |publisher=National Humanities Center |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
Since 1978 the National Humanities Center has been led by six directors: [[Charles Frankel]], [[William Bennett]], Charles Blitzer, W. Robert Connor, [[Geoffrey G. Harpham]], and current director [[Robert D. Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/16/nc-national-humanities-idUSnBw166268a+100+BSW20140916|title=National Humanities Center Appoints New President and Director|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Frank H. Neely Nuclear Research Center''', also known as the '''Neely Research Reactor''' and the '''Georgia Tech Research Reactor''' was a [[nuclear engineering]] research center on the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] campus, which housed a 5 [[megawatt]] [[heavy water]] moderated and cooled [[research reactor]] from 1961 until 1995.&lt;ref name="hertel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nremp.gatech.edu/files/ne50/presentations/02D2_NE50_Hertel.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321112426/http://www.nremp.gatech.edu/files/ne50/presentations/02D2_NE50_Hertel.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-21|title=History of the Georgia Tech Research Reactor|publisher=[[Georgia Institute of Technology]]|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioned]] in November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/nuclear/assets/ProjectPortfolio/ResearchReactor.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060311135240/https://www.ch2m.com/corporate/markets/nuclear/assets/ProjectPortfolio/ResearchReactor.pdf|archivedate=2006-03-11|title=Research Reactor Decommissioning|publisher=[[CH2M HILL]]|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building that housed the reactor was demolished to make way for the [[Marcus Nanotechnology Research Center]].

The center is named for [[Frank H. Neely]], a Georgia Tech graduate and businessman who organized the first [[Georgia Nuclear Advisory Commission]], an essential step in the creation of the reactor and associated facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/finding-aids/display/xsl/MS088|title=Frank H. Neely Papers|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Library]]|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The center and associated reactor was built after campus president [[Blake Ragsdale Van Leer|Blake R. Van Leer]] appointed a Nuclear Science Committee, which included [[Georgia Tech Research Institute]] director [[James E. Boyd (scientist)|James E. Boyd]].&lt;ref name="boyd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/BOYDJAM.ESE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912061927/http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/df/pdf/BOYDJAM.ESE.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-12|title=James E.

The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and a large research reactor. The laboratory was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process radioactive materials.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt; The research reactor would be completed in 1963.

The reactor was shut down in 1988 due to safety concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/16/us/georgia-tech-closes-its-reactor-citing-continued-safety-concerns.html?pagewanted=1|title=Georgia Tech Closes Its Reactor, Citing Continued Safety Concerns|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1988-02-16|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was defueled due to safety concerns related to the nearby [[1996 Summer Olympics]] events.&lt;ref name="boyd"/&gt;

The reactor building was torn down after the decommissioning, with the remainder removed as of 2015.

'''NeoSon''' is an artistic movement developed in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]], by a group of local artists, [[Tropico Suemba|Josué Pérez]] being  its main exponent. The movement was started in the early 1990s after a two-year tour by Pérez and Carlos "Charly" Garcia (one of the best [[multi-instrumentalist]]s in the country) through 13 countries in [[Latin America]], especially [[Brazil]]. The genesis was prompted by Pérez's perception of the lack of artistic innovation in Mexico experienced from the 1960s on. Although [[Mexican art]] has always had plenty of creative minds and people interested in its promotion, a considerable gap separated the country's artistic scene from those of other countries such as Brazil and [[Argentina]]. This separation was particularly felt after the concert of [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]] (regarded as the Mexican [[Woodstock]]) in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.normal-records.com/main.php?a=3_Love%20Peace%20Poetry&amp;r=Vol.7%20Mexican Normal Records - Avandaro Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; after which rock music in the country was object of [[political repression|repression]]s by the government, the [[News media|media]] and the conservative part of Mexican society, until approximately 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maph49.galeon.com/avandaro/ingles/avandaro8.html After Avándaro: the black hole of mexican rock]&lt;/ref&gt; The repression caused a collapse in the young musicians' (and artists in general) creative and social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neoson.mex.tl/132531_NeoSon-Manifesto.html NeoSon Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurolaw''' is an emerging field of interdisciplinary study that explores the effects of discoveries in neuroscience on legal rules and standards. Drawing from [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[social psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], neurolaw practitioners seek to address not only the descriptive and predictive issues of how neuroscience is and will be used in the legal system, but also the normative issues of how neuroscience should and should not be used.

The most prominent questions that have emerged from this exploration are as follows: To what extent can a tumor or brain injury alleviate criminal punishment? Can sentencing or rehabilitation regulations be influenced by neuroscience? Who is permitted access to images of a person's brain? Neuroscience is beginning to address these questions in its effort to understand human behavior, and will potentially shape future aspects of legal processes.&lt;ref name="Eagleman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M.|date=July–August 2011|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520|title=The Brain on Trial|journal=The Atlantic}} [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/print/2011/07/the-brain-on-trial/8520]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petoft"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Neurolaw: a brief introduction|publisher=''Iranian Journal of Neurology''|date=2015|url=http://ijnl.tums.ac.ir/index.php/ijnl/article/download/570/232|pmc=4395810|pmid=25874060|volume=14|journal=Iran J Neurol|pages=53–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New insights into the psychology and cognition of the brain have been made available by [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI). These new technologies were a break from the conventional and primitive views of the brain that have been prevalent in the legal system for centuries. Brain imaging has provided a much deeper insight into thought processes, and will have an effect on the [[law]] because it contests customary beliefs about mental development. Because the science is still developing and because there is substantial opportunity for misuse, the legal realm recognizes the need to proceed cautiously. Neurolaw proponents are quickly finding means to apply neuroscience to a variety of different contexts. For example, intellectual property could be better evaluated through neuroscience. Major areas of current research include applications in the courtroom, how neuroscience can and should be used legally, and how the law is created and applied.&lt;ref name="Petoft-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Toward Human Behavior Sciences from the Perspective of Neurolaw|publisher=''International Journal of Public Mental Health and Neurosciences''|date=2015|url=http://sarvasumana.in/files/26.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodenough"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodenough|first=Oliver R. and Macaela Tucker|date=December 2010| url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131523|title=Law and Cognitive Neuroscience|journal=Annual Review of Law and Social Science|publisher=Annual Review|volume=6|pages=61–92|doi=10.1146/annurev.lawsocsci.093008.131523|last2=Tucker|first2=Micaela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Neuroscience and the law have interacted over a long history, but interest spiked in the late 1990s. After the term neurolaw was first coined by Sherrod J. Taylor in 1991,&lt;ref name="taylor-erickson"/&gt; scholars from both fields began to network through presentations and dialogs. This led to an increasing pull to publish books, articles, and other literature. The Gruter Institute for Law and Behavioral Research and the Dana Foundation were the first groups to provide funding for the new interdisciplinary field. Parallel to the expansion of neurolaw, an emergence of ethics specifically regarding neuroscience was developing as well. The intersection of neurolaw and ethics was able to be better scrutinized by the initiation of the Law and Neuroscience Project in 2007.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt; The MacArthur Foundation launched Phase I of its project through a $10 million grant in hope of integrating the two fields. The initiative sustained forty projects addressing a multitude of issues, including experimental and theoretical data that will provide further evidence as to how neuroscience may eventually shape the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawneuro.org/About-Us/History.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130024912/http://www.lawneuro.org/About-Us/History.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-01-30|title=History: Phase I|publisher=The Law &amp; Neuroscience Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new field of study has also piqued the interests of several universities. Baylor College of Medicine's Initiative on Neuroscience and the Law’s research seeks to research, educate, and make policy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neulaw.org/goals|title=Goals of the Initiative|publisher=Baylor College of Medicine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514220120/http://www.neulaw.org/goals|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Neuroscience and Society began in July 2009, and is working towards confronting the social, legal, and ethical inferences of neuroscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuroethics.upenn.edu/|title=Center for Neuroscience and Society|publisher=University of Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurocriminology==

The term neurolaw was first used in practice by the neuroscientist and attorney J. Sherrod Taylor in 1991.&lt;ref name="taylor-erickson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=J. Sherrod |author2=J. Anderson Harp |author3=Tyron Elliott|date=Oct 1991|title=Neuropsychologists and Neurolawyers|journal=Neuropsychology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=293–305|doi=10.1037/0894-4105.5.4.293}}  See also: {{cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Steven K.|year=2010|ssrn=1472245|title=Blaming the Brain|journal=Minnesota Journal of Law, Science &amp; Technology|publisher=University of Missouri School of Law Legal Studies|volume=11|issue=2009–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor's book, ''Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injury'' (1997), was used as a resource for attorneys to properly introduce medical jargon into the courtroom and to further develop the implications of neuroscience on litigation. In addition, Taylor explained the consequences of ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]''.&lt;ref name="Juliano"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juliano|first=Elizabeth|author2=James R. Fell |date=April 1998|url=http://www.medicineforthedefense.com/MAIN/articles/newspubs-a-07.aspx|title=Book Review: Neurolaw: Brain and Spinal Cord Injuries|journal=The MIM Reporter|publisher= Litigation Management, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This United States Supreme Court case resulted in what is now known as [[Daubert Standard]], which sets rules regarding the use of scientific evidence in the courtroom.

===Crime prediction===

[[Psychological testing|Behavioral testing]] and [[neuroimaging]] evidence offer a potentially accurate method of predicting human behavior. This advancement would be beneficial particularly for determining guilty criminal sentences or discerning which criminals deserve to be released on parole or detained in jail due to the  possibility of future offenses. Not only could it aid in the process of [[recidivism]], it could also show an indication of the need for personal rehabilitation. In light of this information and its potential applications, the legal system seeks to create a balance between just punishment and penalties based on the ability to predict additional criminal activity.&lt;ref name="Eagleman"/&gt;

===Insanity defense===

The tendency of the United States criminal justice system has been to limit the degree to which one can claim innocence based on [[mental illness]]. During the middle of the 20th century, many courts through the [[Durham rule|Durham Rules]] and the American Law Institute Model Penal Code, among others, had regarded impaired volition as legitimate grounds for the [[insanity defense]]. However, when [[John Hinckley]] was acquitted due to insanity, a reversal of opinion occurred, which then spurred a narrowing definition of mental illness. Decisions became increasingly based on the [[M’Naghten Rules]], which asserted that unless one was able to prove that a mental illness kept him or her from knowing that the act was wrong, or knowing the disposition of the criminal act, one would not be able to be tried as mentally handicapped. Contemporary research conducted on the prefrontal cortex has criticized this standpoint because it considers impaired volition as a factor. Many courts are now considering "irresistible impulse" as legitimate grounds for mental illness.&lt;ref name="Sapolsky"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapolsky|first=Robert M.|authorlink=Robert Sapolsky|date=2004-11-26|url=http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSapolsky%5DFrontalCortexandJustice2004.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614055055/http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/neurolaw/papers/%5BSapolsky%5DFrontalCortexandJustice2004.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-06-14|title=The frontal cortex and the criminal justice system|journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B|publisher=The Royal Society|volume=359|pages=1787–1796|doi=10.1098/rstb.2004.1547|issue=1451|pmid=15590619|pmc=1693445}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the factors neuroscience has added to the insanity defense is the claim that the brain “made someone do it.” In these cases, the argument is based on an understanding that decisions are made before the person is able to consciously realize what is happening. More research on control and inhibition mechanisms will allow further modifications to the insanity defense.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt; Impaired functioning of the [[prefrontal cortex|PFC]] is evidence proving that a prime factor in mental illness is an issue of volition. Many experiments using MRI show that one of the functions of the PFC is to bias a person towards taking the more difficult action. This action is representative of a long-term reward, and it is competing with an action that will lead to immediate satisfaction. It is responsible for moral reasoning, including regret. Individual variations that impair the PFC are extremely detrimental to the decision-making process, and give an individual a greater likelihood in a committing a crime he or she would have otherwise not committed.&lt;ref name="Sapolsky"/&gt;

===Brain death===

Injuries or illnesses that lead to a [[persistent vegetative state]] have come to the forefront of many ethical, legal, and scientific issues regarding brain death.&lt;ref name="Eagleman2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagleman|first=David M.|date=March–April 2008|url=http://www.thehoustonlawyer.com/aa_mar08/page36.htm|title=Neuroscience and the Law|journal=The Houston Lawyer|publisher=Houston Bar Association|volume=16|issue=6|pages=36–40}} [http://neuro.bcm.edu/eagleman/papers/Eagleman_NeuroscienceandLaw_HoustonLawyer.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a difficult subject to know when someone is beyond hope for recovery, as well as to decide who has the right to make the decision of when death is most appropriate. Research to determine a person’s cognitive state has helped develop an understanding of the vegetative state. While a person can be awake and conscious, he or she may not show any signs of awareness or recognition to external stimulation. In 2005, research was conducted on a 23-year-old female who suffered severe head trauma due to an automobile accident. The woman was diagnosed to be in a vegetative state; after five months she continued to be unresponsive, but did show normal sleep and wake cycles.  Using fMRI technology, researchers concluded that she was able to understand external stimuli, showing a response via activity in specific regions of the brain. For example, there was increased activity in the middle and superior temporal gyri similar to activity exhibited by control subjects. This positive response reveals potential for medical imaging to be used to understand the implications of brain death, and to help answer legal, scientific, and ethical questions pertaining to brain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Owen|date=2006-09-08|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/313/5792/1402.full|title=Detecting Awareness in the Vegetative State|journal=Science|publisher=AAAS|volume=313|issue=5792|doi=10.1126/science.1130197|page=1402|pmid=16959998|display-authors=1|last2=Coleman|first2=MR|last3=Boly|first3=M|last4=Davis|first4=MH|last5=Laureys|first5=S|last6=Pickard|first6=JD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nootropics==

In addition to questions involving how neuroscience should influence criminal and civil law, neurolaw also encompasses ethical questions regarding [[nootropics]], more commonly known as mind-enhancing drugs. A plethora of drugs are already known to cause a variety of effects on the brain, for example, the stimulatory action of [[caffeine]]. Similarly, current research suggests that the future may hold even more powerful medications that can specifically target and alter brain function.&lt;ref name="Lanni"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lanni|first=Cristina|author2=Silvia C. Lenzken |author3=Alessia Pascale |author4=Igor Del Vecchio |author5=Marco Racchi |author6=Francesca Pistoia |author7=Stefano Govoni |date=Mar 2008|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WP9-4RV7YF1-1/2/0b3e0b9e1816d062aeb1a6d67c0496db|title=Cognition enhancers between treating and doping the mind|journal=Pharmacological Research|publisher=Elsevier|volume=57|issue=3|pages=196–213|issn=1043-6618|doi=10.1016/j.phrs.2008.02.004|pmid=18353672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The potential to significantly improve one's concentration, memory, or cognition has raised numerous questions on the legality of these substances, and their appropriateness for various uses, such as studying for an exam. Analogous to the controversy over the use of [[anabolic steroids]] in professional sports, many high schools and universities are wary of students eventually using nootropics to artificially boost academic performance.

Some of the questions raised regarding the use of nootropics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sahakian|first=Barbara|author2=Sharon Morein-Zamir |date=2007-12-20|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7173/full/4501157a.html|title=Professor's little helper|journal=Nature|volume=450|pages=1157–1159|doi=10.1038/4501157a|issue=7173|pmid=18097378}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* How will these enhancers affect performance gaps between family income classes?
* Will it become necessary to use an enhancing drug simply to remain competitive in society?
* How does society distinguish between what is an acceptable substance (e.g. caffeine) and an unacceptable substance to alter one's mind?
* Do people have the right to experiment with substances to modify their own cognition?

Scientists and ethicists have attempted to answer these questions while analyzing the overall effect on society. It is largely accepted that mind-enhancing drugs are acceptable for use with patients facing cognitive disorders, as in a case of prescribing [[Adderall]] to children and adults with [[ADHD]]. In contrast, Adderall and [[Ritalin]] have become popular black-market drugs, most notably on college campuses. Students often use them to maintain focus when struggling to complete large amounts of schoolwork.&lt;ref name="Talbot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|date=2009-04-27|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/04/27/090427fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=all|title=Brain Gain|journal=The New Yorker|publisher=Condé Nast Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Much of neurolaw depends on state-of-the-art medical technology that has been adapted to a new role in the legal system. Among the most prominent technologies and disciplines are [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET scan), [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), and [[epigenetics]]. MRI and fMRI are particularly important because they allow detailed [[Brain mapping|mapping of the human brain]], potentially allowing technicians to visualize another person's thoughts. FMRI, a derivative of MRI, allows for oxygen-specific mapping to view the most active areas of a brain at a specific moment. Combined with the knowledge of how the brain works in different situations (lying, remembering, etc.), there is the potential to use functional neuroimaging evidence as a modern form of [[lie detection]]. Similarly, PET scans use a radioactive tracer injected into the body to analyze brain tissue.&lt;ref name="Eagleman2008"/&gt;

===Lie detection===

[[Image:Brianlies.png|thumb|500px|right|The diagram above is an overview of the varying patterns of brain activity detected by fMRI. Yellow highlighted regions are where there is the most activity occurring. TR and CR levels represent "telling the truth." LT signals indicate a subject is withholding information. LN signals indicate a subject is making up information.]]
In regard to neuroscience as a form of lie-detection, specific regions of the brain have been analyzed in order to uncover patterns of truth telling, deception, and false memory. Notably, an important obstacle to any form of lie detection is when subjects inadvertently recall [[source-monitoring error|false memories]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} This is induced experimentally by presenting subjects a list of semantically related words. While they believe their responses to be true, their recollections are in fact false. For instance, reading a long list of words including "moon," "sun," and "Mars," may cause a subject to incorrectly believe the word "Earth" to have been listed, even if it was not. This is a normal psychological occurrence, but presents numerous problems to jury attempting to sort out the facts of a case. Indeed, researchers have attempted to distinguish genuine truths from "false truths." Subjects are subsequently quizzed on the word list while specific regions of the brain are analyzed for activity. For instance, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] has been shown to activate when subjects are pretending to know information which they do not know, in contrast to truth telling and false recognition. Alternatively, the [[hippocampus|right anterior hippocampus]] activates when a subject presents false recognition in contrast to lying or accurately telling a truth. However, there remain limitations to how much brain imaging can distinguish between the many forms of truths and deceptions. For instance, future research hopes to uncover patterns that differentiate whether someone has genuinely forgotten an experience in contrast to the active choice to withhold information.&lt;ref name="Abe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abe|first=Nobuhito|date=December 2008|url=http://neulaw.org/papers/%5BAbe2008%5DCorrelatesofFalseMemory.pdf|title=Neural Correlates of True Memory, False Memory, and Deception|journal=Cerebral Cortex|volume=18|pages=2817|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhn037|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114004801/http://neulaw.org/papers/%5BAbe2008%5DCorrelatesofFalseMemory.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

The Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics (SCBE) specifically analyzes the contribution of fMRI to legal, ethical, and social challenges so that their conclusions may offer a liable transfer of fMRI information to policy recommendations and the clinical realm. The research will focus on identifying emerging trends of emotion, moral judgment, and other complex human behaviors. With the information that the researchers obtain, an advisory board will compile a list of guidelines to interpret the results. In analyzing the use of fMRIs, they will assess the risks and accuracy of using these machines to quantitatively detect mental illness. The [[Major Depressive Disorder]] is used as their main experimental model.&lt;ref name="Illes"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics|year=2011|url=http://bioethics.stanford.edu/research/projects/illes_advanced_neuro.html|title=Advancing Neuroimaging: Ethical, Legal and Social Issues|publisher=Stanford School of Medicine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002041436/http://bioethics.stanford.edu/research/projects/illes_advanced_neuro.html|archivedate=2011-10-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===

The use of neuroimaging in the legal system creates a very divided critical audience; many argue for its potential, while others argue it will not accurately replace human investigations to verify criminal decision making processes. Neuroimaging is inadequately understood; the multiple variables it displays, including [[medication]], [[nutrition]], and [[hormones]] create an image that is very complex and often impossible to interpret accurately. Other critics highlight that the image derived from the technology does not display the brain’s [[intentionality]] during the illegal act. Functional neuroimaging was not intended to calculate volition, and while it may offer insight into the processes that cause behavior, it is debated whether or not the images can objectively narrow in on human reason.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=Neil K.|year=2009|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/reprint/37/2/239.pdf|title=Neuroimaging, Culture, and Forensic Psychiatry|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|publisher=The American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=37|issue=2|pages=239–244|pmid=19535562}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also many worries about privacy as well.

Controversy over the science behind fMRI lie detection entered a Federal courtroom in 2010 with a [[Daubert]] hearing concerning its admissibility in a criminal trial but was excluded based on the state of the supporting science. A 2012 appeal of the case failed to change the court's view of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee at Jackson|url=http://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0312p-06.pdf|website=United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortcomings in the laboratory research that forms the basis of fMRI lie detection, and absence of validation in more complex contexts outside of the laboratory, leave serious open questions about the suitability of the method for legal or other high-stakes uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Martha J.|last2=Hutchinson|first2=Benjamin|last3=Phelps|first3=Elizabeth A.|last4=Wagner|first4=Anthony D.|title=Functional MRI-based lie detection: scientific and societal challenges|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=20 January 2014|volume=15|pages=123–131|doi=10.1038/nrn3665|url=http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v15/n2/full/nrn3665.html|pmc=3867253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application in practice==

Neurolaw has already been applied to various situations throughout the United States and other countries. Two companies, [[No Lie MRI]] and Cephos Corp, both offer lie-detection services using fMRI. Advertising to lawyers, prosecutors, and other firms, they attempt to provide a twenty-first century version of the traditional [[polygraph]].&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Because of variations among individuals’ responses however, the technology is not fool proof and many are skeptical of its uses. Nevertheless, It is often considered to be a more advanced technique than the polygraph test. The United States rarely allows evidence to be accepted in the court of law; and in response to worries of its scientific validity, judges have so far veered away from allowing Cephos and No Lie MRI tests into the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt;

===Criminal law===
In Mumbai, India, the legal system has taken a more rapid approach in applying neuroscience, and has already incorporated it into criminal convictions. In 2008, an Indian woman was convicted of murder based on strong [[circumstantial evidence]], including a brain scan that suggested her guilt. This conviction was sharply criticized by Hank Greely, a professor of law at Stanford University. Greely contested the scan based on evidence produced by a [[Brain Electrical Oscillation Signature Profiling]] test (BEOSP).  No scientific peer-review studies had ever been published demonstrating the efficacy of BEOS, raising questions about its reliability in such an important decision.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

In the United States, convicts have used introduced brain scan results during the sentencing phase of trials. Because the court system allows nearly any mitigating evidence during sentencing, brain scans have not faced as many hurdles for this application. In two instances occurring in California and New York, defendants were able to reduce their sentence of first-degree murder to manslaughter. Each presented brain scans suggesting hindered neurological function hoping to mitigate their responsibility in the crime.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt; Brain images were also used in the case of Harrington v. State of Iowa in 2003 as evidence for the defense.&lt;ref name="Goodenough" /&gt;

===Government and military===
The United States Military has become increasingly interested in the possibilities made available by neuroscience. In an effort to combat terrorism, officials hope to use modern technologies for a variety of purposes. Brain imaging may help to distinguish between enemy combatants from those who pose no risk. Similarly, officials can help determine the mental stability of their own soldiers. Nootropic drugs could also be used to enhance the focus and memories of soldiers, allowing for better recognition of dangers and improved performance. However, this has led to questions regarding the personal privacy of soldiers and detainees. While the general population generally has the right to refuse medication, soldiers may eventually face compulsory medication to benefit the overall mission.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Additionally, questions regarding the accuracy of brain imaging arise when testing detainees for concealed information. Although the civilian court system is reluctant to use unproven technologies, the military's reliance on them may generate controversy over the possible innocence or guilt of enemy combatants.&lt;ref name="Begley"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Begley|first=Sharon|date=2006-12-15|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116613325554750607|title=A Pentagon Agency Is Looking at Brains -- And Raising Eyebrows|journal=The Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of novel technological innovations and information in the field of neuroscience, the military has begun to anticipate specific uses for such neuroscience research. However, these approaches, which can alter human cognitive abilities as well as infringe on an individual’s right to the privacy of his or her own thoughts, are still innovatory and early in development. Therefore, the precise effects and potential influence are yet to be well explained.&lt;ref name="Huang"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huang|first=Jonathan Y.|author2=Margaret E. Kosal |date=2008-06-20|url=http://thebulletin.org/security-impact-neurosciences|title=The security impact of the neurosciences|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt; Present day treaties, such as the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights and the Chemical Weapons Conventions, address only the use of certain chemical agents and therefore cannot adequately regulate the fast-paced evolution of recent advancements in cognitive science research.&lt;ref name="Huang"/&gt; Due to this ambiguity and the potential of technology misuse, it has become increasingly pressing to address the regulations needed for controlling the extent to which neuroscience research can be employed in military functions.

Another area of interest to the military is the use of human enhancement drugs. [[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), a Pentagon branch of the United States Department of Defense, is often perceived to be responsible for military research and development of technology. A current operation of DARPA is named the Preventing Sleep Deprivation Program, which conducts research on the molecular processes and changes in the brain involved with sleep deprivation, with the ultimate purpose to maximize warfighters’ cognitive abilities, even with sleep deprivation.&lt;ref name="Clancy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clancy|first=Frank|date=2006-01-17|url=http://journals.lww.com/neurotodayonline/Fulltext/2006/01170/At_Military_s_Behest,_Darpa_Uses_Neuroscience_To.4.aspx|title=At Military's Behest, Darpa Uses Neuroscience To Harness Brain Power|journal=Neurology Today|publisher=American Academy of Neurology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=4, 8–10|doi=10.1097/00132985-200601170-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this research, sleep deprivation prevention drugs such as Modafinil and Ampakine CX717 have increased in significance. However, because these chemical drugs directly affect natural chemical reactions and receptors in the body, the ethics of their use as well as safety are in question.&lt;ref name="Kluger"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kluger|first=Jeffrey|date=2009-03-17|url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1885825,00.html|title=Safety Concerns Raised Over Popular Wakefulness Drug|journal=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cautions and concerns==
Neuroscience is a complex field and one not well understood by the general public. Although experts recognize the possibilities and drawbacks of brain imaging relatively well, others may be either too confident in or completely reject the field. Judges must decide on the validity of various neurological evidence so it can enter the courtroom, and juries must not be too willing to place all faith in neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Petoft-3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Petoft|first=Arian|title=Controversial Brain Imaging as a Terrorism Emergency Measure in Neurolaw Discourse|publisher=''Neurology &amp; Neurotherapy Journal''|date=2017|url=https://medwinpublishers.com/NNOAJ/NNOAJ16000118.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Ingfei|date=2009-10-21|url=http://stanfordlawyer.law.stanford.edu/2009/10/neurolaw/|title=Neurolaw|journal=Stanford Lawyer|publisher=Stanford School of Law|issue=81|volume=44|issn=0585-0576|pages=14–21}} [http://www.law.stanford.edu/publications/stanford_lawyer/issues/81/pdfs/sls81-articles.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to glorified depictions of forensics labs on popular television shows, brain imaging has faced criticism for having a "[[CSI effect]]". Society may soon develop a false sense of what is possible with contemporary technologies, and may not understand the value of evidence being presented.&lt;ref name="Merikangas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merikangas|first=James R.|year=2008|url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/36/4/499|title=Commentary: Functional MRI Lie Detection|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|publisher=American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law|volume=36|issue=4|pages=499–501|pmid=19092067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American professor of law and psychology [[Stephen J. Morse]] described the abuse of neuroscience in courtrooms with a pseudo-disease he called "Brain Overclaim Syndrome".  He focused on claims made about people having [[diminished responsibility]] or no responsibility for their actions because those actions were caused by "the brain", in situations where the science could not support such causal claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morse|first1=Stephen J.|title=Brain Overclaim Syndrome and Criminal Responsibility: A Diagnostic Note|journal=Ohio State Journal of Criminal Law|date=2006|volume=3|page=397|url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/osjcl/Articles/Volume3_2/Symposium/Morse-PDF-04-05-06.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchen|first1=L|title=Science in court: Arrested development.|journal=Nature|date=18 April 2012|volume=484|issue=7394|pages=304-6|doi=10.1038/484304a|pmid=22517146|url=https://www.nature.com/polopoly_fs/1.10456!/menu/main/topColumns/topLeftColumn/pdf/484304a.pdf?origin=ppub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nathan M. Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory''', or '''Newmark Lab''', located at 205 N. Mathews Avenue in [[Urbana, Illinois]] on the campus of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], houses the university's [[Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering]].  The Lab was built in 1967, and has been modified and updated a number of times since then.&lt;ref name=fac&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/portalresearch_facilities "Civil and Environmental Engineering: Research Facilities"]&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was named after professor and department head [[Nathan M. Newmark]] after his death.

The building consists of classrooms and offices surrounding a large open area called the crane bay for large scale experiments,&lt;ref name=fac /&gt; including those of the Newmark Structural Engineering Lab (NSEL). Newmark also contains a professional machine shop where students and faculty can have material fabricated by the staffed professionals, and a student instrumentation workshop where students and faculty can fabricate materials themselves.

In 2011, the M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center was added to the building.

== Crane bay ==

The crane bay is a large open area in the center of Newmark Laboratory with a three story height. It is where much of the department's structural research and testing is done. There are large doors on both the north and south sides of this area, where trucks and equipment can move through.  The crane bay gets its name from two large yellow hydraulic cranes on rails above the room, which move heavy equipment around. The crane bay houses many structural analysis equipment, including a concrete cylinder crusher for strength tests and beam deflection measurement devices. There is also a {{convert|28|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} L-shaped concrete reaction wall with hydraulic actuators, which was added in 2004. The crane bay's large open size is also sometimes used for departmental events such as Engineering Open House and the department's annual career fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Grzegorz Banas | title=NSEL Policy 2009 | url=http://nsel.cee.illinois.edu/website2008upgrade/safety.policy/nsel.policy.2009.02.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center ==

In 2011, an addition called the M. T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center, designed by Teng &amp; Associates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecandsinc.com/newmarkyeh.html "M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center Addition - Newmark Civil Engineering Laboratory - University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Campus"]&lt;/ref&gt; was completed at the cost of $7 million, adding {{convert|20500|sqft|m2}}  of classrooms, student study space and meeting rooms. The Yeh Center was funded entirely with private gifts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://cee.illinois.edu/yehcenter "Civil and Environmental Engineering: M.T. Geoffrey Yeh Student Center"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leader&gt;[http://issuu.com/ceeatillinois/docs/history_2_pdf_issuu "Leadership and Legacy"]&lt;/ref&gt; in particular a $4 million gift from M. T. Geoffrey Yeh, a 1953 graduate of the Department of Civil Engineering. Yeh is chairman of [[Hsin Chong]] International Holdings, Ltd., a large construction company in China.

The remainder of the funding for the addition came from private sources including alumni and corporate sponsors, and $1.0 million contributions by both the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the College of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=March 2011 U of I Trustee Meeting Agenda/ | url=http://www.uillinois.edu/trustees/agenda/March%2011,%202009/014%20mar%20UIUC%20Yeh%20Student%20Center.pdf | work= | publisher= | date= | accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It opened in time for the start of classes in fall 2011.

The '''Philosophical Gourmet Report''' (also known as the '''Leiter Report''' or '''PGR'''), founded by philosophy and law professor [[Brian Leiter]] and now edited by philosophy professors [[Berit Brogaard]] and Christopher Pynes, is a ranking of graduate programs in philosophy in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnpfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=%22brian+leiter%22+%22english+speaking+world%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=betnVafZB9WyyASrqIMI&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brian%20leiter%22%20%22english%20speaking%20world%22&amp;f=false|title=A Practical Guide to Electronic Resources in the Humanities|author=Ana Dubnjakovic, Patrick Tomlin|publisher=Elsevier|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophicalgourmet.com/ "The Philosophical Gourmet Report 2014-15"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The "Gourmet" Report ranking was created in response to the [[Gourman Report]], and is based on a survey of philosophers who are nominated as evaluators by the Report's Advisory Board.  Its purpose is to provide guidance to prospective Ph.D students, particularly those students who intend to pursue a professional career in academic philosophy. The Report first appeared on the web in 1996; it has been distributed by [[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell]] since 1997.

In 1989, while he was a graduate student, Leiter made a subjective list of what he believed to be the top 25 graduate philosophy programs in the United States, which came to be the PGR.&lt;ref name=chron1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Peter|title=The Man Who Ranks Philosophy Departments Now Rankles Them, Too|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|website=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|accessdate=September 30, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926193400/http://chronicle.com/article/The-Man-Who-Ranks-Philosophy/149007/|archivedate=September 26, 2014|deadurl=no|date=September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The PGR was described by [[David L. Kirp]] in a 2003 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' op-ed as "the bible for prospective [philosophy] graduate students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirp|first1=David|title=How Much for That Professor?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/opinion/27KIRP.html|accessdate=May 28, 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  George Yancy, in ''Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge'' ([[SUNY Press]], 2012), opined that Philosophical Gourmet Report ranking: "is, of course, very controversial. However, as is often pointed out, there is no real alternative."&lt;ref name=reframe&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eu6BpIDzmkQC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=Reframing the Practice of Philosophy: Bodies of Color, Bodies of Knowledge|author=George Yancy|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlin Romano]], in ''America the Philosophical'' ([[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]], 2013), referred to the PGR rankings as "often-criticized" and "biased towards mainstream analytic departments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUAc6z2uSnAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Philosophy+gourmet+report+controversy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3ZmVYrTIYursAX7pIDIDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20gourmet%20report%20controversy&amp;f=false|title=America the Philosophical|author=[[Carlin Romano]]|publisher=
Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year= 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11095">The '''Porn Art Movement''' (Movimento de Arte Pornô) was a transgressive Brazilian [[avant-garde]] movement that started in 1980 and ended in 1982. The movement took place under a [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]]  and pioneered the use of pornography both as a form of political resistance and as an innovative art medium.&lt;ref&gt;Cunha, Maria C. “Arte Pornô, a última dos novos poetas.” ''Folha de S. Paulo'' (Ilustrada), February 10th, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was formally experimental, politically progressive and socially non-normative. It used the word “porn” deliberately but it did not produce conventional pornography. Rather, it rejected erotica, which was accepted by the dictatorship,&lt;ref&gt;''Playboy'' magazine started publication in Brazil in 1975, one of the harshest periods of the military dictatorship. This was a time of rampant police brutality, when political prisoners were tortured and killed with impunity. In 1982, the President of Brazil, General João Figueiredo, made headlines calling for a "crusade against pornography." See: "Figueiredo convoca a nação para combater pornografia." ''Jornal do Brasil'', March 16th, 1982, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and subverted the logic of pornography to create social, political and aesthetic alternatives that employed humor, scatology, surprise, poetry, performance, body politics and [[pansexuality]]. Organized and coordinated activities ended in 1982, but isolated performances were realized and publications came out until 1984. The book ''Antolorgia'', published in 1984, was the last publication of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Movimento de Arte Pornô (Porn Art Movement), also known as Poesia Pornô (Pornpoetry) or Pornismo (Pornism), was conceived by [[Eduardo Kac]] in January 1980 in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Kac invited [[Cairo Trindade]]&lt;ref&gt;Rodrigues, Dolores. “Poesia Pornô: Liberta, aberta e honesta”. ''ArteManha'', Rio de Janeiro, January/February 1982, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop the movement together and they launched it publicly on March 30, 1980, through their Ipanema Beach intervention called ''Pelo Topless Literário'' (''Literary Topless'').&lt;ref&gt;''Gang'', n. 1, May 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a sudden invasion of the beach’s Lifeguard Post 9 (Posto Nove) with performances, poetry readings, demonstrations with banners featuring slogans, and distribution of publications. Lifeguard Post 9 was a strategic choice: it was considered at the time the epicenter of the beach (and, as a consequence, a major focal point of the city).

Soon after the ''Literary Topless'' intervention, Kac and Trindade invited Teresa Jardim to join them, thus forming the official performative arm of the movement, which they called Gang (The Gang). Braulio Tavares, Ana Miranda, Cynthia Dorneles and Sandra Terra also performed with The Gang.

Kac and Trindade wrote the ''Manifesto Pornô'' (''Porn Manifesto'') in May 1980 and first published it in the movement’s zine ''Gang'', n. 1, September 1980.  The movement published a total of three editions of the ''Gang'' zine, in addition to chapbooks, stickers, t-shirts, prints, comics, artist’s books and anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1980 and 1982, every Friday night The Gang performed at [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]]’s main square known as Cinelândia, a vibrant and busy area surrounded by the Municipal Theatre, the National Library, the Rio de Janeiro City Council and the [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes|National Museum of Fine Arts]]. In front of a public that mixed intellectuals and popular audiences, the Gang read out loud the ''Porn Manifesto'' on September 9, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The selection of Cinelândia was also a strategic maneuver, since it is the heart of Rio de Janeiro.

On February 13, 1982, the Gang presented its last major public intervention, which took place in Ipanema Beach’s Lifeguard Post 9.&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; This event, which Kac considers the formal end of the movement,&lt;ref&gt;Kac, Eduardo; Trindade, Cairo. (orgs.). ''Antolorgia'' (Rio de Janeiro: Editora Codecri, 1984), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; mobilized 9 performers, explored the entire repertoire developed during the preceding two years, included a wide array of props and publications, climaxed with a nude demonstration along the beach (which was and still is forbidden by law&lt;ref&gt;In 2011, Rio de Janeiro Police arrested three Dutch tourists for being naked in Copacabana Beach.  [http://www.rnw.nl/english/bulletin/naked-dutch-tourists-arrested-rio]&lt;/ref&gt;), mobilized public participation, and culminated with a collective dive in the ocean—a symbolic act meant to signify self-renewal, the beginning of a better path forward beyond the prevailing political and aesthetic conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Ronái, Cora. “A Caminhada Pornô,” ''Pasquim'', n. 660, February 18th to 24th, 1982, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[videographer]] Belisario Franca, then a photographer, accompanied The Gang between 1980 and 1982, producing photographic documentation of many of its interventions.

The Brazilian Porn Art Movement anticipated the international use of pornography as a critical and imaginative art form, as later seen in the work of Jeff Koons, Annie Sprinkle, Sue Williams, Santiago Sierra, Shu Lea Cheang, Wim Delvoye and the artists featured in the 2006 DVD compilation entitled ''Destricted''.&lt;ref&gt;The DVD compilation ''Destricted'' was organized by P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center curatorial adviser Neville Wakefield and featured artists such as Marina Abramović, Larry Clark, and Matthew Barney.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement started to be rediscovered in 2010, when the Laura Marsiaj Gallery, in Rio de Janeiro, exhibited Eduardo Kac’s series entitled ''Pornogramas'' (''Pornograms''), developed by the artist between 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054235/http://www.rioecultura.com.br/expo/expo_resultado2.asp?expo_cod=1453 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }} ; [http://www.canalcontemporaneo.art.br/_v3/site/evento.php?idioma=br&amp;id_evento=5278]&lt;/ref&gt; The first museum exhibition of the Brazilian Porn Art Movement took place at the Reina Sofía Museum, in Madrid, in the context of the group show ''Losing the Human Form'', realized in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoreinasofia.es/exposiciones/actuales/perder-forma-humana_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum published a catalogue that features the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nogueira, Fernanda; Henaro, Sol. “Overgoze,” in: ''Vv.Aa., Perder la forma humana. Una imagen sísmica de los años ochenta en América Latina'' (Madrid: Museo Reina Sofia, 2012), pp. 199-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art forms==

The Porn Art Movement produced work in a variety of media, including performance, poetry, [[graffiti]], drawing, photography, cartoon and the graphic arts. Glauco Mattoso created an innovative form that he called ''Jornal Dobrabil'', a self-printed double-sided sheet designed entirely on a typewriter that was visually provocative and mixed indiscriminately classic, experimental and popular pornographic material.&lt;ref&gt;Glauco Mattoso, ''Jornal Dobrabil'' (São Paulo: Iluminuras, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Hudinilson Jr. created a visual vocabulary based on his systematic sampling of his own body through reprographic media, notably the photocopier. Leila Míccolis, Teresa Jardim and Cynthia Dorneles developed their respective poetic voices through a form of feminism that combined unabashed pornography and liberal political positions. Ota produced invitations, posters, cartoons and comics through which he advanced the movement’s agenda while inviting the movement’s participants and the public to laugh. The poetry of Braulio Tavares and the drawings of Siegbert Franklin were also significant contributions to the movement. Publicly forging a new subjectivity, Eduardo Kac wore a pink mini-skirt in his daily life. Kac also developed the innovative series entitled ''Pornograms'', hybrid of body art, design, political resistance, performance, publishing, activism, photography and poetry. In this series Kac uses photography to explore the possibilities of writing with the body and writing the body itself. Kac included two ''Pornograms'' in his artist’s book ''Escracho'', which he published in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/jfabc/id/3079/rec/6]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1827">'''Pressure piling''' describes phenomena related to [[combustion]] of [[gas]]es in a [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tube]] or long vessel.  As the flame front propagates along the tube, the unburned gases ahead of the front are compressed, and hence heated. The amount of compression varies depending on the [[geometry]] and can range from twice to eight times the initial [[pressure]]. Where multiple vessels are connected by piping, ignition of gases in one vessel and pressure piling may result in a [[deflagration to detonation transition]] and very large [[explosion]] pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Chemical Process Safety  ''Safe Design and Operation of Process Vents and Emission Control'', Center for Chemical Process Safety/AIChE 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-471-79296-3}} pages 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[electrical equipment in hazardous areas]], if two [[electrical enclosure]]s are connected by a [[Electrical conduit|conduit]], an explosion of a gas in one of the compartments travels through the conduit into the next enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest C. Magison, ''Electrical Innstruments in Hazardous Locations 4th edition'', International Society of Automation, 1998  {{ISBN|978-0-97923-431-6}},  page  153&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure of the 'primary' explosion together with the pressure from the 'secondary' explosion in the other compartment produces one huge explosion that the equipment cannot handle. Heat, arcs or sparks escape from the equipment and ignite any gas or [[vapour]] that may be around.

Operators avoid this by not using conduits to join classified equipment together and by using barrier glands on cables going into the enclosure. This ensures that compartments remain separate at all times.

[[Image:Root primordia.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Root]] primordia (brown spots) as seen on the butt of a freshly cut [[pineapple]] crown intended for [[vegetative reproduction]].]]
A '''primordium''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|aɪ|ˈ|m|ɔːr|d|i|ə|m}}; plural: '''primordia'''; synonym: '''anlage''') in [[embryology]], is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or tissue in its earliest recognizable stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33809 MedicineNet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cell (biology)|Cell]]s of the primordium are called '''primordial cells'''. A primordium is the simplest set of cells capable of triggering growth of the would-be organ and the initial foundation from which an organ is able to grow. In flowering plants, a floral primordium gives rise to a flower.

Although it is a frequently used term in plant biology, the word is used in describing the biology of all multicellular organisms (for example: a tooth primordium in animals, a leaf primordium in plants or a [[sporocarp (fungi)|sporophore]] primordium in fungi.&lt;ref name="Mushroom"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noble|first=R.|author2=T. R. Fermor |author3=S. Lincoln |author4=A. Dobrovin-Pennington |author5=C. Evered |author6=A. Mead |author7=R.

==Primordium development in plants==
Plants produce both leaf and flower primordia cells at the [[shoot apical meristem]] (SAM). Primordium development in plants is critical to the proper positioning and development of plant organs and cells. The process of primordium development is intricately regulated by a set of [[genes]] that affect the positioning, growth and [[Differentiation (biology)|differentiation]] of the primordium. Genes including STM (''SHOOT MERISTEMLESS'') and CUC (''CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON'') are involved in defining the borders of the newly formed primordium.&lt;ref name="Heisler2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heisler|first=Marcus G.|author2=Carolyn Ohno |author3=Pradeep Das |author4=Patrick Sieber |author5=Gonehal V. Reddy |author6=Jeff A. Long |author7=Elliot M. Meyerowitz |year=2005|title=Patterns of Auxin Transport and Gene Expression during Primordium Development Revealed by Live Imaging of the Arabidopsis Inflorescence Meristem|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=21|pages=1899–1911|issn=0960-9822|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.052|pmid=16271866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant hormone [[auxin]] has also been implicated in this process, with the new primordium being initiated at the placenta, where the auxin concentration is highest.&lt;ref name="Heisler2005" /&gt; There is still much to understand about the genes involved in primordium development.

Leaf primordia are groups of cells that will form into new leaves. These new leaves form near the top of the shoot and resemble knobby outgrowths or inverted cones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plant-biology.com&lt;/ref&gt; Flower primordia are the little buds we see at the end of stems, from which flowers will develop. Flower primordia start off as a crease or indentation and later form into a bulge. This bulging is caused by slower and less anisotropic, or directionally dependent, growth. (See [[anisotropy]])

'''Russeting''' or '''russetting''' is an abnormality of [[fruit]] skin which manifests in [[russet (color)|russet]]-colored (brownish) patches that are rougher than healthy skin. It is a common feature in [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s. Russeting is typically an undesirable trait, which reduces the storage life of fruits and makes their appearance unattractive to consumers,&lt;ref name=Lashbrooke&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genome investigation suggests ''MdSHN3'', an APETALA2-domain transcription factor gene, to be a positive regulator of apple fruit cuticle formation and an inhibitor of russet development |last1=Lashbrooke |first1=J. |last2=Aharoni |first2=A. |last3=Costa |first3=F. |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Botany]] |year=2015 |issue=21 |volume=66 |pages=6579–89 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erv366 |pmc=4623677 |pmid=26220084}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some cultivars, so-called [[russet apple]]s, are appreciated for the feature. 

==Causes==
In apples and pears, russet results from micro-cracking of the [[plant cuticle|cuticle]], the outer epidermal layer of the fruit. The cuticle is a natural waterproof barrier composed of a polymerized cutin matrix embedded with waxes, which protects the fruit from outside stresses, and helps maintain post-harvest preservation. When the cuticle cracks, a [[cork (material)|corky]] [[suberized]] layer is formed on the fruit skin.&lt;ref name=Lashbrooke/&gt;&lt;ref name=Opara&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Jules |editor-first=Janick|title=Horticultural Reviews |volume=55 |chapter=Fruit Skin Splitting and Cracking |last1=Opara |first1=Linus U. |last2=Studman |first2=Clifford J. |last3=Banks |first3=Nigel H. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdVY1nF_BjkC&amp;pg=PA225|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-65061-5|pages=225–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apples are particularly susceptible to russet. Many naturally-occurring varieties exhibit the feature consistently, while other cultivars may develop russet due to environmental stresses. As a result, cuticular structure is impaired, leading to reduced strength of the peel, which impacts handling and post-harvest processing. Russeting and cuticular cracks may accelerate the development of flesh browning due to oxidation, as well as softening of internal tissue due to the loss of an external support.&lt;ref name=Lashbrooke/&gt;

The term '''serious play''' refers to an array of [[Play (activity)|playful]] inquiry and innovation methods that serve as vehicles for complex [[problem solving|problem-solving]], typically in work-related contexts.  [[Lego Serious Play]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/seriousplay|title=Lego Official Serious Play Site|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the best known examples; however, serious play methods also include [[Improvisational theatre|improv theater]], [[Roleplay simulation|role play exercise]]s, low fidelity prototyping, as well as certain simulations and [[gamification]] interventions, etc.

In recent years, an increasing body of academic and popular literature have argued that being in a playful mode (engaging in playful processes and applying a playful, open mindset) can foster creativity and innovation as it emphasizes possibilities, freedom, and process versus outcome, [[self-consciousness]], responsibility and shame. According to Gauntlett (2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Gauntlett|title=Creative explorations: new approaches to identities and audiences|year=2007|isbn=978-0415396592|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The non-judgmental environment of play, it is claimed, is more likely to foster surprising and innovative ideas" (see Stephenson (1998);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last=Stephenson|title=Play Theory of Mass Communication|isbn=9780887387050|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1988|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terr (2000);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lenore|last=Terr|title=Beyond Love and Work: why adults need to play|year=2000|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=978-0684863160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gee (2004);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Paul Gee|title=[[What Video Games Have to Teach Us About Learning and Literacy]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kane (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Kane|title=The Play Ethic: a manifesto for a different way of living|year=2005|isbn=9780330489300|publisher=Pan}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The term "serious play" was popularized with the publication of Michael Schrage's book ''Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Schrage|title=Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate|year=2000|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|isbn=9780875848143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious play methods can be used as vehicles for engaging teams in the five stages of the [[design thinking]] process: empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping, and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dschool.stanford.edu/redesigningtheater/the-design-thinking-process/ | title=The Design Thinking Process | work=ReDesigning Theater | accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The methods are designed to create a safe environment for exploring and sharing ideas and help engage teams in behaviors and mindsets that integrate disparate knowledge and align team efforts towards problem-solving and organizational change. Serious play methods are most often used in creative industries (e.g. product and service design), yet also hold a promise to foster creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship in general management practices as well. While much of the serious play literature focuses on [[business]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kristiansen|author2=Rasmussen|title=Building A Better Business: Using The Lego Serious Play Method|year=2014|isbn=978-1118832455|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Burgi|author2=Victor|author3=Lentz|title=Modeling how their business really works prepares managers for sudden change|year=2004|doi=10.1108/10878570410525106|journal=Strategy &amp; Leadership|volume=32|issue=2|pages=28–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sorensen|author2=Spoelstra|title=Play at Work: continuation, intervention, and usurpation|year=2012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258174266_Play_at_Work_Continuation_Intervention_and_Usurpation|doi=10.1177/1350508411407369|journal=Organization|volume=19|issue=1|pages=81–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; its benefits are applied in numerous fields, including [[military]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check out the US military's sandbox of silly-putty that predicts disasters and war|author=Aliya Sternstein|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/06/check-out-us-militarys-sandbox-silly-putty-predicts-disasters-and-war/129509/?oref=defenseone_today_nl|date=June 29, 2016|work=Defense One}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|last2=Palmer|title=Intergroup Encounters of a Different Kind: the experiential research model|year=1989|doi=10.1080/03075078912331377683|journal=Studies in Higher Education|volume=14|issue=3|pages=297–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Mann: Serious Play (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Montesa-Andres|author2=Garrigos-Simon|author3=Narangajavana|chapter=A Proposal for Using Lego Serious Play in Education|year=2011|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-04825-3_10|isbn=978-3-319-04824-6|title=Innovation and Teaching Technologies|publisher=Springer International Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[healthcare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Katie Watson|title=Teaching Medical Skills with Improvisation Techniques|year=2011|journal=Acad.

Because serious play is still an emergent field and used in various contexts, it is sometimes branded as or referred to by other names. For instance, the University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, utilizes an array of serious play methods when dealing with complex problems, which they refer to as liberating structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usacac.army.mil/organizations/ufmcs-red-teaming | title=University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies / Red Teaming | publisher=University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies | accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to serious play is the concept of strategic play, which was the subject of a facilitator's guide book written by Jacqueline Lloyd Smith &amp; Denise Meyerson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Strategic Play: The Creative Facilitator's Guide | publisher=Wordzworth Publishing | author=Jacqueline Lloyd Smith | year=2015 | isbn=978-1783240258 | author2=Denise Meyerson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

While the concept of "serious play" may sound like an [[oxymoron]], it is the dual nature of the concept that makes it powerful. It is play with a purpose and intentionality that goes beyond simply having fun.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Statler|last2=Heracleous|last3=Jacobs|title=Serious Play as a Practice of Paradox|year=2011|doi=10.1177/0021886311398453|journal=Journal of Applied Behavioral Science|volume=47|issue=2|pages=236–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|last2=Victor|title=Towards a New Model of Strategy-making as Serious Play|year=1999|doi=10.1016/S0263-2373(99)00015-8|journal=European Management Journal|volume=17|issue=4|pages=348–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rieber|last2=Smith|last3=Noah|title=The Value of Serious Play|year=1998|journal=Educational Technology|volume=38|issue=6|pages=29–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The serious aspect requires a degree of focus on a task or challenge, while the play aspect emphasizes imagination and toying with boundaries. Together, these seemingly juxtapose components are able to foster a deeper engagement – also known as a state of flow&lt;ref name=Csikszentmyhalyi&gt;{{cite book|author=Csikszentmyhalyi, M.|title=Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience|location=New York|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|year=1990|isbn=9780060162535}}&lt;/ref&gt; where participants lose track of time and their inner critique. Being playful also enables us to better tolerate the ambiguity and uncertainty that characterizes many of the problems modern organizations face.

Using play as a way to develop adaptive human potential is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutton-Smith, B.|title=The ambiguity of play|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780674017337}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Product Design and Intentional Emergence facilitated by Serious Play", Mabogunje et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.designsociety.org/publication/27350/product_design_and_intentional_emergencefacilitated_by_serious_play | title=Product Design and Intentional Emergence facilitated by Serious Play | author=Mabogunje | year=2008 | editor=L. Roosimölder|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
summarize that "play has:

Through their non-judgmental and cross sector/hierarchy communicative approaches, serious play methods allow for solutions and connections to emerge that more rigid traditional methods had missed.

There exists an array of serious play methods – from "energizers" to prototyping methods and from open-ended, emergence-oriented interventions to goal-achievement-oriented interventions (e.g. gamification) – all of which offer different affordances in terms of knowledge creation, sharing, and conversion.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

== Characterizing different methods ==

Table 1 below characterizes five types of serious play methods, that are reoccurring in the academic literature, according to the following five parameters:

[[File:Wheel of Knowledge.png|thumb|Wheel of Knowledge]]

'''Purpose/rational:''' What is the purpose of applying the method?

'''Role(s) of the participant(s):''' Do the participants work individually or in teams? Which types of roles/activities do they engage in?

'''Level of Materiality:''' Does the method typically involve physical artifacts? Are the meaning or these literal or metaphorical? Or, in contrast, is the intervention typically delivered through a digital/virtual game or an incentive structure?

'''Degree of structure:''' Is the method explorative/open-ended? Does it allow for emergence? Or is there a "one best way" of doing the activity? Is there a quantifiable output?

'''Phase applicability:'''  In which of the phase(s) mentioned in the Wheel of Knowledge&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|first=Camilla|last=Jensen|title=Play is the Proper Prescription for Entrepreneurship|year=2016|url=http://www.pubpub.org/pub/play-is-the-proper-prescription-for-entrepreneurship|displayauthors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is this method applicable? (Socialization, Externalization, Internalization, and/or Combination).

Workshops will often use multiple serious play methods to compliment each other and allow participants to explore different applicability phases of the challenges they face.

{{nihongo|'''''Sexfriend'''''|セックスフレンド|Sekkusufurendo}} is a [[hentai]] [[computer game]] and [[anime]]. ''Sexfriend'' focuses on the [[protagonist]], Tomohiro Takabe, who has his first sexual encounter in the nurse's office after school with his classmate, Mina Hayase. He eventually desires a real romantic relationship, not just "friends with benefits." Another student, Kaori Nonomiya, sees Takabe and Hayase having sex and runs off disappointed because she loves Takabe. She eventually joins them in a threesome.

The '''Simatic S5 PLC''' is an [[automation]] system based on [[Programmable Logic Controller]]s. It was manufactured and sold by [[Siemens AG]]. Such automation systems [[systems control|control]] process equipment and machinery used in manufacturing. This [[Product lining|product line]] is considered obsolete, as the manufacturer has since replaced it with their newer [[Simatic S7 PLC]]. However, the S5 PLC still has a huge installation base in factories around the world. Most automation systems integrators still have the ability to provide support for the platform.

==Hardware==
The S5 line comes in the 90U, 95U, 101U, 100U, 105, 110, 115,115U, 135U, and 155U chassis styles. The higher the number (except for the 101U), the more sophisticated and more expensive the system. Within each chassis style, several [[CPU]]s are available, with varying speed, memory, and capabilities. Some systems provide redundant CPU operation for ultra-high-reliability control, as used in [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] [[manufacturing]], for example.

Each chassis consists of a [[power supply]], and a backplane with slots for the addition of various option boards. Available options include serial and Ethernet communications, digital input and output cards, [[analog signal processing]] boards, counter cards, and other specialized interface and function modules.

==Software==
The S5 product line is usually programmed with a PC based software programming tool called ''Step 5''. Step 5 is used for programming, testing, and commissioning, and for documentation of programs for S5 PLCs.

The original Step5 versions ran on the [[CP/M|CP/M operating system]]. Later versions ran on [[MS-DOS]], and then versions of Windows through [[Windows XP]]. The final version of Step 5 is version 7.2 (upgradable to version 7.23 Hotfix 1 with patches). No further development of this product line has occurred since that time, due to its announced obsolescence.

In addition to Step5, Siemens offered a proprietary [[State logic]] programming package called Graph5. Graph5 is a sequential [[programming language]] intended for use on machines that normally run through a series of discrete steps. It simulates a [[State machine]] on the S5 platform.

Several third-party programming environments have been released for the S5. Most closely emulate Step5, some adding macros and other minor enhancements, others functioning drastically differently from Step5. One allows Step5 programs to be cross-compiled to and from the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language and [[BASIC]].

==Structured programming==
STEP 5 allows the creation of structured or unstructured programming, from simple AND/OR operations up to complex subroutines. A STEP 5 program may, therefore, contain thousands of statements.

To maintain maximum transparency, STEP 5 offers a number of structuring facilities:
* Block technique - A linear operation sequence is divided into sections and packed into individual blocks.
* Segments - Within blocks, fine structuring is possible by programming subtasks in individual segments.
* Comments - Both a complete program as well as individual blocks or segments and individual statements can be directly provided with comments.

==Methods of representation==
STEP 5 programs can be represented in three different ways:
* Statement List (STL) - The program consists of a sequence of mnemonic codes of the commands executed one after another by the PLC.
* [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LAD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols of the [[circuit diagram]]
* [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols to DIN 40700/ DIN 40719.

Absolute or symbolic designations can be used for operands with all three methods of representation.

In LAD and FBD complex functions and function block calls can be entered via [[function key]]s. They are displayed on the screen as graphical symbols.

There are several program editors, from either genuine Siemens, or from other suppliers. Because Siemens no longer support. So, other Supplier start to develop new STEP5 version which can run on Windows XP, or Windows 7.

== Blocks==
Five types of blocks are available:
* Organization blocks (OB) - for managing the control program
* Programming blocks (PB) - contain the control program structured according to functional or process-oriented characteristics
* Sequence blocks (SB) - for programming sequential controls
* Function blocks (FB) - contain frequently occurring and particularly complex program parts
* Data blocks (DB) - for storing data required for processing the control program.

Some S5 PLCs also have block types FX (Extended Function Blocks), and DX(Extended Data Blocks); these are not distinct block types, but rather are another set of available blocks due to the CPU having more memory and addressing space.

==Operations==
STEP 5 differentiates between three types of operations: 
* Basic operations, (e.g. linking, saving, loading &amp; transferring, counting, comparing, arithmetic operations, module operations) - These can be performed in all three representations.
* Supplementary operations and complex functions, (e.g. substitution statements, testing functions, word-by-word logic operations, decrement/increment and jump functions.) - These can only be executed in STL.
* System operations (direct access the [[operating system]]) - These can only be executed in STL.

==Additional functions==
* Saving user-specific project settings
* Symbol editor
* Automatic generation and updating of [[cross-reference]] lists
* Comparison of user programs
* Transferring blocks to [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] memory modules for programmable controllers
* Rewiring inputs, outputs, flags, timers and counters
* Testing and service functions for startup and maintenance

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3316">'''Sirtuin-activating compounds''' (STAC) are chemical compounds having an effect on [[sirtuin]]s, a group of enzymes that use NAD+ to remove acetyl groups from proteins. They are [[caloric restriction mimetic]] candidates, molecules able to prevent [[aging]]-related diseases like Alzheimer's,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Context==
[[Leonard P. Guarente]] is recognized as the leading proponent of the hypothesis that caloric restriction slows aging by activation of Sirtuins.

STACs have been discovered by [[Konrad Howitz]] of Biomol Inc and biologist [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]]. In September 2003, Howitz and Sinclair et al. published a highly cited paper reporting that [[polyphenol]]s such as [[resveratrol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kaeberlein | first1 = M. | last2 = McDonagh | first2 = T. | last3 = Heltweg | first3 = B. | last4 = Hixon | first4 = J. | last5 = Westman | first5 = E.

Other examples of such products are [[butein]], [[piceatannol]], [[isoliquiritigenin]], [[fisetin]], and [[quercetin]].

Some STACs can cause artificial effects in the assay initially used for their identification, but it has been shown that STACs also activate SIRT1 against regular polypeptide substrates, with an influence of the substrate sequence.&lt;ref name=PMID23524286&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lakshminarasimhan|first1=M|last2=Rauh|first2=D|last3=Schutkowski|first3=M|last4=Steegborn|first4=C|title=Sirt1 activation by resveratrol is substrate sequence-selective|journal=Aging|volume=5|pages=151–4|pmid=23524286|issue=3|date=Mar 2013|doi=10.18632/aging.100542|pmc=3629287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PMID23471411&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubbard|first1=BP|title=Evidence for a common mechanism of SIRT1 regulation by allosteric activators|journal=Science|volume=339|pages=1216–9|pmid=23471411|doi=10.1126/science.1231097|issue=6124|date=Mar 2013|display-authors=etal|pmc=3799917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14225">The '''Smart Onboard Data Interface Module''' (SMODIM) is used by the [[United States Army]] and foreign militaries for live simulated weapons training on military platforms. The SMODIM is the primary component of the Longbow Apache Tactical Engagement Simulation System (LBA TESS) that provides weapons systems training and collective Force-on-Force live training participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, LBA TESS (Page 88) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TESS is an advanced weapons training system developed for the [[AH-64 Apache]] to support force-on-force and force-on-target live training at U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs), Aviation Home Stations, and deployed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/LBA_TESS/ |title=PEO STRI LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; TESS integrates with aircraft and ground vehicles to provide collective [[opposing force]] participation in live training.

The Aerial Weapons Scoring System (AWSS) integration with LBA TESS provides the ability to conduct force-on-target engagements using live ammunition for 30 mm gun, rockets, and simulated Hellfire missiles. Gunnery scoring is supported by the SMODIM, which transmits aviation data from the LBA to the Exercise Control (EXCON). AWSS scores the pilot’s live-fire gunnery performance and provides constructive After Action Review (AAR) feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |title=PEO STRI AWSS LBA TESS |publisher=PEO STRI |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320202151/http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/AWSS-LBA-TESS/home.jsp |archivedate=2014-03-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peostri.army.mil/PRODUCTS/2013_PEOSTRI_DSRG.pdf |title=PEO STRI Desk-Side Reference Guide, AWSS LBA TESS (Page 83) |publisher=PEO STRI |date= 2013–2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|citeseerx = 10.1.1.177.858 |title=PEO STRI Products and Services Catalog (Page 81) |publisher=PEO STRI |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed and manufactured by Inter-Coastal Electronics, Inc (ICE), "The SMODIM is fully compatible with the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System|multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)]] and laser-based direct fire weapons. Additionally, it eliminates the requirement for MILES-type lasers by providing the capability to geometrically pair weapon engagements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smodim.html |title=SMODIM - Smart Onboard Data Interface Module |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[File:Smart Onboard Data Interface Module (SMODIM).png|thumb|right|SMODIM]]

== Background ==

In 1992, Inter-Coastal Electronics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net |title=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was selected by U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cecom.army.mil |title= U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; to provide the real-time casualty assessment (RTCA) interface for the AH-64 Apache Attack Helicopter. This component was called the onboard data interface module (ODIM). As the Army incorporated new technologies, the SMODIM added GPS and telemetry and became the core component of live helicopter training systems at all U.S. Army Combat Training Centers (CTCs) with a fielding of over 240 systems. In 1997, the SMODIM was modified to provide a proof of concept for the upgraded AH-64 (D model) Longbow Apache. In 1998 the "Modular" SMODIM and the longbow tactical engagement simulation system (TESS) training system was fielded to all three CTCs and Aviation Home Stations, and became the U.S. Army's first fully integrated live aviation training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a359363.pdf |title=The Development of a Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) Plan for a Proposed Tactical Engagement Simulation System for the AH-64D Attack Helicopter |publisher=Robert A. Pupalaikis, Defense Technical Information Center |date= November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following 15&amp;nbsp;years, the SMODIM has deployed in multiple systems and platforms with over one thousand SMODIMs fielded in the U.S. and abroad. An "Advanced" SMODIM or "ASMODIM" is currently in development due to parts obsolescence and will provide an 80% increased processing performance. Security encryption is in accordance with [[FIPS 140-2]] level 2. Advanced weapon simulation is augmented by digital terrain elevation data ([[DTED]]) and geometric ranging. Data communication and data transmission upgrades utilize [[RS-422]] and [[RS-485]] full duplex channels, and [[ARINC 429]] technical standards.

== Overview ==

The SMODIM includes a built-in GPS receiver, [[telemetry]] radio, data recorder, and [[MIL-STD-1553]] mux bus processors. The SMODIM interfaces with the weapons systems and actively tracks, records and transmits data to the ground station or exercise control (EXCON). RTCA feedback is passed directly to the weapons processor and the ground station through the onboard telemetry radio. The SMODIM processes area weapons effects (AWE) data received from the EXCON and computes geometric pairing solutions for weapon engagements using the RF Hellfire, semi-automated laser (SAL) Hellfire, 30 mm chain gun, and rockets. It selects a target from its onboard player/position database in the appropriate weapons impact footprint, then uses the probability-of-hit (Ph) factor to determine the assessment (i.e., ‘hit’/‘miss’). Via the data link, it then informs the target it has been selected for assessment.

The SMODIM maintains a dynamic position database through player-to-player network communications. The onboard telemetry radio supports simultaneous distribution to multiple locations. The radio acts as a message repeater to overcome line of sight (LOS) interruptions. The SMODIM interfaces with [[distributed interactive simulation]] (DIS) networks using SMODIM tracking analysis and recording (SMOTAR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter-coastal.net/smotar.html |title=SMODIM Tracking Analysis and Recording (SMOTAR) |publisher=Inter-Coastal Electronics (ICE) |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced software suite that provides visual display and tracking of SMODIM instrumented players. GPS provides real-time position data as players are dynamically simulated, tracked and recorded over tactical maps and aerial photos for after-action review (AAR).

The TESS Aircraft System consists of an “A” kit that becomes part of the aircraft, and a “B” kit that is added to the aircraft for training exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/p350_9.pdfl |title=TESS Apache Longbow TESS B-Kit (Pages 88-89) |publisher=Headquarters Department of the Army |date= 12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “A” kit includes the SMODIM Tray Assembly, modified software in the weapons display and systems processors, with cable connection provisions. The “B” kit includes the SMODIM, Eye-Safe Laser Range Finder/Designator (ESLRF/D), TESS Gun Control Unit (TGCU), Aircraft Internal Boresight Subassembly (AIBS), TESS Training Missile (TTM) with Flash Weapon Effects Signature Simulator (FlashWESS), GPS and telemetry antennas.

The '''Stockbridge School of Agriculture''' offers Associate of Science, Bachelor of Science, and graduate degrees as an academic unit of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] campus. It was founded as part of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now University of Massachusetts Amherst) in 1918. The following Associate of Science degrees are available at Stockbridge:

* [[Arboriculture]] and Community Forest Management
* [[Equine]] Management
* Sustainable Food &amp; Farming
* Sustainable [[Horticulture]] 
* [[Landscape]] Contracting
* [[Turfgrass]] Management

The following Bachelor of Science Degrees are available:

* Sustainable Food &amp; Farming
* Sustainable Horticulture
* Turfgrass Science &amp; Management
* Plant, Soil, &amp; Insect Sciences

The following graduate degrees are offered:

* M.S. and Ph.D. in Plant Biology
* M.S. and Ph.D. in Organismic &amp; Evolutionary Biology
* M.S. and Ph.D. in Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology
* M.S. in Soil Science

The school's main facility and school symbol is [[Stockbridge Hall]], named after [[Levi Stockbridge]], a founder of Massachusetts Agricultural College and its first professor of agriculture; however, its faculty occupies various building on the University of Massachusetts campus, including Agricultural Engineering, Bowditch, Clark, Fernald, French, Stockbridge, and West Experiment Station.  Research, education, and extension activities occur at the UMass Cold Spring Orchard Research &amp; Education Center, the Hadley Farm (Stockbridge Stables), the Joseph Troll Turf Research Center, the UMass Vegetable &amp; Agronomy Research Farm, and the CNS Greenhouses.

== Athletics ==
Stockbridge has two [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) teams: basketball and golf. As a two–year school, its students are not allowed by the NCAA to play on varsity teams. Stockbridge teams compete against small four-year schools, preparatory schools, and community colleges. Stockbridge students may try out for the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association equestrian team and Intercollegiate Dressage Association team. These teams compete throughout the year with other colleges in the Northeast. Students may also take advantage of many noncompetitive recreational opportunities or participate in the University of Massachusetts' intramural program, one of the largest in the East.

== Greek life ==
[[Alpha Tau Gamma]] is the social and academic fraternity of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture. Their Chapter House is located at 118 Sunset Avenue on several acres of land near the Southwest dormitories.
There has been at several time throughout the history of the Stockbridge School of Agriculture a sorority Sigma Sigma Alpha. They are currently not active on campus.

In [[biblical studies]], the '''supplementary hypothesis''' proposes that the [[Pentateuch]] (the first five books of the bible) was derived from a series of direct additions to an existing corpus of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as a revision to the earlier [[documentary hypothesis]], which proposed that independent and complete narratives were later combined by redactors to create the Pentateuch.

The supplementary hypothesis was developed over the 19th and 20th centuries, primarily deriving from a dissatisfaction with the adequacy of the documentary hypothesis, and came to a head in the 1970s with the publication of works by [[John Van Seters]], [[Rolf Rendtorff]], and [[Hans Heinrich Schmid]]. In their book, ''An Introduction to the Bible'', Kugler and Hartin argue that "the work of John Van Seters best reflects the revival of the supplementary hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kugler &amp; Hartin|title=An Introduction to the Bible|date=2009|publisher=[[William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co.]] |location=Cambridge|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Seters’ summation of the hypothesis accepts "three sources or literary strata within the Pentateuch," which have come to be known as the [[Yahwist]] (J), the [[Priestly source|Priestly Writer]] (P), and the [[Deuteronomist]] (D). Van Seters ordered the sources chronologically as DJP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the Deuteronomist source (D) was likely written c. 700 BCE.
* the Yahwist source (J) was likely written c. 600 BCE in the [[exilic]] period.
* the Priestly source (P) was likely  written c. 400 BCE in the [[post-exilic]] period.

While the hypothesis is not the only revision of the documentary hypothesis to be made, it is one of the few at the forefront of Pentateuch studies and has been suggested by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaron|first1=David H.|title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue|date=2006|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

While documentarians originally placed the authorship of the Pentateuch in the 10th to the 7th centuries BCE, the supplementary hypothesis places the authorship of the Pentateuch later in the seventh to fifth centuries. A major driver of this reassessment has been the evolving understanding of the historical context of the early Israelites. Biblical estimates put the earliest activity of the Israelites in Canaan in the 13th century, with [[Joshua]]'s conquest. However, archeologists have found no evidence of a distinct Israelite people in the region at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein &amp; Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, archaeologists have found that most of the places referred to by name in the Bible, most notably [[Jerusalem]], reflect the realities of the 7th century, much later. If, as the archeological evidence would suggest, there was no distinct group of "Israelite" people until the seventh century, the authorship of the Pentateuch is likely to have occurred in the 7th century and later. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein &amp; Silberman|title=The Bible Unearthed|date=2001|publisher=Touchstone|location=New York|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archeological findings have caused recent Pentateuch scholars to reject earlier documentarian claims of 10th-century authorship, in favor of later authorship, as reflected in the supplementary hypothesis.

== Major divergences from the documentary hypothesis ==
[[Julius Wellhausen]], the leading proponent of the documentary hypothesis, proposed that the Pentateuch is the amalgamation of four independent and complete narratives which were combined by redactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horton|first1=Fred L.|title=A Basic Vocabulary of Biblical Studies for Beginning Students: A Work in Progress|date=2007|publisher=Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supplementary hypothesis, as outlined by Van Seters, differs from it in three major ways:

=== The existence of the Elohist (E) source ===

The supplementary hypothesis denies the existence of an extensive Elohist (E) source, one of the four independent sources described in the documentary hypothesis. Instead, it describes the Yahwist as having borrowed from an array of written and oral traditions, combining them into the J source. It proposes that because J is compiled from many earlier traditions and stories, documentarians mistook the compilation as having multiple authors: the Yahwist (J) ''and'' the Elohist (E). Instead, the supplementary hypothesis proposes that what documentarians considered J and E are in fact a single source (some use J, some use JE), likely written in the 6th century BCE.

=== The chronology of the sources ===

The supplementary hypothesis proposes that the Deuteronomist (D) was the original, and earliest, Pentateuch writer, having been written at the end of the seventh century, and ascribes the Jahwist (J) to the exilic (c. 540) and the Priestly (P) to the post-exilic (c. 400) periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aaron|first1=David H.|title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue|date=2006|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The supplementary hypothesis argues that the Deuteronomist (D) source is of the seventh century BCE. Early Pentateuch scholars, most notably [[Martin Noth]], argued that the Deuteronomist (D) was a single sixth century author explaining the events preceding the Babylonian exile theologically. In 1968 [[Frank Moore Cross]] suggested that Deuteronomist (D) actually originated from "dual-redactors," with the original Deuteronomist (Dtr1) being a seventh century author supporting Josiah's reforms, and Noth's later sixth century Deuteronomist (Dtr2) revising the earlier work, imbuing it with themes of punishment for the sinful as to explain the Babylonian exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richter|first1=Sandra L.|title=The Deuteronomistic history and the name theology|date=2002|publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "dual-redactor" view is likely the most common held among scholars today; Van Seters affirmed this view arguing that both the emphasis on seventh century reform and on sixth century exile shows that  "Deuteronomy . . . consists of an older nucleus with later expansions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the documentary hypothesis held that the Yahwist (J) was likely of the 10th century, the supplementary hypothesis puts it much later, in the 6th century, during the exilic period. That reassessment was made largely because of research conducted in the 1970s. A 1976 study by [[Hans Heinrich Schmid]] demonstrated that the Yahwist (J) was aware of earlier religious writings of the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, refuting the original assessment of J as a work of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cambell &amp; O'Brien|title=Sources of the Pentateuch: texts, introductions, annotations.|date=1993|publisher=Frotress Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Seters argues that the Yahwist (J) used "fragments, some in literary form, others as popular motifs and stories" to create a theological creation story, expanding upon the Deuteronomist's established corpus of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the post-exilic period, he theorizes that there was an established theological work (DJ) created by the Deutoronomist (D) and Yahwist (J). 

Van Seters argues that the Priestly source (P) is not independent from the Yahwist source (J) but indeed relies heavily upon it. If J is ascribed to the exilic period, P must be of the post-exilic, or [[Second Temple]], period, likely in the 5th century. This reassessment of chronology places the Deuteronomist as the first writer (DJP) whereas the documentary hypothesis places the Deuteronomist as a later writer (JEDP).

=== Independence of the Yahwist and Priestly sources ===

Whereas the documentary hypothesis proposed that the four Pentateuch sources were complete and independent accounts, Van Seters writes that the supplementary hypothesis "does not view the later sources J and P as independent documents but as direct additions to the earlier corpus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis proposed that the Deuteronomist is the only independent source and that the Yahwist (J) is a reply to the Deuteronomic explanation of the Exile and a "confessional reformulation" as a theological corrective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kugler &amp; Hartin|title=An Introduction to the Bible|date=2009|publisher=William B. Eerdman's Publishing Co.|location=Cambridge|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the hypothesis views the Priestly (P) source as non-independent as well. Because many P texts, Van Seters argues, "do not make sense without the larger J context," the Priestly writer is viewed as a redactor of J. A major consequence of this view that the later two sources are not independent is the removal of the need for redactors to explain the cohesion of the Penteteuch. Van Seters writes, “Since there are no separate sources after the first one, there is no need for redactors. The elaborate system of multiple redactors used by current documentarians is unnecessary.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Seters|first1=John|title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary|date=1999|publisher=t&amp;t clark|location=New York|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">'''Time-triggered architecture''' (abbreviated as '''TTA'''), also known as a '''time-triggered system''', is a computer system that executes one or more sets of tasks according to a pre-determined and set task schedule.&lt;ref name="PTTES"&gt;Pont, M.J. (2001) "Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems", Addison-Wesley / ACM Press.  {{ISBN|0-201-331381}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of a TT system will typically involve use of a single interrupt that is linked to the periodic overflow of a timer.  This interrupt may drive a task scheduler (a restricted form of [[real-time operating system]]).  The scheduler will{{mdashb}}in turn{{mdashb}}release the system tasks at predetermined points in time.&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

== History and development ==

Because they have highly deterministic timing behaviour, TT systems have been used for many years to develop [[safety-critical]] aerospace and related systems.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, N. J. (1991) "The static analysis of a safety-critical avionics control system", in Corbyn, D.E. and Bray, N. P. (Eds.) "Air Transport Safety: Proceedings of the Safety and Reliability Society Spring Conference, 1991" Published by SaRS, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of TT systems was popularised by the publication of ''Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems'' (PTTES) in 2001&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt; and the related introductory book ''Embedded C'' in 2002.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;Pont, M.J. (2002) "Embedded C", Addison-Wesley.  {{ISBN|0-201-79523-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The PTTES book also introduced the concepts of time-triggered hybrid schedulers (an architecture for time-triggered systems that require task pre-emption) and shared-clock schedulers (an architecture for distributed time-triggered systems involving multiple, synchronised, nodes).&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

Since publication of PTTES, extensive research work on TT systems has been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Athaide, K.F., Pont, M.J. and Ayavoo, D. (2008) "Deploying a time-triggered shared-clock architecture in a multiprocessor system-on-chip design", in Proceedings of the 4th UK Embedded Forum (September 2008, Southampton, UK).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayavoo, D., Pont, M.J., Short, M. and Parker, S. (2007) "Two novel shared-clock scheduling algorithms for use with CAN-based distributed systems", Microprocessors and Microsystems, 31(5): 326–334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan, K.L. and Pont, M.J. (2010) "Real-time non-invasive detection of timing-constraint violations in time-triggered embedded systems", Proceedings of the 7th IEEE International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems, Bradford, UK, 2010, pp.1978–1986. Published by IEEE Computer Society. {{ISBN|978-0-7695-4108-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gendy, A.K. and Pont, M.J. (2008) "Automatically configuring time-triggered schedulers for use with resource-constrained, single-processor embedded systems", IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, 4(1): 37–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Z.M. and Pont, M.J. (2008) "Reducing the impact of task overruns in resource-constrained embedded systems in which a time-triggered software architecture is employed", Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, Vol. 30: pp.427–450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phatrapornnant, T. and Pont, M.J. (2006) "Reducing jitter in embedded systems employing a time-triggered software architecture and dynamic voltage scaling", IEEE Transactions on Computers, 55(2): 113–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current applications ==

Time-triggered systems are now commonly associated with international safety standards such as [[IEC 61508]] (industrial systems), [[ISO 26262]] (automotive systems), [[IEC 62304]] (medical systems) and [[IEC 60730]] (household goods).

== Alternatives ==

Time-triggered systems can be viewed as a subset of a more general event-triggered (ET) system architecture (see [[event-driven programming]]).

Implementation of an ET system will typically involve use of multiple interrupts, each associated with specific periodic events (such as timer overflows) or aperiodic events (such as the arrival of messages over a communication bus at random points in time).  ET designs are traditionally associated with the use of what is known as a [[real-time operating system]] (or RTOS), though use of such a software platform is not a defining characteristic of an ET architecture.&lt;ref name="PTTES"/&gt;

'''Tropical geography''' refers to the study of places and people in the [[tropics]]. When it first emerged as a discipline, tropical geography was closely associated with [[imperialism]] and [[colonial expansion]] of the [[Colonial empire|European empires]] as contributing scholars tended to portray the [[tropical]] places as "primitive" and people "uncivilised" and "inferior".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. "Illusory Riches": Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950. ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography''. 21(1), 2000, 6-18.&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of subjects has been discussed within the sub-field during late 18th to early 20th century including zoology, climatology, geomorphology, economics and cultural studies.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, H.R., 1977. ''Tropical geography: An introductory study of the humid tropics'', Macdonald and Evans,p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discipline is now more commonly known as [[development geography]] as [[colonization]] had been replaced by [[economic development]] as the main ideological driver of international and global interactions since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Gallaher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Carolyn |author-link1=Carolyn Gallaher |last2=Dahlman |first2=Carl T. |last3=Gilmartin |first3=Mary |last4=Mountz |first4=Alison |last5=Shirlow |first5=Peter |date=2009 |title=Key Concepts in Political Geography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpBJclVnVdQC&amp;pg=PA118 |publisher=SAGE |location=London |pages=392 |isbn=978-1-4129-4672-8 |oclc= |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|118}} Today, many scholars continue to use the term tropical geography to contest the determinism embedded in the term and de-exoticise the tropical countries and their inhabitants.

==Origins==
The origins of tropical geography can be traced back to as early as the fifteenth century when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] first discovered the Caribbean islands in tropical America. Subsequent writings of European explorers, merchants, naturalists, colonists and settlers who traveled to and lived in the tropics were the main sources of the study.

[[Alexander von Humboldt]], [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] are some of the significant contributors. It is argued that it is due to their academic reputation and scientific approaches tropical geography was consolidated into an academic discipline widely studied in Europe in spite of the region's vast differences in vegetation, wild lives, climate, geology and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. pp9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Troubled Representations==

The discourse on the tropics and their inhabitants have evolved over time in response to changing patterns of Europe's engagements in the tropics.

A variety of [[environmental determinism]] emerged from the sub-field as colonists and naturalists started representing temperate and tropical people with [[binaries]] like "progressive vs. backward," "civilised vs. primitive," "hard working vs. lazy" and "superior vs. inferior."&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, p177"&gt;Gilmartin, Mary, 2008. p177.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]], an invented concept, was convenient and readily applied in attempts to "[link] climatic variation closely to the supposed division of the human species into different 'races'".&lt;ref name="Gilmartin, p177" /&gt;

As activities of the European empires diversified in the 19th century, travelers and settlers who had experienced deadly tropical diseases and conflicts with the local peoples forged another representation of the tropical world as a place full of "dangers" and "horrors" to mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, David, 2000. p10.&lt;/ref&gt; The fertile lands of the tropics were then interpreted as to have  obstacles for human morality and physical well-being preventing their inhabitants from technical, philosophical and artistic innovation. This dramatized and pessimistic representation reinforced Europe's superior position and enhanced the depiction of the tropics as an exotic other to the temperate world.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, V.R., 2004. Topicality Imagined and Experienced. ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography'', 25(1), 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether tropical geographers found the tropical places and people abundant and dynamic or deadly and barbaric. They understood them as inferior to the temperate and great Western civilizations. As criticized by [[Edward Said]] in his famous work ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', the literature of tropical geography served the interests of European scholars who were living in the temperate world to create an exotic other which in turn helped define themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward W., 2007. "Latent and Manifest Orientalism." ''Race and Racialization: Essential Readings.'' pp45-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today's tropical geography==

Until the mid 20th century, the imperialist, racist and Euro-centric version of tropical geography was still flourishing as influential works were still being published like ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' by geomorphologist [[Pierre Gourou]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, D. et al., 2009. ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'' 5th ed., Wiley-Blackwell, p.777.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1950's onward, [[development geography]] replaced tropical geography as the sub-field of geography.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, J. &amp; Jeffrey, A. 2009. "Imperialism and Postcolonialism". ''Political Geography'' 2nd ed. Sage, London. pp169-195.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the studied regions were given new terminologies such as the "[[Third World]]" and the "[[global South]]."

Critical geographers argue the replacement of tropical geography by development geography marks the historical turning point of international intervention strategy from [[colonisation]] to [[economic development]].&lt;ref name="Lawson, p70"&gt;Lawson, Victoria, 2007. "Development as Intervention: From Modernisation to Neo-liberalisation." Making Development Geography. Hodder Arnold. p70.&lt;/ref&gt; Though morphed into a different discipline, the ideological roots of tropical geography—superiority, progress, civilization and technological advancement of the West which originated and matured in the [[temperate]] zone—carry on and become the building blocks of mainstream economic development theories.&lt;ref name="Lawson, p70" /&gt;

Paralleled with the rise of critical approaches to other sub-fields of geography, [[development geography]] and tropical geography as academic disciplines have seen a movement away from the mainstream economistic and deterministic view of the tropical world in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, Victoria, 2007. "Development as Situated Knowledge." ''Making Development geography.'' Hodder Arnold. pp10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers now attend to the influences imperialism, racism and Euro-centrism have had on tropical geography while attempting to bring class, gender, race and religion into the broader picture to better understand the tropical world and its inhabitants.
 
Today the [[academic journal]] ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography''&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography. Available at: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1467-9493 [Accessed November 23, 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; continues to be a forum for tropical geographers to introduce and present new research and critique existing literature on the tropical world and people. Different from the historic absence of voices from the tropics, now many of the contributors of the ''Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography'' are of tropical origins and study tropical countries and their citizens with more holistic and inclusive approaches.

UBC iSchool (Library, Archival and Information Studies) is a graduate school at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]] offering a Master of Archival Studies (MAS), a Master of Arts in Children's Literature (MACL), a Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS), a DUAL Master of Archival Studies/Master of Library and Information Studies (MASLIS) and a Doctor of Philosophy in Library, Archival and Information Studies (Ph.D.). Founded in 1961 as the School of Librarianship, the iSchool is currently located in the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. The school changed its name in 2018, but was previously known as the '''School of Library, Archival and Information Studies''' ('''SLAIS''' or '''SLAIS, The [[Information school|iSchool]] at UBC''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slais.ubc.ca/2018/06/ubc-ischool-has-a-new-name/ |title="UBC iSchool has a new name." |date=June 2018 |access-date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UBC iSchool is an internationally ranked, multi-disciplinary school, ranked first in Canada, and fourth in the world for graduate education in library and information management.&lt;ref&gt;QS Rankings. https://slais.ubc.ca/2018/08/ubcs-ischool-ranked-number-one-in-canada-for-library-and-information-studies/. "UBC’s iSchool ranked number one in Canada for library and information studies, and fourth in the world." Accessed August 14, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;


==Academic Programs==
UBC iSchool offers four master's degrees and a doctoral degree. Students can also specialize in the First Nations Curriculum Concentration if they want to work with, or within Indigenous knowledge organizations. &lt;ref&gt;UBC iSchool. "First Nations Curriculum Concentration." https://slais.ubc.ca/programs/specializations/fncc/. Accessed August 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Archival Studies''' and '''Master of Library and Information Studies''' degrees are 48-credit programs, consisting primarily of coursework, with an optional 12-credit thesis option.

The '''Master of Archival Studies''' degree program follows the guidelines for archival education published by the Association of Canadian Archivists and the Society of American Archivists. The degree program began in 1981 and was the first stand-alone degree program in [[archival science]] in Canada or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Eastwood, Terry. "Archival Research: the University of British Columbia Experience." ''The American Archivist'' 63 (Fall/Winter 2006): 243-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Library and Information Studies''' degree is accredited by the American Library Association. The degree was first offered in 1995 and superseded the Master of Library Studies, which had been offered since 1971. Prior to that, the school offered a one-year [[Bachelor of Library Science]].&lt;ref&gt;About UBC iSchool. https://slais.ubc.ca/about/about-the-ischool/highlights/ "Highlights."] Accessed August 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dual Master of Archival Studies/Master of Library and Information Studies''' program enables students to earn both the MAS and MLIS degrees within three to five years, following the completion of 81 credits.

The '''Master of Arts in Children's Literature''' is a 30-credit interdisciplinary program, composed of courses from the departments of English, French, Language and Literacy Education, Theatre and SLAIS.

The '''Doctor of Philosophy in Library, Archival and Information Studies''' program was introduced in 2003, with Archival Studies and Library and Information Studies streams.

==Research==
Research is clustered in three core areas: management and preservation of digital records, creation and use of cultural materials, and digital information systems and information interaction. The International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Project focuses on the authenticity of born-digital records in records management programs and archives. The Centre for the Investigation of Financial Electronic Records (CiFER) studies issues relevant to the management of financial records, including risk management, security and e-discovery. The Digital Information Interaction Group (DiiG) brings together researchers and students engaged in the study of human interaction with digital information objects, collections of digital media, and digital information systems.

=== New Media ===
At the iSchool, a number of faculty do research in the [[new media]] space: Internet research, online social networks, e-learning, new media literacy, youth and new media, e-books, social media, open data and government, user engagement, social tagging, researchers on GRAND (Graphics, Animation and New Media), as well as faculty associated with the Faculty of Art’s Bachelor of Media Studies.

=== Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) ===
[[Human–computer interaction|HCI]] is necessarily an interdisciplinary field, engaging researchers who design, build, test, evaluate and examine the impact of new computer implementations for individual, group and community use across levels of skill, ability, and facility with technology. It addresses multiple contexts from work to learning and includes both fixed and mobile technologies and applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://hci.ubc.ca/about-hciubc/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural Heritage ===
Collection, preservation, access and use in library, archival and museum contexts, as augmented and challenged by [[digitization]], digital production (‘born digital’ materials), participatory culture, and access through contemporary media. [[Cultural heritage management|Cultural Heritage Management]] addresses what in the cultural realm will be retained, by whom, in what manner, and with what access (i.e. whose history will be digitized, retained and made available). Research addresses both traditional and newly emerging contexts. It includes new access protocols and technologies for physical and digitized cultural artifacts held in traditional institutions, documentation, preservation, and sustainability of cultural knowledge and practices. For example, professors and students from the iSchool at UBC work with the [[Irving K. Barber Learning Centre]] and others to support the [http://www.indigitization.ca Indigitization] program, which provides funding and training for Indigenous communities and organizations to digitize cultural heritage materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slais.ubc.ca/research/current-research-projects/|title=Current Research Projects {{!}} SLAIS, the iSchool @ UBC|website=slais.ubc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indigitization.ca/|title=Indigitization {{!}} Toolkit for the Digitization of First Nations Knowledge|website=www.indigitization.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Records and Information Management ===
[[Archival science]] is concerned broadly with the creation and preservation of representations of transactions (i.e., [[Records management|records]] and [[Archive|archives]]) that can provide information and evidence about past activities of individuals and organizations. Archival Science explores the theoretical and practical conditions that lead to, or work against, creation and preservation of persistent and trustworthy records and archives. It also touches on issues of representation, openness, transparency, privacy, security, accountability, internal control, compliance and risk and risk management.

=== Children and Young Adult Literature and Services ===
This research depends on a multi-disciplinary approach bringing an understanding of child development, cognition, literacy, and literary analysis to bear on creative and critical evaluation of [[children's literature]] and [[young adult literature]] in traditional and new media formats.&lt;ref&gt;http://macl.arts.ubc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UniversityOfVenda.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the University of Venda]]

The '''University of Venda''' ('''UNIVEN''') is a [[South Africa]]n Comprehensive rural based [[university]], located in [[Thohoyandou]] in [[Limpopo]] province. It was established in 1982 under the then Republic of Venda government.

==History==

It was established in 1982 to serve the inhabitants of the [[Venda]] [[bantustan]], however, the student body at Univen never consisted of Venda students only, student from all over the Northern Transvaal attended the Institution. After the end of [[apartheid]] and the re-integration of the bantustans into South Africa, Univen student body were drawn from all over South Africa. With the South African government's programme of tertiary education reform in the new millennium, Univen became a "[[comprehensive university]]", offering both theoretically oriented and practically oriented courses.

==Campus==
The University of Venda has one main Campus in [[Thohoyandou]]. The Campus houses all seven faculties of the institution namely 
*The School of Agriculture, 
*School of Education, 
*School of Environmental Science, 
*School of Health Sciences, 
*School of Human and Social Sciences, 
*School of Management Sciences, 
*School of Mathematical and Natural Sciences,
*The Univen School of Law.

The campus also houses the Art Gallery, which has a display of carvings, paintings and clay pots made by both students and local community members. Furthermore, the campus has a full-time Sport Center that is used for indoor Sports as well as other recreational activities such as drama and dance.

The main campus houses nine of the eleven official residences, namely Bernard Ncube, Carousel, F3, F4, F5, Lost City Boys, Lost City Girls, Mango Groove, Riverside and Prefab.

==Student Representative Assembly==
The representative student body of the University of Venda is made up an 84-member [[parliament]] styled structure. it is led by a 14-member cabinet also known as the SRC executive. The assembly can be further divided into three: the first sub-division is the cabinet that is led by the president, then the deputy president, the secretary-general, the deputy secretary general, there are nine ministerial portfolios as followed; Ministry of Campus and off Campus Housing, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, Bursaries and Projects, Ministry of Gender and people with Disabilities, Ministry of Health, Safety and Security, Ministry of Information, External Affairs and International Relations, Ministry of Legal, Policies, and Constitutional Affairs, Ministry of Religion, Culture, Arts and Heritage, Ministry of Sports and Recreation, and with the equivanlence of a ministry there is the Chairperson of the Post Graduate Council. the second sub-division of the SRA is the Structures, these are made up of four-person executives of the Disabled Student Council (DSC), the Housing Representative Council (HRC), the Sports, Recreation and Cultural Committee (SRCC) and the School Councils from all seven faculties of the University. The third sub-division is the parliament which is composed of committees under each ministerial position.

Each member of the SRC is forwarded to parliament by a student formation they belong to except the third sub-division of the [[Student Representative Council]] who campaign independently. the [[Speaker of Parliament]] is voted in on the first sitting of Parliament by the house. the student parliament sits four times a year, once each quarter of the year.
The Univen SRA is composed of members from different formations, the recognized [[student formations]] on campus are: [[AZAPO]] Student Convention (AZASCO), [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] Student Organization, [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] Student Command (EFFSC), [[Pan-Africanist]] Student Movement of Azania (PASMA), [[South African Student Congress]] (SASCO) and the Student Christian Organization (SCO).

Each organization contests in the general elections to deploy members to the SRA, the term of office is one year, the period begins after annual election that are held during late September or early October.
The current head of the SRA is acting President Miss Nokuthula Mabuza after the suspension of the president in the beginning of the second semester.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">The '''William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute''' is a research institute in the [[University of Minnesota College of Science and Engineering]]. FTPI was largely the work of physics Professor Emeritus, [[Stephen Gasiorowicz]] and University alumnus and Twin-Cities real-estate developer William I. Fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/inventingtomorrow/docs/v32_n2_spring_2008_inventing_tomorrow UMN, CSE Inventing Tomorrow, Spring/Summer 2008, Vol. 32, 2., P.32-33]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute officially came into existence in January 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/august-2007/donors-big-dream Symmetry Magazine, August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; FTPI faculty consists of seven permanent members: [[Alex Kamenev]], [[Keith Olive]], [[Mikhail Shifman]], [[Boris Shklovskii]], [[Arkady Vainshtein]], [[Mikhail Voloshin]], and [[Andrey V. Chubukov]] as well as postdoctoral and graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/people/ William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute People]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute''' has on Oversight Committee consisting of 8 members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/people/oscomm.html William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute People OSC]&lt;/ref&gt; The Oversight Committee is essentially a board of directors that make decisions concerning the staffing and budgeting of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/44/2/10.1063/1.2809991 Physics Today, February 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach ==

'''The Misel Family Lecture Series'''

The Irving and Edythe Misel Family Lecture Series, hosted by FTPI, invites physicists from around the world to the University of Minnesota to discuss physics with the general public.  It is funded by a generous gift from the Edythe and Irving Misel family. The list of the Misel Lecturers to date is:
2006: [[Frank Wilczek]] (2004 Nobel Prize in Physics), 2007: [[Leo Kadanoff]] (1980 Wolf Prize), 2008: [[Jim Peebles]] (1982 Heineman Prize), 2009: [[Helen Quinn]] (2000 Dirac Medal), 2010: [[N. David Mermin]] (2010 Majorana Prize), 2011: [[Roger Blandford]] (1998 Heineman Prize), 2012: [[John Ellis (physicist)|John Ellis]] (2005 Dirac Medal), 2013: [[Eric Cornell]] (2001 Nobel Prize in Physics), 2014: [[Andrei Linde]] (2012 Fundamental Physics Prize), 2015: [[Joseph Polchinski]] (2008 [[Dirac Medal]] and 2017 [[Fundamental Physics Prize]]), 2016: [[John Preskill]] (member of the [[National Academy of Science]]): 2017: [[Wendy Freedman]] (2016 [[Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/misel/ William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute Misel]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visitor Program'''

FTPI has a worldwide reach. The Institute has hosted over 800 individual researchers, from institutions in more than 18 different countries, for working visits of one day to six months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/inventingtomorrow/docs/v32_n2_spring_2008_inventing_tomorrow UMN, CSE Inventing Tomorrow, Spring/Summer 2008, Vol. 32, 2., P.32-33]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workshops'''

FTPI hosts up to three workshops per year for physicists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/workshops/ William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute Workshops]&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the 2013 CAQCD meeting which was special because it was the tenth meeting in the series. The proceedings of the previous conferences – they are held biannually – reveal the developments of QCD and related theories from the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/54389/2 CERN Courier, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as a workshop in October 2000 celebrating 30 years of supersymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28388 CERN Courier, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

Current and former faculty members of FTPI have been honored with a number of prizes and awards. Keith Olive is a current Distinguished McKnight University Professor of Physics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/awards/mcknight/mcknight_distinguished.html UMN Distinguished McKnight University Professor]&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the 2018 [[Hans Bethe Prize]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?last_nm=Olive&amp;first_nm=Keith&amp;year=2018 APS Prizes and Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; Former faculty, Leonid Glazman was a McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftpi.umn.edu/about/ About FTPI]&lt;/ref&gt; Boris Shklovskii is the recipient of the 1986 Landau Award &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.umn.edu/about/awards.html UMN Physics Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arkady Vainshtein]] and [[Mikhail Shifman]] were awarded the 2016 [[Dirac Medal and Prize]]. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/prizes-awards/the-dirac-medal/the-medallists/dirac-medallists-2016.aspx Dirac Medallists 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three faculty members have been awarded the [[Sakurai Prize]]: [[Arkady Vainshtein]] (1999), [[Mikhail Shifman]] (1999), and [[Mikhail Voloshin]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/sakurai.cfm APS Sakurai Prize ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arkady Vainshtein]] (2005) and [[Mikhail Shifman]] (2013) received the [[Pomeranchuk Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itep.ru/eng/?pprize.html ITEP Pomeranchuk Prize ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Shifman]] was honored with the [[Lilienfeld Prize]] (2006),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/lilienfeld.cfm APS Lilienfeld Prize ]&lt;/ref&gt; and elected as Laureate of Les Chaires Internacionales de Recherche Blaise Pascal(2007)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.umn.edu/about/awards.html UMN Physics Awards ]&lt;/ref&gt; Former member Anatoly Larkin was awarded the [[Fritz London Memorial Prize]] in Low Temperature Physics (1990),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phy.duke.edu/~hm/flondonprizeawards.html Duke Physics Fritz London Memorial Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; the Hewlett Packard Europhysics Prize (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?first_nm=Anatoly&amp;last_nm=Larkin&amp;year=2002 APS Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lars Onsager Prize]] in Theoretical Statistical Physics (2002)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/onsager.cfm APS Lars Onsager Prize]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Bardeen Prize for Superconductivity (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m2s-2012.org/john-bardeen-prize/ Bardeen Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute is financed from a combination of private and University funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/40/2/10.1063/1.2819908 Physics Today February 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of fundamental-science research institutes, FTPI is, for its part, something of an oddity. While most such organizations are large, National Science Foundation-funded enterprises, Minnesota's FTPI was created in large part out of the generosity of a single private donor, and it is dedicated to the research efforts of its members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.highbeam.com/137256/article-1G1-55128657/worlds-apart Mpls-St. Paul Magazine 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Energy]] ER40823 grant is mutually submitted between the Department of Physics at the [[University of Minnesota]] and FTPI. This grant is entitled "Experimental and Theoretical High Energy Physics" and helps to support faculty and postdoctoral salaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.energy.gov/funding-opportunities/award-search/ DOE Grant Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;
