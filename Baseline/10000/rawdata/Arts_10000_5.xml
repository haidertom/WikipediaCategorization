Caminero later tells the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' that he destroyed the vase "for all the local artists in Miami that have never been shown in museums here."

Later Wei Wei told the ''[[New York Times]]'' "The argument does not support the act"... " It doesn't sound right. his argument doesn’t make much sense. If he really had a point, he should choose another way, because this will bring him trouble to destroy property that does not belong to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/arts/design/ai-weiwei-vase-destroyed-by-protester-at-miami-museum.html | work=The New York Times | first=Nick | last=Madigan | title=Ai Weiwei Vase Is Destroyed by Protester at Miami Museum | date=February 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caminero also told police that he had been inspired by Wei Wei's own performance piece and tryptych "[[Ai Wei Wei#Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn|Dropping a Han Dynasty Urn]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-case-of-the-million-dollar-broken-vase&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''9 by 5 Impression Exhibition''''' was an [[art exhibition]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia. The exhibition was opened on 17 August 1889 in Buxton's Rooms on [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston Street]] and featured 183 works; the majority of which were painted by the [[Australian Impressionism|Australian impressionists]] [[Tom Roberts]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Arthur Streeton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16872">The '''architecture of Taiwan''' can be traced back to [[stilt house|stilt housing]] of the aborigines in [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]; to the building of fortresses and churches in the north and south used to colonize and convert the inhabitants during the [[Dutch Taiwan|Dutch]] and [[Spanish Taiwan|Spanish]] period; the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning]] period when Taiwan was a base of [[anti-Qing sentiment]] and Minnan-style architecture was introduced; in [[Qing dynasty]] period, a mix of Chinese and Western architecture appeared and [[artillery battery]] flourished during Qing's [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]; During the [[Japanese rule of Taiwan]], the Minnan, [[Japanese culture|Japanese]] and [[Western culture|Western]] culture were main influencers in architectural designs and saw the introduction and use of [[reinforced concrete]]. Due to excessive Westernization as a colony, after the [[Retrocession Day|retrocession of Taiwan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in 1945 from Japan at the end of World War II, Chinese classical style became popular and entered into international mainstream as a postmodern design style. Today, Taiwanese architecture has undergone much diversification, every style of architecture can be seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/history/history.htm {{zh icon}} History of Taiwanese architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prehistory (-1621) ==
{{Main|Prehistory of Taiwan}}
The architecture of prehistoric Taiwan saw structures ranging from [[cave|cave dwellings]], [[stilt house|stilt housing]], to [[stone masonry]]. Primarily of [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.wunan.com.tw/download/preview/1wb5.pdf {{zh icon}} Pre-historic Taiwanese architecture, National Chiayi University - Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Cave Dwelling===
Prehistoric man made use of caves for their dwellings and Taiwan's oldest known civilization is the [[Changbin culture]] (長濱文化) dating back to over 50,000 years. An example of an [[archaeological site]] of a cave dwelling is the [[Bashian Caves]] in [[Changbin, Taitung|Changbin Township]], [[Taitung County]] which is dated from between 5,500 and 30,000 years. The actual cave itself has a height of around ten [[metre|meters]] and can accommodate some ten persons.

===Stilt Housing===
{{Main|Stilt house}}
Spread over the vast prehistoric [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Indian Ocean]] areas, stilt houses vary greatly. In more recent times, Taiwanese aborigines make use of them for holding church meetings, as places to cool down and to hold ancestral activities. Apart from their cooling effect, stilt houses also have various functions such as avoiding [[miasma theory|miasma]], dampness, flood, and insects and snakes from entering, it is also easier to construct.

===Stone Slab Housing===
[[File:Paiwan.jpg|right|thumb|Stone slab house of the [[Paiwan people|Paiwan tribe]] taken by Japanese anthropologist [[Ushinosuke Mori]] prior to 1945.]]

The [[Paiwan people|Paiwan]] and [[Bunun people|Bunun]] tribes made houses using thatched roofing and made walls from stones, homes of nobles were decorated with elaborate wood carvings. The special characteristics of such houses is that dark colored building materials help conceal the buildings in its environment and the layered use of rocks mimic the scales of the [[Deinagkistrodon|hundred pacer snake]] that they worship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-tribe.org.tw/kungdavane/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabId=100 {{zh icon}} Kungdavane - Dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aboriginal Architecture===
{{Main|Taiwanese aborigines}}
Chinese and aborigines made use of natural materials for basic construction materials such as straw, wood, bamboo, grass, stone, soil, etc. The types and styles vary depending on the environment, climate, and cultural influences of each tribe. For example, the [[Amis people|Amis]] tribe tend to live in larger communities and planned the layout of their community such as placement of communal homes and a plaza for matters of governance inside, planting a bamboo forest around the outside with camps and guard stations to defend against foreign aggressors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Aborigines/Article.aspx?CategoryID=3&amp;ClassID=10&amp;TypeID=24&amp;SubTypeID=0&amp;RaceID=1 {{zh icon}} Building structures of the Amis tribe, Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atayal people|Atayal]] and [[Saisiyat people|Saisiyat]] tribes made their homes out of wood and bamboo while the [[Tao people|Tao]] tribe who live further away on [[Orchid Island]] and faced strong changes in seasonal weather such as typhoons, developed houses that made use of digging vertically into the ground to strengthen their foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmtip.gov.tw/Aborigines/Article.aspx?CategoryID=3&amp;ClassID=10&amp;TypeID=24&amp;SubTypeID=2&amp;RaceID=12 {{zh icon}} Housing layout of the Yami (Tao) tribe, Digital Museum of Taiwan Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Chihkan Tower 03.JPG|[[Fort Provintia]] was a bastion structure, the remains of which are now known as Chihkan Tower.
File:Atlas Blaeu-Van der Hem - Taioan.jpg|[[Anping District|Taioan Street]] (大員市街) was built by the Dutch and is now the present day Yanping Street (延平街) in Anping District, Tainan.
File:Official consulate fort santo domingo.jpg|[[Fort San Domingo]] was built by the Spanish in 1628 and after their defeat was rebuilt by the Dutch. It is known as Âng-mn̂g-siâⁿ (Red-haired Fort) after the Dutch people.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[16th century]] was a time of Western naval navigation, exploration and trade and also the shifting of power from the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. Most of the architecture in Taiwan from this period were dominated by fortresses, primarily the Dutch Fengguiwei Fort (風櫃尾城), [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]], [[Fort Provintia]] in the south and the Spanish [[Fort San Domingo]] to the north. The Dutch used red bricks in construction while the Spanish used stone. Both sides made use of ports and constructed fortresses to consolidate their power on the island. The fortresses were square shaped with an additional side for the installment of [[artillery]]. This period saw Taiwan architecture enter the peak of [[western culture|Western colonization]]. Such structures from this period represent the first generation of architectural works and is now listed as a world heritage by the Republic of China government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dm.ncyu.edu.tw/vr/vr02_map/001/001-02.htm {{zh icon}} Origins of Tamsui's Fort Zeelandia]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''art blog''' is a common type of [[blog]] that comments on art.  More recently, as with other types of blogs, some art blogs have taken on 'web 2.0' social networking features.  Art blogs that adopt this sort of change can develop to become a source of information on art events (listings and maps), a way to share information and images, or virtual meeting ground.

Art blogs entries cover different topics, from art critiques and commentary to insider art world gossip, auction results, art news, personal essays, portfolios, interviews, artists’ journals, art marketing advice and artist biographies. Some artists use art blogs as a form of new media art project.

Art blogs may also serve as a forum to reach out to anybody interested in art — be it painting, sculpture, print making, creative photography, video art, conceptual art or new media. In this way, they may be visited not only for the practitioners of different forms of art, but also collectors, connoisseurs, and critics.

==Mainstream media==
In 2011, art critic [[Brian Sherwin]] interviewed art critic Mat Gleason of [[Coagula Art Journal]] for Faso.com's FineArtViews blog. The interview between Sherwin and Gleason focused on [[contemporary art]] criticism and the role of art blog’s in present-day [[art criticism]] among other issues. Gleason suggested to Sherwin that art blogs and the development of new media have become a "''blow''" to traditional print art magazines. Gleason and Sherwin also discussed how [[bloggers]] form a "''pack mentality''" based on region and perceived significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faso.com/fineartviews/27987/fineartviews-interview-mat-gleason-art-critic-and-founder-of-coagula-art-journal "FineArtViews Interview: Mat Gleason -- Art Critic and Founder of Coagula Art Journal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218141116/http://faso.com/fineartviews/27987/fineartviews-interview-mat-gleason-art-critic-and-founder-of-coagula-art-journal |date=18 December 2011 }}, Faso.com - FineArtViews. Retrieved 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/26/fineartsviews-interviews-_n_828719.html "FineArtViews Interviews Mat Gleason, Art Critic/Founder of Coagula"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420061624/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/26/fineartsviews-interviews-_n_828719.html |date=20 April 2012 }}, Huffington Post. Retrieved 7 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2009, Art Connect produced an in-depth interview by Peter Cowling for [[Art Connect]] and Jessica Palmer of [[Bioephemera]].  The interview, titled It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know,&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, Peter and Palmer, Jessica, "It is not Really Bloggers vs. Journalists, You Know", April 2009 {{cite web|url=http://www.loveart-gallery.com/art-blog-reviews/2009/04/27/extraordinary-art-blogs-series-part-seven-it-is-not-really-bloggers-vs-journalists-you-know |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701133911/http://www.loveart-gallery.com/art-blog-reviews/2009/04/27/extraordinary-art-blogs-series-part-seven-it-is-not-really-bloggers-vs-journalists-you-know/ |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; pointed to five trends that were shaping the communication and discussion of art on the internet, and that the real picture was much bigger than just the bloggers vs. journalists that had been discussed to date.  These five points were:

* Media convergence will continue to improve consumer choice, providing a better match between desire and availability.
* Content producers are just that.  Consumers care less about how and where they can get the content they want.  What they do consistently care about is the quality of the content, and whether the content is produced to their timescales.
* The content producer-to-content consumer relationship is changing.  Requests for feedback and further debate have been partially overtaken by things like conversations, and further fragmentation will certainly occur.
* Information technology and systems, provided as commodity (pay-as-you-go) services.  Such services range from processing and storage, through to credit card processing and super-fast content delivery.
* The economic downrun.

On January 8, 2009, Regina Hackett, art critic of the [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]], noted in her article Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia &lt;ref&gt;Hackett, Regina, "Art Blogs Hit Wikipedia." ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', January 2009. {{cite web |url=http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/159041.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720231949/http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/art/archives/159041.asp |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that commercially run, mainstream media supported, art blogs face issues of acceptance among the independent art blogging community.

On January 7, 2009, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' art critic Martha Schwendener suggests that art blogs have helped shape a more laissez-faire climate for art writing. "Art blogs have created a new, largely unedited, admirably 'unprofessional'—hence, democratic—venue for people to speak their minds, gossip, or theorize about art."&lt;ref&gt;Schwendener, Martha, "What Crisis? Some Promising Futures for Art Criticism." ''The Village Voice'', January 2009. {{cite web |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-01-07/art/what-crisis-some-promising-futures-for-art-criticism/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123956/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-01-07/art/what-crisis-some-promising-futures-for-art-criticism |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the ''[[Brooklyn Rail]]'' contributor [[James Kalm]] produced an article titled "Virtually Overwhelmed.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/09/artseen/brooklyn-dispatches-virtually-overwhelmed Kalm, James, "Virtually Overwhelmed." ''Brooklyn Rail''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105114244/http://www.brooklynrail.org/2008/09/artseen/brooklyn-dispatches-virtually-overwhelmed |date=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A practicing artist and video blogger himself, Kalm has this to say about art blogs, "The art blogosphere is a work in progress, and you’ve got to be vigilant of hidden agendas. As with anything online, take it with a grain of salt. Have fun, speak out, but don’t let it cut too much into your studio time; you might end up in a twelve step-program."

In the November 2007 issue of ''[[Art in America]]'', [[Peter Plagens]] contributed "Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots."&lt;ref&gt;Plagens, Peter, "Report from the Blogosphere: The New Grass Roots." ''Art in America'', November 2007. [http://madsilence.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/the-future-of-the-art-blog/]&lt;/ref&gt; Plagens convened a round table of veteran art bloggers, who conversed via email on a range of questions, aimed at getting a better understanding of what art blogs were, how they were run, and their relationship with the mainstream media.

In an October 2007 article for artnet Magazine, critic Charlie Finch suggested that art critiques and reviews by art bloggers are overrated and lengthy, and implied that the art blogging community was overly insular.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Charlie, "A NOT-SO-VAST RIGHT-WING CONSPIRACY" ''artnet Magazine'', {{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch10-26-07.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418041306/http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/finch/finch10-26-07.asp |archivedate=18 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article includes several ''ad hominen'' arguments against specific art bloggers, and ventures the opinion that art blogs "have no readers".

In the January 2005 issue of ''[[Art in America]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Rafael, "Art in the Blogoshere." ''Art in America'', "Front Page," January 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/frontpageaia.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807172818/http://www.firstpulseprojects.com/frontpageaia.pdf |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael Rubinstein mentioned several blogs in the magazine's "Front Page" section, where he penned a brief, annotated survey of 12 art blogs that he found "to be worth regular visits.". Rubinstein opined that "art-related blogs" had not, at the time, become as consequential as blogs in other fields such as poetry or politics.

In December 2008, the art blog [[Maurice Benayoun|The Dump]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-dump.net/|title=The-dump|author=|date=|website=www.the-dump.net|accessdate=23 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180212143100/http://the-dump.net/|archivedate=12 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the new-media artist [[Maurice Benayoun]] dumped hundreds of undone art projects, was the first to become a doctorate thesis in art and art science in and of itself: ''Artistic Intentions at Work, Hypothesis for Committing Art'' Université Pantheon Sorbonne (December 6, 2008)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9802">'''Art destruction''' involves the damaging or destruction of works of [[art]]. This can happen through a natural process, an accident, or deliberate human involvement.

==Natural destruction==
All physical works of art are slowly affected and degraded by the natural elements. Some may survive long enough to allow the slow processes of erosion to act on them. Works of art may also be destroyed by natural disasters.

*The [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] is slowly eroding. Most experts believe it is a natural process, but some believe acid rain is accelerating the process.
*It is estimated that tens of thousands of works of [[Japanese art]] dating as far back as the 13th century were destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] and the ensuing firestorm that destroyed much of central Tokyo.
*1,400 artworks were damaged beyond repair in the November 4, 1966, floods that devastated [[Florence]], Italy, including [[Cimabue]]'s ''[[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|The Crucifixion]]''.
*[[Ribeira Palace]] destroyed during [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. Inside, the 70,000-volume royal library as well as hundreds of works of art, including paintings by Titian, Rubens, and Correggio, were lost. The royal archives disappeared together with detailed historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators.
*[[Royal Alcazar of Madrid]] was destroyed by fire on the Christmas Eve of 1734 with its gallery (Velázquez, Titian, Rubens, Ribera, and others.)

==Accidental destruction==
{{Main|Accidental damage of art}}
Many works of art have been damaged or destroyed by accident.
* On September 2, 1998, [[Swissair Flight 111]] crashed near [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada, killing 225 people. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1963 work ''Le Peintre'' (The Painter) had been loaded on the flight as cargo and was also destroyed.
* In May 2004 a fire destroyed the [[Momart]] warehouse in east London which destroyed more than 50 works by abstract painter [[Patrick Heron]] and works by other artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/05/27/1085641648774.html?from=storyrhs|title=Art world reels as losses mount|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intentional destruction==
===Of artwork designed to be destroyed===
[[File:Lightmatter burningman.jpg|thumb|300px|Burning Man]]

Many works of visual art are intended by the artist to be temporary. They may be created in media which the artist knows to be temporary, such as sand, or they may be designed specifically to be destroyed. Often the destruction takes place during a ceremony or special event highlighting the destruction. Examples of this type of art include:
*[[Street painting]]
*[[Sand mandala]]
*[[Ice sculpture]]
*[[Sand art and play|Sand castles]]
*Food art or Edible art

Additionally, some artists destroy their own work out of lack of self confidence or to gain a fresh start (the prior art still inside their head).  [[Claude Monet]] with [[Haystacks (Monet)|destroying 30 paintings in the water lilies series]] and other paintings, or the [[John Baldessari]] collective 1953 - 1966 works in a 1970 bonfire were famous examples. An artist also may limit the number and quality variation of his work to make it more scarce, therefore gain a reputation of increasing in later valuations.

Festivals where artwork is destroyed:
*The week-long ''[[Burning Man]]'' festival in the desert of [[Nevada]], which began in 1986 with tens of thousands of participants who must pay a fee to attend, an entire city of art and self-expression is created. The focal point of the festival is a temple designed and built by artists. On the last day of the festival there is a ceremony known as a Temple Burn where the temple goes up in flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://burningman.org/event/art-performance/playa-art/building-the-temple/|title=Building the Temple|work=Burning Man|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Semana Santa]]'' (Easter week) festival in [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]], [[Guatemala]], where designs made out of flowers and colored sawdust are created in the street prior to being trampled by a religious parade.
*The burning of [[Zozobra]] during [[Fiestas de Santa Fe]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], usually during the second week of September.
*The burning of [[falles]] in [[Valencia]], Spain.

===Of artwork not designed to be destroyed===
Other works of art may be destroyed without the consent of the original artist or of the local community. In other instances, works of art may destroyed by a local authority against the wishes of the outside community. Examples of this include the removal of [[Diego Rivera]]'s ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' mural from the [[Rockefeller Center]] and the destruction of the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] statues by the [[Taliban]] government.
More than 14 Gustav Klimt masterpieces burned in a fire set by retreating SS forces at [[Immendorf Castle]] in May 1945

*[[Iconoclasm]] is the general destruction of a type of work of art for religious or ideological reasons. Most publicly visible [[classical art]] showing religious subjects was destroyed or disfigured by Christians, {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} mostly after theirs had become the state religion. The same process was inflicted on classical and pagan art after the [[Muslim conquests]], a process which continued for centuries, especially in India. {{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
*The [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] was an internal process within the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], led by changes of [[Byzantine Emperor]], which was reversed after nearly a century.
*In the [[Protestant Reformation]], a great deal of Medieval and Renaissance religious art was destroyed in Protestant areas, mostly in orderly official removals, but sometimes in riotous attacks, of which the most notable was the [[Beeldenstorm]] which swept the [[Low Countries]] in the summer of 1566 kicking off the [[Dutch Revolt]]. 
*The [[French Revolution]] ushered in a period of widespread art destruction, motivated by anti religious and anti royalist ideology, both in France itself and other countries conquered in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Similar destruction occurred for similar ideological motives following other revolutions such as the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian revolution|Russian Revolution]], the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], and the wars that sometimes followed them. 
*In the 1930s and 1940s, [[Nazi Germany]] destroyed works of art they labeled "[[degenerate art]]". These were often non-realistic forms of art such as [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Art created by [[Secular Jewish culture#Visual arts|Jewish artists]] was also destroyed.
*Tens of thousands of works of art were destroyed in military actions in [[World War II]]. One of the best-known examples in Europe is [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet's]] ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'', which was destroyed in [[Dresden]] in 1945 during the Allied bombings. The original of [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', a work with an iconic status in the US, was destroyed in a British bombing of [[Bremen]]. Other works of art were destroyed in [[the Blitz]], in the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombings]] of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], and throughout [[Southeast Asia]].
*Artworks destroyed in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] in the United States included a painted wood relief by [[Louise Nevelson]], a painting from [[Roy Lichtenstein]]'s ''Entablature'' series and a [[Joan Miró]] tapestry. The total value of artwork lost in the September 11 attacks is said to have been in excess of $100 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1581737.stm|title='Up to' $100m art lost in attacks|date=5 October 2001|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Corridart]] was an eight-kilometer exhibit of artworks in [[Montreal]], intended to be part of the arts and cultural component of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]]. Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]], who deemed the artworks ugly, had them torn down two days before the Olympic games began.
*In 1956, a vandal [[Mona Lisa#Theft and vandalism|threw acid at the Louvre museum's Mona Lisa]], damaging it.
*In 2017, [[2017 Louvre machete attack|a terror suspect attacked guards of the Louvre with machetes]] and was found carrying "bombs of aerosol paint" intended to "disfigure the masterpieces of the [Louvre] museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Emilie Blachère|title=Attack at the Louvre: the tourist was a terrorist|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Actu/Societe/Attaque-au-Louvre-le-touriste-etait-un-terroriste-1184744|accessdate=2 January 2018|work=Paris Match|date=13 February 2017|language=French|quote=Investigators found bombs of aerosol paint in his bag.

== Exhibition planning ==
The amount of money allotted for art in each building is calculated with a formula based on the gross square footage.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; AIEP's curatorial team develops thematic exhibitions in collaboration with each ambassador, taking into account the host country's artistic traditions and cultural mores. They recommend artists and works of art, negotiate all loans, and propose placement of the art within the embassy residences. After all loans are secured and the art insured, AIE's registrars coordinate with professional art handlers for the [[manufacturing|assembly]], [[Packaging and labeling|packing]], [[crating]] and safe [[shipment]] of each exhibition to post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to ABC 7 Questions on US Department of State's Art In Embassies Program|url=http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/052114-wls-iteam-gov-spending-q&amp;a-doc.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1963, approximately 10,000 pieces of art have been placed in ambassador residences, embassies, and consulates throughout the world, including work by [[Maya Lin]], [[Jeff Koons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corcoran|first1=Joe|title=Art in Embassies Makes a Splash for 50th Anniversary|url=http://www.washdiplomat.com/DPouch/2013/January/story5artembassies.html|website=www.washdiplomat.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Martin Puryear]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Benjamin Abramowitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Department of State - Art in Embassies|url = http://art.state.gov/ArtistDetail.aspx?id=137324|website = art.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prestigious artists.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia|title=Employing Art Along With Ambassadors | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/arts/design/27embassy.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of art on loan to the embassy program is estimated at $200 million.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

== Artist exchanges / Residency programs ==
Initiated in 2002, the American Artists Abroad program was created to extend Art In Embassies' exhibitions beyond the walls of U.S. diplomatic residences into local communities. Participating American artists travel to countries where their work is exhibited and engage in a series of public cultural programming activities, such as lectures, workshops, and studio visits.

== Art collections by embassy ==

===Beijing===
The art in [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|Beijing]] cost about $800,000 but has been appraised at $30 million. &lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}

There has been numerous works of art that depicted the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] during and since the War both at Bangladesh and abroad. The concert for Bangladesh organized by members of the Beatles was a major happening in 1971 for protest music. The songs recorded for and broadcast on [[Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra]] are still considered to be the best of Bangladeshi protest songs.

The four documentaries made during the War – [[Zahir Raihan]]'s ''[[Stop Genocide]]'' and ''A State Is Born'', Babul Chowdhry's ''Innocent Millions'', Alamgir Kabir's ''Liberation Fighters'' – are described as the first films made in [[Bangladesh]], as earlier films were all made in Pakistan or India, larger entities that Bangladesh belonged to. ''[[Muktir Gaan]] (Song of Freedom)'', based on footage shot by Leer Levin during the war, by [[Tareque Masud|Tareque]] and Kathrine Masud is critically the most acclaimed Bangladeshi documentary. The directors followed the film with two sequels – ''[[Muktir Kotha|Story of Freedom]]'' and ''Narir Katha''. Their feature film on the same subject, ''[[Matir Moyna]]'', won the FIPRESCII award at Cannes Film Festival.

There have been numerous poems and novels written on the Liberation war, including Shamsur Rahman's famous poems written during the War. Arguably it is the most often used subject for Bangladeshi literature since 1971. The monuments made to commemorate the War are the highest esteemed monuments in Bangladesh.

The '''Australia Council for the Arts''', informally known as the '''Australia Council''', is the official [[arts council]] or arts funding body of the [[Government of Australia]]

==Function==
The Australia Council (the Council) is the Australian Government’s principal arts funding and advisory body. The Council is the national advocate for the arts and its purpose is to champion and invest in Australian arts. This national leadership role is achieved by supporting and building Australia’s arts ecology by fostering excellence in the arts and increasing national and international engagement with Australian arts. 

== History ==
Australia Council was formed in 1967 by Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] as a body for the public funding of the arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=19 April 2013 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given statutory authority in March 1975 by the ''Australia Council Act''. The Council's predecessor, the Australian Council for the Arts was established in 1968 by Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] as a division of the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet]]. The Council then incorporated other government projects, such as the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] and the [[Commonwealth Art Advisory Board]]. It operates in co-ordination with the various [[states and territories of Australia|state government]] agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/about/our-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Council’s operations were independently reviewed in 2012, and the ''Australia Council Act 2013'' (the Act) commenced on 1 July 2013.

In early 2014 federal Ministers Brandis and Turnbull told artists at the Sydney Biennale that they were ungrateful and selfish to protest about the role of Transfield in Nauru. In December 2014, Arts Minister, [[George Brandis]], took away a large portion of literature funding from Australia Council.&lt;ref&gt;''The Conversation'', 16 October 2016, [http://theconversation.com/arts-training-is-an-essential-part-of-an-innovative-nation-67303 Arts training is an essential part of an innovative nation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NoMinister&gt;InDaily, 24 October 2016, [http://indaily.com.au/arts-and-culture/2016/10/24/no-minister-creative-arts-are-not-lifestyle-choice/ No minister, creative arts are not a "lifestyle choice"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Brandis cut $26 million a year for four years from Australia Council arts funding, a third of its arts funding, receiving significant criticism from the arts community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/george-brandis-turns-arts-into-political-football-with-1047m-australia-council-cuts-20150513-gh0d0n.html|title=George Brandis turns arts into 'political football' with $104.7m Australia Council cuts|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-17/brandis-accused-of-neglecting-arts-politicising-funding/6629322|title=Private arts donors Neil Balnaves and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis accuse George Brandis of neglecting arts community, politicising funding|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was reallocated to a new program, the '''National Program for Excellence in the Arts''' (NPEA). NPEA in turn was criticised by many artists and arts organisations for lacking the "arms-length" funding principles that had applied to the relationship between the government and Australia Council since its inception in the 1970s. These principles have traditionally had bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/the-regrettable-rise-of-the-arts-bureaucrat-20150518-gh4o01.html|title=The regrettable rise of the arts bureaucrat|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuartglover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/writers-and-publishers-are-all-at-sea-under-brandis-and-the-npea-44842|title=Writers and publishers are all at sea under Brandis and the NPEA|author=Stuart Glover|date=20 July 2015|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-australia-council-must-hold-firm-on-arms-length-funding-24460|title=The Australia Council must hold firm on ‘arm’s length’ funding|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandis was criticised previously for giving Melbourne classical music record label Melba Recordings a $275,000 grant outside of the usual funding and peer-assessment processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/04/australias-arts-funding-crisis-george-brandis-one-man-show|title=George Brandis and the arts funding crisis: one hell of a one-man show|author=Ben Eltham|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandis's changes to funding arrangements, including the quarantining of the amount received by Australia's 28 major performing arts companies, were widely seen to disadvantage the small-to-medium arts sector and independent artists.&lt;ref name="stuartglover"/&gt; Following Malcolm Turnbull's successful [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, September 2015|spill]] of the leadership of the Liberal party in September 2015, Brandis was replaced as arts minister by [[Mitch Fifield]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 September 2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cabinet-reshuffle-artists-call-on-new-arts-minister-mitch-fifield-to-undo-the-damage-done-by-george-brandis-20150920-gjqvpk.html Cabinet reshuffle: artists call on new arts minister Mitch Fifield to 'undo the damage' done by George Brandis]&lt;/ref&gt; In November Fifield gave back $8 million a year for four years to Australia Council, changed the NPEA to the '''Catalyst Fund''', and stressed it would have a focus on smaller arts projects. The arts community was not impressed by the changes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 November 2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/rebranding-brandis-arts-fund-catalyst-wont-kill-off-national-program-for-excellence-in-the-arts-20151120-gl42nv.html Rebranding Brandis arts fund Catalyst won't kill off National Program for Excellence in the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 20 February, 2016, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-20/$105m-budget-cut-caught-australia-council-by-surprise:-emails/7185900?pfmredir=sm Australia Council budget cuts blindsided peak arts body's executive, documents show]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the reduced funding, Australia Council cancelled project funding rounds for small groups and individuals in 2015 and then cut funding to over 60 arts organisations across the country in May 2016. 

In addition, Education Minister [[Simon Birmingham]] indicated that the government is considering cutting funding to students who wish to undertake creative arts training, saying that he believes training in the creative arts is a ‘lifestyle’ choice and cannot lead to a satisfactory career or any economic outcome, and that he intends to cut loan support for students to undertake this form of education and training, cutting loans for over 50 arts training programs, including programs in ceramics, photography, dance, acting, animation, all forms of design, circus, music, film, fashion and journalism.&lt;ref name=NoMinister/&gt;

[[File:Altar-mor da Basílica de Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Recife, Pernambuco, Brasil.jpg|thumb|Altar of the Basilica of Our Lady of Carmel in [[Recife]], one of the masterpieces of the Brazilian Baroque]]
The '''baroque in Brazil''' was introduced at the beginning of the seventeenth century by Catholic missionaries, especially Jesuits, who brought the new style as an instrument of Christian indoctrination. The epic poem ''Prosopopeia'' (1601), by [[Bento Teixeira]], is one of its initial milestones. The baroque reached its apogee in literature with the poet [[Gregório de Matos]] and the holy orator Father [[António Vieira]]. The greatest artists of the era were [[Aleijadinho]] in sculpture and [[Manoel da Costa Ataíde|Master Ataíde]] in painting. Baroque architecture flourished remarkably in the Northeast; important examples also exist in the center of the country, in [[Minas Gerais]], [[Goiás]], and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In music, unlike the other arts, few documents survive, and only from the late baroque. With the development of [[neoclassicism]] starting in the first decades of the eighteenth century, the Baroque tradition, which had a history of massive strength in Brazil and was considered the national style of excellence, gradually fell into disuse, but traces of it were found in various forms of art until the early years of the twentieth century.

[[File:Zeegezicht bij Scheveningen - s0416M1990 - Van Gogh Museum.jpg|thumb|390px|''Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather'']]

'''''Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather''''', also known as '''''View of the Sea at Scheveningen''''' (Dutch: ''Zeegezicht bij Scheveningen''), is an early oil painting by [[Vincent van Gogh]], painted at [[Scheveningen]] near [[The Hague]] in August 1882. It is held in the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam.

Van Gogh made his first paintings in December 1881, under the supervision of [[Anton Mauve]], the husband of Van Gogh's cousin, Ariëtte (Jet) Sophia Jeannette Carbentus.  This work was made in Van Gogh's second attempt at painting in August 1882.

The painting shows the beach at [[Scheveningen]], on the North Sea coast a few miles from The Hague, on a stormy day on 21 or 22 August 1882.  The painting was made quickly, ''[[en plein air]]'', on an easel at the beach, with the wind whipping up sand and nearly blowing Van Gogh off his feet.  He managed to scrape most of the wind-blown sand off the thick wet painting, but some remains.

The painting  is an [[Impressionist]] take on the grey-tinged [[seascape]]s of [[Hague School]] paintings such as [[Hendrik Mesdag]]'s 1881 ''[[Panorama Mesdag|Panorama]]'' of  Scheveningen.  The composition is broken into three horizontal zones: a threatening grey sky with dark roiling clouds, the greenish-grey sea with lines of white-capped waves crashing onto the shore, and the beach and sand dunes in browns, oranges, yellows and greens.  A number of people are on the beach, some [[fishwife|fishwives]] in their white bonnets, watching as a group of men with horses and a cart are about to pull on a rope attached to a waiting fishing boat to bring it safely ashore.  The people are suggested by a few economical brushstrokes, and the breakers by thick lines of paint applied directly from the tube.

The work measures {{convert|34.5|x|51|cm}}.  It was catalogued as "F4" in [[Jacob Baart de la Faille]]'s 1928 ''The Works of Vincent van Gogh'' and as "JH187" in [[Jan Hulsker]]'s 1978 ''The Complete Van Gogh''.

The painting was stored the Van Gogh family house in [[Breda]].  Along with many early other works, it was left behind in the attic when the family moved away in 1886, and it came into the possession of a carpenter, Adrianus Schrauwen.  It was sold as part of a job lot of worthless "rubbish" to the merchant J.C. Couvreur in 1902, and it came to [[Kunstzalen Oldenzeel]] in Rotterdam.  It was bought by tobacco importer [[Gerlach Ribbius Peletier]] in 1903 for the record price of 2,500 [[Dutch guilder|guilders]], when other works by Van Gogh were selling for less than 1,000 guilders.  It was inherited by his daughter {{ill|Liesbeth Ribbius Peletier|nl}}, and she donated it to the state of the Netherlands on her death in 1989.

==Theft and recovery==
''Beach at Scheveningen in Stormy Weather'' had been held by the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam since 1989, but was stolen on 7 December 2002, along with Van Gogh's early painting of ''[[Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen]]''.  It remained [[stolen art|missing]] for over 13 years, until it was recovered by the Italian [[Guardia di Finanza]] at [[Castellammare di Stabia]] near Naples in January 2016, without its original frame.  Its recovery was not announced until September 2016, and it was subsequently returned to the museum and went back on display in March 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1215">In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''bômolochus''''' ({{lang-grc|βωμολόχος}}) was one of three [[stock character]]s in [[ancient Greek comedy|comedy]], corresponding to the English [[buffoon]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''bômolochus'' is marked by his wit, his crudity of language, and his frequent non-illusory audience address. 

In modern [[Greek language|Greek]], the word refers to a [[profanity|foul-mouthed]] person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''Bon chic, bon genre''' ({{Langnf||French|"Good style, good class"}}) is an expression used in France to refer to a [[subculture]] of stylish members of the Paris [[upper class]]. They are typically well-educated, well-connected, and descended from "[[old money]]" families, preferably with some aristocratic ancestry. The style combines certain fashionable tastes with the appearance of social respectability. The expression is sometimes shortened to "BCBG"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adeleye|first=Gabriel G.|title=World dictionary of foreign expressions: a resource for readers and writers|year=1999|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|isbn=9780865164239|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the fashion company [[BCBG Max Azria]] was named in reference to the subculture). 

Parallels are often seen between this subculture and similar upper-class social groups in the United States ("[[preppy]]") and the United Kingdom ("[[Sloane Ranger]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes, Alexandra and Keith Reader|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003305|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with those groups, BCBG drew mainstream attention during the 1980s. Thierry Mantoux published a handbook for BCBG style (''BCBG - Le Guide du bon chic bon genre'') in the 1980s, a French equivalent to ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]'' and ''The Sloane Ranger Handbook'', both published earlier in the decade. 

The BCBG social group is not to be confused with the "[[Bobos in Paradise|bobo]]" Paris fashion subculture (short for "bohemian bourgeois").

==Fashion==
The style of BCBG tends towards the conservative and classic, to "de-emphasize 'sexiness' and 'flashy' signs of wealth", and is influenced by "Anglo-Saxon" styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raissiguier|first=Catherine|title=Becoming Women, Becoming Workers: Identity Formation in a French Vocational School|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|isbn=9781438416762|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some brands trendy with the BCBG group include [[Gucci]], [[Max Mara]], [[Le Bon Marché]], and [[Chanel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=Stephen|title=Paris|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203980|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BCBG social group is associated with certain residential areas in Paris and Versailles. BCBG are often identified with the "NAP" area formed by the triangle between [[Neuilly-Auteuil-Passy]], from the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] to the [[Bois de Boulogne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes, Alexandra and Keith Reader|title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary French Culture|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203003305|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]] closer to the centre of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexiou|first=Joseph|title=Paris for Dummies|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118038741|page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[7th arrondissement of Paris|7th]] and [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissements]] for shopping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fallon|first=Stephen|title=Paris|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=9781742203980|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1960">A '''book of office''' may refer either to a record of the conduct of affairs within an organization, particularly a religious organization like a church, or to a body of writing establishing the guiding philosophy of an organization like a political party.

== Practical Books of Office ==
[[Religious organizations]], including individual churches and parishes, may record the acts of their leaders in a book of office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dioceseofcheyenne.org/history/Pine_Bluffs_1913-1993_Thompson.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604034806/http://www.dioceseofcheyenne.org/history/Pine_Bluffs_1913-1993_Thompson.html |archivedate=2008-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has also been used to record the dealings of secular organizations like courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historycourtcha00towngoog|title=History of the Court of Chancery in Nova Scotia|last=Charles James Townshend|date=1900|publisher=Carswell|others=unknown library|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infrequency of reference to these books in modern use may point to a decline in their use.

== Philosophical Books of Office ==
A political party may refer to a work as a "book of office" if it represents the philosophical foundation of the party. [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' is described as the book of office for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] of the United Kingdom (and its predecessor the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]), and is presented to every newly elected President of the party upon election.

'''Cloisonnism''' is a style of [[post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] painting with bold and flat forms separated by dark contours. The term was coined by critic [[Edouard Dujardin]] on the occasion of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]], in March 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Dujardin, Édouard: ''Aux XX et aux Indépendants: le Cloisonismé'' (sic!), Revue indépendante, Paris, March 1888, pp. 487-492&lt;/ref&gt; Artists [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], [[Louis Anquetin]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Paul Sérusier]], and others started painting in this style in the late 19th century. The name evokes the technique of [[cloisonné]], where wires (''cloisons'' or "compartments") are soldered to the body of the piece, filled with powdered glass, and then [[Pottery firing|fired]]. Many of the same painters also described their works as [[Synthetism]], a closely related movement.

In ''[[The Yellow Christ]]'' (1889), often cited as a quintessential cloisonnist work, Gauguin reduced the image to areas of single colors separated by heavy black outlines. In such works he paid little attention to classical [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of color&amp;mdash;two of the most characteristic principles of post-[[Renaissance]] painting.

The cloisonnist separation of colors reflects an appreciation for discontinuity that is characteristic of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/first-moderns/ William R.

'''Czech Gothic architecture''' refers to the [[architectural period]] primarily of the [[Late Middle Ages]] in the area of the present-day [[Czech Republic]] (former [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]], primarily consisting of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Margraviate of Moravia]]).

The [[Gothic style]] first appeared in the [[Czech lands]] in the first half of the 13th century and was usual there until the early 16th century. The phases of the development of the Gothic architecture in the Czech lands are often named after the [[Bohemia]]n ruling dynasty of the corresponding time:
* Early Gothic — [[Přemyslid dynasty|Přemyslid]] Gothic (13th and early 14th century)
* High Gothic — [[Luxembourg dynasty|Luxembourg]] Gothic (14th and early 15th century)
* Late Gothic — [[Jagiellonian dynasty|Jagiellonian]] Gothic (approximately 1471–1526)&lt;ref name="cerna"&gt;&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Dějiny výtvarného umění|year=2012|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|isbn=978-80-85970-74-6|page=63|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant Gothic architects who worked in the Czech lands (especially in Bohemia) were [[Peter Parler]] and [[Benedikt Rejt]].

== Early Gothic ==
[[File:Klater Tepla.jpg|thumb|left|[[Teplá Abbey]] Church, Bohemia, consecrated in 1232.]]
The Gothic style penetrated the Czech lands in the first half of the 13th century – in the time when the [[Romanesque style]] flourished in Bohemia and the High Gothic in France.&lt;ref name="cerna" /&gt; In the 13th century the Kingdom of Bohemia became a stable country and the growth of the political and economical importance of Bohemia mirrored also in the art. Until that time the cultural development of the Czech lands was obviously delayed in comparison with Western Europe. In the 13th century many monasteries, convents, cities, towns and villages were founded. It was the time of colonization of the still uninhabited areas of the Kingdom. The Czech nobility accepted the culture of [[knights]], so they listened to the German [[Minnesingers]], participated in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]], got their [[coat of arms]] and built [[castle]]s of stone. Thanks to the newly found silver mines the Kingdom was becoming richer (e. g. [[Jihlava]], [[Stříbro]] or [[Kutná Hora]]).&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Gotická architektura|year=2005|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|location=Praha|isbn=80-85970-46-5|pages=57–58|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1240s last purely Romanesque churches were built (e. g. in [[Vinec, Czech Republic|Vinec]], [[Potvorov]], [[Tismice]] or [[Kondrac]]). In the 1230s first Early Gothic buildings were built in the "transitional" style brought to Bohemia and Moravia by the [[Order of Cistercians]]. Their buildings were not very fancy and they often used leaf and berry motifs, especially on the [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; The Cistercians were the most important builders of the very Early Gothic style architecture in the Czech lands.&lt;ref name="cerna" /&gt;

[[File:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|thumb|Portal of the [[Old New Synagogue]] in Prague using [[vine]]-leaf motifs, after 1270.]]

The Church of the [[Teplá Abbey]] ([[Premonstratensians]]) consecrated in 1232&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.klastertepla.cz/cz_index.html|work=Klášter Teplá|accessdate=10 July 2013|language=Czech|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701044818/http://www.klastertepla.cz/cz_index.html|archivedate=1 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the oldest Gothic churches in Bohemia. Other important Early Gothic building is the [[Osek (Teplice District)|Osek]] Monastery (Cistercians) in Bohemia with its unique [[Chapter hall]]. The first Gothic building in Moravia was the Monastery of Cistercian nuns [[Porta coeli Convent|Porta Coeli]] in [[Předklášteří|Předklášteří u Tišnova]] near [[Brno]] founded by [[Constance of Hungary]], [[Queen of Bohemia]] in 1233 and concentrated in 1239.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historie|url=http://www.portacoeli.cz/informace/historie|work=Porta Coeli|accessdate=10 July 2013|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are the oldest [[traceries]] of the rose windows in the Czech lands and the very fancy portal built in the style of the [[French cathedrals]] was unique in Central Europe of that time.&lt;ref name=early/&gt;

The [[St. Procopius Basilica in Třebíč]] is considered to be the most bizarre work of the European architecture of the second third of the 13th century. The architecture of this former [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] church in [[Třebíč]] is a unique mixture of Romanesque and Gothic style.&lt;ref name="cerna" /&gt; It was not built in the "transitional" Romanesque-Gothic style but the builders used elements of the both styles in its mature forms and so created a building which is purely Romanesque and Gothic at the same time.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; Therefore, it is listed in the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]].&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=Třebíč UNESCO site|url=http://en.czech-unesco.org/trebic/introduction/|work=UNESCO Czech Republic|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest Gothic building in Prague is the [[Convent of St. Agnes]] founded in 1231 by the Bohemian Princess [[Agnes of Bohemia]] (later canonized). It was the first convent of the [[Poor Clares]] outside Italy. The first church of this convent (St. Francis Church) was completed in 1234 and it is said to be the oldest vaulted mendicant order church north of the Alps. The Church of Christ the Saviour built in 1261–1265 as the royal mausoleum of [[Přemyslid dynasty]] by King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] was directly influenced by the [[French Gothic architecture]].&lt;ref name=early/&gt;

In the new-founded rich [[mining town]] [[Jihlava]] there were built three Early Gothic churches ([[Parish church|parish]], [[Minorites|Minorite]] and [[Dominicanes|Dominicane]]) in the 1240s which also belong to the oldest preserved Gothic churches in the Czech lands.&lt;ref name=early2&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Gotická architektura|year=2005|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|location=Praha|isbn=80-85970-46-5|page=59|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1260s the influence of the Cistercian style diminished and the Czech architecture was then inspired by the French High Gothic architecture. In southern Bohemia there worked the royal builders employed by the King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]]. In the Royal Town of [[Písek]] there they built some important buildings (Royal Castle, [[Písek Stone Bridge]], parish church). They also built the [[Zvíkov Castle]] with a central court surrounded by arcades in two levels inspired by the [[cloister]] — typical element of the [[Monastery|monastic architecture]]. The chapel of the castle was completed in 1270.&lt;ref name=early2 /&gt;

Other important castles are the royal [[Bezděz Castle]] (with its beautiful chapel) and [[Křivoklát Castle]], the bishop's [[Horšovský Týn]] Castle (its chapel has been preserved, other parts were later rebuilt). In Moravia there are the [[Špilberk Castle]] in [[Brno]], [[Veveří Castle]], [[Buchlov]], [[Hukvaldy]] or others.&lt;ref name=early2 /&gt;

The [[Old New Synagogue]] in the Jewish Quarter of the [[Old Town of Prague]] was built around 1270 by stonemasons of the royal workshop who also built the Convent of St. Agnes. This twin-nave synagogue is one of the oldest preserved in Europe and the oldest still active in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Old-New Synagogue|url=http://www.synagogue.cz/the-old-new-synagogue-page/about-the-synagogue/|work=Synagogue.cz|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of the Old New Synagogue resembles the Cistercian monasteries [[Zlatá Koruna]] (founded in 1263) and [[Vyšší Brod Monastery|Vyšší Brod]] (founded in 1259). In Vyšší Brod very precious Early Gothic Chapter hall from 1285 has been preserved. These monasteries were then completed in the High Gothic style.&lt;ref name=early3&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Gotická architektura|year=2005|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|location=Praha|isbn=80-85970-46-5|pages=60–61|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== High Gothic ==

=== Late Přemyslid Gothic ===
[[File:Klášter cisterciácký, s omezením bez budovy jídelny (Sedlec).jpg|thumb|[[Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist|Sedlec Cathedral]] in Kutná Hora.]]
The High Gothic period in the Czech lands started during the reign of the King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] in the 1290s. In that time the Gothic style in the Czech lands changed. The new buildings started to emphasize the verticality and light very strongly.

In the Cistercian [[Sedlec Abbey]] near [[Kutná Hora]], the first church in the style of [[Architecture of cathedrals and great churches|French Gothic cathedrals]] in the Czech lands was built around 1300. It is called the [[Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist]] and although it was rebuilt in the 18th century in the [[Czech Baroque architecture#Baroque Gothic|Baroque Gothic style]] its presbytery, main nave and transept didn't lose its original appearance. It is considered to be one of the first High Gothic buildings in the Czech Republic&lt;ref name=early3 /&gt; and it was also inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kutná Hora: Historical Town Centre with the Church of St Barbara and the Cathedral of Our Lady at Sedlec|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/732|work=UNESCO|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very similar church was built in another [[Zbraslav Monastery|Cistercian monastery in Zbraslav]]. In its time it was the biggest church in Bohemia – it was 104 meters long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Líbal|first=Dobroslav|title=Cisterciácká architektura v českých zemích|year=1994|publisher=Unicornis|location=Praha|isbn=80-901587-1-4|page=36|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zbraslav Cathedral was destroyed during the [[Hussite Wars]].

=== Luxembourg Gothic ===

The first king of the new [[Luxembourg dynasty]] [[John of Luxembourg]] was not a great founder of new buildings. He probably rebuilt the Stone Bell House on the Old Town Square in Prague after 1310. In this time the house was decorated with great statues and paintings and was probably used as a royal residence instead of the [[Prague Castle]] which was uninhabitable after the fire in 1303.&lt;ref name=early3 /&gt;

The [[Bishop of Prague]] Jan IV. z Dražic supported the new architecture instead of the king who was often absent in the country. He founded a new workshop in his town [[Roudnice nad Labem]] to which he invited south-French builders. He started to build a new bridge in Roudnice over the river [[Elbe]] ({{Lang-cs|Labe}}). He also invited a bridge architect William of Avignon for one year who taught the local stonemasons so that they could finish the bridge construction on their own. The Bishop also founded a new monastery with a church in Roudnice and new castles in Litovice and [[Dražice (Tábor District)|Dražice]]. He also founded a new monumental St Giles's Church ({{Lang-cs|Kostel sv. Jiljí}}) in the [[Old Town of Prague]]&lt;ref name=early3 /&gt; and rebuilt the Bishop's residence in the [[Lesser Town of Prague]] (was destroyed during the Hussite Wars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biskupský dvůr|url=http://www.hrady.cz/index.php?OID=1866|work=Hrady.cz|accessdate=10 July 2013|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The reign of Charles IV and Wenceslaus IV ====
[[File:Prag Teynkirche Nordportal.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Northern portal of the [[Church of Our Lady before Týn]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]] built by [[Parler family|Parler]]'s workshop.]]
The heyday of the High Gothic art in the Czech lands came with John's son [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]. This young Bohemian Prince came to Bohemia in 1333 from France where he had been raised at the French royal court. Then he became as the first king of Bohemia the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and so Prague became the imperial residence. The reign of Emperor Charles IV and his son King [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]] is one of the very few periods of the Czech art when it was at the comparable level with the European development and even became the leading force in the development of European art.&lt;ref name="cerna2"&gt;&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Dějiny výtvarného umění|year=2012|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|isbn=978-80-85970-74-6|page=64|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles IV was a very important supporter of art. He founded many new buildings, for example the most important High Gothic building in the Czech Republic – the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at the [[Prague Castle]] – which was founded by him, his father King John and the Prague Archbishop [[Arnošt of Pardubice]] in 1344. The first architect was a Frenchman [[Matthias of Arras]] who designed the church in the [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic style]]. After his death [[Petr Parléř|Petr Parler]] (who came from Germany) became the architect of the cathedral and changed the older plans. Peter Parler built a [[net vault]] in the main nave, one of the first net vaults in the continental Europe.&lt;ref name="cerna2" /&gt; This net vault then inspired the vaults in many central-European churches (e. g. in [[Milevsko]], [[Český Krumlov]] or [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]] in Poland). One of the most precious spaces of the cathedral is the St. Wenceslas Chapel which resembles the Chapel of the Holy Cross at the [[Karlštejn Castle]] in central Bohemia. The building of the cathedral was interrupted by Hussite Wars and was completed first in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=high&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Gotická architektura|year=2005|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|location=Praha|isbn=80-85970-46-5|pages=64–65|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles IV also ordered to rebuild the Old Royal Palace at the [[Prague Castle]], his son [[Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia|Wenceslaus IV]] then continued in the rebuilding after Charles's death.

Another important building of the Prague High Gothic architecture is the [[Charles Bridge]] with its Old Town Bridge Tower built by Petr Parler and which is one of the largest and most beautiful Gothic gates in Europe.&lt;ref name="cerna2"/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Town Bridge Tower|url=http://www.kralovskacesta.cz/en/tour/objects/old-town-bridge-tower.html|work=Královská cesta|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petr Parler also designed the new presbytery of the St. Bartholomew Church in [[Kolín]] ({{Lang-cs|Kostel sv. Bartoloměje}}). The work of Petr Parler later became a great inspiration for central-European Late Gothic architects.&lt;ref name=high2&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Gotická architektura|year=2005|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|location=Praha|isbn=80-85970-46-5|pages=66–68|language=Czech|chapter=Země Koruny české}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important Czech High Gothic castle is the [[Karlštejn Castle]] built in 1348–1357 (and decorated until 1367) where the unique Chapel of the Holy Cross can be seen which should have looked like the Heavenly Jerusalem and in which the most precious [[holy relics]] and jewels of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and [[Holy Roman Empire]] were kept (e. g. the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire]]). Its walls are decorated with precious stones and with 130 pictures of saints painted by [[Theodoric of Prague]], its golden ceiling resembles the sky with stars, sun and moon.&lt;ref name=high2 /&gt;

During the reign of Wenceslaus IV the Gothic style changed a bit into the so-called [[International Gothic]] which was characterized by replacing monumentality with elegance (therefore it is also known as the ''"Beautiful style"''). Typical for the International Gothic architecture especially in Central Europe were the [[hall church]]es. The hall churches usually also had thin tall columns supporting the vault. Typical examples of International Gothic architecture in the Kingdom of Bohemia are the south-Bohemian churches of St Giles in [[Třeboň]] ({{Lang-cs|Kostel sv. Jiljí}}) and of St Vitus in [[Soběslav]] ({{Lang-cs|Kostel sv. Víta}}). The king himself ordered to rebuild the [[Italian Court]] in Kutná Hora and to build the [[Točník Castle]].&lt;ref name=high2 /&gt; Another important church was the St Vitus Church in [[Český Krumlov]] built after 1407 as a hall church with a net vault in the main nave.

== Late Gothic ==
[[File:Kuttenberg-Barbara.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[St. Barbara's Church, Kutná Hora|St. Barbara's Church]] in [[Kutná Hora]].]]
The heyday of the High Gothic architecture in the Crown of Bohemia was stopped by the outbreak of the [[Hussite Wars]] in 1419. Many churches, monasteries and castles were burnt down and many new buildings were left unfinished by the builders, such as the St Vitus Cathedral at the Prague Castle. The amazing fortification system of the Hussite town [[Tábor]] is probably the only precious architectural work of that time. During the wars and many years after them there was not enough money to build any precious buildings. The only important monuments of that time in Prague are the [[Church of Our Lady before Týn]] in the Old Town of Prague (used as the main Hussite church in Bohemia) whose building continued after the wars&lt;ref name=high2 /&gt; and the higher tower of the gate of the Charles Bridge in the [[Lesser Town of Prague]] which was built at the expense of [[George of Poděbrady|King George]] after 1464.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesser Town Bridge Towers|url=http://www.kralovskacesta.cz/en/tour/objects/lesser-town-bridge-towers.html|work=Královská cesta (The Royal Route)|accessdate=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jagiellonian Gothic ===
The bad situation of the Czech art caused by wars and political instability was improved after 1471 when a Catholic Polish prince [[Vladislav II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus Jagiellon]] (grandson of Bohemian Princess [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]] granddaughter of Charles IV) became the new king of Bohemia and especially after 1485 when religious freedom was enacted (for Catholics and Hussites) and so the religious wars finally ended.&lt;ref name=dcz&gt;{{cite book|title=Dějiny českých zemí|year=2011|publisher=Knižní klub|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-242-3205-8|pages=122–123|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Renaissance style flourished in Italy and Western Europe and Hungary were under its influence, the Czech art returned in its style to the legacy of the old Gothic masters. Bohemia was not the only country which did not accept the [[Renaissance art]] very early and tried to develop the older Gothic style into new forms – it was also the case of [[Austria]], Bavaria, [[Saxony]]&lt;ref name=dcz /&gt; or England (see [[Tudor architecture]]). Although they still used the Gothic style, they slowly started to mix it with some Renaissance elements.

The most important architect of the Czech Late Gothic style was [[Benedikt Rejt]] who worked for the King Vladislaus. He rebuilt the Prague Castle in the Late Gothic style and also used some Early [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements. Rejt's masterpiece is the [[Vladislav Hall]] in the Old Royal Palace at the Prague Castle which was completed in 1502, and was at its time the largest secular vaulted space (without inner supporting columns) at least in Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poche|first=Emanuel|title=Praha středověká|year=1983|publisher=Panorama|location=Praha|page=349|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chotěbor|first=Petr|title=Prague Castle: Detailed Guide|year=2005|publisher=Prague Castle Administration|location=Prague|isbn=80-86161-61-7|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benedikt Rejt completed the [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutná Hora|St. Barbara's Church]] in Kutná Hora in the Late Gothic style using a vault very similar to the vault of the Vladislav Hall. This church has a typical Late Gothic tent roof.

Together with Hans Spiess Benedikt Rejt built the Royal Oratory in St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle after 1490. The interesting vault of this oratory has naturalistically executed dry cut branches, tied with strong ropes at the top of arches, instead of usual ribs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chotěbor|first=Petr|title=Prague Castle: Detailed Guide|year=2005|publisher=Prague Castle Administration|location=Prague|isbn=80-86161-61-7|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hans Spiess who came from [[Frankfurt am Main]] also rebuilt the royal [[Křivoklát Castle]] in central Bohemia.&lt;ref name="cerna3"&gt;&gt;{{cite book|last=Černá|first=Marie|title=Dějiny výtvarného umění|year=2012|publisher=IDEA SERVIS|isbn=978-80-85970-74-6|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important Late Gothic architect was [[Matěj Rejsek]] who was of Czech origin. He built the [[Powder Gate]] in Prague in 1475–84&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poche|first=Emanuel|title=Praha středověká|year=1983|publisher=Panorama|location=Praha|pages=341–343|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by the Old Town Bridge Tower.

In Brno was active Austrian architect [[Anton Pilgram]] where designed the very interesting portal of the Old Town Hall.&lt;ref name="cerna3" /&gt;

The theme of '''death within ancient Greek art''' has continued from the [[Early Bronze Age]] all the way through to the [[Hellenistic period]]. The Greeks used architecture, pottery, and funerary objects as different mediums through which to portray death. These depictions include mythical deaths, deaths of historical figures, and commemorations of those who died in war. This page includes various examples of the different types of mediums in which death is presented in Greek art.

== Examples of architecture ==
[[Greek heroa]] were tombs dedicated to both mythological and actual heroes of the Ancient Greek world. These tombs contained the remains of the hero and acted as a place where citizens of the polis where the tomb was located could hold feasts as a hero cult in order to honor the hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47675022|title=The Greek way of death|last=1947-|first=Garland, Robert,|date=2001|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801487463|edition= 2nd|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|oclc=47675022}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built in a variety of different styles, were located in many different polis across Greece, and their legacy was continued by the Romans.

The [[heroon at Nemea]] is an example of a hero shrine, the resting place of the late Ophletes and a place for Greeks to worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43477508|title=Nemea : a guide to the site and museum|date=1990|publisher=University of California Press|others=Miller, Stephen G. (Stephen Gaylord), 1942-, Abraldes, Ana M.|isbn=0585160430|location=Berkeley|oclc=43477508}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heroon was a way to memorialize the infant and transform his legacy from that of a mere mortal to that of a hero. Ophletes' death elevated him above the status of other humans and made him more divine, and thus his final resting place became a sacred space to Greeks. The ancient Greeks would use this space and the surrounding land to host the Nemean Games in Ophletes' honor, as well as practice magic and other cult activities.

The [[grave monument from Kallithea]] is an example of a funerary monument from the Hellenistic period. They were for wealthy people and families that served to remind the living of the power and wealth of the dead by exhibiting conspicuous consumption. This monument was for a non Greek family from Romania, who became prominent in Athens in the 300s. The grave monument had a podium, pedestal, a frieze, and a naiskos with statues of two family members and a slave inside. These grave monument largely disappeared in Attica after an austerity law that banned them.

The [[tombs at Xanthos]], Lycia, are funerary architecture that display the cultural synthesis enacted by a Lycian Dynasty. The tombs at Xanthos primarily take the form of pillar tombs, which were composed of a stone burial chamber on top of a stone pillar. The decorative motifs surrounding many of the elevated burial chambers depicts Near Eastern imagery, with roots in Persia. However, the Lycian rulers employed Greek artisans to carve the relief sculptures, primarily in the Archaic style. Thus, the monumentalization of the dead rulers is accompanied by regionally-specific visual motifs that bring together both Greek and Near Eastern influences.

[[Brasidas]] was a successful Spartan General who won a major battle in Amphipolis during the second Peloponnesian War. After Brasidas died, the people of Amphipolis monumentalized him by cremating him, placing his ashes in a silver ossuary with a gold wreath, and burying him in a cist grave within the city walls. Sparta also dedicated a cenotaph in his honor. His legacy was remembered and celebrated with these things and contributes to the theme of monumentalization of important Greek figures after death.

== Examples of pottery and painters ==

The [[Jar (pelike) with Odysseus and Elpenor|Pelike]] of Odysseus and Elpenor is a jar from Attika in 440 B.C. It portrays Elpenor begging Odysseus to give him a proper burial. Elpenor had drunkenly fallen off the roof of a boat and his death went unnoticed which means he did not get his burial rights and could not proceed through his journey in the underworld. Hermes stands next to Odysseus watching over the scene as he a guide for the dead.

The [[Thanatos Painter]] is a lekythoi painter from Athens, Greece in the 5th century BCE. The lekythoi attributed to the Thanatos Painter are all white-ground that is specifically used in the funerary context. These lekythoi also had depiction of death on them and thanatos is the Greek word for death. They were used as grave markers and would hold special oil used for funerals.

Another example of pottery being used in funerary contexts is the [[Eleusis Amphora]] by the Polyphemos painter, which is a neck amphora that dates back to the Middle Protoattic (ca. 650-625 B.C.E.). The amphora's decoration reflects the pottery of the [[Orientalizing period]] (ca. 710-600 B.C.E.), a style in which human and animal figures depict mythological scenes. It was used as an urn, as it was found to contain the remains of a young boy.

[[Ancient Greek funerary vases]] were made to resemble vessels used for elite male drinking parties, called symposiums. Funerary vases were often painted with symposiums, or Greek tragedies that involved death. There are many types of funerary vases including [[amphorae]], [[krater]]s, [[oinochoe]], and [[kylix]] cups. Funerary scenes show us how the Greeks treated the deceased. Such ritualistic practices included laying out the body for mourners to see, called prothesis. An example of this was painted on the [[Dipylon Amphora|Dipylon amphora]]. Next, was the ekphora, which is the moving of the body to a cemetery, usually in a procession. If cremation was practiced, then the ashes of the deceased would be placed inside the funerary vase, and buried.

The [[Odysseus in the Underworld krater]] is a Lucanian kalyx-[[krater]] decorated in the [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] style dating to dating to ca. 380 BC - ca. 360 BC. Side A of the krater depicts Homer's story of Odysseus's visit to the Underworld to consult the dead seer Teiresias. This meeting is known as a nekuomanteion or “consultation with the dead”. Side B depicts the judgment of Paris where Hermes asks Paris, the Trojan prince, to arbitrate the contest between Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena and determine who is the most beautiful.

The suicide of Ajax vase was made by Exekias during the Archaic Period. The scene depicts Ajax preparing for his suicide in black-figure on a neck amphora. Ajax is bent over his sword, which he is placing in the ground. There is a tree to one side of him and his suit of armor on the other side. This scene is unusual in Greek art because it depicts the moment right before the death, rather than the violence of the actual death.

The [[Dipylon krater]] from Athens displays representations of funerary rituals for death and burial. The prothesis was a public "laying out" of the deceased similar to a modern wake, and the ekphora was a transportation of the body to the grave for burial. These rituals coincided with intense grief and extravagance, as those closest to the deceased attempted to mourn and celebrate his death.

Depictions of the death of Iphigenia are mostly on pottery. She was a young girl who was to be the sacrifice for Agamemnon's mistake. Pottery depictions of this mythological story are of two different versions. One where she dies, and the other is where her body is replaced with the corpse of an animal by Artemis, who saves her. The pottery depictions are mostly by the black-figure and red-figure techniques. They are also mostly amphoras and kraters. In my page, I wanted to include depictions of Iphigenia from all artistic aspects, not only pottery. Mosaic and plays have been made for Iphigenia.

== Examples of grave stelai and goods ==

The stelai which mark the burials in Grave Circles A and B in Mycenae demonstrate burial practices during the Late Bronze Age. Some of the stelai feature relief sculpture, including chariot scenes, hunting scenes, and spiral motifs. These scenes could potentially indicate a desire for display and conspicuous consumption and hint at the presence of warfare and social stratification at Mycenae.

The [[death masks of Mycenae]] are a collection of golden masks placed on male dead bodies entombed within circular grave sites located at the city of Mycenae. They are designed to represent the features of the deceased, immortalizing them after death. They also display the status of the deceased through conspicuous consumption, due to their valuable materials.

After finding a phenomenal amount of [[gold grave goods at Grave Circles A and B]] at Mycenae, the location earned the nickname "Golden Mycenae". It was a successful and wealthy area during the Bronze Age and the families buried in the shaft graves there memorialized their status using gold grave goods. They also distinguished which graves were for men and which were for women using grave goods. Generally, the men were buried with gold inlaid weapons while the women had gold jewelry, and both boasted their family's wealth.

The [[hellenistic stelai from Demetrias]] used art styles and sculpting techniques from the Hellenistic period to commemorate the deceased. Marble and stone stele were decorated with full and diverse colors which were used to depict both scenes from life and scenes from myth. By looking at grave stele such as "Aphrodeisia, Daughter of Theudotos," we can learn what life and art for Greeks during the hellenistic period was like.

==History==
The organization had its beginnings in 1912, when the Authors' League of America was formed by some 350 book and magazine authors, as well as dramatists. In 1921, this group split into two branches of the League: the Dramatists Guild for writers of radio and stage drama and the [[Authors Guild]] for novelists and nonfiction book/magazine authors.

A performance of the dance features sixteen masked male dancers and ten musicians. The dancers wear monastic robes and wooden masks with features of animals, both real and mythical.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The musicians play "cymbals, trumpets and drums, including the ''bang nga'', a large cylindrical drum, the ''lag nga'', a small hand-held circular flat drum, and the ''nga chen'', a drum beaten with a bent drumstick."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They first perform a prayer dance in the ''soeldep cham'', the main shrine, before appearing one by one in the courtyard of the monastery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dance has two parts: a calm, contemplative part to represent the peaceful deities, and a rapid, athletic part for the wrathful ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Performances of the dance have been conducted for almost five centuries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the late nineteenth century, the dance started spreading to other parts of Bhutan.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Today, it is approaching to be something of a national dance for the country, representing the identity of the Bhutanese nation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The dance was inscribed in the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] in 2008, though it was originally proclaimed in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The original proclamation notes "the number of practitioners is dwindling due to the lack of rehearsal time, the absence of a systematic mechanism to train and honour the dancers and musicians and the gradual decrease in interest among young people."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/06apa_uk.htm|title=The Mask Dance of the Drums from Drametse|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fashion design''' is the [[art]] of applying [[design]], [[aesthetics]] and natural beauty to [[clothing]] and its [[Fashion accessory|accessories]]. It is influenced by cultural and social attitudes, and has varied over time and place. [[Fashion designers]] work in a number of ways in designing clothing and accessories such as bracelets and necklaces. Because of the time required to bring a garment onto the market, designers must at times [[Fashion forecasting|anticipate changes to consumer tastes]].

Designers conduct research on fashion trends and interpret them for their audience. Their specific designs are used by manufacturers. This is the essence of a designer’s role; however, there is variation within this that is determined by the buying and merchandising approach, and product quality; for example, budget retailers will use inexpensive fabrics to interpret trends, but high-end retailers will ensure that the best available fabrics are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1517632943/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_dp_TIXlzbNKHZAEH|title=Fashion Buying and Merchandising: From mass-market to luxury retail|last=Hebrero|first=Miguel|date=2015-10-15|publisher=CreateSpace|year=|isbn=9781517632946|location=Printed in the USA|pages=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fashion designers attempt to design clothes which are functional as well as aesthetically pleasing. They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn, they have a wide range and combinations of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. Though most clothing worn for everyday wear falls within a narrow range of conventional styles, unusual garments are usually sought for special occasions such as [[formal wear|evening wear]] or party [[dress]]es.

Some clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of [[haute couture]] or [[bespoke tailoring]]. Today, most clothing is designed for the [[mass market]], especially casual and every-day wear are called [[ready to wear]].

== Structure ==
Fashion designers may work full-time for one fashion house, as 'in-house designers', which owns the designs, or they work alone or as part of a team. Freelance designers work for themselves, selling their designs to fashion houses, directly to shops, or to clothing manufacturers. The garments bear the buyer's label. Some fashion designers set up their own labels, under which their designs are marketed. Some fashion designers are self-employed and design for individual clients. Other [[high-end]] fashion designers cater to specialty stores or high-end fashion department stores. These designers create original garments, as well as those that follow established fashion trends. Most fashion designers, however, work for apparel manufacturers, creating designs of men's, women's, and children's fashions for the mass market. Large designer brands which have a 'name' as their brand such as [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]], [[Tween Brands|Justice]], or [[Juicy Couture|Juicy]] are likely to be designed by a team of individual designers under the direction of a design director.

== Designing a garment ==
Fashion designers work in different ways. Some sketch their ideas on paper, while others drape fabric on a dress form. When a designer is completely satisfied with the fit of the ''toile'' (or muslin), he or she will consult a professional pattern maker who then makes the finished, working version of the pattern out of card or via a computerized system. Finally, a sample garment is made up and tested on a model to make sure it is an operational outfit.

==History==
[[File:Chéruit Salon Paris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Louise Chéruit|Chéruit]] salon on [[Place Vendôme]] in Paris, 1910]]
{{main article|History of fashion design}}
Fashion design is generally considered to have started in the 19th century with [[Charles Frederick Worth]] who was the first designer to have his [[label]] sewn into the garments that he created. Before the former [[draper]] set up his ''maison couture'' (fashion house) in [[Paris]], clothing design and creation was handled by largely anonymous seamstresses, and high fashion descended from that worn at royal courts. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term ''couturier'' was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered as fashion design.

It was during this period that many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs instead of presenting completed garments on models to customers began as an economy.

==Types of fashion==
The garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories

===Haute couture===
{{Main article|Haute couture}}
Until the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a [[made-to-measure]] or [[haute couture]] basis ([[French language|French]] for high-sewing), with each garment being created for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Haute Couture?|url=http://www.hautecouturenews.com/what-is-haute-couture/|work=Haute Couture Hot|publisher=HauteCoutureNews.com|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haute Couture Fashion History|url=http://fashion-era.com/haute_couture.htm|work=Fashion-Era.com|publisher=Fashion-Era.com|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Pauline Weston Thomas|format=Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG7883236/Haute-couture-Making-a-loss-is-the-height-of-fashion.html|title=Haute couture: Making a loss is the height of fashion|work=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ready-to-wear (prêt-à-porter)===
{{Main article|Ready-to-wear}}

Ready-to-wear, or prêt-à-porter, clothes are a cross between haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as [[Fashion Week]]. This takes place on a citywide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of [[Fashion Week]] include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.

===Mass market===

}}
{{Main article|Mass market}}

Currently the [[fashion industry]] relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. To save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designers Flock to Mass-Market Retailers|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=87177&amp;page=1#.T68WL9kZHIU|work=ABC News|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Catherine Valenti|format=Article|date=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out from Underground|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/10/31/out-from-underground.html|work=The Daily Beast|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Sameer Reddy|format=Article|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass market broached by high-end fashion |url=http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091#.T68YgNkZHIU |work=The Prospector |publisher=College Media Network |accessdate=13 May 2012 |author=Stephania Lara |format=Article |date=22 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102205229/http://www.utepprospector.com/news/mass-market-broached-by-high-end-fashion-1.1494091 |archivedate=2 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a type of design called "kutch" design originated from the German word "kitschig" meaning "ugly" or "not aesthetically pleasing".  ''Kitsch'' can also refer to "wearing or displaying something that is therefore no longer in fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kitsch pickings|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3e2b1f30-7f3a-11e1-b3d4-00144feab49a.html#axzz1uiFiHExC|work=Financial Times Online: Style|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd|accessdate=13 May 2012|author=Bethan Cole|format=Article|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Income ==
Median annual wages for salaried fashion designers were $61,160 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $42,150 and $87,120.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashion Designers|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Arts-and-Design/Fashion-designers.htm|work=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lowest 10 percent earned less than $32,150, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $124,780. Median annual earnings were $52,860 (£40,730.47) in apparel, piece goods, and notions - the industry employing the largest numbers of fashion designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/ooh20022003/ocos090.htm|title=Designers|work=umsl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2016,a fashion designer's median annual salary was $65,170. High end designers can earn around $92,550. In the year of 2016, 23,800 people were accounted as fashion designers in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;((cite web/ url= https://work.chron.com/starting-salary-range-fashion-designer-9391.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Garment District NYWTS crop.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Men pulling carts of women's clothing in [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]], New York, 1955]]

Fashion today is a global industry, and most major countries have a fashion industry. [[China]]  , [[Bangladesh]] and India are the biggest manufacturers of clothing, and other notable clothing manufacturing countries are [[Germany]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[India]], [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], and [[Brazil]].

The "big four" centers of the fashion industry are [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[Milan]], [[New York City]] and [[London]]. Seven countries have established an international reputation in fashion: [[French fashion|France]], [[Italian fashion|Italy]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Japanese Fashion|Japan]], [[German fashion|Germany]] and [[Belgium]].

===American fashion design===
{{Main article|Fashion in the United States}}
[[File:"Elements" Fashion Show at College of DuPage 2015 30 (17334518498).jpg|thumb|260px|Fashion show at a fashion designing college, USA, 2015]]

Most fashion houses in the United States are based in [[New York City]], with a high concentration centered in the [[Garment District, New York City|Garment District]] neighborhood. On the west coast, there are also a significant number of fashion houses in [[Los Angeles]], where a substantial percentage of high fashion clothing manufactured in the United States is actually made. [[Beverly Hills]], particularly on [[Rodeo Drive]], is globally renowned for its fashion design and prestigious shopping. Burgeoning industries in [[Miami]], [[Chicago]], [[Dallas]], and especially [[San Francisco]] have developed as well. A semi-annual event held every February and September, [[New York Fashion Week]] is the oldest of the four major [[fashion week]]s held throughout the world. [[Parsons The New School for Design]], located in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of [[Lower Manhattan]] in New York City, is considered as one of the top fashion schools in the world. There are numerous fashion magazines published in the United States and distributed around the world for global readership. Examples include [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Harper’s Bazaar]], and [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]. 

American fashion design is dominated by a clean-cut, urban, casual style; reflecting the [[athlete|athletic]], health-conscious lifestyles of urban city-dwellers. A [[designer]] who helped to set the trend in the [[United States]] for sport-influenced day wear throughout the 1940s and 50s was [[Claire McCardell]]. Many of her designs have been revived in recent decades. Famous American fashion labels and designers include [[Zac Posen]], [[Kate Spade]], [[Isaac Mizrahi]], [[Vera Wang]], [[Bill Blass]], [[Joseph Abboud]], [[Calvin Klein (fashion designer)|Calvin Klein]],  [[Bob Mackie]], [[Anna Sui]], [[Derek Lam]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]], [[Michael Kors]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Tom Ford]], [[Tommy Hilfiger]], [[Geoffrey Beene]], [[Oleg Cassini]], [[Perry Ellis]], [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]], [[James Galanos]], [[Todd Oldham]], [[Donna Karan]], [[Liz Claiborne (fashion designer)|Liz Claiborne]], [[Diane von Fürstenberg]], [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]] and [[Nolan Miller]].

===Belgian fashion design===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Belgian fashion designers brought a new fashion image that mixed East and West, and brought a highly individualised, personal vision on fashion. Well known Belgian Designers are the [[Antwerp Six]] : [[Ann Demeulemeester]], [[Dries Van Noten]], [[Dirk Bikkembergs]], [[Dirk Van Saene]], [[Walter Van Beirendonck]] and Marina Yee, as well as [[Martin Margiela|Maison Martin Margiela]], [[Raf Simons]], [[Kris Van Assche]], [[Bruno Pieters]], [[Anthony Vaccarello]]&lt;ref&gt;Holgate, Mark, ′How Anthony Vaccarello Is Making Saint Laurent His Own′, (Feb. 13, 2018), Vogue March 2018, https://www.vogue.com/article/anthony-vaccarello-interview-vogue-march-2018-issue, Retrieved 3 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===British fashion design===
[[London]] has long been the capital of the United Kingdom fashion industry and has a wide range of foreign designs which have integrated with modern British styles. Typical, British design is smart but innovative yet recently has become more and more unconventional, fusing traditional styles with modern techniques. Vintage styles play an important role in the British fashion and styling industry. Stylists regularly 'mix and match' the old with the new, which gives British style that unique, bohemian aesthetic that many of the other fashion capitals try to imitate. Irish fashion (both design and styling) is also heavily influenced by fashion trends from Britain.
Famous British brands and designers include [[Burberry]], [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], [[Alfred Dunhill, Ltd.|Alfred Dunhill]], [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]], [[John Galliano]], [[John Richmond (fashion designer)|John Richmond]], [[Neil Barrett (fashion designer)|Neil Barrett]], [[Matthew Williamson]], [[Hussein Chalayan]], [[Gareth Pugh]], [[Stella McCartney]], [[Mulberry (company)|Mulberry]], [[Thomas Pink]] and [[Vivienne Westwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British fashion designers|url=http://www.visitbritain.com/en/Fashion-designers/|work=Visit Britain|publisher=Visit Britain|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French fashion design===

===Soviet fashion design===
{{Main article|Fashion in the Soviet Union}}
Fashion in the [[Soviet Union]] largely followed general trends of the Western world. However, the state's [[Socialism|socialist ideology]] consistently moderated and influenced these trends. In addition, shortages of [[Consumer goods in the Soviet Union|consumer goods]] meant that the general public did not have ready access to pre-made fashion.

===Swiss fashion design===
Most of the Swiss fashion houses are in [[Zürich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich labels|url=http://www.zuerich.com/files/?id=40184|work=Zurich labels: Media Information|publisher=Zurich Tourism|accessdate=13 May 2012|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss look is casual elegant and luxurious with a slight touch of quirkiness. Additionally, it has been greatly influenced by the dance club scene.

==Fashion design services==
{{or|date=April 2017}}
Fashion design services provide services like [[Trend forecasting|trend]] and color forecasting, [[market analysis]], design concepts and [[design document]]ation for [[manufacturer]]s. This way the manufacturer can contract out the design requirements rather than maintaining an in-house design team. Fashion design services providers can either sell the [[design]]s outright or license them out on a [[Royalties|royalty]] basis.

If someone is interested in launching a line in footwear, handbags, bedding etc. and are looking to outsource the design work, then a fashion design services provider can help. When initially launching the business, it might be expensive to launch with many new designs, and thus a licensing option from such a company might save startup cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS160645+17-Aug-2009+PRN20090817 27th Point Launches a New Program to Help Start-Up Manufacturers in the Home and Fashion Industry]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion design terms==
* A '''fashion designer''' conceives garment combinations of line, proportion, color, and texture. While sewing and pattern-making skills are beneficial, they are not a pre-requisite of successful fashion design. Most fashion designers are formally trained or apprenticed.
* A '''technical designer''' works with the design team and the factories overseas to ensure correct garment construction, appropriate fabric choices and a good fit. The technical designer fits the garment samples on a fit model, and decides which fit and construction changes to make before mass-producing the garment.
* A '''[[Pattern (sewing)|pattern maker]]''' (''also referred as pattern master or'' ''pattern cutter'') drafts the shapes and sizes of a garment's pieces. This may be done manually with paper and measuring tools or by using a CAD computer software program. Another method is to drape fabric directly onto a dress form. The resulting pattern pieces can be constructed to produce the intended design of the garment and required size. Formal training is usually required for working as a pattern marker.
* A '''[[tailor]]''' makes custom designed garments made to the client's measure; especially suits (coat and trousers, jacket and skirt, et cetera). Tailors usually undergo an apprenticeship or other formal training.
* A '''[[Textiles|textile designer]]''' designs fabric weaves and prints for clothes and furnishings. Most textile designers are formally trained as apprentices and in school.
* A '''[[Wardrobe stylist|stylist]]''' co-ordinates the clothes, jewelry, and accessories used in fashion photography and catwalk presentations. A stylist may also work with an individual client to design a coordinated wardrobe of garments. Many stylists are trained in fashion design, the history of fashion, and historical costume, and have a high level of expertise in the current fashion market and future market trends. However, some simply have a strong aesthetic sense for pulling great looks together.
* A '''[[fashion buyer]]''' selects and buys the mix of clothing available in retail shops, department stores, and chain stores. Most fashion buyers are trained in business and/or fashion studies.
*A '''[[seamstress]]''' sews ready-to-wear or mass-produced clothing by hand or with a sewing machine, either in a garment shop or as a sewing machine operator in a factory. She (or he) may not have the skills to make (design and cut) the garments, or to fit them on a model.
* A '''[[teacher|teacher of fashion design]]''' teaches the art and craft of fashion design in art or fashion school.
* A '''custom clothier''' makes custom-made garments to order, for a given customer.
* A '''[[dressmaker]]''' specializes in custom-made women's clothes: day, cocktail, and evening dresses, business clothes and suits, trousseaus, sports clothes, and lingerie. 

* An '''[[illustration|illustrator]]''' draws and paints clothing designs for commercial use.
* A '''[[fashion forecasting|fashion forecaster]]''' predicts what colours, styles and shapes will be popular ("on-trend") before the garments are on sale in stores.
* A '''[[Fashion model|model]]''' wears and displays clothes at fashion shows and in photographs.
* A '''[[fit model]]''' aids the fashion designer by wearing and commenting on the fit of clothes during their design and pre-manufacture. Fit models need to be a particular size for this purpose.
* A '''[[Fashion journalism|fashion journalist]]''' writes fashion articles describing the garments presented or fashion trends, for magazines or newspapers.
* An '''alterations specialist''' ('''alterationist''') adjusts the fit of completed garments, usually ready-to-wear, and sometimes re-styles them. NOTE: despite tailors altering garments to fit the client, not all alterationists are tailors.
* An '''image consultant''', '''wardrobe consultant''' or '''fashion advisor''' recommends styles and colors that are flattering to the client.

The '''Fist Crushing a U.S. Fighter Plane Sculpture''' is a gold-coloured{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} monument located in [[Misrata]], [[Libya]]. It was once located at the [[Bab al-Azizia]] compound in the [[Libya]]n capital of [[Tripoli]].  The sculpture was commissioned by the nation's leader, Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] following the [[1986 bombing of Libya]] by United States aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Corey Sobel. [http://www.esquire.com/the-side/opinion/7totalitarianwonders-2 ''Fist Crushing U.S. Fighter Plane'']. Esquire, February 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the shape of an arm and hand squeezing a fighter plane.

During the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the sculpture was frequently noted in media coverage of televised speeches given by Gaddafi on 22 February and 20 March 2011, in which he vowed to "die a martyr" to prevent anti-government rebels prevailing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/libyan-leader-muammar-qaddafi-vows-to-die-as-a-martyr ''Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi vows to 'die as a martyr' '']. The National, February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August, at the height of the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]], NTC rebels breached the Bab al-Azizia compound and international news stations broadcast pictures of rebels gathered around the statue, with one fighter having climbed onto it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/world/africa/24libya.html Rebels Storm Qaddafi Compound] The New York Times, August 23, 2011. Accessed: 2011-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Graffiti had been drawn on its base by rebel forces. At some point in time, the U.S. flag and initials U.S.A. had been removed from the representation of the plane.

It is now in the [[Misrata War Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.juancole.com/2012/07/looking-out-from-the-misrata-war-memorial-museum-libya-photo.html|title=Looking out from the Misrata War Memorial Museum, Libya (Photo)|website=Informed Comment|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''folding screen''' is a type of free-standing [[furniture]]. It consists of several frames or panels, which are often connected by [[hinge]]s or by other means. It can be made in a variety of designs and with different kinds of materials. Folding screens have many practical and decorative uses. It originated from [[ancient China]], eventually spreading to the rest of East Asia, Europe, and other regions of the world.

==History==
[[File:Albert von Keller 001.jpg|thumb|A Chinese [[Coromandel screen]] is seen in the oil painting ''Chopin'' (1873) by [[Albert von Keller]]. Typically for this kind of folding screen, the front has a detailed scene, while the back usually has a simple floral theme.]]

===Origin in China===
Screens date back to China during the Eastern [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] period (771–256 BCE).&lt;ref name="handler268"&gt;{{cite book|last=Handler|first=Sarah|title=Austere luminosity of Chinese classical furniture|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21484-2|pages=268–271, 275, 277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EKkblrm6sUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mazurkewich|first1=Karen|first2=A.

A folding screen was often decorated with beautiful art; major themes included mythology, scenes of palace life, and nature. It is often associated with intrigue and romance in [[Chinese literature]], for example, a young lady in love could take a curious peek hidden from behind a folding screen.&lt;ref name="handler268"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"/&gt; An example of such a thematic occurrence of the folding screen is in the classical novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' by [[Cao Xueqin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tian|first=Jiaqing|title=Classic Chinese furniture of the Qing dynasty|year=1996|publisher=Philip Wilson|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The folding screen was a recurring element in [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] literature.&lt;ref name=ha275/&gt; The Tang poet [[Li He]] (790–816) wrote the "Song of the Screen" ({{lang|zh-hant|屏風曲}}), describing a folding screen of a newly-wed couple.&lt;ref name=ha275/&gt; The folding screen surrounded the bed of the young couple, its twelve panels were adorned with butterflies alighted on [[China pink]] flowers (an allusion to lovers), and had silver hinges resembling glass coins.&lt;ref name=ha275&gt;{{cite book|last=Handler|first=Sarah|title=Austere luminosity of Chinese classical furniture|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520214842|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folding screens were originally made from wooden panels and painted on [[lacquerware|lacquered]] surfaces, eventually folding screens made from paper or [[silk]] became popular too.&lt;ref name="needham-v5"/&gt; Even though folding screens were known to have been used since [[Ancient history|antiquity]], it became rapidly popular during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="vgulik"&gt;{{cite book|last=van Gulik|first=Robert Hans|title=Chinese pictorial art as viewed by the connoisseur: notes on the means and methods of traditional Chinese connoisseurship of pictorial art, based upon a study of the art of mounting scrolls in China and Japan|year=1981|publisher=Hacker Art Books|isbn=978-0-87817-264-1|page=159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqkLAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Tang dynasty, folding screens were considered ideal ornaments for many painters to display their [[Chinese painting|paintings]] and [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] on.&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham-v5"/&gt; Many artists painted on paper or silk and applied it onto the folding screen.&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"/&gt; There were two distinct artistic folding screens mentioned in historical literature of the era.

Folding screens became significant during the period of [[Unified Silla]] (668–935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Kumja Paik|title=The art of Korea: Highlights from the collection of San Francisco's Asian Art Museum|year=2006|publisher=Asian Art Museum|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-939117-31-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Folding screens known as ''[[irworobongdo]]'' were important elements in the [[throne room]] of some [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] kings, placed immediately behind the throne.

Like many [[Japanese art]]s and crafts, folding screens originated in China. According to the 8th-century work ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', one of the earliest folding screens to reach Japan was during the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 672–686), which were gifts from the Korean kingdom of [[Silla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koizumi|first=Kazuko|title=Traditional Japanese furniture|year=1986|publisher=Kodansha International|location=Tokyo|isbn=978-0-87011-722-0|pages=154|others=Birnbaum, Alfred (trans.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 8th century, folding screens became well known in Japan through China during the Tang dynasty (618–907), which led Japanese craftsmen to start making their own, highly influenced by Chinese patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Impey | first=Oliver | title=The art of the Japanese folding screen | year=1997 | publisher=Weatherhill | location=New York | isbn=978-0-8348-0389-3 | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late [[Muromachi period]], the Japanese began depicting everyday life on folding screen, which was a custom imported from China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dougill|first=John|title=Kyoto: A Cultural History|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199760466|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folding screens were introduced in the [[late Middle Ages]] to Europe.&lt;ref name="handler268"/&gt; In the 17th and 18th centuries, many folding screens were being imported from China to Europe.&lt;ref name="handler268"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a coromandel screen?|url=http://quezi.com/3679|work=Quezi|publisher=Uclue|accessdate=9 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727031440/http://quezi.com/3679|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially the French had a certain admiration and desire for the Chinese folding screens,&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"/&gt; along with the rest of Europe,&lt;ref name="handler268"/&gt; and they began importing large lacquered folding screens adorned with art.&lt;ref name="handler268"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mazurkewich"/&gt; The famous fashion designer [[Coco Chanel]] was an avid collector of Chinese folding screens and is believed to have owned 32 folding screens, of which eight were housed in her apartment at 31 rue Cambon, Paris.&lt;ref name="coco"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coco Chanel’s apartment: the Coromandel screens|url=http://chanel-news.chanel.com/en/home/2010/06/coco-chanels-apartment-the-coromandel-screens.html|publisher=Chanel News|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She once said:

== Uses ==
Although folding screens originated in China, they can now be found in many [[interior design]]s throughout the world.&lt;ref name="oldhouse"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Dan|title=Folding Grandeur|journal=Old House Interiors|year=1999|volume=5|issue=1|pages=30–36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDEEAAAAMBAJ|issn=1079-3941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first uses of folding screens were rather practical. They were used to prevent draft in homes,&lt;ref name="oldhouse"/&gt; as indicated by the two [[Chinese character|character]]s in their Chinese name: ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|píng}}'' ({{lang|zh-hant|屏}} "screen; blocking") and ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|feng}}'' ({{lang|zh-hant|風}} "breeze, wind"). They were also used to bestow a sense of privacy; in classical times, folding screens were often placed in rooms to be used as dressing screens for ladies.&lt;ref name="oldhouse"/&gt; Folding screens can be set up to partition a large room and change the interior features of the space.&lt;ref name="oldhouse"/&gt; Screens may be used as a false wall near the entrance from one room to another to create a desirable atmosphere by hiding certain features like doors to a kitchen.&lt;ref name="oldhouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koll"/&gt; As many folding screens have fine artistic designs and art on them, they can fit well as decorative items in the interior design of a home.&lt;ref name="oldhouse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="koll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Koll|first=Randall|title=The organized home : design solutions for clutter-free living|year=2004|publisher=Rockport|location=Gloucester, Mass.|isbn=978-1-59253-018-2|page=41|author2=Ellis, Casey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details and history==

Joyce McMillan, writing in ''The Scotsman'', called Forced Entertainment "legendary".&lt;ref name="joyce-mcmillan" /&gt; David Tushingham, writing in the ''Financial Times'', called them "The best group of stage actors in Britain".&lt;ref name="david-tushingham-ft"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d60d8684-20a2-11d9-af19-00000e2511c8.html | date = 18 October 2004 | accessdate = 26 October 2013 | first= Tushingham |last= David | publisher = [[Financial Times]] | title = We go in and see what happens | quote = The best group of stage actors in Britain are Robin Arthur, Richard Lowdon, Claire Marshall, Cathy Naden and Terry O'Connor.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Avila, writing in the ''San Francisco Bay Guardian'', considered them "internationally successful and storied".&lt;ref name="robert-avila" /&gt; Lyn Gardner, writing in ''The Guardian'', has said that "Beyond these shores, however, the company is regarded as one of the greatest British theatrical exports of the past 20 years. ...

'''FurReal Friends''' (later '''FurReal''' in 2017) is a toy brand division of [[Hasbro]], [[Tiger Electronics]] and Dreamright Toys created in 2002 of [[Robotic pet|robotic pets]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/business/20021219-9999_1b19toys.html|title=No-toy story: Must-have goodies mostly not there|last=Green|first=Frank|date=19 December 2002|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown when it was made by Sega Toys in Japan. The robotic toys range from guinea pigs to dinosaurs. They come in many sizes &amp;mdash; some are able to be held in a child's hand and others are able to be ridden by a child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The prices range from $6 to $300. All of the toys move in some way. The slogan was "They love you for real, FurReal Friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newboy.com/en/Products.aspx?did=1&amp;bid=2llEQ2JXHmrBBwAPuNoNXA%3D%3D|title=FurReal friends|last=|first=|date=2014|website=NEW BOY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, it is "My best friends are FurReal Friends." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hasbro.com/en-au/brands/furreal|title=My Best Friends are FurReal Friends|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Hasbro|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FurReal is noted for its [[Animatronics|animatronic]] replications of creatures and domestic animals as an alternative to live pets, or emulating the behaviors of pets commonly desired by children including horses, cats, and dogs. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Certain robotics may be designed to represent creatures unfit for domestication. Bouncy, a robotic puppy, can jump and turn in a circle when a child waves their hand across her head. With Zambi, a robotic elephant manufactured and intended for charitable sales, a portion of its proceeds benefit charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201014827/http://www.projectzambi.org/|title=Project Zambi|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=Giving Hope to Kids in Need in Africa|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104113224/http://www.furrealzambi.co.uk/|title=FurReal Zambi Elephant|last=|first=|date=2009|website=ElectronicPets|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable toy manufactured by FurReal was the Butterscotch Pony, a large, animatronic, whinnying pony, among the toy line's products designed for children to sit on. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-141804866.html|title=Butterscotch Pony|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pony was designed with an assortment of sound effects mimicking those of live horses and opened a gateway to the production of a second animatronic pony named S'mores of slightly higher quality with more sound effects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Squawkers Macaw was produced: an interactive, vocal animatronic macaw capable of saying phrases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

FurReal Friends has manufactured models of varying functions and quality. The animatronics may come in different species or sizes. Models of newborn animals are frequently manufactured by the company. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Gurumāpā''' ([[Devanagari]]: गुरुमापा) is a mythical creature in the folklore of [[Nepal Mandala]]. According to legend, he is said to take away disobedient children, and so was banished to a field in [[Kathmandu]].&lt;ref&gt;Slusser, Mary Shepherd (1982). ''Nepal Mandala: A Cultural Study of the Kathmandu Valley.'' Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0691031282}}, 9780691031286.

Page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Gurumapa is one of the most well known [[Folklore|folk tale]]s in [[Newar]] society. He is depicted as a giant with a terrifying face and protruding fangs.

==The legend==

===Kesh Chandra ===

The story starts with an inveterate named Kesh Chandra who lived in Itumbaha, a sacred courtyard in central Kathmandu.&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Pratapaditya and National Centre for the Performing Arts (India) (2004). ''Nepal, old images, new insights.'' Marg Publications. {{ISBN|8185026688}}, 9788185026688. Page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.lonelyplanet.com/nepal/kathmandu/sights/square-plaza/itum-bahal| title = Lonely Planet review for Itum Bahal| work = | publisher = Lonely Planet| year=2012| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he had gambled away all of his property, he went to live with his sister. When he stole even the plate on which his lunch was served to gamble, his sister, wishing to teach him a lesson, served his rice on the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Jim (1981). ''Guide to enjoying Nepalese festivals: an introductory survey of religious celebration in Kathmandu Valley.'' Kali Press. Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply hurt, Kesh Chandra gathered up the food in a handkerchief and walked a long distance to the woods outside the city. Feeling hungry, he unwrapped the rice, and found that it had turned bad and there were maggots all over. So he spread the food to dry in the sun and dozed off.

===Droppings turn to gold===

When Kesh Chandra awoke, he found that pigeons had eaten everything. He was so saddened that he broke into tears. Taking pity on him, the pigeons left their droppings which turned into gold. There was so much gold that he couldn't carry it all. As he was pondering what to do, he saw Gurumapa, a man-eating giant that lived in the forest, approaching. He had been attracted by the smell of prey.

Kesh Chandran pacified him by calling him uncle, and persuaded him to carry the gold to his home with the promise of a feast and the right to take away children if their parents called him whenever they were bad. Kesh Chandra took Gurumapa home to Itumbaha and let him live in the attic. As the years passed, children started disappearing whenever their parents warned them that Gurumapa would come and get them.

===Banished to Tundikhel===
The local residents then decided that it was not safe to keep Gurumapa in the neighborhood. They promised to provide him an annual feast of boiled rice and buffalo meat if he agreed to live on the field of Tinkhya ([[Tundikhel]]). And so the giant was persuaded to move out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |title= Polishing up the past|url= http://www.nepalitimes.com.np/issue/2005/07/22/Arts/604|publisher=|accessdate=10 July 2012|newspaper= Nepali Times|date= 22–28 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the people of the locality prepare a feast on the day of Ghode Jatra for Gurumapa and leave it on the field which is now a parade ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Child| first = John| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://newsblaze.com/story/20110315112122chil.nb/topstory.html| title = Colors and Rituals Mark Holi in Nepal| work = | publisher = News Blaze| date=15 March 2011| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bisht|first=Kapil|title=A walk into the heritage|url=http://ecs.com.np/features/a-walk-into-the-heritage|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=ECS Nepal|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hart was born in [[Massett]], [[Haida Gwaii]], [[British Columbia]]. His mother, Joan Hart, is the granddaughter of [[Charles Edenshaw]]. His father was European, allowing Hart to escape the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] that many Haida of his time were sent to. Instead, he grew up with his grandparents and became a fisherman.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt;

Hart discovered his passion for Haida art in high school. He began carving seriously in 1979. Hart first apprenticed with [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]] in 1978 to help construct a set of totem poles. From 1980 to 1984 he became an assistant to [[Bill Reid]] in [[Vancouver]], who by then was too seriously afflicted with [[Parkinson's disease]] to do much of his own carving. He began his work with Reid by putting the finishing details on ''The Raven and the First Man'', a centerpiece of the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]], and he also assisted on Reid's ''[[Spirit of Haida Gwaii|Spirit of Haida Gwaii / The Jade Canoe]]''.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/reid-controversy/|title=Reid controversy|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|first=Jane|last=O'Hara|date=April 28, 2003|accessdate=2014-08-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart lives in both Vancouver and Haida Gwaii.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt; In Haida Gwaii, he is known as ˀIdansuu, a hereditary chief name that he received in 1999 after it had earlier been held by Charles Edenshaw.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vm"/&gt; As chief he belongs to the Hereditary Chiefs Council of the [[Council of the Haida Nation|Haida Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.haidanation.ca/Pages/governance/hereditarychiefs.html|title=Hereditary Chiefs Council|publisher=[[Council of the Haida Nation]]|accessdate=2014-08-16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Hart was the first Northwest Coast artist to use bronze, beginning in 1982, and he has also made works in silver and gold.&lt;ref name="thom"/&gt; In 1988, he supervised the construction of the Haida house in the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/haaat07e.shtml|title=Artists – rebirth: Jim Hart|publisher=[[Canadian Museum of Civilization]]|accessdate=2014-08-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 wood sculpture that Hart considers to be his equivalent of a [[doctoral thesis]], ''Frog Constellation'', depicts two people on the back of a giant frog; it was installed in 2012 on the campus of [[Simon Fraser University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Jim Hart Sculpture Celebrated at SFU|date=May 25, 2012|url=https://www.sfu.ca/brc/news/story/jim-hart-sculpture-celebrated-at-sfu.html|publisher=The Bill Reid Centre for Northwest Coast Art Studies, Simon Fraser University}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dance Screen'', a large wood carving that he began designing in 2009, was installed in 2012 as a temporary exhibit in the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vanartgallery.bc.ca/the_exhibitions/exhibit_hart.html|title=Past Exhibitions: James Hart: The Dance Screen (The Scream Too)|publisher=[[Vancouver Art Gallery]]|year=2012|accessdate=2014-08-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/haida-artist-jim-hart-raises-cedar-masterwork-in-vancouver-1.1379557|title=Haida artist Jim Hart raises cedar masterwork in Vancouver: Massive carving The Dance Screen goes on display at Vancouver Art Gallery|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=January 11, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Hart's works, a totem pole called the ''Respect to Bill Reid Pole'', is part of the outdoor Haida village at the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC]].&lt;ref name="vm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/opening-date-set-for-bill-reid-gallery/article594483/|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|title=Opening date set for Bill Reid gallery|first=Marsha|last=Lederman|date=November 14, 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A bronze sculpture by Hart, ''The Three Watchmen'', is part of the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], and is installed outside the gallery in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Chief James Hart's bronze sculpture ''The Three Watchmen'' installed outside the NGC|publisher=[[National Gallery of Canada]]|date=November 10, 2011|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/about/1236.php}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaldor Public Art Projects''' is an Australian arts organisation established in 1969 by [[John Kaldor (artist)|John Kaldor]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}}. The organisation collaborates with groundbreaking international artists to create innovative, site-specific projects in public spaces.  By bringing art to spaces outside of galleries and museums, Kaldor Public Art Projects has changed the landscape of contemporary art in Australia with inspiring projects that bring together art, creativity and education.

The organisation’s first project, in 1969 was [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]]’s ''Wrapped Coast'', which at the time was the largest single artwork ever made. By 2014, the organisation had brought 29 art projects to Australia, utilizing a variety of public spaces including [[Cockatoo Island (New South Wales)|Cockatoo Island]], [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], and Sydney Park Brickworks. Kaldor Public Art Projects has worked with international artists including [[Gilbert and george|Gilbert &amp; George]], [[Michael Landy]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Bill Viola]], [[Thomas Demand]], [[John Baldessari]] and [[Tino Sehgal]] among others.

Kaldor Public Art Projects has been listed on the register of charitable organisations since 2004, and also contributes to the development of Australia’s cultural life through innovative education programs for primary, secondary and tertiary schools, as well as programs for the public.

== Education projects ==

=== MOVE: Video art in schools ===
MOVE: Video art in schools was produced in partnership with the [[New South Wales Department of Education]] and is a collection of video art works distributed to secondary schools for use in the classroom. Twelve leading Australian artists were commissioned for this program providing an education edition of their work solely for use in schools. The works are supplied on DVD and are packaged together with support materials that provide information on the artists, their works and the context of video art making. Student activities are also included, providing avenues for participation and creative engagement.

MOVE: Video art in schools includes work by Daniel Crooks, [[Shaun Gladwell]], [[The Kingpins]], Todd McMillan, Jess MacNeil, [[Tracey Moffatt]], TV Moore, [[Patricia Piccinini]], David Rosetzky, Grant Stevens, John Tonkin and Daniel von Sturmer.

Provided free of charge to public secondary schools, the resource is now present in all states across Australia, in over 1800 schools, and has been Australia-wide since 2011.

===MOVE Primary: Art in Motion ===

MOVE Primary: Art in Motion is Kaldor Public Art Project’s first art education project for primary school students throughout Australia, in partnership with the NSW Department of Education and Communities through its NSW Curriculum and Learning Innovation Centre.

Drawing on the success of MOVE: Video Art in Schools, this initiative is centred on video work from Shaun Gladwell, Jess MacNeil, Joan Ross, Grant Stevens and Daniel von Sturmer.

===MOVE Hospitals===

MOVE: Hospitals was introduced in 2012 in partnership with the Sydney Children’s Hospital Art Program.  This educational program introduced digital art to hospital patients and visiting students.  This initiative showcases digital work from artists such as Todd Fuller and Joan Ross.

Based on its new e5 instruction model for quality teaching, the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development has developed a Kindergarten to Year 6 art education resource based on ‘Public Art’ and, in particular, on the past Kaldor Public Art Projects by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Richard Long and Jeff Koons.

The publication features past Kaldor Public Art Projects by Christo and Jeanne-Claude, Richard Long and Jeff Koons as a way of engaging students with contemporary art practice and in particular to explore ‘public art’. Public Art, Teaching Excellence, the first in a series of publications on professional learning, will be distributed to Victorian schools in 2011.

'''''Synopsis''''', also known as the '''''Kievan Synopsis''''' ({{Lang-ru|Синопсис, албо Краткое описание о начале русскаго народа}}) is work of history, first published in [[Kiev]] in 1674. It interprets history through a [[Christian conception of time]] focused on the narratives of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], [[fall of man|fall]], and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatseel.org/100111/pdf/5a7_2_rikoun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It also had a political purpose to justify the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] which annexed the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] to the [[Tsardom of Russia]] while also claiming a central role for the city of Kiev.

[[Innokentiy Gizel]] is generally considered to be the author of ''Synopsis'', however this is arguable. ''Synopsis'' was the first textbook on the subject of history written in any [[Slavic language]].{{fact|date=December 2017}} It was rather popular until the mid-19th century and survived some thirty editions. 

The book began with the history of the origins and lifestyle of the [[Slavic people|Slavs]] and ended with the mid-17th century in the first edition. The second and third editions (1678 and 1680) end with the [[Chigirin Campaigns]] of 1677-1678. ''Synopsis'' covers the history of [[Kievan Rus']], the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], and the struggles against the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]], [[Ottoman Turkey]], and [[Kingdom of Poland|Poland]]. The author of the ''Synopsis'' asserted that the Russian [[tsar]]s were the legal successors of the [[Kiev]]an [[grand prince]]s. ''Synopsis'' is notable since it clearly demonstrates that the idea of uniting all [[East Slavic people]] under the authority of one state was born not in [[Moscow]] but in the south-western lands of former [[Kievan Rus']] and designed in Kiev.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

The purpose of the work is to "achieve a precarious balance between glorifying the Muscovite tsar on the one hand and defending Kiev’s own claims to power on the other."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aatseel.org/100111/pdf/5a7_2_rikoun.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The appendix of the ''Synopsis'' contains lists of Russian princes, [[Poland|Polish]] [[Voivode]]s in [[Little Russia]], [[Cossack]] [[hetman]]s, and Kievan [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]]s.

'''''Lake with Dead Trees''''', also known as '''''Catskill''''', is an oil on canvas painting completed in 1825 by [[Thomas Cole]]. Depicting a scene in the [[Catskill Mountains]] in southeastern New York State, this work is one of five of Cole's 1825 landscapes to found the mid-19th century American art movement known as the [[Hudson River School]].

==Artist's Background==
Tom Christopher wrote that “[Thomas] Cole’s greatest artistic asset proved to be his untutored eye.”&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cole emigrated to [[America]] with his family in the spring of 1819 at the age of eighteen.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, ''The Life and Works of Thomas Cole'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child, his surroundings were of [[Lancashire]], [[England]], an area known to be an epicenter of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]’s primarily industrial region.  Because of this, Cole was granted an additional clarity of and sensitivity to the vibrancy of American landscapes awash with color, a stark contrast to the bleak and subdued landscapes of the country he left behind.&lt;ref&gt;Great Northern Catskills of Greene County. “Hudson River School of Art,” 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==''Lake with Dead Trees'' and The Hudson River School==
When Cole emerged from the Catskill mountains in 1825, not only would he bring with him some of the first renderings of the Catskills in his first five landscape paintings, but in those paintings, he brought a new style of art.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Accessed October 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  This style would come to be known as the [[Hudson River School]], a style that would sweep across the United States in celebration of one of America’s most prized attributes, our natural resources and wildernesses.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Curator of American Paintings and Sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum, [[H. Barbara Weinberg]] described the style as, “[[Plantation era|Antebellum]] encounters with barely tamed nature, lovingly recorded in meticulous botanical detail and overwhelming in scale in comparison with those who enjoy its pleasures…”.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, “Late-Nineteenth-Century American Painting” 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial value==
Among those five paintings, the first of their kind, stands ''Lake with Dead Trees''. The oil on canvas painting was sold originally for twenty-five dollars in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Allowing for 191 years of inflation, the sum’s equivalent would now be $537.86.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman. “The Inflation Calculator”.&lt;/ref&gt;  While that was considered a respectable price and sale at the time, another work by [[Thomas Cole]], ''[[Part of the Ruins of Kenilworth Castle]]'', was recently put up to be auctioned with an appraisal of the painting estimated to be $200,000 to $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Invaluable. “Thomas Cole Auction Price Results”. &lt;/ref&gt;  A style that began nearly two hundred years ago is still viable and commercially successful. Currently, the original resides at the [[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] of [[Oberlin College]] in [[Oberlin, Ohio]], as it has since its donation in 1904 by [[Charles F. Olney]].&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual Analysis and Composition==
Simply named, ''Lake with Dead Trees'' exemplifies the typical stylistic traits of the [[Hudson River School]] art movement. The viewer’s eye is drawn first to the stand of snags foremost, which is highlighted starkly by warm morning light. They are skeletal, stripped of leaves, of bark, of any branch that would not bend. They embody death and they are surrounded by life. 

The trees are twisted splintering apart at the core as if by some great ravaging storm. The exposed raw wood shines sun-bleached in shades of pale yellow, white, and gray, the only darker pigments used to define shadows cast by light from the upper right side of the painting. Following vibrant trees along the lakeside, and along the bottom of the painting, there is further evidence of a great storm; downed and fallen trees lie by ample water, sunlight, and nutrient rich soil, conditions in which the surrounding trees thrive. 

The 27 x 33 3/4 in. dimensions of ''Lake with Dead Trees'' make it reminiscent of a picture window offering a portal to the Catskill mountains in southeastern [[New York State]]. The painting does not present a specific moment in time, rather it exists. It seems to indicate that within the delicate balance of beauty and life, there is also a strength that will slowly rise and reclaim where ruin has set foot. 

As the viewer’s gaze sweeps from the bottom left of the painting, a scene of destruction evokes emotions of loss and regret. Moving up to the right side of the painting and across the sky, sentiments shift with the change in light. From left to right, the sky clears from a ruminating storm to the respite of a clearing sky. On the left of the painting, the dead trees are prominent, as evident by their size and proximity. As the scene moves right, the dead trees become smaller; they decrease in importance, fade, and give way to living trees and new life. 

Each of these transitions, from left to right, are smooth, natural motions across realistic spectrums of extremes, until the viewer’s eye is caught and disrupted by the two deer crossing the painting. Captured in the pristine and graceful scene, the deer appeared overly poised, lacking the fluidity found elsewhere. In 1825, an unnamed contemporary viewer noted Cole might easily have omitted the two deer, as they “detracted from [the] foreground.”&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Influence==
The introduction of Thomas Cole’s works at the emergence of the Hudson River School style, gave voice to conservation, an idea that was just beginning to develop. It was at nearly the same time that ''Lake with Dead Trees'' was sold, as were the other four paintings, and Thomas Cole’s name was starting to become familiar as a noteworthy artist, that the [[Erie Canal]] officially opened across upstate New York.&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The opening of this major transportation system, second worldwide only to the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] in [[China]], swept the nation up in a surge of patriotism and celebration of the innovations of this great country. In this outpouring of nationalism, Thomas Cole was wholeheartedly embraced and became championed as the "American Adam of landscape painting.”&lt;ref&gt;“Modern Landscapes”, Allen Memorial Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cole is considered to be one of the pioneers of American environmentalism, for his concern for the impending destruction by “Copper-hearted barbarians … pushing a railroad up through his valley to exploit its natural resources – through mining, quarrying, and logging” and in his effort to inform the public, Thomas Cole’s labors are among those that motivated the creation of the [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Catskill Park]] was established in 1904 to protect thousands of acres, incredible vistas, and mountain ranges including thirty-three [[Catskill’s high peaks]], a natural inheritance that will remain forever wild, an event that without Thomas Cole, and ''Lake with Dead Trees'', likely would not have transpired.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, “Living Off the Landscape,” 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

The film is about what the routine of everyday life can do to the human mind and psyche. It also reflects on the importance of the choices we make and how limited these choices are in the first place. The plot evolves around a family of four. They live in the suburbs, in a strange villa that appears, through a complex game of mirrors, to be more like a piece of [[installation art]] than a real house. The main character, who hardly appears on screen, is the son, a man in his thirties. Suffering from [[asthma]] and [[eczema]] since childhood, he uses his condition to manipulate his parents and his sister.  Thus the existence of the terrorized family turns into an endless ritual of attempting to satisfy his whims, and always on the alert for yet another one of his “health crises”.
''Las Meninas'' resembles the scattered pieces of a [[puzzle]]. It is up to the viewer to assemble them in order to form his very own picture – something that makes the film itself personal and unique.

The idea for the script appeared in 2004, inspired by Doctor Janos Sanocky’s account of a case from his medical practice. The dialogue was co-written by the Lithuanian-Russian writer Andrey Levkin.
The shooting of the film took place between September 15 and October 24, 2006, in Kyiv. Most of the film was shot through the mirrors,&lt;ref name="format.ua"&gt;[http://format.ua/index.php?go=Articles&amp;in=11&amp;id=87 ''Художник Ігор Подольчак та його кіно'']. format.ua Retrieved November 4, 2009 {{uk icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused serious difficulties for the director of photography, since there was a permanent challenge for the crew to avoid getting into the shot.
Editing, effects, color correction, and rendering of the film took 14 months. All post-production work except for rendering was done by Ihor Podolchak himself. ''Las Meninas'' was the first feature film in Ukraine created entirely with the [[Digital intermediate]] process.&lt;ref name="AJA"&gt;[http://www.aja.com/news/index_article.php?id=33 AJA KONA 3 Enables Post Production for ''Las Meninas''] aja.com Retrieved November 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the music in the film was written for cello and piano by composer [[Alexander Shchetynsky]]. Director and composer paid attention to the central role of music as a semantic counterpoint to the dialogue and visual imagery, so the sound level of the film can be viewed as an integral sound installation. American video clip director [[Dean Karr]] co-directed the music part of the film.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is painting? ==
Painting can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity. The word "art" is therefore both a verb and a noun, as is the word "painting".
** [[Work of art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic physical item or artistic creation. A painting is a work of art expressed in paint.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, painting is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Painting is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse.
*** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
*** One of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.

== Essence of painting ==
* [[Emotions]]
** [[Love]]
* [[Knowledge]]
* [[Perception]]
* [[Creativity]]
* [[Imagination]]
* [[Artistic inspiration]]
** [[Muse]]
** [[Afflatus]]

== Styles of painting ==

=== Styles of painting by movement ===
* [[Abstract Expressionism]] &amp;ndash; movement in painting, originating in New York City in the 1940s. It emphasized spontaneous personal expression, freedom from accepted artistic values, surface qualities of paint, and the act of painting itself. Pollock, de Kooning, Motherwell, and Kline, are important abstract expressionists.
* [[Academic art]] &amp;ndash; a style of painting and sculpture produced under the influence of European academies or universities. Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French Académie des beaux-arts, which practiced under the movements of Neoclassicism and Romanticism, and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles.
* [[Action Painting]] &amp;ndash; connected to the Abstract Expressionist movement, but more precise in its meaning, Action Painting believes in the expressive power held in the actual act of painting as much as in the finished product. Rosenberg defined the notion of the canvas as seen by the artists in this movement as being 'not a picture but an event'.
* [[Art Deco]] &amp;ndash; design style prevalent during the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by a sleek use of straight lines and slender form.
* [[Art Nouveau]] &amp;ndash; decorative art movement that emerged in the late nineteenth century. Characterized by dense asymmetrical ornamentation in sinuous forms, it is often symbolic and of an erotic nature. Klimt worked in an art nouveau style.
* [[Baroque]] &amp;ndash; movement in European painting in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, characterized by violent movement, strong emotion, and dramatic lighting and coloring. Bernini, Caravaggio and Rubens were among important baroque artists.
* [[Bauhaus]] &amp;ndash; school of art, design and architecture founded in Germany in 1919. Bauhaus style is characterized by its severely economic, geometric design and by its respect for materials. The Bauhaus school was created by Walter Gropius.
* [[Byzantine]] &amp;ndash; style of the Byzantine Empire and its provinces, c. 330-1450. Appearing mostly in religious mosaics, manuscript illuminations, and panel paintings, it is characterized by rigid, monumental, stylized forms with gold backgrounds.
* [[Classicism]] &amp;ndash; based on Greek and Roman art of antiquity with emphasis on harmony, proportion, balance, and simplicity.
* [[Color field painting]] &amp;ndash; technique in abstract painting developed in the 1950s. It focuses on the lyrical effects of large areas of color, often poured or stained onto the canvas. Newman, Rothko, and Frankenthaler painted in this manner.
* [[Conceptual Art]] &amp;ndash; movement of the 1960s and 1970s that emphasized the artistic idea over the art object. It attempted to free art from the confines of the gallery and the pedestal.
* [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] &amp;ndash; Russian abstract movement founded by Tatlin, Gabo, and Antoine Pevsner, c. 1915. It focused on art for the industrial age. Tatlin believed in art with a utilitarian purpose.
* [[Cubism]] &amp;ndash; revolutionary movement begun by Picasso and Braque in the early twentieth century. It employs an analytic vision based on fragmentation and multiple viewpoints.
* [[Empire Style]] &amp;ndash; sometimes considered the second phase of Neoclassicism, is an early-19th-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts.
* [[Dadaism]] &amp;ndash; movement, c. 1915-23, that rejected accepted aesthetic standards. It aimed to create antiart and nonart, often employing a sense of the absurd.
* [[Der Blaue Reiter]] &amp;ndash; name derived from a drawing by Wassily Kandinsky that appeared on the cover of the Almanac featuring a blue horseman. Established in December 1911 by Kandinsky, Marc and Gabriele Münter their first show was entitled 'First Exhibition by the Editorial Board of the Blue Rider' and was launched to coincide with the last show by the NKV in the same gallery in Munich.
* [[Die Neue Sachlichkeit]] (The New Objectivity) &amp;ndash; Expressionist movement founded in Germany in the aftermath of World War I by George Grosz and Otto Dix. Its artwork is characterized by a realistic style combined with a cynical and socially critical philosophical stance. Other artists associated with the movement included Christian Schad and Max Beckmann.
* [[Ashcan School|The Eight]] &amp;ndash; group of American painters who united out of opposition to academic standards in the early twentieth century. Members of the group were Robert Henri, Arthur Davies, Maurice Prendergast, William James Glackens, Ernest Lawson, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, and George Luks.
* [[Expressionism]] &amp;ndash; art that uses emphasis and distortion to communicate emotion. More specifically, it refers to early twentieth century northern European art, especially in Germany c. 1905-25. Artists such as Rouault, Kokoschka, and Schiele painted in this manner.
* [[Fauvism]] &amp;ndash; style adopted by artists associated with Matisse, c. 1905-08. They painted in a spontaneous manner, using bold colors. From the French word fauve, meaning "wild beast .
* [[Flemish School]] &amp;ndash; characterised by idealism and experimentation with perspective, Flemish Art thrived in the 15th century with artists such as Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, Hans Memling and Dirk Bouts. They specialised in portrait painting with religious themes and complicated iconography.
* [[Fluxus]] &amp;ndash; movement encompassed a new aesthetic, a reductive gesturality, part Dada, part Bauhaus and part Zen, and presumes that all media and all artistic disciplines are fair game for combination and fusion. Fluxus presaged avant-garde developments over the last 40 years. Fluxus objects and performances are characterized by minimalist but often expansive gestures based in scientific, philosophical, sociological, or other extra-artistic ideas and leavened with burlesque.
* [[Folk art]] &amp;ndash; works of a culturally homogeneous people without formal training, generally according to regional traditions and involving crafts.
* [[Futurism]] &amp;ndash; Italian movement c. 1909-19. It attempted to integrate the dynamism of the machine age into art. Boccioni was a futurist artist.
* [[Gothic art|Gothic]] &amp;ndash; European movement beginning in France. Gothic sculpture emerged c. 1200, Gothic painting later in the thirteenth century. The artworks are characterized by a linear, graceful, elegant style more naturalistic than that which had existed previously in Europe.
* [[Graffiti Art]] &amp;ndash; movement which achieved an enormous amount of success in New York in the 1980s. It was named after the spray-can vandalism common in most cities and most associated with the New York subway system. The two most successful figures of this movement were Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. The New York art scene embraced Graffiti Art, with several galleries specialising in the genre and a Museum of American Graffiti opening in 1989.
* [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] &amp;ndash; began in the early 1900s when several Canadian Artists began noticing a similarity in style. Canadian Painters Tom Thomson, J.E.H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael were often believed to have socialised together through common interests and mutual employment.
* [[Harlem Renaissance]] &amp;ndash; from 1920 until about 1930 African-American cultural movement became known as "The New Negro Movement" and later as the Harlem Renaissance. More than a literary movement and more than a social revolt against racism, the Harlem Renaissance exalted the unique culture of African-Americans and redefined African-American expression.
* [[Impressionism]] &amp;ndash; late-nineteenth-century French school of painting. It focused on transitory visual impressions, often painted directly from nature, with an emphasis on the changing effects of light and color. Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro were important impressionists.
* [[Kitsch]] &amp;ndash; German and Yiddish word denoting art that is considered an inferior, tasteless copy of an extant style of art.
* [[Lyrical Abstraction]] &amp;ndash; Post-War style of abstract painting emanating out of Europe in the late 1940s and a style of American painting emanating out of New York City and Los Angeles in the mid-1960s.

* [[Les Nabis]] &amp;ndash; group of French painters active in the 1890s who worked in a subjective, sometimes mystical style, stressing flat areas of color and pattern. Bonnard and Vuillard were members. From the Hebrew word for "prophet."
* [[Naive Art]] &amp;ndash; artwork, usually paintings, characterized by a simplified style, nonscientific perspective, and bold colors. The artists are generally not professionally trained. Henri Rousseau and Grandma Moses worked in this style.
* [[Neoclassicism]] or [[Neo-Classicism]] &amp;ndash; European style of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that drew inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome. Its elegant, balanced works revived the order and harmony of ancient Greek and Roman art. David and Canova are examples of neoclassicists.
* [[Op Art]] &amp;ndash; abstract movement in Europe and the United States, begun in the mid-1950s, based on the effects of optical patterns. Albers worked in this style.
* [[Photorealism]] &amp;ndash; figurative movement that emerged in the United States and Britain in the late 1960s and 1970s. The subject matter, usually everyday scenes, is portrayed in an extremely detailed, exacting style. It is also called superrealism, especially when referring to sculpture.
* [[Pointilism]] &amp;ndash; method of painting developed by Seurat and Paul Signac in the 1880s. It used dabs of pure color that were intended to mix in the eyes of viewers rather than on the canvas. It is also called divisionism or neoimpressionism.
* [[Pop Art]] &amp;ndash; movement that began in Britain and the United States in the 1950s. It used the images and techniques of mass media, advertising, and popular culture, often in an ironic way. Works of Warhol, Lichtenstein, and Oldenburg exemplify this style.
* [[Postimpressionism]] &amp;ndash; term coined by British art critic Roger Fry to refer to a group of nineteenth-century painters, including Cézanne, Van Gogh, and Gauguin, who were dissatisfied with the limitations of expressionism. It has since been used to refer to various reactions against impressionism, such as fauvism and expressionism.
* [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] &amp;ndash; group of English painters formed in 1848. These artists attempted to recapture the style of painting preceding Raphael. They rejected industrialized England and focused on painting from nature, producing detailed, colorful works. Rossetti was a founding member.
* [[Realist movement]] &amp;ndash; nineteenth century movement, especially in France, that rejected idealized academic styles in favor of everyday subjects. Daumier, Millet, and Courbet were realists. In a general sense, refers to objective representation.
* [[Renaissance]] &amp;ndash; Refers to Europe c. 1400-1600. Renaissance art which began in Italy, stressed the forms of classical antiquity, a realistic representation of space based on scientific perspective, and secular subjects. The works of Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael exemplify the balance and harmony of the High Renaissance (c. 1495-1520). Means "rebirth" in French.
* [[Rococo]] &amp;ndash; eighteenth-century European style, originating in France. In reaction to the grandeur and massiveness of the baroque, rococo employed refined, elegant, highly decorative forms. Fragonard worked in this style.
* [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] &amp;ndash; European style developed in France in the late eleventh century. Its sculpture is ornamental, stylized and complex. Some Romanesque frescoes survive, painted in a monumental, active manner.
* [[Romanticism]] &amp;ndash; European movement of the late eighteenth to mid nineteenth century. In reaction to neoclassicism, it focused on emotion over reason, and on spontaneous expression. The subject matter was invested with drama and usually painted energetically in brilliant colors. Delacroix, Géricault, Turner, and Blake were Romantic artists.
* [[Situationist International|Situationism]] &amp;ndash; influenced by Dada, Surrealism and Lettrism. The post-war Lettrist International, which sought to fuse poetry and music and transform the urban landscape, was a direct forerunner of the group who founded the magazine 'Situationiste Internationale' in 1957. At first, they were principally concerned with the "suppression of art", that is to say, they wished like the Dadaists and the Surrealists before them to supersede the categorization of art and culture as separate activities and to transform them into part of everyday life.
* [[De Stijl]] &amp;ndash; art movement advocating pure abstraction and simplicity—form reduced to the rectangle and other geometric shapes, and colour to the primary colours, along with black and white. Piet Mondrian was the group's leading figure. He published a manifesto titled Neo-Plasticism in 1920. Another member, painter Theo van Doesburg had started a journal named De Stijl, spreading the theories of the group. Their work exerted tremendous influence on the Bauhaus and the International Style.
* [[Suprematism]] &amp;ndash; Russian abstract movement originated by Malevich c. 1913. It was characterized by flat geometric shapes on plain backgrounds and emphasized the spiritual qualities of pure form.
* [[Surrealism]] &amp;ndash; movement of the 1920s and 1930s that began in France. It explored the unconscious, often using images from dreams. It used spontaneous techniques and featured unexpected juxtapositions of objects. Magritte, Dalí, Miró, and Ernst painted surrealist works.
* [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] &amp;ndash; painting movement that flourished in France in the 1880s and 1890s in which subject matter was suggested rather than directly presented. It featured decorative, stylized, and evocative images.

'''''St. Paul in Britain, or, The origin of British as opposed to papal Christianity''''' is a book written by [[Richard Williams Morgan]] and published in 1861.&lt;ref name="Hutton2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Hutton|title=Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EIhuFN48UoC&amp;pg=PA243|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=26 May 2009|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-14485-7|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carolyn D.

The work suggests the early entry of [[Christianity]] into Britain by [[Saint Paul]], [[Simon Zelotes]] and [[Joseph of Aramathea]]. It lists thirty one different [[druid]]ic [[universities]] which he says had been established in most of the subsequently well known English cities (which Morgan named using real or invented Welsh names).&lt;ref name="Hutton2009"/&gt;

History professor Joanne Pearson noted that "Morgan's lifetime saw both the heyday and the demise of the story in Wales" of an alleged early entry of Christianity, which began with works written the year Morgan was born by Bishop [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]] arguing that St. Paul converted Britain to Christianity and ended with an essay by Vicar [[John Pryce]] which refuted the arguments for an early entry of Christianity and was written shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="Pearson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pearson, Joanne|title=Wicca and the Christian Heritage: Ritual, Sex and Magic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Au_paUclEZkC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=8 November 2012|date=27 June 2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-25413-7|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book makes the claim that Caratacus and his family was converted to Christianity and that he founded "the royal family of ancient Britain,— of whom her present Majesty, Queen Victoria, is, through the Tudors, the lineal blood representative." He also argued that [[Boudica]] was a Christian and related by marriage to St. Paul.&lt;ref name="Williams2009"/&gt;

The author [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] had a copy of Morgan's book and used it as the basis for his writing on British Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Joanne., ''Wicca and the Christian Heritage: Ritual, Sex and Magic'' Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007 pp. 57. {{ISBN|978-0-415-25413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Cardwell]] published a critical booklet on the topic in 1837 entitled ''The Supposed Visit of St Paul To Britain: A Lecture Delivered In The University of Oxford'' (Sermons, Volume 2), that predated Morgan's book.&lt;ref&gt;London: John Murray, 1837&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ia700803.us.archive.org/zipview.php?zip=/22/items/olcovers557/olcovers557-L.zip&amp;file=5571298-L.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/supposedvisitofs00cardrich PDF downloadable]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Snow Globe girl.jpg|thumb|A girl holding a snow globe]]
A '''snow globe''' (also called a '''waterglobe''', '''snowstorm''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=snow-storm, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183531|website=OED|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=28 August 2014}} (subscription required for online version)&lt;/ref&gt; or '''snowdome''') is a [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] sphere, traditionally made of glass, enclosing a miniaturized scene of some sort, often together with a model of a town, landscape or figure. The sphere also encloses the water in the globe; the water serves as the medium through which the "snow" falls. To activate the snow, the globe is shaken to churn up the white particles. The globe is then placed back in its position and the flakes fall down slowly through the water. Snow globes sometimes have a built-in [[music box]] that plays a song. Some snow globes  have a design around the outerbase for decoration.

== History ==
When exactly the first snow globes became well-known remains uncertain, but the popularity seemingly dates to the early 19th century in [[France]]. They may have appeared for glass blowers as adjuncts to [[paperweight]], which had become popular a few years earlier. Snow globes were exhibited at the [[Paris Exhibition of 1878|Paris Universal Expo of 1878]], and by 1879 at least five or more companies were producing and selling snow globes throughout [[Europe]].

In 1889, a snow globe containing a model of the newly built [[Eiffel Tower]] was produced to commemorate the [[International exposition|International Exposition]] in [[Paris]], which marked the centenary of the [[French Revolution]]. Snow globes became popular in [[England]] during the [[Victorian era]] and, in the early 1920s, crossed the Atlantic to the [[United States of America]] where they became a popular [[collectors item]]. Many of these globes were produced by [[Atlas Crystal Works]], which had factories in [[Germany]] and America.

At the end of the 19th century the Austrian Erwin Perzy, a producer of surgical instruments, invented the so-called ''Schneekugel'' (snow globe) and got the first patent for it. Originally his goal was to develop an extra bright lightsource for use as a [[surgical lamp]]. As he tried to intensify the candlepower of a so-called ''Schusterkugel'' (a water filled flask used to focus light since the Middle Ages) with particles made out of different materials for reflection purpose,
the effect reminded him of snowfall and it's said that by this he got the idea for a snow globe. He then built his first actual globe with the basilica of [[Mariazell]] as a model in it. Because of the great request for his snow globes, Perzy, along with his brother Ludwig opened a shop in [[Vienna]], where the production continues until today as a family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The family company that invented the snow globe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25298507|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://volksgruppen.orf.at/radio1476/stories/59668/ a unicum from vienna] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731114549/http://volksgruppen.orf.at/radio1476/stories/59668/ |date=2012-07-31 }} broadcast on [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]-Volksgruppen from 8. December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Today the globes get exported throughout the world; the material out of which the "snow" is made is handed down from generation to generation as a production secret (it should float as long as possible in the water before sinking down).

In the United States, the first snow globe-related patent was granted in 1927 to Joseph Garaja of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1929, Garaja convinced Novelty Pool Ornaments to manufacture a fish version underwater.

In America, during the 1940s, snow globes were often used for advertising. In Europe, during the 1940s and 1950s, religious snow globes were common gifts for [[Catholic]] children. Snow globes have appeared in a number of film scenes, the most famous of which is the opening of the 1941 classic ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.
[[File:Australian Souvenir Snow Globes.jpg|thumb|Plastic Australian Souvenir Snow Globes.]]
In the 1950s, the globes, which were previously made of glass, became available in plastic. Currently, there are many different types of snow globes available. These globes are produced by a number of countries and range from the mass-produced versions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[China]] to the finely crafted types still produced in [[Austria]]. Snow globes feature diverse scenes, ranging from the typical holiday souvenirs to more eclectic collectibles featuring [[Christmas]] scenes, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters, popular icons, animals, military figures, historical scenes, etc. Snow globes have even been used for election campaigns. Since 2000 fashion and luxury brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Ladurée, Sonia Rykiel, or Martin Margiela, got hold of the trend and grew particularly fond of snow globes as collectible totems and emblems of their brand image. Such enthusiasm was reinforced by presence in numerous art collections of contemporary artists  Walter Martin &amp; Paloma Muñoz (also known as [[Martin &amp; Muñoz]]) who use snow globes as a medium, or museums who paid tribute to famous artists such as French sculptor Auguste Rodin in creating high quality numbered glass dome snow globes.
&lt;!-- A history of snowdomes can be found in "Snowdomes" by Nancy McMichael. This book provided much of the material in this entry. --&gt;

== Contents ==

Initially snow globes consisted of a heavy [[lead glass]] dome which was placed over a [[ceramic]] figure or tableau on a black cast ceramic base, filled with water and then sealed. The snow or "flitter" was created by use of bone chips or pieces of [[porcelain]], sand or even sawdust. As they became more sophisticated, the glass became thinner, the bases were lighter ([[Bakelite]] was popular during the Art Deco period) and the snow was made out of particles of gold foil or non-soluble soap flakes. For health and safety reasons, white plastic has become more common in the construction of modern snow globes. The liquid has evolved to light oil and then a mixture of water and [[antifreeze]] (glycerin or glycol). An added benefit was that glycerin and glycol slowed the descent of the snow. Caution should be taken if a snow globe is broken because the liquid, which can contain antifreeze, can be deadly to cats and dogs if ingested or licked off their fur.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/2011/02/antifreeze-poisoning-in-dogs-cats-ethylene-glycol-poisoning/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embellishments==
Today's snow globes can include music boxes, moving parts, internal lights, and even electric motors that make the "snow" move so that it is no longer necessary to shake the globe. Some also have central slots for positioning items such as photographs.

==Forced-air globes==
In 2005, many U.S. stores started to sell inflatable snow globes as part of their Christmas décor. These have a base with a blower, forcing air which carries [[polystyrene]] pellets from the bottom and through a tube up the back to the top, where they are blown out and fall down inside the front, which is made of transparent vinyl. The rest of the globe, including the characters inside, are made of colorful [[nylon]] fabric. These globes are typically large decorations for the front yard, and are lighted internally with a few C7 ([[nightlight]]-type) [[incandescent light bulb]]s (which are enclosed in plastic spheres to prevent heat damage to the fabric).

A variation on this is the "tornado globe", where small foam objects spin around inside a globe. This is more common for [[Halloween]], where foam bats or sometimes ghosts may fly around the Halloween figures in the middle. These were most common in 2006, and come in both large inflatables, and smaller tabletop versions with rigid plastic globes about 8 to 12&amp;nbsp;inches or 20 to 30 centimeters in diameter. As with the snow globes, [[static cling]] often causes the foam to stick to the plastic (especially vinyl) when humidity is low, while condensation will do the same thing on outdoor inflatables when humidity is high, or rainwater has seeped in while it is deflated.

==Cultural references==
In modern culture, snow globes often symbolize childhood, innocence, or so-called "happy days". However, they are also sometimes used, with dark humor, to evoke more gruesome scenes.

===Film ===
* The film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) starts with Charles Foster Kane in a bed holding a snow globe, uttering, "Rosebud ..."; the globe slips from his dying hand and smashes. The film historian Paul Malcolm noted the scattered content of the snow globe parallels the scattered or "dispersed" story of Kane to come in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clayton, Alex  |author2=Klevan, Andrew |lastauthoramp=yes |title=  The Language and Style of Film Criticism|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|date= 2011| page= 182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The special edition VHS release of ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'' (1996) included a snow globe which, when shaken, stirred up both snow and "blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/02/movies/summer-films-synergy-a-few-words-in-defense-of-swag.html|title=Summer Films: Synergy, A Few Words in Defense of Swag|date=May 2, 1999|accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'' (2002), Edward Sumner ([[Richard Gere]]) uses the snow globe he gave as a present to his wife Connie ([[Diane Lane]]) as a weapon to kill her lover Paul Martel ([[Olivier Martinez]]).
* The film ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', based on a novel by [[Neil Gaiman]], had the child Coraline's parents being imprisoned in a souvenir snow globe of the [[Detroit Zoo]].
* [[Pixar]]'s early [[short film]] ''[[Knick Knack]]'' (1989) is about a snow globe snowman trying to break out of his globe.

===Publications===
* In [[Libba Bray]]'s book ''[[Going Bovine]]'' (2009), snow globes are used periodically as metaphors for the constraints of reality and life as we know it. At the end of the book, the main characters smash them, claiming that they are "freeing the snow globes".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
*In [[Erica Rand]]'s ''The Ellis Island Snow Globe'' (2005), a snow globe from the [[Ellis Island]] gift shop is one of the objects that "demonstrate how some narratives are promoted while others are repressed to represent a particular version of United States history and citizenship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nishime|first=LeiLani|year=2006|title=Rev. of Rand, ''The Ellis Island Snow Globe''|journal=[[Journal of American Ethnic History]]|volume=26|issue=1|pages=96–97|jstor=27501787}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sendzikas|first=Aldona|year=2006|title=Rev. of Rand, ''The Ellis Island Snow Globe''|journal=[[Australasian Journal of American Studies]]|volume=25|issue=2|pages=122–24|jstor=41054040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* The series finale of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' famously ends with the implication that the events of the whole series were nothing more than a mere fantasy imagined by Tommy Westphall, an autistic boy whose most treasured possession is a snow globe containing a small model of a building resembling the hospital in which the series is set.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
*In [[Sons of Anarchy (season 5)|''Sons of Anarchy'', Season 5, Episode 6]] ("Small World"), [[Jax Teller|Jax]] forms an alliance with [[List of Sons of Anarchy characters#Damon Pope|Damon Pope]] and détente among [[SAMCRO]], "black" (the One-Niners), "brown" (the Mayans), and "yellow" (the Triad). Jax then tasks [[Tig Trager|Tig]] with finding a pipe with which to kill the prison guard who had facilitated the fatal beating by other prisoners of Jax's childhood friend [[Opie Winston|Opie]], at Stockton, and who had said the guards were betting on how long it would take Opie to die. Tig can't find a pipe, and instead hands Jax a hammer and a musical "[[It's a Small World]]" snow globe. Jax  chooses the globe and winds it up; he, Tig, and [[Chibs Telford|Chibs]] slowly circle round the guard as in the ride, [[Ring a Ring o' Roses]], and then Jax beats the guard to death with the globe, all while the globe tinkles the song "[[It's a Small World (After All)]]".
* In 2014, in the final seconds of the last episode of ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'', a snow globe is shown on his bedside table, accompanied by [[Journey (band)|Journey]]'s song "[[Don't Stop Believin']]". The custom snow globe used was specially created for the CBS production, including the host's likeness in the middle, with his sidekicks Geoff the robot skeleton and Secretariat the pantomime horse.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

'''''The Commanding Self''''' is a book by the writer [[Idries Shah]] first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1994. A paperback edition was published in 1997.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''The Commanding Self'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Shah stated that ''The Commanding Self'' was "the key to understanding his entire corpus of work."

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|right|Idries Shah]]
''The Commanding Self'' builds on the foundations laid in Shah's previous publications, ''[[Learning How to Learn – Psychology and Spirituality in the Sufi Way]]'' and ''[[Knowing How to Know]]''.

"The Commanding Self" ([[Arabic]] ''Nafs-ul-Amara'' اﻟﻧﻔﺲﻻﻣﺎﺮﺓ) is Sufic terminology for the "mixture of primitive and conditioned responses, common to everyone, which inhibits and distorts human progress and understanding".

The opening pages of the book expand on this definition:

"The Commanding Self ... can be seen as a sort of parasite, which first complements the personality, then takes over certain parts of it, and masquerades as the personality itself." Shah states that there is "no intention of destroying or undermining the Commanding Self". Instead, would-be students are encouraged to "divert vanity from the spiritual arena ... to channel the Commanding Self's activities to any worldly ambition: while continuing to study the [[Sufi]] Way in a modest and non-self-promoting manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Written in response to requests for "clarification, interviews, question-and-answer sessions, lectures", the following sections of the book present study themes intended to enable the student to observe the functioning of their own emotional and conditioned responses.&lt;ref&gt;"Summing Up", ''Daily Telegraph'', 23 November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Upon its publication, [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] prize winner [[Doris Lessing]] wrote of ''The Commanding Self''; "What Sufis offer is learning, through experience. But if Sufism is not to be understood by people not involved in the process of becoming Sufis, or working with Sufis, what hope is there for outside enquirers; what use is a book like this one? But this is exactly where ''The Commanding Self'' comes in, and other books Idries Shah has been publishing which are part of a "course", if you like, and designed to introduce the interested to this way of looking at life, as well as teaching students. An analogy they use is that a dried peach is not a peach, but may prepare you to recognize fresh peaches when at last you eat one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ishk.net/sufis/lessing_commandingself.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329072149/http://ishk.net/sufis/lessing_commandingself.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Green Christ''''' (in French: '''''Le Christ vert''''') is a painting executed by [[Paul Gauguin]] in autumn 1889 in [[Pont-Aven]], [[Brittany]], France. Together with ''[[The Yellow Christ]]'', it is considered to be one of the key-works of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] in painting. It depicts a Breton woman at the foot of a [[calvary (sculpture)|calvary]], or sculpture of Christ's crucifixion. Calvaries are common in town squares in Brittany. The woman appears to be hiding from a pair of figures in the distant background; the green christ providing her cover from the figures. 

Topographically, the site depicted is the Atlantic coast at [[Clohars-Carnoët|Le Pouldu]]. But the calvary depicted is an amalgam of calvaires from different site; the cross is based upon that in the centre of [[Névez]], a community close to [[Pont-Aven]] and several miles from the coast, and the figure of Christ is based upon the calvaire at [[Briec]] - also some distance from the sea.

[[File:Frans Hals - De officieren van de Sint-Adriaansdoelen.jpg|thumb|290px|''The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633'']]
[[File:Wybrand Hendrik after Frans Hals - copy of 1633 schutterstuk for St.Adrian doelen.jpg|thumb|290px|This 18th-century copy by [[Wybrand Hendriks]] shows how much darker the painting has become over the centuries.]]
'''''The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1633''''' refers to the second [[schutterstuk]] painted by [[Frans Hals]] for the Cluveniers, St. Adrian, or St. Hadrian civic guard of [[Haarlem]], and today is considered one of the main attractions of the [[Frans Hals Museum]] there.

Unlike Hals' previous schutterstuk for this company, ''[[The Banquet of the Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1627]]'' in which all officers are seated at a banquet wearing the colors of the Dutch flag - ''[[oranje-blanje-bleu]]'', in this version, the men are seated outside in the courtyard wearing sashes showing the colour of the officer's "rot", with the Ensign Jacob Hofland holding the flag of the blue rot, and Ensign Jacob Steyn holding the flag for the white rot. Because they are outside, they are holding their weapons. For the first time the sergeants are shown, holding [[halberd]]s to differentiate them from officers with [[spontoon]]s.

Officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. This was not the first time they were portrayed outside. After Hals painted them in 1627, [[Hendrick Gerritsz Pot]] painted them in [[The Officers of the St Adrian Militia Company in 1630|1630 on the steps just outside their hall]] where the other earlier paintings hung. In this version painted for the next three-year service period, the man with the orange sash seated on the left and looking directly at the viewer is Colonel [[Johan Claesz Loo]], heading the table.

The men featured are from left to right Ensign Jacob Hofland, Captain Cornelis Backer, Sergeant Dirck Verschuyl (standing in background with [[halberd]]), Colonel Johan Claesz Loo (sitting in foreground with right hand on commander's staff), Ensign Jacob Steyn (flag in left hand), Sergeant Balthasar Baudaert (standing in background), Captain Johan Schatter (standing with magnificent blue sash with bow), Sergeant Cornelis Jansz Ham (balding, sitting behind the table), Lieutenant Jacob Pietersz Buttinga (foreground), Sergeant Hendrik van den Boom (background), Captain [[Andries van Hoorn]] (standing with orange sash with bow, and behind his head in the distance two guards can be seen), Sergeant Barent Mol (standing behind the table), Lieutenant Nicolaes Olycan (standing and pointing his finger), Lieutenant [[Hendrick Gerritsz Pot]] (sitting with book).

During the [[Batavian Revolution]] the schuttersgilde of St. Adrian was disbanded in favor of a new "Patriotic people's militia" called Pro Aris et Focis. The local artist [[Wybrand Hendriks]] commemorated the event with an engraving of the meeting, and this painting is shown hanging side by side with a later schutterstuk by [[Pieter Soutman]].

'''Tuyet Nguyet''' ("Snow Moon") is the Vietnamese publisher, editor and founder of ''[[Arts of Asia]]'' magazine which has been published continuously since 1970. Nguyet conceived of the magazine after her brother was killed in the Vietnam War in 1969.

==Early life==
Nguyet was born in [[Tan An]] province, Vietnam, near the [[Mekong River]] in the south of the country. Her name means "Snow Moon" in English. Nguyet's father had attended university in Paris and graduated with a degree in [[agronomy]]. He was responsible for the introduction of fertilisers on the French model into Vietnamese rice farming. Her mother was a school teacher.&lt;ref name=sheaf&gt;[http://images1.bonhams.com/original?src=Images/live/2014-08/29/S-22319-0-1.pdf "The Markbreiter Collection"] by Colin Sheaf in ''Art of Asia from the Tuyet Nguyet and Stephen Markbreiter Collection'', Bonhams, Hong Kong, 2014, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyet was educated at the [[Marie Curie High School|Lycee Maris Curie]] in Saigon. In 1955, she was awarded a scholarship to study Journalism at the [[Mundelein College]] in Chicago. She received her B.A. in journalism in 1958.&lt;ref name=sheaf/&gt;

==Marriage &amp; Hong Kong==
In 1959, Nguyet married [[Stephen Markbreiter]] (deceased), an English architect, and moved to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=nguyet&gt;[http://images1.bonhams.com/original?src=Images/live/2014-08/29/S-22319-0-1.pdf "A Valedictory Editorial"] by Tuyet Nguyet Markbreiter in ''Art of Asia from the Tuyet Nguyet and Stephen Markbreiter Collection'', Bonhams, Hong Kong, 2014, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four sons between 1960 and 1969.&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt;

In Hong Kong, Nguyet developed her journalistic skills while writing for ''Asia Magazine'' (the Sunday magazine for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''), the ''[[Far Eastern Economic Review]]'', ''[[Agence France Presse]]'', and ''[[Modern Asia]]''.&lt;ref name=sheaf/&gt;

==Asian arts==
In 1969, after her brother was killed in the [[Vietnam War]], Nguyet began to plan a magazine about Asian arts and a preview edition of ''Arts of Asia'' magazine was published in 1970&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt; with the first regular edition appearing in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsofasianet.com/about/about.php About us.] Arts of Asia. Retrieved 7 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsofasianet.com/publications/20100308.pdf "Arts of Asia Magazine 40th Anniversary Celebrations"] ''The Standard'', 8 March 2010, p. 1. [https://www.webcitation.org/6bNAkrUwq Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the magazine, Nguyet sought to combine authoritative content from experts with detailed coverage of the Asian art market. Since its establishment the magazine has chronicled, through its saleroom reports and articles on collections and collectors, the expanding market for Asian art in Hong Kong. The executive editor of the magazine is Nguyet's son, [[Robin Markbreiter]].&lt;ref name=bridge&gt;[http://www.artsofasianet.com/publications/20060526.pdf "Arts of Asia Magazine"] Sponsored feature. Vicki Williams, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 24 May 2006, p. A13. [https://www.webcitation.org/6bN9tVdrr Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Nguyet helped to set up a vetting committee for the Asia International Arts &amp; Antiques Fair (AIAA 2006) at the [[AsiaWorld-Expo]] in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=bridge/&gt;

==Art collection==
The Nguyet-Markbreiters formed an art collection from the early 1970s which was particularly strong in paintings on glass and mirrors. Parts of the collection were sold by Bonhams in Hong Kong in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22319/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight''''' (also known as '''''Dressing the Kitten''''') (c. 1768–70) is a "fancy painting" by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] (1734–97). The picture is one of a number of candlelit studies made by Wright that demonstrate his skill in the use of ''[[chiaroscuro]]'' in which he specialised. Apparently an innocent scene of little girls dressing a kitten, the picture has been thought by art historians to have a number of deeper meanings.

==Genre and composition==
''Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight'' would have been described in the late eighteenth century as a "fancy picture", a type of picture between [[Portrait painting|portraiture]] and works with a historical or literary theme.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; It depicts two upper-class girls, probably sisters, who have put aside their doll in order to dress up their kitten instead.

The most notable feature of the painting is Wright's skillful use of ''chiaroscuro'', the contrast of light and dark, a technique in which he specialised, here seen in the play of the candlelight on the figures of the girls. The English portrait painter [[James Northcote]], who was a contemporary of Wright, called him "the most famous painter now living for candle-lights"&lt;ref name=Houst/&gt; and Wright's use of contrasts in this picture has been compared to the [[Utrecht Caravaggism]] of the religious paintings of [[Gerard van Honthorst]].&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Wright was also known for his close attention to detail which here may be seen in the careful depiction of the girls dresses, their doll, the necklace, and the bonnet on the kitten.&lt;ref name=Houst/&gt;

==Interpretation==
A longer look at the picture indicates that it may not be so innocent as it seems. In contrast to the little girls in Wright's ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' (1768, thought to be the earlier work), who shrink from the suffering of the bird, the girls in this painting seem to be enjoying themselves.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; The theme of cruelty is the same however.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; The girl on the left is placed forward, almost outside the scene, her index finger pointing to her sister, inviting the spectator to observe the proceedings.&lt;ref name=App/&gt; Her maniacal expression and the shadowy uplighting add a sinister dimension, suggesting that something unnatural is going on.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; If the scene was entirely innocent it would surely be taking place in daylight&lt;ref name=Kenw&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryant, Julius.|title=Kenwood, Paintings in the Iveagh Bequest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DAjHamKGor0C&amp;pg=PA408|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0-300-10206-2|pages=408–411}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the positioning of the spectator at about the eye level of the children enhances the feeling that the viewer is entering the secret world of the child with its attendant moral ambiguity.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;

The sexual undertone in the picture is suggested by the kitten, gripped firmly by the neck and who we may infer is male, which stares out of the picture as though protesting the forced [[transvestism]]&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; but at the same time suggesting with his tail an element of arousal, while the girls' doll lies on her back with her skirts around her waist.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; The candle adds drama by producing areas of light and dark, and refers to the transience of childhood.&lt;ref name=App&gt;"The dark side of ''The Kitten'': A Wright of Derby for Kenwood." Julius Bryant, ''[[Apollo (magazine)|Apollo]]'', December 1996, Vol. 144, No. 418 (new series), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; When the picture was painted the age of consent in England was just 12&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; and the girls, approaching womanhood, are more finely dressed than they need be, with fancy collars, cuffs and jewellery more appropriate to adults.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; The message is that today they dress up and cruelly toy with a helpless kitten, soon they will toy with the affections of real men.&lt;ref name=Houst/&gt; Wright did not marry until he was 38 and it has been speculated that the picture in some way reflects his frustrations with the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=Houst&gt;[http://www.mfah.org/blogs/behind-scenes-rienzi/2012/guests-abroad-joseph-wright-derby-fancy-pictures-a/ "Guests from Abroad: Joseph Wright of Derby and a Tiny Kitten with a Hat".] Caroline Cole, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]], 20 July 2012. Retrieved 12 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may also be an element of interest in the developing sexuality of the adolescent girls.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt; Cats were often used in eighteenth-century painting as devices to indicate female sexuality.&lt;ref name=rep/&gt;

The depiction of the girls in the painting has been contrasted with Wright's treatment of boys in his art. While the girls either shrink in horror from the cruelty in ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'', or turn cruelty into a game of fun in ''Dressing the Kitten'' in order to make it more acceptable to the viewer, the boys in ''Two Boys Blowing a Bladder by Candle-light'' are engaged in enlightenment scientific research, and the ''Two Boys Fighting over a Bladder'' are in the tradition of using children as allegories for adult ambition.&lt;ref name=App/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Art historians]] have also placed the painting in the tradition of [[Allegory|allegories]] of the cruelty of children&lt;ref name=App/&gt; as seen in the work of [[William Hogarth]] in plate I of ''[[The Four Stages of Cruelty]]'' (1751).&lt;ref name=rep&gt;"Engaging the Audience: Sexual Economies of Vision in Joseph Wright", Susan L. Siegfried, ''[[Representations (journal)|Representations]]'', No. 68 (Autumn, 1999), pp. 34–58.&lt;/ref&gt; The last in the series of the four stages, entitled "The Rewards of Cruelty", was a source for ''A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery'' (1766) and ''An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump'' (1768) and it is possible therefore that Wright owned all four of the engravings in the series.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; As a collector of prints, Wright may also have been aware of the work of earlier artists that explored similar themes, particularly Netherlandish painters such as [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Judith Leyster]] and [[Jan van Bijlert]], where there was a proverb "Whoever plays with a little cat will be scratched".&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt;&lt;ref name=App/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Provenance==
The exact date of completion of the painting is not known but Wright showed two "candle-light" paintings at the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain|Society of Artists]] in 1767, and again in 1768. ''Dressing the Kitten'' may have been one of them.&lt;ref name=Kenw/&gt; The painting was purchased at [[Christie's]] in 1772 by [[Henry Temple, 2nd Viscount Palmerston|Henry Temple]], second Viscount Palmerston (1739–1802),&lt;ref name=App/&gt; father of British Prime Minister [[Lord Palmerston]].

The painting is now owned by [[English Heritage]] and located at [[Kenwood House]], near Hampstead, London,&lt;ref&gt;''Oil Paintings in Public Ownership in Camden: Vol II''. London: [[The Public Catalogue Foundation]], p. 135. {{ISBN|1909475017}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has become the most popular picture on display.&lt;ref name=artf/&gt; It was acquired by English Heritage in 1996&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Acquisitions by English Heritage: Supplement", Julius Bryant, ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', Vol. 139, No. 1131 (Jun., 1997), pp. 435–440.&lt;/ref&gt; with financial help from the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], [[National Art Collections Fund]], [[London Historic House Museums Trust]] and the Friends of Kenwood&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/two-girls-dressing-a-kitten-by-candlelight-191854 ''Two Girls Dressing a Kitten by Candlelight''.] BBC Your Paintings.

[[Image:UTE logo.png|right]]
The '''Union of European Theatres''' (UTE; {{lang-fr|Union des Théâtres de l'Europe}}) is an alliance of [[Europe]]an public [[theatre]]s. It serves to promote [[European integration]] through cultural interaction.
It does intensive transnational theatre work comprising over ten thousand performances and reaching three million viewers
each season. The UTE presents festivals, exhibitions, workshops, theatre school collaborations, colloquiums and co-productions throughout Europe. The Union des Théâtres de l'Europe has over 40 members, 20 of which are major national and municipal theatres from 17 countries.

== History ==

The UTE was founded in 1990 by [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]], then Culture Minister of France, and Italian theatre director [[Giorgio Strehler]]. Apart from fostering European integration, their motivation also was the perceived threat to European [[cultural diversity]] posed by [[globalisation]]:

:"Already then we felt that the building of Europe required a firm stand against the unruly vagaries of the economic machine. Today we find ourselves faced with the same questions: how do we defend art within a [[market economy]] whose logistics are designed to [[Pensée unique|standardise our way of life and thought]] so that we are reduced to a state of passive [[consumerism]]? Can public policies that support the arts be more effective?"

== Mission ==

The UTE's stated mission is
:"to contribute to the building of the [[European Union]] through [[culture]] and [[theatre]], to encourage a collective cultural movement that breaks through language barriers in order to develop an art theatre which is seen as a vector of fraternity among people. The UTE promotes productions and co-productions, theatre exchanges and shared experiences while respecting individual identities and cultures. ... Etched in continuity, the sum of these activities helps in elucidating the objectives of artistic and cultural policies that aim to reinforce artistic cooperation and transnational circulation in Europe."

The UTE is a “multinational house”, an idea which corresponds to the so-called “Mehrspartenhaus” in German Theatre – that is, one major theatre with different departments, and in the case of the UTE one theatre that consists of seventeen national theatres but yet remains a single entity. This “multinational house” intensively discusses the questions of a European identity and the role of culture in its formation. Its goal is to promote cultural activities across national borders that respect the principles of the particular identities, a thing that requires common and continuous research. Its current programme focuses on projects that put new working methods to the test and connects experienced theatre creators with enthusiastic newcomers, projects which are close to the citizens of the different European cities, and all this on a long-term scale.

== Members and structure ==

The UTE is governed by a General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/ute_general_assemblies&lt;/ref&gt; and a board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/ute&lt;/ref&gt;

The president is Gábor Tompa, artistic and general director of the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj, Romania.

Today the UTE has 19 member theatres&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.union-theatres-europe.eu/UNIQ145760068806842/theatres|title=U.T.E. : Theatres|website=www.union-theatres-europe.eu|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 15 European countries and beyond:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12165">The use of '''[[urban planning]] in [[ancient Egypt]]''' is a matter of continuous debate. Because ancient sites usually survive only in fragments, and many ancient Egyptian cities have been continuously inhabited since their original forms, relatively little is actually understood about the general designs of Egyptian towns for any given period.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, "el-Amarna" 124&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptians referred to most cities as either ''nwt'' or ''dmi''.&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nwt'' usually refers to unplanned cities that grew naturally, such as [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], while ''dmi'' can be translated as "settlement" and usually refers to towns that were laid out along a plan. The archaeological evidence of such cities is best preserved, and has been most thoroughly delved, at [[el-Lahun]], [[Deir el-Medina]], and [[Amarna]], though some averment of urban planning exists at other sites as well.

== Predynastic period ==
{{main|Predynastic Egypt}}

Almost no traces of Egyptian settlements exist before the development of [[neolithic]] culture around 6000 BC, as settlements were certainly very small, and buildings were made of perishable materials such as reeds and were not meant to be permanent structures.&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; Sites that do survive do not show much evidence of urban planning. The earliest known predynastic settlement is at [[Merimda-Beni Salame]] at the southwest desert edge of the [[Nile Delta]] and covers about {{convert|44|acre|m2}}, a very large area for the predynastic period. The city was rebuilt three times during its inhabited life, and in at least one of its incarnations, its houses were placed very regularly along a main street. Almost all the houses follow a plan which faces their doorways to the northwest, to avoid the prevailing northerly wind.

Other known pre-dynastic settlements, such as those of the [[Badarian]] and [[Naqada]] cultures, are laid out arbitrarily and lack a defining plan. These villages mostly consisting of small huts situated around circular [[storage pit (archaeology)|storage pits]].

== Tell el-Dab'a ==
At Tell el-Dab'a were excavated remains of a settlement, dating to the early Middle Kingdom (about 2000 BC). The ancient name of the town is not known. An area of about 100 to 100 meters were uncovered, therefore, only parts of the settlements are known. The settlements consisted of at least ten rows of houses divided by straight streets. There is evidence that the town was surrounded by a wall. Remains were found in the North. Here there was also a bigger building. The East side of the settlements had an open space. The rows of houses on the east side (west of the open space) consisted of blocks with 12 houses. The single houses were small, just about 5 by 5 meters large and all built on the same plan. The rows of houses on the west side consisted of blocks of at least 20 houses, but perhaps even more. The settlement was inhabited only for about 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp: ''Ancient Egypt'', p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

== el-Lahun ==
{{main|el-Lahun}}

The workmen's village at el-Lahun was built and inhabited during the reign of [[Senusret II]] of the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelfth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; Located near the entrance to the channel of the [[Nile]] that leads to the [[Faiyum Oasis]], it housed the workers who constructed Senusret's pyramid as well as the priests who maintained the royal funerary cult, and possibly even the king himself. The village was apparently only fully inhabited during the king's reign.

The village was organized according to a regular plan. It was centered on the temple of the Senusret's pyramid, which visually dominated the village, and it consisted of two unequal quarters enclosed by [[mudbrick]] walls on at least three sides. The smaller western quarter contained the relatively humble dwellings of the workers that were laid out on a rectangular grid pattern. [[Flinders Petrie]], who first excavated the site, noted how the layout of the neighborhood would allow a single nightwatchman to easily guard the area. The houses all followed the same basic pattern and dimensions, and they were evenly spaced along the parallel streets. The streets were paved, and stone drainage channels built into them, leading to a central drain, allowed the disposal of dirty water from the houses. The much larger eastern quarter contained considerably larger buildings, including mansions, an "acropolis" with an attached guard building, storerooms, a few more workers' dwellings, and some buildings at the far east side whose purposes are unknown.

== Deir el-Medina ==
{{main|Deir el-Medina}}

The workmen's village at Deir el-Medina, located in a valley on the west bank of the Nile across from Thebes, was first constructed under Thutmose I of the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth Dynasty]] to house the workers who worked on the tombs in the nearby [[Valley of the Kings]] during the [[New Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Uphill&lt;/ref&gt; The village is surrounded by a thin mudbrick wall and built around a central street. Houses were connected at the sides, sharing walls for building and space efficiency. It is possible that entire blocks of houses were covered by a single roof.

The original village had 20 houses, probably supporting a population of about 100 people. The village was expanded once under [[Thutmose III]], and when the workers returned to Deir el-Medina after the reign of [[Akhenaten]], during which they were transferred to Amarna, the village was expanded again and formed nine distinct quarters. At its largest point, Deir el-Medina contained 120 houses and probably about 600 inhabitants.

== Amarna ==
{{main|Amarna}}

&lt;!-- [[Image:Amarna Map.png|350px|thumb|Map of Amarna]] --&gt;
{{Amarna Image Map|width=425}}
[[Akhenaten]] of the eighteenth Dynasty built Akhetaten as the new capital city of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, "el-Amarna" 123&lt;/ref&gt; For the location, he chose Amarna, a fresh site on the eastern bank of the Nile, about 275 kilometers northwest of the old capital city of Thebes. After his death, the city was virtually abandoned. The degree of planning involved in the construction of Amarna involved for the most part the administrative and religious buildings of the Central City.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 284&lt;/ref&gt; Even the planned part of the city was somewhat hastily designed and assembled.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 144&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the city was built along an eight kilometer north-south main street, referred to today as the “Royal Road,” which connected the Central City with the North City, an outlying satellite and the probable residence of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 284&lt;/ref&gt; The king probably lived in the North Riverside Palace in the North City, a large building on the east side of the Royal Road and separate from the rest of the city, protected by a fortified wall which enclosed a complex of royal service buildings. On the opposite side of the road from the palace lay a group of some of the largest houses in the city, probably belonging to nobles who were very close to the king. An administrative building containing an enormous warehouse formed the northern limit of the North City. At the southern end of the Royal Road lay the Central City, a group of temples, palaces, and administrative buildings forming the executive hub of the city. The planned buildings of the Central City can be found in an inscription on one of the [[Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|Amarna Boundary Stelae]] which marked the boundaries of the city at its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Fairman&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Akhenaten describes the main buildings he will construct in his new capital:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
…I am making a House of the [[Aten]] for the Aten my father in Akhetaten in this place. I am making the Mansion of the Aten for the Aten my father in Akhetaten in this place. I am making the “Sunshade of Re” of the [great] royal wife…for the Aten my father in Akhetaten in this place. I am making a House of Rejoicing for the Aten my father in the island of “Aten distinguished in jubilees” in Akhetaten in this place. I have made a house of Re-[joicing of the Aten] for the Aten my father in the island of “Aten distinguished in jubilees” in Akhetaten in this place. &lt;ref&gt;Fairman 136&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of these buildings can be identified easily by their inscriptions, but we know the names of others only through this speech. On the entire western side of the road and probably reaching down to the riverside was the Great Palace, consisting of several stone courts and halls, and housing at its center a huge courtyard surrounded by statues of Akhenaten.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 184&lt;/ref&gt; Across the road and connected by a brick bridge lay the King’s House, a small palace and residence of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 287&lt;/ref&gt; South of the palace (on the west side of the road) was the Mansion of the Sun-disc, a religious building whose purpose is not completely understood but was likely the king’s mortuary temple.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 146&lt;/ref&gt; In the northernmost position on the east side of the road in the Central City was the largest temple of all, the House of the Sun-disc, or the [[Great Temple of the Aten]], which lay on an east-west axis and consisted of a rectangular walled area measuring 760 by 290 meters, enclosing several individual temples. Near the temples were long storehouses and priests’ housing.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 148&lt;/ref&gt; Due east of the king’s house were offices, the archives (in which the Amarna Letters were found), and police and military barracks. On the eastern outskirts of the Central City was a walled workmen’s village housing the workers during the city's construction. Villas of the king’s vizier’s and priests sprawled along both sides of the Royal Road to the south. At the far south of the city was an unusual complex called the [[Maru-Aten]], a walled complex of gardens, pools, an artificial island, and open-air kiosks.&lt;ref&gt;Redford 149&lt;/ref&gt; While it was originally mistaken by excavators as a sort of pleasure resort, it is understood now to be a religious building.

Most of Amarna’s housing was in two large areas north and south of the Central City.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, ''Ancient Egypt'' 327&lt;/ref&gt; These sprawling suburbs housed the large population needed to maintain the court and run the administration of the Central City. Residing in the suburbs was a very mixed collection of social groups, the priests, soldiers, builders, sculptors and scribes having the most prominent houses. As far as the residential sections of Amarna are concerned, there is almost a complete absence of an imposed layout. Outside the corridor of the Royal Road, there were a few broad, far from straight streets running more or less north and south and joining the suburbs to the center, crossed by perpendicular, smaller streets. The houses themselves are arranged in arbitrary clusters which create distinct neighborhoods. There does not seem to be any concept of “prime location,” except to be located on one of the main north-south streets, and rich and poor seemed to live side by side. Proximity to the Central City or the Royal Road seems to have been unimportant, and there is at least one example of a royal vizier who seems to have chosen to live as far away from the king as possible.

'''Shantaram Rajaram Vankudre''' (18 November 1901 – 30 October 1990), referred to as '''V. Shantaram or Shantaram Bapu''', was a Marathi Indian [[Filmmaking|filmmaker]], [[film producer]] and actor.&lt;ref name="Tilak2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tilak, Shrinivas |title=Understanding Karma: In Light of Paul Ricoeur's Philosophical Anthropology and Hemeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1xXDHLlNYIC&amp;pg=PA306|accessdate=19 June 2012|year=2006|publisher=International Centre for Cultural Studies|isbn=978-81-87420-20-0|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is most known for films such as ''[[Dr. Kotnis Ki Amar Kahani]]'' (1946), ''[[Amar Bhoopali]]'' (1951), ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'' (1955), ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]]'' (1957), ''[[Navrang]]'' (1959), ''[[Duniya Na Mane]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]]'' (1972), ''Chani'', ''Iye Marathiche Nagari'' and ''Zunj''.

==Career==
V. Shantaram started his film career doing odd jobs in Maharashtra Film Co. owned by [[Baburao Painter]] at [[Kolhapur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiaplaza.com/Promo/vshantaram/page2.shtml Biography – The V. Shantaram Centennial Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902234856/http://www.indiaplaza.com/Promo/vshantaram/page2.shtml |date=2 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to debut as an actor in the silent film ''Surekha Haran'' in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/old/20001208/falis.htm Remembering the Pioneer] screenindia. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923154918/http://www.screenindia.com/old/20001208/falis.htm |date=23 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantaram, fondly known as Annasaheb, had an illustrious career as a filmmaker for almost six decades. He was one of the early filmmakers to realize the efficacy of the film medium as an instrument of social change and used it successfully to advocate humanism on one hand and expose bigotry and injustice on the other. V. Shantaram had a very keen interest in music. It is said that he "ghost wrote" music for many of his music directors, and took a very active part in the creation of music. Some of his songs had to rehearsed several times before they were approved by V. Shantaram.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Narwekar|first=Kiran Shantaram with Sanjit|title=V. Shantaram, the legacy of the Royal Lotus|year=2003|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co.|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-291-0218-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed his roles so well that [[Rajesh Khanna]] also has appreciated him for his performance.

He directed his first film ''[[Netaji Palkar (film)|Netaji Palkar]]'', in 1927.&lt;ref name="Lal2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lal, S. |title=50 Magnificent Indians Of The 20Th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkI1_n4QAxMC&amp;pg=PT274|accessdate=20 February 2015|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7992-698-7|pages=274–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, he founded the [[Prabhat Film Company]] along with [[Vishnupant Damle]], K.R. Dhaiber, S. Fatelal and S.B. Kulkarni, which made ''[[Ayodhyecha Raja]]'', the first [[Marathi language]] film in 1932 under his direction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/05/02/stories/2002050200380100.htm A navrang of Shantaram's films – Retrospective] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 2 May 2002. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100901060422/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2002/05/02/stories/2002050200380100.htm |date=1 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Prabhat co. in 1942 to form "[[Rajkamal Kalamandir]]" in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prabhatfilm.com/founders.htm Founders] ''[[Prabhat Film Company]] '' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903050113/http://www.prabhatfilm.com/founders.htm |date=3 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In time, "Rajkamal" became one of the most sophisticated studios of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2001/11/30/stories/2001113000910400.htm Well ahead of his times] ''[[The Hindu]]'', 30 November 2001. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201142316/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2001/11/30/stories/2001113000910400.htm |date=1 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was praised by [[Charlie Chaplin]] for his Marathi film ''[[Manoos]]''. Chaplin reportedly liked the film to a great extent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://in.movies.yahoo.com/news/charlie-chaplin-saluted-v-shantaram-140157157.html Charlie Chaplin saluted V. Shantaram]. In.movies.yahoo.com (18 November 2013). Retrieved on 2018-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shantaram introduced his daughter [[Rajshree]] (his daughter by Jayashree) and [[Jeetendra]] in the 1964 film ''[[Geet Gaya Patharon Ne]]''. That was the debut film for both of them. He also introduced his second wife Sandhya's niece [[Ranjana Deshmukh]] into the Marathi film industry through ''Chandanachi Choli Ang Ang Jaali'', directed by his son Kiran Shantaram in 1975. Ranjana dominated the Marathi silver screen in the 70s and 80s.

The [[Dadasaheb Phalke Award]] was conferred on him in 1985.&lt;ref name=phalke&gt;[http://www.ultraindia.com/movies/awards/vshantaram.htm 17th Awardee] Dada Saheb Phalke Awards, List of Awardees. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725024304/http://www.ultraindia.com/movies/awards/vshantaram.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Padma Vibhushan]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmavibhushan_awards_list1.php Official List of Awardees] Padma Vibhushan. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115044717/http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmavibhushan_awards_list1.php |date=15 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His autobiography ''Shantarama'' was published in Hindi and Marathi.&lt;ref name=phalke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 years of a Shantaram classic|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2033356.cms|accessdate=8 August 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=28 September 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811020639/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2033356.cms|archivedate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The V. Shantaram Award was constituted by Central Government and Maharashtra State Government. The V. Shantaram Motion Picture Scientific Research and Cultural Foundation, established in 1993, offers various awards to film-makers. The award is presented annually on 18 November.&lt;ref name=phalke/&gt; A postage stamp dedicated to Shantaram was released by [[India Post]] on 17 November 2001.

==Personal life==
Shantaram was born in 1901 at [[Kolhapur]] to a Marathi family with a Jain father and Hindu mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyden, John |title=The Routledge Companion to Religion and Film |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9OJLAZakI4C&amp;pg=PA148 |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-44853-6 |pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, aged 20, he married 12-year-old Vimalabai, a girl of his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian manner. Their marriage lasted their entire lives and its relationships of harmony and mutual support survived even his subsequent two marriages, which were concurrent with his first. Vimalabai bore four children, being son Prabhat Kumar (after whom Shantaram named [[Prabhat Film Company|his movie company]]) and daughters Saroj, Madhura and Charusheela. Shantaram's second daughter Madhura is the wife of [[Pandit Jasraj]] and mother of music director Shaarang Dev Pandit and of TV personality [[Durga Jasraj]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/jai-ho-jasraj/article2254030.ece Jai ho! Jasraj]. ''The Hindu''. 8 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Shantaram's third daughter, Charusheela, is the mother of Hindi and Marathi actor Sushant Ray a.k.a. [[Siddharth Ray]].

On 22 October 1941, Shantaram (aged 40) married the actress Jayashree (née Kamulkar), with whom he had fallen in love while they worked together in several films, including ''Shakuntala'' (1942) which ran for 104 weeks in Mumbai. Jayashree became Shantaram's second wife, and was received with traditional ceremonies by his first wife Vimalabai. Until January 1957, it was perfectly legal (and in keeping with ancient custom) for Hindu men to have more than one wife at a time, and it was typical for the wives to live harmoniously together in the same household. Jayashree bore Shantaram three children – one son, the Marathi film director and producer [[Kiran Shantaram]],&lt;ref name="Gavankar2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavankar, Nilu N. |title=The Desai Trio and the Movie Industry of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGAyEpXtK3UC&amp;pg=PA139|accessdate=5 May 2013|date=26 July 2011|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4685-9981-7|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 50 years of a Shantaram classic | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-years-of-a-Shantaram-classic/articleshow/2033356.cms |author=Mishra, Ambarish |date=28 September 2006| accessdate = 22 September 2014 | publisher = The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two daughters, [[Rajshree]] (the actress) and Tejashree. Shantaram's six children grew up playing and bonding with each other. The two wives also had a cordial relationship and often interacted with each other, although they maintained separate houses. Vimalabai was strongly bonded with Shantaram's extended family; she would be at her husband's side at all religious and family finctions that they attended, and she would be hostess whenever they themselves hosted such functions. On the other hand, Jayashree would accompany Shantaram to all events and functions connected with the film industry and the film profession and at any parties he hosted for the film fraternity.

In the early 1950s, Shantaram grew close to another of his leading ladies, the actress [[Sandhya Shantaram|Sandhya]] (née Vijaya Deshmukh), who was his co-star in many films like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje]]'', ''Navrang'', ''[[Jal Bin Machhli Nritya Bin Bijli]]'' and ''Sehra''. Vimalabai did not have much contact with Shantaram's professional associates and took Sandhya in her stride, but the case was different with Jayashree, who came to regard Sandhya as an ambitious gold-digger who was using the middle-aged Shantaram for her own purposes, to become a successful actress at his expense and riding on his shoulders. Things came to a head during the making of ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' a film which Shantaram was producing and which featured him and Sandhya in the main roles. Shantaram ran short of money while making the film, and asked his wives to give him their jewellery so that he could mortgage the same and raise funds to get over the cash crunch. The jewellery would be redeemed and returned to the ladies after the movie was completed, he said. Vimalabai agreed without fuss and handed over her jewellery, but Jayashree did not, apparently because she suspected that the jewellery would end up in Sandhya's possession. This led to a misunderstanding between the couple. Later, Jayashree realized that money was indeed the problem and that in fact, even Sandhya had parted with her jewels in order to help Shantaram. When she came to know this, Jayashree felt bad that she was the only person to have retained her jewellery. On some minor occasion (a birthday), she tried to make amends by gifting some of her jewellery to Sandhya, so that the latter could have some jewels at least. However, Sandhya declined the gift by saying that she had lately stopped wearing jewellery. Jayashree took offence at the snub and the rift between the ladies grew. It became clear that they would not be able to live harmoniously together the way Vimalabai and Jayashree were living. It also became clear that there existed a widening rift between Jayashree and Shantaram also.

Finally, Shantaram and Jayashree were divorced on 13 November 1956. This was one of the earliest divorces to be granted in India, because it happened only weeks after parliament passed a law making it possible for Hindus to get a divorce; previous to this, divorce had been literally impossible for Hindus. According to Shantaram's daughter by Vimalabai, neither Shantaram not Jayashree could ever forget each other in later life and both of them deeply regretted that the parting of ways.

Hardly a month after the divorce, on 22 December 1956, Shantaram married Sandhya. This marriage was also legally valid because the law which forbade bigamy for Hindu men would come into effect only on 1 January 1957; it was therefore one of the last bigamous marriages to be conducted among Hindus in India. Sandhya had met Vimalabai many times before her wedding, and when the wedding was being finalized, she told Vimalabai that she would only marry Shantaram if Vimalabai not only gave her willing consent but also permitted her to stay in the same house with her. Touched by Sandhya's humility, goodness and traditional values, Vimalabai wholeheartedly gave her consent. She performed the traditional ceremonies and received her new co-wife into her household. The two ladies lived together harmoniously in the same house not just during Shantaram's lifetime but even after his death. Vimalabai and Sandhya enjoyed a close and cordial relationship with each other, which was enhanced because of the large age difference between them, because of their common values of ''pativratha sanskar,'' and also because it was known from the beginning that Sandhya would never bear children. This was because Shantaram had undergone an operation after the birth of Jayashree's third child, which left him incapable of begetting further progeny. Sandhya had been informed of this fact and had accepted it knowingly, which earned her great respect in her new home and put to rest all the speculation about her being a gold-digger. She would often say in Marathi “Hey sagle majhe mula aahet (all these are my kids)" indicating Shantaram's seven children. Sandhya treated Vimalabai with great respect at all times, and Vimalabai looked upon Sandhya with deep affection. In the professional field, Sandhya worked exclusively with her husband and refused all film offers made by other film-makers. She starred in some of Shantaram's biggest hits like ''[[Do Aankhen Barah Haath]],'' ''[[Navrang]],'' ''[[Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baje]]'' and ''[[Pinjra (film)|Pinjra]].''

Shantaram died on 30 October 1990 in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/14188 Biography] American Film Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by all three of his wives. Even his second wife Jayashree, who was divorced from him, attended his funeral rites, participated in the rituals, and took to wearing the garb of a widow thereafter, thus indicating that the piece of legal paper which constituted their divorce was only a paper. Vimalabai and Sandhya continued to reside together in one house along with Vimalabai's son Prabhat and his wife and children. Vimalabai, passed away in 1996 after being bedridden for four years. Sandhya lives today in the care and company of Vimalabai's children, especially of Prabhat and his family.

Shantaram used to live at [[Panhala]] near [[Kolhapur]] in [[Maharashtra]] state. His daughter Saroj has maintained his house and has converted it into a hotel named Valley View.
