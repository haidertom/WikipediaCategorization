An '''antheridium''' is a [[haploid]] structure or organ producing and containing male [[gamete]]s (called ''antherozoids'' or [[sperm]]). The plural form is '''antheridia''', and a structure containing one or more antheridia is called an '''androecium'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Generic concepts within hornworts: Historical review, contemporary insights and future directions |author=D. Christine Cargill |author2=Karen S. Renzaglia |author3=Juan Carlos Villarreal |author4=R. Joel Duff |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Australian Systematic Botany |volume=18 |pages=7–16 |year=2005 |doi=10.1071/sb04012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Androecium" is also used as the collective term for the [[stamen]]s of [[flowering plant]]s.

Antheridia are present in the [[gametophyte]] phase of [[cryptogam]]s like [[bryophyte]]s and [[fern]]s. Many [[alga]]e and some [[Fungus|fungi]], for example [[ascomycete]]s and [[water mould]]s, also have antheridia during their [[reproductive]] stages. In [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s, the male gametophytes have been reduced to [[Pollen|pollen grains]] and in most of these the antheridia have been reduced to a single [[generative cell]] within the pollen grain. During [[pollination]], this generative cell divides and gives rise to sperm cells.

The female counterpart to the antheridium in cryptogams is the [[archegonium]], and in flowering plants is the [[gynoecium]].

An antheridium typically consists of sterile [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and spermatogenous [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]. The sterile cells may form a central support structure or surround the spermatogenous tissue as a protective jacket. The spermatogenous cells give rise to [[spermatid]]s via mitotic [[cell division]]. In some [[bryophyte]]s, the antheridium is borne on an '''''antheridiophore''''', a stalk-like structure that carries the antheridium at its apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shimamura|first=Masaki|date=2016-02-01|title=Marchantia polymorpha: Taxonomy, Phylogeny and Morphology of a Model System|url=https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article/57/2/230/2460945/Marchantia-polymorpha-Taxonomy-Phylogeny-and#41305768|journal=Plant and Cell Physiology|language=en|volume=57|issue=2|pages=230–256|doi=10.1093/pcp/pcv192|issn=0032-0781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Landscape in Sa Pa (Vietnam).jpg|320x320px|thumb|right|An example of advanced anthropization: the cultivation of [[rice]] in [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in [[Vietnam]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[ecology]], '''anthropization''' is the conversion of open spaces, landscapes, and [[natural environment]]s by human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading [[terrain]] and [[soil]].

An area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural, such as [[grassland]]s that have been [[Deforestation|deforested]] by humans. It can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of [[urbanization]] because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cause ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The earliest known stages of anthropization can be found as early as the Neolithic era and the basic farmland created in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
With the continually-growing population of humans, the land that the Earth provides has been appropriated over the years.  The ecological footprint created by anthropization is continually growing despite efficiency and technique improvements made in anthropization..

Whether anthropized or not, all land seldom a few [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|locations]] has been claimed.  Outside of the largely inhospitable [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles and large portions of other uninhabitable landscapes, much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans.  Land has been appropriated for many different reasons, but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans.  An area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing, to harvest the resources, to create space for some anthropological reason, or many other possibilities.

== Processes and effects ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Farm in Hainan 01.jpg|thumb|An example of land that has been appropriated for [[Horticulture|cultivation]] in [[Hainan]], [[China]].]]

=== Agriculture ===
The root of many early forms of civilization, [[agriculture]] has been a primary reason for anthropization. To cultivate food or breed animals, humans must alter land—till soil or build structures—to facilitate agriculture.  This can lead to [[soil erosion]] and [[pollution]] ([[pesticide]]s, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, etc.), and subsequently [[habitat fragmentation]] and overall an increased [[ecological footprint]]. Agriculture and industry often overlap, and industry produces many of these effects too.

=== Urban development ===
Especially with approximately 7.5 Billion humans inhabiting the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/|title=World Population Clock: 7.5 Billion People (2017) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; this typically aligns with an increase in residences worldwide.  Over the years, humans have built on land to meet their needs and wants. These actions range from small villages to massive factories, water parks, and apartments.  [[Urbanization]] and development of human residences can significantly affect the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Not only does the physical space of buildings fragment habitats and possibly endanger [[Endangered species|species]], but it fundamentally alters the habitat for any other living being.  For some species, this effect can be inconsequential, but for many this can have a dramatic impact.  The biosphere is very much interconnected, and this means that if one organism is affected, then as a result the other organisms within this ecosystem and food chain are also affected.  
[[File:Athabasca oil sands.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca]] oil sands are an example of anthropization as a result of the harvest and transport of a non-renewable resource, [[oil sands]].]]
As well, within the last century, any urbanized area requires roads for transportation.  This transportation is a continued source of pollution, and the roads can be a source of soil erosion.

=== Industry and technology ===
To support humans, industrial buildings and processes are apparently essential. Urban development and agriculture require that people produce, refined, or construct many things. Key to this is that factories require that people gather the materials they need to create a product. The wide range of products in this anthropological age use a plethora of substances that must be harvested or produced.  Many of these materials are [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] (e.g., fossil fuel, metal ores, etc.) and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization. For resources that depend on in high quantity, this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource (e.g., depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://puredrinkablewater.weebly.com/how-water-sources-are-being-depleted.html|title=How Water Sources are Being Depleted|website=PureDrinkableWater|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; improper or inefficient [[silviculture]], etc.).  Even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment.  While the resource in question may not be in jeopardy, the harvest and processing can still change and damage the environment.

==== Science ====
Anthropization can also be a result of scientific endeavours.  This can manifest as construction of structures to aid in scientific discovery and observation.  This can range from structures such as [[Observatory|observatories]], or on the opposite scale the [[Large Hadron Collider]].  These and many other things are built and used to enhance knowledge of sciences. They do however require space and energy.

==== Energy ====
To power the ever-growing human race, energy is needed.  Power-harvesting structures are built to harness energy, such as dams, windmills, and nuclear reactors.  These sources of energy ultimately fuel the rest of anthropological activity and are essential in this way.  However many of these methods have consequences.  With dams, construction aside, they can cause flooding, habitat fragmentation, and other effects.  With nuclear reactors, they have a lasting effect in that typically a lifespan of one of these is around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-power-plant-aging-reactor-replacement-/|title=How Long Can a Nuclear Reactor Last?|last=Voosen|first=Paul|newspaper=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards the nuclear waste must be dealt with, and the structure itself must be shut down and cannot be used further.  To safely dispose of this even low-level waste can take hundreds of years, ranging upwards with increased radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. Tyler, David F. Hackett, and Carl Eric Wolfe. ''Living in the Environment''. 4th ed. Toronto: Nelson Education, 2017. 454-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  To produce and as a result of this production of energy, it requires a lot of anthropized land.

== Evolution of anthropization ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:All pyramids of Giza panorama 2.jpg|thumb|462x100px|An example of ancient anthropization; Giza pyramid complex, Egypt.]]

Changes in population directly effect anthropological impact—but changes in technology and knowledge have greatly changed anthropization throughout the [[Holocene]]. The tools and methods that humans use to anthropize have changed drastically.  For examples, the great [[pyramid]]s in [[Egypt]] were not constructed by some large machine, but instead by thousands of humans.  They were still able to build massive monuments, but the efficiency of their efforts and environmental damage is much different than today.  This shows that the environmental effect of modern anthropization is generally greater, not just because of the increase in population. Pollution and loss of [[biodiversity]] in Egypt was largely natural, not man-made, and anthropization existed on a much lower level.

As the human population of Earth increase, this anthropization will continue to evolve.

[[Image:TEMET_HV_Blast_Damper.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Blast Damper with integral grill to shield against flying objects]]
A blast damper is used to protect occupants and equipment of a structure against [[overpressure]]s resultant of an explosion. The blast dampers normally protect air inlets and exhaust penetrations in an otherwise hardened structure. Blast dampers are related or identical to [[blast valve]]s, the latter name is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices as they relate to nuclear explosions.

==Operation==
Blast dampers usually employ some type of blade held open with tension from a spring. The damper blades close automatically when pressure overcomes the resistance offered by the spring. Various models differ in the amount of blast protection (e.g. 1bar/14.5psi or lower amounts of protection) and whether they stay closed after the blast or remain functional.

==Design==
Typical blast dampers are sized to match [[HVAC]] ductwork and provide proper airflow with low [[pressure drop]]. Common applications include protecting equipment and personnel of control rooms and accommodation modules in petrochemical and [[industrial process]] facilities onshore and offshore. Acid- and [[corrosion]]-resistant versions are often requested in these instances.

The '''Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD)''', established in 1993 by [[Rehman Sobhan]], its Founder chairman, with support from leading civil society institutions in [[Bangladesh]], is mandated by its Deed of Trust to service the growing demand originating from the emerging civil society of Bangladesh for a more participatory and accountable development process. CPD seeks to address this felt-need from the perspectives of marginalised stakeholders, by way of organising multistakeholder consultations, by conducting research on issues of critical national, regional and global interests, through dissemination of knowledge and information on key developmental issues, and by influencing the concerned policy making processes.

CPD strives to bridge the gap between empirical research and policy advocacy through a sustained effort in public policy analyses. Over the past eighteen years CPD has emerged as Bangladesh's premier civil society think-tank, and has established its credibility as one of the very few platforms in Bangladesh where civil society organisations, stakeholder groups and political parties, often with diverse views and perspectives, are agreeable to sit around a dialogue table, and conduct an informed discussion about key issues of developmental concern and interest.

Over the years, CPD has evolved into a South Asia centre of excellence and has attained credibility as a distinguished focal point for issues relating to the least developed countries (LDCs).

The Centre was recognised as one of the top 228 leading think-tanks by the first global ''Go to Think Tank Survey in 2007'', and was selected for support under the Think Tank Initiative through a globally competitive process.

== Focus ==
CPD is an independent think-tank with local roots and global outreach. CPD focuses on frontier issues which are critical to the development process of Bangladesh, South Asia and LDCs in the present context, and those that are expected to shape and influence country's development prospects from the medium-term perspective. CPD's current programme portfolio includes research activities, holding of dialogues, publication and dissemination, and networking-related initiatives. CPD strives to enhance national capacity for economy-wide policy analyses, foster regional co-operation, and addresses issues which relate to Bangladesh's effective integration into the process of regionalisation and globalisation.

CPD activities also focus on challenges for regional co-operation and integration in South Asia. Moreover, CPD engages its capacity to analyse and highlight factors affecting socioeconomic progress in the LDCs. CPD has been organising Indo-Bangladesh dialogues on a regular basis where high level policymakers and representatives of key stakeholder groups of the two countries discuss issues of bilateral interest. CPD is also actively involved in the Kunming Initiative which strives to foster co-operation among Bangladesh, China, India and Myanmar. Among other things, CPD regularly organises international fora of the civil society organisations to advance the interests of the LDCs in the UN, WTO and other multilateral institutions.

== Target Groups ==

CPD's target groups are diverse and include both global and local policymakers. CPD seeks to provide voice to the interests and concerns of the low-income economies in global development discourse. In doing so, CPD involves all important cross-sections of the society including public representatives, government officials, business leaders, representatives of grassroots organisations, academics, development partners and other relevant interest groups. These different groups are engaged in exchange of views in all the three phases of the CPD process: identification of socially relevant issues, generation of inputs for policy analysis, and validation of policy recommendations.

== Operational Modality ==

CPD's civic activism in policy-related areas is operationalised through various means which are implemented by way of concrete initiatives. These include:

* ''Knowledge generation'' through research and analysis, creation and management of data and information base.
* ''Policy appreciation'' through dialogues, networking, information dissemination and mobilising support of the civil society for concrete policy agendas.
* ''Policy influencing'' at national, regional and international levels, by involving policymakers in the dialogue process, and by contributing to preparation of global policy documents and national policy briefs.
* ''Capacity building'' by way of organising policy appreciation workshops for policymakers and other important stakeholder groups.

== Dialogue ==

At the core of CPD's activities lies its dialogue programme. CPD designs the dialogue format in such a way as to stimulate constructive engagement and informed exchange of views. Since the CPD dialogues are not intended to be merely academic, but tailored towards implementation, the discussions are designed to come up with specific recommendations reflecting stakeholders' views in terms of redefining the policies and ensuring their effective realisation on the ground. These recommendations are then placed before current and prospective policymakers of the country as inputs to the policy making process. One of the major CPD initiatives of recent times was the Bangladesh Vision 2021, a document prepared under the initiative of the Nagorik Committee (Citizen's Committee), based on a wide-ranging consultation held in Dhaka and several district headquarters of the country.

Beyond issues of national importance, CPD dialogues also focus on those that concern regional and global interests of the country and other LDCs.

== Research ==

CPD maintains an extensive research portfolio focusing on frontier issues that would define Bangladesh's socioeconomic transformation in the immediate future. The research issues pursued by the Centre also address the interests and concerns of South Asian as well as LDCs.

The evolving research programme of CPD reflects the expressed demands of the policymakers, and attempts to provide voice to the absentee stakeholders in the policy making process. CPD deploys multistakeholder dialogues, along with traditional research techniques, to elicit analytical insights and to seek validation of the research conclusions.

As a centre of excellence, CPD endeavours to interface its research outcomes with the ongoing global debates on contemporary development discourse. CPD partners with research institutions and agencies of global acclaim. For more than a decade now, CPD, as a partner institute of the World Economic Forum (WEF), is contributing to the Global Competitiveness Report (GCR). CPD is currently spearheading an independent partnership of international institutions to follow up the outcome of the Fourth UN LDC Conference.

CPD's flagship output, titled the Independent Review of Bangladesh's Development (IRBD) regularly monitors the policy environment, macroeconomic indicators and sectoral variables of the country. Challenging the Injustice of Poverty: Agendas for Inclusive Development in South Asia is one of the important studies carried out by the CPD in recent times.

Some of the other issues addressed in the immediate past at CPD included agricultural productivity and diversification, implications of WTO negotiations, regional connectivity and trade facilitation, implications of trade liberalisation on employment, promotion of foreign direct investment, impact of climate change on livelihood concerns, assessment of social safety net programmes, economic costs of spousal violence, export diversification, and efficacy of development institutions.

Ongoing recent research activities of CPD have clustered under the following eight broad themes:

# Macroeconomic Performance Analysis
# Poverty, Inequality and Social Justice
# Agriculture and Rural Development
# Trade, Regional Cooperation and Global Integration
# Investment Promotion, Infrastructure and Enterprise Development
# Climate Change and Environment
# Human Development and Social Protection
# Development Governance, Policies and Institutions

== Contribution to Policy Making ==

CPD researchers have been actively involved in contributing to the policy making process in the country as members of various committees and working groups set up by a range of public bodies including the Bangladesh Bank, Planning Commission, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Industries, and Ministry of Agriculture. CPD senior research staff are members of Panel of Economists for the Sixth Five-Year Plan, Boards of state-owned banks, WTO Advisory and Working Groups, and various other policy forums. Senior researchers of CPD, on a regular basis, disseminate CPD's research findings to the wider public through comments and interviews in newspapers, television and radio channels, and international media. They also regularly participate in television talk shows. Writing of op eds and popular pieces by the CPD researchers for leading newspapers on a regular basis is another way to reach the policy voice.

== Support to Young Professionals ==

With a view to promote development vision and policy awareness amongst the young people of the country, CPD is implementing a Youth Leadership Programme. The aim of the programme is to inculcate leadership qualities and promote civic responsibility amongst the young professionals of the country through internship, research involvement, dialogue participation and civic activism. CPD regularly hosts international interns.

== Capacity Building ==

CPD has been putting a considerable effort to support research-related capacity building in the country. The objective is to enable researchers, academics and representatives of various stakeholder groups to better appreciate and understand key issues related to Bangladesh's development, and give them exposure to analytical approaches and tools for in-depth examination of those issues. As part of such initiatives, CPD organises, on a regular basis, Advanced Lecture Series for fresh Economics graduates from universities where senior CPD staff deliver lectures on such topics as macroeconomic policy management, regional co-operation and impact of globalisation. Over the past eleven years CPD has been regularly organising Policy Appreciation Workshops on WTO and Bangladesh for mid-level government officials, researchers, academics, NGO representatives and journalists. CPD has also conducted courses on WTO and Implications for Bangladesh for young journalists and junior faculty of the Department of Economics of various universities.

== Publication and Dissemination ==

CPD pursues a comprehensive programme for disseminating its research and dialogue outputs through regular publications and web-postings. CPD's current publication list contains more than 370 titles including Books, Monographs, Working Papers (Occasional Papers), Dialogue Reports and Policy Briefs.

CPD Books and Monographs have been published by The University Press Ltd. (UPL), Pathak Shamabesh and on CPD's own initiative. CPD outputs are available for sale at the Centre and also in selected bookstores in Bangladesh. The Working Papers (Occasional Papers) and Dialogue Reports are posted on CPD's website. Information about ongoing CPD activities is also regularly published in the CPD Quarterly.

== Reference and Documentation Unit ==

CPD has established a Reference and Documentation Unit (RDU) which serves as a repository of books, monographs, journals, periodicals and newspaper clippings on current and strategic policy issues. RDU puts special emphasis on policy documents and unpublished policy-related materials. Information generated through CPD's dialogue programmes and research activities is also systematically catalogued by the RDU.

== Website and Media ==

CPD has created a website to expand its outreach and expedite the dissemination of dialogue and research outputs. The website has enabled CPD to substantially enhance its networking capacity. The address of the website is http://www.cpd.org.bd

CPD has also launched its own blog for enhancing interaction with its stakeholders from different quarters. The blog was launched in March 2010. The blog allows posting of comments and sharing of views on CPD's latest activities, published reports and all other postings. It can be visited from the CPD Website Homepage.

CPD's public dialogues are usually extensively reported by the print media and covered by the electronic media in Bangladesh.

== Networking with Partner Institutions ==

CPD looks upon its capacity to fruitfully network with various organisations and institutions within the civil society as one of its core strengths. As of now, CPD has initiated and hosted a number of dialogues and research programmes in collaboration with organisations such as Oxfam International, ICTSD (Geneva), ODI (London), The Commonwealth Foundation, OECD,  [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)]], UNDESA, UNDP, [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)]], [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization (WTO)]], ILO, FAO, IRRI, [[Asian Development Bank|Asian Development Bank (ADB)]], and the [[World Bank]].

CPD is a partner institute of the [[World Economic Forum]], popularly known as the Davos Forum, since 2001; DeFiNe Network of OECD Development Centre, Paris; and the ARTNeT-UNESCAP. CPD also maintains membership with the South Asia Network of Economic Research Institutes (SANEI) and a number of other Networks, and is one of the four Founders of the South Asia Economic Summit, an initiative of the premier civil society think-tanks in South Asia.

'''Chromosomal instability''' (CIN) is a type of [[genome instability|genomic instability]] in which [[chromosomes]] are unstable, such that either whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes are duplicated or deleted. The unequal distribution of DNA to daughter cells upon [[mitosis]] results in a failure to maintain euploidy (the correct number of [[chromosomes]]) leading to [[aneuploidy]] (incorrect number of chromosomes).  In other words, the daughter cells do not have the same number of chromosomes as the cell they originated from.

These changes have been studied in solid tumors, which may or may not be cancerous. CIN is a common occurrence in [[solid tumour|solid]] and [[leukaemia|haematological cancers]], especially [[colorectal cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lengauer C, Kinzler KW, Vogelstein B | title = Genetic instability in colorectal cancers | journal = Nature | volume = 386 | issue = 6625 | pages = 623–7 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9121588 | doi = 10.1038/386623a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many tumours show chromosomal abnormalities, CIN is characterised by an increased rate of these errors.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geigl JB, Obenauf AC, Schwarzbraun T, Speicher MR | title = Defining 'chromosomal instability' | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 64–9 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18192061 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2007.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria for CIN definition==
*As chromosome instability refers to the rate that chromosomes or large portions of chromosomes are changed, there should be comparisons between cells, or cell populations rather than looking at cells individually in order to determine chromosome instability. These differences should be examined statistically as well.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;
*The rates in the cell population being tested should be compared to a reference cell population. This is especially true in low phenotype chromosomal instability,&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; where the changes are subtle.  
*The number of cell divisions undergone by a cell population should be related to the rate of chromosomal change.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;
*A chromosomal instability assay should measure not only whole chromosome change rates, but also the partial chromosomal changes such as deletions, insertions, inversion and amplifications to also take into account segmental aneuploidies.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; This provides a more accurate determination of the presence of chromosome instability. 
*The results from [[polyploid]] and [[diploid]] cells should be identified and separately recorded from one another. This is because the fitness cost (survival to next generation) of chromosomal instability is lower in polyploid cells, as the cell has a greater number of chromosomes to make up for the chromosomal instability it experiences.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;
*Polyploid cells are more prone to chromosomal changes, something that should be taken into account when determining the presence and degree of chromosomal instability &lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;

==Classification==
Numerical CIN is a high rate of either gain or loss of whole chromosomes; causing [[aneuploidy]]. Normal cells make errors in chromosome segregation in 1% of cell divisions, whereas cells with CIN make these errors approximately 20% of cell divisions. Because aneuploidy is a common feature in tumour cells, the presence of aneuploidy in cells does not necessarily mean CIN is present; a high rate of errors is definitive of CIN.&lt;ref name="pmid22595889"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGranahan N, Burrell RA, Endesfelder D, Novelli MR, Swanton C | title = Cancer chromosomal instability: therapeutic and diagnostic challenges | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 528–38 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22595889 | pmc = 3367245 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2012.61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way of differentiating aneuploidy without CIN and CIN-induced aneuploidy is that CIN causes widely variable (heterogeneous) chromosomal aberrations; whereas when CIN is not the causal factor, chromosomal alterations are often more clonal.&lt;ref name="pmid22466654"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakhoum SF, Compton DA | title = Chromosomal instability and cancer: a complex relationship with therapeutic potential | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 122 | issue = 4 | pages = 1138–43 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22466654 | pmc = 3314464 | doi = 10.1172/JCI59954 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural CIN is different in that rather than whole chromosomes, fragments of chromosomes may be duplicated or deleted. The rearrangement of parts of chromosomes ([[translocations]]) and amplifications or deletions within a chromosome may also occur in structural CIN.&lt;ref name="pmid22595889"/&gt;

==Effects==
CIN often results in [[aneuploidy]]. There are three ways that aneuploidy can occur. It can occur due to loss of a whole chromosome, gain of a whole chromosome or rearrangement of partial chromosomes known as gross [[chromosomal rearrangement]]s (GCR). All of these are hallmarks of some [[cancers]].&lt;ref name=one&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yuen|first=Karen|author2=Wing Yee|title=Chromosome Instability (CIN), Aneuploidy and Cancer|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Segmental aneuploidy can occur due to deletions, amplifications or translocations, which arise from breaks in DNA,&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; while loss and gain of whole chromosomes is often due to errors during mitosis.

==Genome integrity==
Chromosomes consist of the DNA sequence, and the proteins (such as [[histones]]) that are responsible for its packaging into chromosomes. Therefore, when referring to chromosome instability, [[epigenetic]] changes can also come into play. Genes on the other hand, refer only to the DNA sequence (hereditary unit) and it is not necessary that they will be expressed once epigenetic factors are taken into account. Disorders such as chromosome instability can be inherited via genes, or acquired later in life due to environmental exposure. One way that Chromosome Instability can be acquired is by exposure to ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name=five&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Eric G.|title=Inherited and inducible chromosomal instability: a fragile bridge between genome integrity mechanisms and tumourigenesis|journal=The Journal of Pathology|date=1 January 1999|volume=187|issue=1|pages=19–27|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199901)187:1&lt;19::AID-PATH233&gt;3.0.CO;2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Radiation is known to cause DNA damage, which can cause errors in cell replication, which may result in chromosomal instability. Chromosomal instability can in turn cause cancer. 
However, chromosomal instability syndromes such as [[Bloom syndrome]], [[ataxia telangiectasia]] and [[Fanconi anaemia]] are inherited &lt;ref name=five /&gt; and are considered to be genetic diseases. These disorders are associated with tumor genesis, but often have a phenotype on the individuals as well. The genes that control chromosome instability are known as chromosome instability genes and they control pathways such as mitosis, DNA replication, repair and modification.&lt;ref name=three&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stirling PC, Bloom MS, Solanki-Patil T, Smith S, Sipahimalani P, Li Z, Kofoed M, Ben-Aroya S, Myung K, Hieter P | title = The complete spectrum of yeast chromosome instability genes identifies candidate CIN cancer genes and functional roles for ASTRA complex components | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e1002057 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21552543 | pmc = 3084213 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also control transcription, and process nuclear transport.&lt;ref name=three /&gt;

==Chromosome instability and cancer==
The research associated with chromosomal instability is associated with solid tumors, which are tumors that refer to a solid mass of cancer cells that grow in organ systems and can occur anywhere in the body. These tumors are opposed to liquid tumors, which occur in the blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Cancer Institute|title=Definition of Solid Tumors|url=http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=45301|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although chromosome instability has long been proposed to promote tumor progression, recent studies suggest that chromosome instability can either promote or suppress tumor progression.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; The difference between the two are related to the amount of chromosomal instability taking place, as a small rate of chromosomal instability leads to tumor progression, or in other words cancer, while a large rate of chromosomal instability is often lethal to cancer.&lt;ref name=six&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dabas N, Byrnes DM, Rosa AM, Eller MS, Grichnik JM | title = Diagnostic role of chromosomal instability in melanoma | journal = Journal of Skin Cancer | volume = 2012 | pages = 914267 | date = 1 January 2012 | pmid = 23125934 | doi = 10.1155/2012/914267 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that a large rate of chromosomal instability is detrimental to the survival mechanisms of the cell,&lt;ref name=six /&gt; and the cancer cell cannot replicate and dies (apoptosis).  Therefore, the relationship between chromosomal instability and cancer can also be used to assist with diagnosis of malignant vs. benign tumors.&lt;ref name=six /&gt;

A majority of human solid malignant tumors is characterized by chromosomal instability, and have gain or loss of whole chromosomes or fractions of chromosomes.&lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt; For example, the majority of colorectal and other solid cancers have chromosomal instability (CIN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Michor F, Iwasa Y, Vogelstein B, Lengauer C, Nowak MA | title = Can chromosomal instability initiate tumorigenesis? | journal = Seminars in Cancer Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–9 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15613287 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcancer.2004.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This shows that chromosomal instability can be responsible for the development of solid cancers. However, genetic alterations in a tumor do not necessarily indicate that the tumor is genetically unstable, as ‘genomic instability’ refers to various instability phenotypes, including the chromosome instability phenotype &lt;ref name="pmid18192061"/&gt;

The role of CIN in carcinogenesis has been heavily debated.&lt;ref name=Gibbs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gibbs|first1=W. Wayt|title=Untangling the Roots of Cancer|journal=Scientific American|date=July 2008|volume=18|pages=30–39|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0708-30sp}}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While some argue the canonical theory of [[oncogene]] activation and [[tumor suppressor gene]] inactivation, such as [[Robert Weinberg]], some have argued that CIN may play a major role in the origin of cancer cells, since CIN confers a mutator phenotype&lt;ref name=mutatorphenotype&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loeb|first1=Lawrence A.|title=A Mutator Phenotype in Cancer|journal=Cancer Research|date=2001|volume=61|pages=3230–3239|url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/61/8/3230|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that enables a cell to accumulate large number of mutations at the same time. Scientists active in this debate include Christoph Lengauer, Kenneth W. Kinzler, Keith R. Loeb, Lawrence A. Loeb, [[Bert Vogelstein]] and [[Peter Duesberg]].

== Chromosome instability and metastasis ==
Recent work has identified chromosomal instability (CIN) as a genomic driver of metastasis.&lt;ref name="Bakhoum_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bakhoum SF, Ngo B, Laughney AM, Cavallo JA, Murphy CJ, Ly P, Shah P, Sriram RK, Watkins TB, Taunk NK, Duran M, Pauli C, Shaw C, Chadalavada K, Rajasekhar VK, Genovese G, Venkatesan S, Birkbak NJ, McGranahan N, Lundquist M, LaPlant Q, Healey JH, Elemento O, Chung CH, Lee NY, Imielenski M, Nanjangud G, Pe'er D, Cleveland DW, Powell SN, Lammerding J, Swanton C, Cantley LC | display-authors = 6 | title = Chromosomal instability drives metastasis through a cytosolic DNA response | journal = Nature | volume = 553 | issue = 7689 | pages = 467–472 | date = January 2018 | pmc = 5785464 | doi = 10.1038/nature25432 | pmid = 29342134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chromosome segregation errors during mitosis lead to the formation of structures called micronuclei. These micronuclei, which reside outside of the main nucleus have defective envelopes and often rupture exposing their genomic DNA content to the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatch EM, Fischer AH, Deerinck TJ, Hetzer MW | title = Catastrophic nuclear envelope collapse in cancer cell micronuclei | journal = Cell | volume = 154 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–60 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23827674 | pmc = 3749778 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.06.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure of double-stranded DNA to the cytosol activates anti-viral pathways, such as the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway. This pathway is normally involved in cellular immune defenses against viral infections. Tumor cells hijack chronic activation of innate immune pathways to spread to distant organs, suggesting that CIN drives metastasis through chronic inflammation stemming in a cancer cell-intrinsic manner.&lt;ref name="Bakhoum_2018" /&gt;

==Diagnostic methods==
Chromosomal instability can be diagnosed using analytical techniques at the cellular level.

'''Civil-military operations''' or '''CMO''' are activities of a military force to minimize civil interference on and maximize civil support for [[military operation]]s.  CMO is conducted in conjunction with combat operations during wartime and becomes a central part of a military campaign in [[Counter-insurgency|counter-insurgencies]].  Some militaries have specialized units dedicated to conduct CMO, such as [[Civil Affairs|civil affairs]] forces or form task forces specifically for this purposes, such as a [[joint civil-military operations task force]] in the U.S. Military.  Also, some militaries have staff sections dedicated to planning and coordinating CMO for their command.  CMO is often called [[Civil-Military Co-operation|civil-military co-operation]] or CIMIC in [[NATO]] operations and [[Civil-military coordination|civil-military co-ordination]] in [[United Nations|UN]] operations.
==Official definitions==
The [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|Military activities associated with an operation that ensure that military commanders comprehend, make use of and mitigate any negative impact of the civil environment on military operations and plans.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Department of National Defence, Canadian Force Operations, National Defence Pub B-GJ-005-300/FP-000 (Ottawa: DND, August 15, 2005), p. 19-2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Military of the United States|U.S. Military]] defines CMO as:

{{quote|The activities of a commander that establish, maintain, influence, or exploit relations between military forces, governmental and nongovernmental civilian organizations and authorities, and the civilian populace in a friendly, neutral, or hostile operational area in order to facilitate military operations, to consolidate and achieve operational US objectives. Civil-military operations may include performance by military forces of activities and functions normally the responsibility of the local, regional, or national government. These activities may occur prior to, during, or subsequent to other military actions. They may also occur, if directed, in the absence of other military operations. Civil-military operations may be performed by designated civil affairs, by other military forces, or by a combination of civil affairs and other forces.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman, U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Civil-Military Operations, Joint Publication (JP) 3-57 (Washington, DC: CJCS, July 08, 2008), p.

'''''Communication Arts''''' is the largest international [[trade journal]] of visual communications.&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations"&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/ Audit Bureau of Circulations] Publisher’s Statement 12/07&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1959 by Richard Coyne and Robert Blanchard, the magazine's coverage includes [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[illustration]] and [[interactive media]]. The magazine continues to be edited and published under the guidance of Coyne's wife Jean and their son Patrick Coyne. Currently, ''Communication Arts'' (CA) publishes six issues a year and hosts six creative competitions in graphic design, advertising, photography, illustration, typography and interactive media and two Web sites,   commarts.com  and  creativehotlist.com

==History==
The magazine was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue debuted in August 1959 as the ''Journal of Commercial Art''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Commercial Art'', Vol. 1, #1, August, 1959, Palo Alto, California&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of innovations, it was the first U.S. magazine printed by offset lithography.&lt;ref&gt;“Yesterday in CA”, ''Communication Arts'', Vol. 31, #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months, paid circulation grew to 10,000. Paid advertising, however, was low and CA was not a financial success. After Blanchard left to go into business by himself, Coyne and a small staff continued to write, design, and produce the magazine. Eventually, paid circulation increased to 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srds.com/ SRDS] Publisher’s Sworn Statement, June 30, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

CA's current audited paid circulation is 63,043&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations" /&gt; and an average of 3.1 people see each issue, giving ''Communication Arts'' an estimated reach of 189,129 readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf Media info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154801/http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions== 
To generate additional income and editorial content, the magazine began an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried competition]] in 1960. Within a few years, the annual competition grew, and eventually segmented into four annual competitions: graphic design, advertising, photography and illustration. A fifth competition, interactive, was added  in 1995. All the CA competitions are juried by  creative professionals.

== Online presences ==
CA was the first major design publication to launch a Web presence ([http://www.commarts.com/ Communication Arts]) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331051305/http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html |date=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to showcasing creative work in visual communications, it included job listings. The jobs section grew, and was relaunched in 2001 as a standalone website,   Creative Hotlist.  These two websites receive approximately three million page views and 250,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070426/http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6679">A '''cost database''' is a computerized database of cost estimating information, which is normally used with [[construction estimating software]] to support the formation of [[cost estimate]]s. A cost database may also simply be an electronic reference of cost data.

==Overview==
A cost [[database]] includes the electronic equivalent of a cost book, or cost reference book, a tool used by estimators for many years. Cost books may be internal records at a particular company or agency,&lt;ref&gt;J. David Nardon, Bridge and Structure Estimating'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1995, Page 5&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be commercially published books on the open market. Well known publishers include RSMeans (Reed Construction Data), Craftsman Book Company, Gulf Publishing Company, Cost Data Online (Richardson Estimating Standards), Frank R. Walker Company, BNI Building News, and Design &amp; Construction Resources.

The cost database may be stored in  [[relational database management system]], which may be in either an open or [[proprietary format]], serving the data to the cost estimating software. The cost database may be hosted in the [[Cloud storage|cloud]]. Estimators use a cost database to store data in structured way which is easy to manage and retrieve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=theses_open "A Visual Approach to Construction Cost Estimating"], Phuwadol Samphaongoen, Marquette University, e-Publications@Marquette, Page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==

===Costing data===
The most basic element of a cost estimate and therefore the cost database is the estimate line item or work item.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=theses_open "A Visual Approach to Construction Cost Estimating"], Phuwadol Samphaongoen, e-Publications@Marquette, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt; An example is "Concrete, 4000 psi (30 MPa)," which is the description of the item. In the cost database, an item is a [[Row (database)|row]] or record in a [[Table (database)|table]] (of items) and the description is a [[Column (database)|column]] or field for that record. Concrete may also be considered to be a material [[resource]]. In some systems, estimate line items and resources are the same, in other systems, various resources may be included with a line item. Other examples of resources are [[Manual labour|labor]] resources, such as carpenters, and [[Heavy equipment (construction)|equipment]] resources, such as cranes. Labor and equipment resources can be combined into a [[crew]], which is then the assumed crew which will install the item or perform the work. Resources and crews can be stored as data in the cost database and can also be related to work items.

===Factor and adjustment data ===
Various factors and adjustments may be useful in the estimating process. Some examples include:
* Factors to adjust costs from one location to another
* Factors to adjust costs from one time to another
* Currency conversion factors
* Sales and use tax rates
* Other tax, insurance, and bond rates
* Overhead factors

===Organizational data===
Data which may be used to organize a cost estimate into groups and levels, and to summarize the cost details can also be part of a cost database. A popular coding system which can be applied to construction cost estimates is [[MasterFormat]].&lt;ref&gt;MasterFormat Numbers &amp; Titles, April 2012,'' The Construction Specifications Institute and Construction Specifications Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Another coding method is [[Uniformat]].&lt;ref&gt;"Uniformat," Construction Specifications Institute, http://www.csinet.org/uniformat&lt;/ref&gt; Also, various types of [[work breakdown structure]]s or WBS may be used. It may also be useful to assign the costs to a [[chart of accounts]] or COA (a.k.a. Code of Accounts). Other organizational needs include:
*Grouping by job cost account
*Grouping by subcontractor or vendor
*Grouping by material class or type
*Grouping by facility, floor, level, location, area, etc.
*Grouping by system
*Grouping by project phase or stage
*Grouping by inside or outside battery limits
All of these represent organizational data which can be stored in the cost database and used to support the cost estimate.

===Calculational data===
Data which can be used to calculate quantities and costs can also be part of a cost database. For example, there are various formulas for calculating the [[area]] of shapes, the [[volume]] of solids or spaces, and the [[weight]] of materials. There are defined unit properties of materials also. Materials each have certain [[Density|densities]] or unit weights. [[Rebar|Reinforcing bars]] are produced in certain sizes, with certain unit weights. Additionally, data which helps calculate the selection or specification of estimate contents can be included.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5716">'''C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t analysis''', a technique based on the principles of '''DNA reassociation kinetics''', is a biochemical technique that measures how much [[repetitive DNA]] is in a  DNA sample such as a [[genome]].&lt;ref name=Britten1966&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waring M, Britten RJ |title=Nucleotide sequence repetition: a rapidly reassociating fraction of mouse DNA |journal=Science |volume=154 |issue=3750 |pages=791–4 |year=1966 |pmid=5919450 |doi=10.1126/science.154.3750.791}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to study [[genome]] structure and organization and has also been used to simplify the sequencing of genomes that contain large amounts of repetitive sequence.&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson DG, Wessler SR, Paterson AH |title=Efficient capture of unique sequences from eukaryotic genomes |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=547–50 |year=2002 |pmid=12414178 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(02)02764-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
The procedure involves heating a sample of genomic DNA until it [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denatures]] into the single stranded-form, and then slowly cooling it, so the strands can pair back together. While the sample is cooling, measurements are taken of how much of the DNA is [[base pair]]ed at each temperature.  

The amount of single and double-stranded DNA is measured by rapidly diluting the sample, which slows reassociation, and then binding the DNA to a [[hydroxylapatite]] column. The column is first washed with a low concentration of [[sodium phosphate]] buffer, which elutes the single-stranded DNA, and then with high concentrations of phosphate, which elutes the double stranded DNA. The amount of DNA in these two solutions is then measured using a [[spectrophotometer]].

[[File:CoT analysis.png|thumb|right|250px|Repetitive DNA sequences renature at lower C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values than single-copy sequences.]]

==Analysis==

Since a sequence of single-stranded DNA needs to find its [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] strand to reform a double helix, common sequences renature more rapidly than rare sequences. Indeed, the rate at which a sequence will reassociate is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the number of copies of that sequence in the DNA sample. A sample with a highly-repetitive sequence will renature rapidly, while complex sequences will renature slowly.  

However, instead of simply measuring the percentage of double-stranded DNA versus time, the amount of renaturation is measured relative to a C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t value. The C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t value is the product of C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (the initial concentration of DNA), t (time in seconds), and a constant that depends on the concentration of [[cation]]s in the buffer. Repetitive DNA will renature at low C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values, while complex and unique DNA sequences will renature at high C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t values. The fast renaturation of the repetitive DNA is because of the availability of numerous complementary sequences.

==Application to genome sequencing==
{{Main|Cot filtration | l1 = C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t filtration}}
C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;t filtration is a technique that uses the principles of DNA renaturation kinetics to separate the [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive DNA]] [[sequence]]s that dominate many [[eukaryotic]] [[genomes]] from "gene-rich" single/low-copy sequences.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt; This allows DNA sequencing to concentrate on the parts of the genome that are most informative and interesting, which will speed up the discovery of new genes and make the process more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;L{{cite journal |vauthors=Lamoureux D, Peterson DG, Li W, Fellers JP, Gill BS |title=The efficacy of Cot-based gene enrichment in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) |journal=Genome |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=1120–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16391681 |url=http://article.pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ppv/RPViewDoc?issn=0831-2796&amp;volume=48&amp;issue=6&amp;startPage=1120 |doi=10.1139/g05-080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yuan&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yuan Y, SanMiguel PJ, Bennetzen JL |title=High-Cot sequence analysis of the maize genome |journal=Plant J. |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=249–55 |year=2003 |pmid=12694599 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-313X.2003.01716.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States '''data item description''' ('''DID''') is a completed document defining the data [[deliverable]]s required of a [[United States Department of Defense]] contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DoD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Policies and Procedures'' | url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412024m.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=Office of the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, [[United States Department of Defense]] March-2000 | pages=57 |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DID specifically defines the data content, format, and intended use of the data with a primary objective of achieving standardization objectives by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]. The content and format requirements for DIDs are defined within ''MIL-STD-963C, Data Item Descriptions (2014)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''MIL-STD-963C, Department of Defense Standard Practice: Data Item Descriptions'' | url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=202450 | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=September 24, 2014  |accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The terminology of DIDs and the term [[contract data requirements list]] (CDRL) originated with US military procurements, and it is now often encountered in other large procurements that are modeled after the military procurement process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Deliverables: CDRLs and DIDs'' | url=http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/enterprise-solutions/deliverable-cdrls-amp-dids-31435 | publisher=Toolbox.com |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a military solicitation or contract, each DID is uniquely numbered to identify the data deliverables in terms of specific information such as: purpose, description, preparation instructions including a table of contents and descriptions of each section, and references to the Contract [[Statement of work]] (SOW).

Practices and terms where definition is given by MIL-STD-963:

* Tailoring of data requirements. The deletion of the applicability of a portion of the data requirements from an approved DID that are unnecessary to meet the needs of a specific contract.
* Format. The desired organization, structure, or arrangement of the content of the data product described by the DID. This term relates to the shape, size, makeup, style, physical organization, or arrangement of the data product described in the DID.
* Content.  The desired subject(s), topic(s), or element(s) which constitutes the data product described in the DID (for example, a string of defined data elements for entry into a Government database; a listing of paragraph titles or topics for inclusion in a data deliverable) under general topics; or subject matter which may be further defined into sub-topics.

* DID number:  Each DID is assigned a unique three-part identifier by the DID approval authority.  An example DID number for repetitive use is DI-SESS-80013B (DI- Data Item; SESS – four character code for the "Systems Engineering" Standardization Area (see "SD-1, Standardization Directory" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''SD-1, Standardization Directory'' |url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=113341 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for descriptions); 80013 assigned by ASSIST Automated Document Number Module, and B the sequential version). An example DID number for one-time use is OT-13-1000 (OT- One Time; 13 – [[fiscal year]] issued; 10000 – (the first number assigned in FY13 by the Army).

Since DID documents are what contract mechanics cause to be produced, the defined content guidelines and their terminologies are commonly referred to in [[United States Military Standard]]s or other forms of procedural and administrative guidance of the [[United States Department of Defense]].

== Usage in government contracts ==
Writers of a [[Statement of work|SOW]] often include requirements that belong in other parts of a contract. Specifically, quantitative technical requirements are addressed in the military specification and work requirements are specified in the SOW, and data requirements (e.g., delivery, format, and content) should be in the [[Contract Data Requirements List|CDRL]] along with the appropriate DID to minimize the potential for conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=MIL-HDBK-245D, Department of Defense: Handbook for Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW) | year=1996 | pages=ii | url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-HDBK/MIL-HDBK-0200-0299/MIL-HDBK-245D_1888/ |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=MIL-HDBK-245D, Department of Defense: Handbook for Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW) | year=1996 | pages=ii | url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=53962 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Depiction''' is reference conveyed through pictures. Basically a picture refers to its object through a non-linguistic two-dimensional scheme. A picture is not writing or notation. A depictive two-dimensional scheme is called a [[picture plane]] and may be constructed according to [[descriptive geometry]] where they are usually divided between ''projections'' (orthogonal and various oblique angles) and ''perspectives'' (according to number of vanishing points). Pictures are made with various materials and techniques, such as painting, drawing, or prints (including photography and movies) mosaics, tapestries, stained glass, and collages of unusual and disparate elements. Occasionally, picture-like features may be recognised in simple inkblots, accidental stains, peculiar clouds or a glimpse of the moon, but these are special cases, and it is controversial whether they count as genuine instances of depiction.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Robert Hopkins (1998), "Picture, Image, Experience" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, sculpture and theatrical performances are sometimes said to depict, but this requires a broad understanding of 'depict', as simply designating a form of representation that is not linguistic or notational. The bulk of studies of depiction however deal only with pictures. While sculpture and performance clearly represent or refer, they do not strictly picture their objects. 
 
Objects pictured may be factual or fictional, literal or metaphorical, realistic or idealised and in various combination. Idealised depiction is also termed schematic or stylised and extends to icons, diagrams and maps. Classes or styles of picture may abstract their objects by degrees, conversely, establish degrees of the concrete (usually called, a little confusingly, figuration or figurative, since the 'figurative' is then often quite literal). Stylisation can lead to the fully abstract picture, where reference is only to conditions for a picture plane – a severe exercise in self-reference and ultimately a sub-set of pattern.

But just ''how'' pictures function remains controversial. Philosophers, art historians and critics, perceptual psychologists and other researchers in the arts and social sciences have contributed to the debate and many of the most influential contributions have been interdisciplinary. Some key positions are briefly surveyed below.

== Resemblance ==

Traditionally, depiction is distinguished from denotative meaning by the presence of a [[mimesis|mimetic]] element or resemblance. A picture resembles its object in a way a word or sound does not. Resemblance is no guarantee of depiction, obviously. Two pens may resemble one another but do not therefore depict each other. To say a picture resembles its object especially is only to say that its object is that which it especially resembles; which strictly begins with the picture itself. Indeed, since everything resembles something in some way, mere resemblance as a distinguishing trait is trivial. Moreover, depiction is no guarantee of resemblance to an object. A picture of a dragon does not resemble an actual dragon. So resemblance is not enough.

Theories have tried either to set further conditions to the kind of resemblance necessary, or sought ways in which a notational system might allow such resemblance. It is widely believed that the problem with a resemblance theory of depiction is that resemblance is a symmetrical relation between terms (necessarily, if x resembles y, then y resembles x) while in contrast depiction is at best a non-symmetrical relation (it is not necessary that, if x depicts y, y depicts x). If this is right, then depiction and resemblance cannot be identified, and a resemblance theory of depiction is forced to offer a more complicated explanation, for example by relying on experienced resemblance instead, which clearly is an asymmetrical notion (that you experience x as resembling y does not mean you also experience y as resembling x).&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Hopkins (1998), Christopher Peacocke (1987) 'Depiction', in Philosophical Review 96(3):383-410.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued, however, that the concept of resemblance is not exclusively a relational notion, and so that the initial problem is merely apparent.&lt;ref&gt;John Hyman (2012), 'Depiction', in Royal Institute of Philosophy Supplement 71:129-150.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art history, the history of actual attempts to achieve resemblance in depictions is usually covered under the terms "[[realism (arts)|realism]]", [[Naturalism (visual art)|naturalism]]", or "[[illusionism]]".

== Illusion ==

The most famous and elaborate case for resemblance modified by reference, is made by art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960) ''Art and Illusion'' (Oxford: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1963) Meditations on a Hobbyhorse (Oxford, Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. ''The Image and the Eye'' (Oxford and New York: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance in pictures is taken to involve illusion. Instincts in [[visual perception]] are said to be triggered or alerted by pictures, even when we are rarely deceived. The eye supposedly cannot resist finding resemblances that accord with illusion. Resemblance is thus narrowed to something like the seeds of illusion. Against the one-way relation of reference Gombrich argues for a weaker or labile relation, inherited from [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1960): pp 80-98, (1982): pp 278–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Pictures are thus both more primitive and powerful than stricter reference.

But whether a picture can deceive a little while it represents as much seems gravely compromised. Claims for innate dispositions in sight are also contested. Gombrich appeals to an array of psychological research from [[James J. Gibson]], R. L. Gregory, John M. Kennedy, Konrad Lorenz, Ulric Neisser and others in arguing for an 'optical' basis to perspective, in particular (see also [[perspective (graphical)]]. Subsequent cross-cultural studies in depictive competence and related studies in child-development and vision impairment are inconclusive at best.

Gombrich's convictions have important implications for his popular history of art,&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, E. H. (1995), The Story Of Art 16th ed. (London: Phaidon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; for treatment and priorities there. In a later study by John Willats (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Willats, John, (1997), ''Art and Representation: New Principles In The Analysis Of Pictures'' (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt; on the variety and development of picture planes, Gombrich's views on the greater realism of perspective underpin many crucial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich (1995), pp. 133, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual invariants ==

A more frankly behaviouristic view is taken by the perceptual psychologist [[James J. Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, James J., 'The Ecological approach to Visual Perception in Pictures' Leonardo, 1978, 11, p.231.&lt;/ref&gt; partly in response to Gombrich. Gibson treats visual perception as the eye registering necessary information for behaviour in a given environment. The information is filtered from light rays that meet the retina. The light is called the stimulus energy or sensation. The information consists of underlying patterns or 'invariants' for vital features to the environment.

Gibson's view of depiction concerns the re-presentation of these invariants. In the case of illusions or trompe l'oeil, the picture also conveys the stimulus energy, but generally the experience is of perceiving two sets of invariants, one for the picture surface, another for the object pictured. He pointedly rejects any seeds of illusion or substitution and allows that a picture represents when two sets of invariants are displayed. But invariants tell us little more than that the resemblance is visible, dual invariants only that the terms of reference are the same as those for resemblance

== Seeing-in ==

A similar duality is proposed by the philosopher of art [[Richard Wollheim]]. He calls it 'twofoldness'.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard (1987), ''Painting as an Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson) pp 46-7, 72-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our experience of the picture surface is called the 'configurational' aspect, and our experience of the object depicted the 'recognitional'. Wollheim's main claim is that we are simultaneously aware of both the surface and the depicted object. The concept of twofoldness has been very influential in contemporary analytic aesthetics, especially in the writings of [[Dominic Lopes]]&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, Dominic (2005), Sight and Sensibility: Evaluating Pictures (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[Bence Nanay]].&lt;ref&gt;Nanay, Bence (2005), 'Is Twofoldness Necessary for Representational Seeing?', British Journal of Aesthetics 45(3): 263-272.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, illusion is forestalled by the prominence of the picture surface where an object is depicted. Yet the object depicted quite simply ''is'' the picture surface under one reading, the surface indifferent to picture, another. The two are hardly compatible or simultaneous. Nor do they ensure a reference relation.

Wollheim introduces the concept of 'seeing-in' to qualify depictive resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim (1987), pp. 59-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing-in is a psychological disposition to detect a resemblance between certain surfaces, such as inkblots or accidental stains, etc. and three-dimensional objects. The eye is not deceived, but finds or projects some resemblance to the surface. This is not quite depiction, since the resemblance is only incidental to the surface. The surface does not strictly refer to such objects. Seeing-in is a necessary condition to depiction, and sufficient when in accordance with the maker's intentions, where these are clear from certain features to a picture. But seeing-in cannot really say in what way such surfaces resemble objects either, only specify where they perhaps first occur.

Wollheim's account of how a resemblance is agreed or modified, whereby maker and user anticipate each other's roles, does not really explain how a resemblance refers, but rather when an agreed resemblance obtains.

== Other psychological resources ==

The appeal to broader psychological factors in qualifying depictive resemblance is echoed in the theories of philosophers such as Robert Hopkins,&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Robert (1998), Picture, Image, and Experience (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; Flint Schier&lt;ref&gt;Schier, Flint (1986), Deeper Into Pictures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Walton]].&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall (1990), Mimesis as Make-believe (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; They enlist 'experience', 'recognition' and 'imagination' respectively. Each provides additional factors to an understanding or interpretation of pictorial reference, although none can explain how a picture resembles an object (if indeed it does), nor how this resemblance is then also a reference.

For example, Schier returns to the contrast with language to try to identify a crucial difference in depictive competence. Understanding a pictorial style does not depend upon learning a vocabulary and syntax. Once grasped, a style allows the recognition of any object known to the user. Of course recognition allows a great deal more than that – books teaching children to read often introduce them to many exotic creatures such as a kangaroo or armadillo through illustrations. Many fictions and caricatures are promptly recognised without prior acquaintance of either a particular style or the object in question.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Stephanie (1971), 'Caricature', The Monist 58: pp 285-93.&lt;/ref&gt; So competence cannot rely on a simple index or synonymy for objects and styles.

Schier's conclusion that lack of syntax and semantics in reference then qualifies as depiction, leaves dance, architecture, animation, sculpture and music all sharing the same mode of reference. This perhaps points as much to limitations in a linguistic model.

== Notation ==
Reversing orthodoxy, the philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson (1968), Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols (Indianapolis and New York: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, Inc.).&lt;/ref&gt; starts from reference and attempts to assimilate resemblance. He denies resemblance as either necessary or sufficient condition for depiction but surprisingly, allows that it arises and fluctuates as a matter of usage or familiarity.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Goodman, a picture denotes. Denotation is divided between description, covering writing and extending to more discursive notation including music and dance scores, to depiction at greatest remove. However, a word does not grow to resemble its object, no matter how familiar or preferred. To explain how a pictorial notation does, Goodman proposes an analogue system, consisting of undifferentiated characters, a density of syntax and semantics and relative repleteness of syntax. These requirements taken in combination mean that a one-way reference running from picture to object encounters a problem. If its semantics is undifferentiated, then the relation flows back from object to picture. Depiction can acquire resemblance but must surrender reference. This is a point tacitly acknowledged by Goodman, conceding firstly that density is the antithesis of notation&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1968), p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that lack of differentiation may actually permit resemblance.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Nelson and Elgin, Catherine Z, (1988) Reconceptions in Philosophy (London and New York: Routledge) p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; A denotation without notation lacks sense.

Nevertheless, Goodman's framework is revisited by philosopher John Kulvicki&lt;ref&gt;Kulvicki, John (2006), On Images: Their structure and content (Oxford: Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and applied by art historian James Elkins&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, James (1999), The Domain of Images (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; to an array of hybrid artefacts, combining picture, pattern and notation.

== Pictorial semiotics ==

Pictorial [[semiotics]] aims for just the kind of integration of depiction with notation undertaken by Goodman, but fails to identify his requirements for syntax and semantics. It seeks to apply the model of structural linguistics, to reveal core meanings and permutations for pictures of all kinds, but stalls in identifying constituent elements of reference, or as semioticians prefer, 'signification'. Similarly, they accept resemblance although call it 'iconicity' (after [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders - (1931-58), Collected Papers I-VIII. Hartshorne, C, Weiss, P, &amp; Burks, A, (eds.) (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; 1931–58) and are uncomfortable in qualifying its role. Older practitioners, such as [[Roland Barthes]]&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland (1969), Elements of semiology (Paris, 1967) translated by Annette Lavers and Colin Smith, (London: Cape).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umberto Eco]]&lt;ref&gt;Eco, Umberto (1980), A Theory of Semiotics (Milan 1976) (Bloomington: Indiana University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; variously shift analysis to underlying 'connotations' for an object depicted or concentrate on description of purported content at the expense of more medium-specific meaning. Essentially they establish a more general [[iconography]].

A later adherent, Göran Sonesson,&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (1989), Pictorial Concepts: Inquiries into the semiotic heritage and its relevance for the analysis of the visual world. (Lund: Aris/Lund University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonesson, Göran (2001), 'Iconicity strikes back: the third generation – or why Eco is still wrong'. VISIO 9: 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects Goodman's terms for syntax and semantics as alien to linguistics, no more than an ideal and turns instead to the findings of perceptual psychologists, such as J. M. Kennedy,&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John M. (1974) The Psychology of Picture Perception (San Francisco, Jossey-Bass).&lt;/ref&gt; N. H. Freeman&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H. and Cox, M. V. (eds.) (1985), Visual Order: The Nature and Development of Pictorial Representation (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, N. H., Evans, D., and Willats, J.

(Republished in Husserliana X, The Hague: Nijhoff, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund (1980), Phantasie, Bildbewusstsein, Erinnerung, Husserliana XXIII. (The Hague: Nijhoff).&lt;/ref&gt; Resemblance is again grounded in optics or the visible, although this does not exclude writing nor reconcile resemblance with reference. Discussion tends to be restricted to the function of outlines in schemes for depth.

==Deixis==
The art historian [[Norman Bryson]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Norman (1983) Vision and Painting: The Logic of The Gaz, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press).&lt;/ref&gt; persists with a linguistic model and advances a detail of parsing and tense, '[[deixis]]'. He rejects resemblance and illusion as incompatible with the ambiguities and interpretation available to pictures and is also critical of the inflexible nature of structuralist analysis. Deixis is taken as the rhetoric of the narrator, indicating the presence of the speaker in a discourse, a bodily or physical aspect as well as an explicit temporal dimension. In depiction this translates as a difference between 'The [[Gaze]]' where deixis is absent and 'The Glance' where it is present. Where present, details to materials indicate how long and in what way the depiction was made, where absent, a telling suppression or prolonging of the act. The distinction attempts to account for the 'plastic' or medium-specific qualities absent from earlier semiotic analyses and somewhat approximates the 'indexic' aspect to [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#Icon, index, symbol|signs introduced by Peirce]].

Deixis offers a more elaborate account of the picture surface and broad differences to expression and application but cannot qualify resemblance.

==Iconography==
Lastly, iconography is the study of pictorial content, mainly in art, and would seem to ignore the question of how to concentrate upon what. But iconography's findings take a rather recondite view of content, are often based on subtle literary, historical and cultural allusion and highlight a sharp difference in terms of resemblance, optical accuracy or intuitive illusion. Resemblance is hardly direct or spontaneous for the iconographer, reference rarely to the literal or singular. Visual perception here is subject to reflection and research, the object as much reference as referent.

The distinguished art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]]&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, Erwin (1955) Meaning in the Visual Arts (New York: Doubleday).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed three levels to iconography. The first is 'natural' content, the object recognised or resembling without context, on a second level, a modifying historical and cultural context and at a third, deeper level, a fundamental structure or ideology (called iconology). He even ascribed the use of perspective a deep social meaning (1927). However more recently, a natural or neutral level tends to be abandoned as mythical. The cultural scholar [[W. J. T. Mitchell]]&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1980), The Language of Images (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1986), Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. J. T. (1994), Picture Theory (Chicago and London: University Of Chicago Press).&lt;/ref&gt; looks to ideology to determine resemblance and depiction as acknowledgement of shifts in relations there, albeit by an unspecified scheme or notation.

Iconography points to differences in scope for a theory of depiction. Where stylistics and a basic object is nominated, resemblance is prominent, but where more elaborate objects are encountered, or terms for nature denied, simple perception or notation flounder. The difference corresponds somewhat to the division in philosophy between the analytic and continental.

==Other issues==
Dozens of factors influence depictions and how they are represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomson|first=T. J.|last2=Greenwood|first2=Keith|date=2016-03-08|title=Beyond Framing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|journal=Journalism Practice|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/17512786.2016.1152908|issn=1751-2786}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the equipment used to create the depiction, the creator’s intent, vantage point, mobility, proximity, publication format, among others, and, when dealing with human subjects, their potential desire for impression management.

Other debates about the nature of depiction include the relationship between seeing something in a picture and seeing face to face, whether depictive representation is [[Convention (norm)|conventional]], how understanding novel depictions is possible, the [[aesthetic]] and [[ethical]] value of depiction and the nature of [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]] in pictorial [[art]].

During the 20th century, '''Deyrolle''' was a Parisian institution for [[natural science]]s and [[pedagogy]]. It is one of the best known companies of [[entomology]] and [[taxidermy]] of [[Paris]]. Today, Deyrolle is a shop and a [[cabinet of curiosities]] open to the public, a reference in the field of taxidermy, entomology and natural sciences, whose vocation is to show the beauty of Nature. Deyrolle is also involved in pedagogy and art.

== History ==

=== Since 1831 ===
Deyrolle was created in 1831 by '''Jean-Baptiste Deyrolle''', who was soon succeeded by his son [[Achille Deyrolle|Achille]], at 46 rue du Bac in a building constructed in 1697-1699 by Jean-Baptiste Voille for a member of the Bruand family (Libéral Bruand). It was deeply transformed in 1739 by Samuel-Jacques Bernard, son of the banker of Louis XIV, Samuel Bernard (7&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; arrondissement). Beyond its scientific material, minerals collections, seashells, fossils, mounted animals and prehistoric tools, Deyrolle provides pedagogical charts to schools and universities in France, made to illustrate teacher’s lessons. (''Musée scolaire Deyrolle'').

In 2001 Louis Albert de Broglie bought Deyrolle and he restored the shop.

=== The fire of 2008 ===
On February the 1st 2008, the [[Cabinet of curiosities|Cabinet of Curiosities]] was destroyed by a big fire. The cause was probably a short-circuit. A big part of the rooms and of the collections has been destroyed: butterflies, insects, and animals (zebras, alligators, gazelles, bears, lions, shellfish and turtles). On May the 15th 2008, the building was already cleaned and the two rooms of the first floor reopened.

Some artists that contributed to save Deyrolle:

[[Jan Fabre]] - [[Nan Goldin]] - [[Jacques Grange]] - [[Karen Knorr]] - [[Marie-Jo Lafontaine]] - Claude Lalanne - [[Les Lalanne|François-Xavier Lalanne]] - [[Pierre Alechinsky]] - [[Yann Arthus-Bertrand]] - [[Miquel Barceló|Miquel Barcelo]] - Pascal Bernier - Laurent Bochet - [[Sophie Calle]] - [[Johan Creten]] - Marc Dantan - Nicolas Darrot - [[Mark Dion]] - [[Bettina Rheims]] - [[Bernar Venet]] - [[Huang Yong Ping]].

== Pedagogy ==

=== The ancient charts ===
Deyrolle is well known for its '''pedagogical charts'''. It all starts around 1871, when [[Émile Deyrolle|Emile Deyrolle]] developed everything that concerns the educational material, anatomical models in staff, biology pieces, and most of all, the creation of coloured wall charts, published under the name "Musée scolaire Deyrolle". They are meant to teach the "Leçons de choses" ("Lessons of things") but also [[Botany]], [[Zoology]], [[Entomology]], [[Geography]], [[Anatomy]], [[Civics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Geology]], [[Mineralogy]], [[Biology]], etc.

« ''Visual instruction is the least tiring for the mind, but this education can have good results only if the ideas engraved in the children’s mind are rigorously exact.'' » [[Émile Deyrolle]]

=== Deyrolle pour l'Avenir ===
In 2007, Louis Albert de Broglie restarts the publishing activity with the creation of new educational charts, to tackle contemporary environmental and societal issues. It is the start of a new collection of educational charts published under the name of Deyrolle pour l’Avenir (DPA). There are charts on [[sustainable development]], [[climate change]]s, [[endangered species]], [[renewable energy]], etc.

== The savoir-faire ==

=== Taxidermy ===
Deyrolle is a reference in the field of taxidermy. We can find birds, beasts and mammals from all over the world. At Deyrolle, with only a few exceptions, no animal was killed to be mounted: the non-domestic species come from zoos, parks, where they died of old age or illness. They are traceable, and protected species are held and delivered in accordance with the [[CITES|Washington Convention (CITES)]].

=== Entomology ===
Deyrolle is also known for its entomological collections. The drawers of the entomological room are filled with colourful butterflies, beetles, and other insects. It is possible to see the experts of the entomology team working on the mounting of insects.

== Art ==
The first aim of Deyrolle was to teach [[natural science]]s to children and students, but Deyrolle was a point of interest also for artists: the surrealists [[André Breton]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], the painters [[Jean Dubuffet]] and Mathieu, the writers [[Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin|Louise de Vilmorin]] and [[Théodore Monod]], [[Raymond Queneau]] and many others stopped regularly at the shop.

=== Deyrolle and artists today ===
Today, Deyrolle continues its proximity with artists and the shop welcomes a lot of exhibitions and events during the year: [[Bettina Rheims]], [[Eric Sanders (playwright)|Éric Sander]] or also Charwei Tsai was exhibited at Deyrolle. [[Woody Allen]] used the rooms of Deyrolle in July 2010 for his movie ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'', and [[Wes Anderson]] is a huge fan of the shop.

Deyrolle also develops collaborations with artists. We can mention Aurèle or [[Damien Hirst]], for example.

=== Music ===
In 2005, French singer [[Nolwenn Leroy]] shot the artwork for her album ''[[Histoires Naturelles (album)|Histoires Naturelles]]'' at Deyrolle, as well as the music video for the single "Histoire Naturelle".

Taking for granted an equal [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|moral status]] as [[person]]s, '''difference feminism''' asserts that there are differences between men and women but that no value judgment can be placed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/carol-gilligan/|title = Carol Gilligan |website= Psychology's Feminist Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "difference feminism" developed during the "equality-versus-difference debate" in American feminism in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Joan|title=Deconstructing Equality-Versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Post-structuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1988|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3177997|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently fell out of favor and use. In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of "difference" versus "equality" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Gisela|last2=James|first2=Susan|title=Beyond Equality and Difference|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn = 9780415079891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location = London|isbn = 9781446228043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism did not require a commitment to [[gender essentialism|essentialism]]. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise "essential" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called "ways of knowing"&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=2 footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued "feminine" characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|title=Feminism: A Paradigm Shift|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of difference feminism, for example [[Mary Daly]]'s, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoagland|first1=Sarah Lucia|last2=Frye|first2=Marilyn|title=Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandilands|first1=Catriona|title=The Good-Natured Feminist Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy|date=1999|pages=chapter 5: "Cyborgs and Queers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer [[Elise Oelsner]], which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see [[ethics of care]]]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase "difference feminism" in a way that asks "what difference does feminism make?" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than "what differences are there between men and women"?&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Essentialism and Difference Feminism==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] and radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]], is "essentialist." In philosophy essentialism is the belief that "(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental vs Essential Properties|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that "women" and "men" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of "essentialism" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida J.|title=Anti-Essentialism in Practice: Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00009.x|pages=142–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title="Essentialism" in Feminism and Psychoanalysis: A Critical Dictionary|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not accurately reflect Gilligan&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; or Daly's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suhonen|first1=Marja|title="Toward Biophilic Be-ing: Mary Daly's Feminist Metaethics and the Question of Essentialism" in Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|date=2000|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; views.

The '''Doctor of Management''' (D.M., D.Mgt. or DMan) is a [[doctoral degree]] focusing on advanced study and research in the applied science and practice of professional [[management]].&lt;ref name=Herts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/dmanma-by-research|title=Professional Doctorate in Management|publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]]|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and focus==
The D.M. was introduced at [[Case Western Reserve]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; and several universities have since developed their own programs. In the UK, the Doctor of Management (DMan) was introduced at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=DMan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/word_doc/0018/25209/CMGdman-brochure2011.docx|title=Doctor of Management/Master of Arts|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|date=December 2010|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.M. program is an applied professional practice doctorate including a similar strong emphasis on research to the academically-equivalent [[PhD in management]], but with a focus on the application of management theories rather than on developing and extending those theories.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"&gt;{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132958/http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx| archive-date=20 December 2017|format=PDF|url=http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx | title=D.M. or Ph.D. in Management?| accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to research, it is focused on developing the talents, skills and abilities of organization executives and experienced management professionals.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=6624 | title=A Degree of Difference: A Doctorate in Management| accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.M. versus Ph.D.===
In most cases, the distinction between the degrees is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D. is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.M. further emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of this theoretical knowledge. The Ph.D. thus prepares students for careers in academia, while the D.M. is more aimed at those seeking a career in management.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"/&gt; Some D.M. programs require a [[dissertation]], while others have replaced this with a number of applied research projects.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; 

The British DMan is a professional doctorate with the same academic status as a Ph.D.&lt;ref name=DMan/&gt; The U.S. Doctor of Management is also a professional doctorate but is not (as of the report ''Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014'') recognised as a Ph.D.-equivalent research doctorate by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/technotes.cfm|title=Technical Notes|work= Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014 |date=December 2015|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doctorate is sometimes viewed as a variant of the Ph.D. in Management (especially when a dissertation is required in the program).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Program structure==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
To be admitted as a doctoral management student in the U.S., one must hold a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|management-related]] [[master's degree]], have sufficient managerial experience, and pass a comprehensive entrance exam or doctoral essay. In the UK (and in many programs in the U.S.), there is a minimum of five years of management or professional consulting experience required. In the UK, an [[honours degree]] plus a relevant master's degree is preferred.&lt;ref name=Herts/&gt; The student must then complete necessary [[coursework]] (typically focused on [[Management#Management skills|leadership]] and [[business strategy|strategy]], and including training in [[research methodology]]), perform independent original [[thesis|research]] under supervision of a qualified [[doctoral advisor]], pass the doctoral dissertation or doctoral [[thesis defense]], and in some cases, teach examinable courses.

Although it can be completed in as little as three years, the D.M. typically takes 4–6 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two years of the program are usually focused on intensive doctoral-level coursework and generally at least one research practicum (near the end of core courses, residencies, and research and writing training). It may be followed by a comprehensive examination (comps) at this point if the candidate has successfully reached this stage.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the PhD, the subsequent dissertation completion phase for the D.M. can take an additional two or more years. In some programs where the candidate has a good deal of professional management practical experience, the D.M. can be completed in as little as three years if the candidate has proven capable of taking a full load of credits each term, as well as successful completion of the required dissertation and its defense.

===Research methodologies===
Common research methodologies used in management studies include both quantitative and qualitative approaches such as: [[Business model|Modeling]], [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, Descriptive and Field Studies, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]], [[Case Study]], [[Action Research]] or [[Mixed Methods]] strategies of inquiry.

The '''European Survey Research Association (ESRA)''' was founded in 2005 to provide coordination in the field of [[statistical survey|Survey]] Research in [[Europe]]. According to the website, ESRA's main goal is to encourage communication between [[Methodology|methodologist]]s and researchers in substantive fields such as [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], and other disciplines employing survey data. Its main two activities are the biannual [[Academic conference|conference]]s on [[statistical survey|survey]] research, and the [[open access journal]] Survey Research Methods (SRM).

Established in January 2007, '''Survey Research Methods (SRM)''' is the official journal of the European Survey Research Association.  This young [[peer-reviewed journal]] aims to be a high quality scientific publication that will be of interest to researchers in all disciplines involved in the design, implementation and analysis of [[statistical survey]]s. The journal is published electronically with free and open access via the internet. The first issue was published 31 January 2007, and contained articles dealing with topics such as survey [[nonresponse]], the measurement of [[social capital]], the [[questionnaire construction|quality of survey questions]], and cross-cultural research. The current editors of SRM are Jaak Billiet of the Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, and Ulrich Kohler of the [[University of Potsdam]], Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4830">The '''European environmental research and innovation policy''' is a set of strategies, actions and programmes to promote more and better research and innovation for building a [[resource-efficient]] and [[climate]] resilient society and economy in sync with the [[natural environment]]. It is based on the [[Europe 2020]] strategy for a smart, [[sustainable]] and inclusive economy and it realises the [[European Research Area]] (ERA) and Innovation Union in the field of environment.
The aim of the European environmental research and innovation policy is to contribute to a transformative agenda for Europe in the coming years, where the quality of life of the citizens and the environment are steadily improved, in sync with the competitiveness of businesses, the societal inclusion and the management of resources.

==Main features==

The '''European environmental research and innovation policy''' has a multidisciplinary character and involve efforts across many different sectors to provide safe, economically feasible, environmentally sound and socially acceptable solutions along the entire [[value chain]] of human activities. To reduce resource use and [[environmental impacts]] whilst increasing competitiveness requires a decisive societal and technological transition to an economy based on a sustainable relationship between nature and human well-being. The availability of sufficient [[raw materials]] is addressed as well as the creation of opportunities for growth and new jobs. Innovative options are developed in policies ranging across science, technology, economy, regulations, society and citizens’ behavior, and governance. Research and innovation activities improve the understanding and forecasting of climate and environmental change in a systemic and cross-sectoral perspective, reduce uncertainties, identify and assess vulnerabilities, risks, costs, mitigation measures and opportunities, as well as expand the range and improve the effectiveness of societal and policy responses and solutions.

==International context==

{{See also|Sustainable development|Sustainable Development Goals }}
The European environmental research and innovation policy was placed in the context of the process at the [[United Nations]] to develop a set of [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) that were agreed at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] on [[Sustainable development]] in 2012 and are now integrated into the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015. These goals have succeeded the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and are universally applicable to all Nations, hence also to the [[European Union]] and its Member States.

==Implementation through Framework Programmes==

{{See also|Horizon 2020}}
The implementation of the European environmental research and innovation policy relies on a systemic approach to innovation for a system-wide transformation. For large extent, it is carried out through the Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.

The current Framework Programme is called [[Horizon 2020]] and environmental research and innovation is envisaged across the entire programme with an interdisciplinary approach. Current price estimates suggest that more than 6,5 € billion per year could be made available for activities related to sustainable development during the duration of Horizon 2020, addressing both research and innovation differently from previous FPs.&lt;ref&gt;It is expected that at least 60% of the overall Horizon 2020 budget should be related to sustainable development, and that climate-related expenditure should exceed 35% of the budget [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm "Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme"], ''[[European Commission]]'', Brussels, 3 December 2013. Retrieved on 18 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Horizon 2020 is open to cooperation with researchers and innovators world-wide in order to foster co-design and co-creation of solutions that may have a global impact.

New calls for research and innovation proposals have been opened on 14 October 2015. Information is contained in the Horizon 2020 participant portal.

The '''extinction risk of global warming''' is the risk of [[species]] becoming [[Extinction|extinct]] due to the [[effects of global warming]]. This may be Earth's [[Mass Extinction|sixth major extinction]], often called the [[Anthropocene]] or [[Holocene extinction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Current projections==
The scientific consensus in the 2007 [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is that {{Quotation|"Anthropogenic warming could lead to some impacts that are abrupt or irreversible, depending upon the rate and magnitude of the climate change."
"There is medium confidence that approximately 20-30% of species assessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average warming exceed 1.5-2.5 °C (relative to 1980-1999). As global average temperature increase exceeds about 3.5 °C, model projections suggest significant extinctions (40-70% of species assessed) around the globe."}}

In one study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2004, between 15 and 37% of 1103 endemic or near-endemic known plant and animal species will be "committed to extinction" by 2050.&lt;ref name=Thomas2004&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas, C.D. |author2=Cameron, A. |author3=Green, R.E. |author4=Bakkenes, M. |author5=Beaumont, L.J. |author6=Collingham, Y.C. |author7=Erasmus, B.F.N. |author8=Siqueira, M.F.D. |author9=Grainger, A. |author10= Hannah, L.  | year = 2004 | title = Extinction risk from climate change | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 427 | issue = 6970 | pages = 145–148 | doi= 10.1038/nature02121 | url = http://www.mnp.nl/bibliotheek/digitaaldepot/20040108nature.pdf  |format= [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] | accessdate = 2008-04-15 | pmid = 14712274|bibcode = 2004Natur.427..145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; More properly, changes in habitat by 2050 will put them outside the survival range for the inhabitants, thus committing the species to extinction.

In 2008, the [[Lemur-like Ringtail Possum|white lemuroid possum]] was reported to be the first known [[mammal]] species to be driven extinct by man-made [[global warming]]. However, these reports were based on a misunderstanding. One population of these possums in the mountain forests of [[North Queensland|northern Queensland]] is severely threatened by climate change as the animals cannot survive extended temperatures over 30&amp;nbsp;°C. However, another population 100 kilometres south remains in good health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16875 Rumours of possum's death were greatly exaggerated] March 31, 2009 [[New Scientist]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the January 4, 2012 ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]'' current climate models may be flawed because they overlook two important factors: the differences in how quickly species relocate and competition among species. According to the researchers, led by [[Mark C. Urban]], an ecologist at the University of Connecticut, diversity decreased when they took these factors into account, and that new communities of organisms, which do not exist today, emerged. As a result the rate of extinctions may be higher than previously projected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0106/Climate-change-models-flawed-extinction-rate-likely-higher-than-predicted|title=Climate change models flawed, extinction rate likely higher than predicted|date= January 6, 2012 |publisher=[[csmonitor.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in the 30 May 2014 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' most known species have small ranges, and the numbers of small-ranged species are increasing quickly. They are geographically concentrated and are disproportionately likely to be threatened or already extinct. According to the research, current rates of extinction are three orders of magnitude higher than the [[background extinction rate]], and future rates, which depend on many factors, are poised to increase. Although there has been rapid progress in developing protected areas, such efforts are not ecologically representative, nor do they optimally protect biodiversity. In the researchers' view, human activity tends to destroy critical habitats where species live, warms the planet, and tends to move species around the planet to places where they don’t belong and where they can come into conflict with human needs (e.g. causing species to become pests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20010">In [[developmental biology]], '''fate mapping''' is a method of understanding the [[embryo]]nic origin of various [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s in the adult organism by establishing the correspondence between individual [[cell (biology)|cell]]s (or groups of cells) at one stage of development, and their progeny at later stages of development.  When carried out at single-cell resolution, this process is termed '''cell lineage tracing'''.

==History==
[[File:Fate mapping fig1.jpg|thumb|right]]
The first attempts at fate mapping were made by inferences based on the examination of embryos that had been fixed, sectioned, and [[staining|stained]] at different developmental timepoints.  The disadvantage of this technique was that observation of single points in developmental time provide only snapshots of what cell movements are actually occurring and what fates are being assigned.  Early embryologists thus had to infer which cells became what tissues at later stages.

Early embryologists used "vital dyes" (which would stain but not harm the cells) to follow movements of individual cells or groups of cells over time in ''[[Xenopus]]'' frog embryos.  The tissue(s) to which the cells contribute would thus be labeled and visible in the adult organism.  The first person to develop and use this technique to study cell fate was embryologist [[Walter Vogt]] in 1929.  Vogt used small chips of agar impregnated with a vital dye, (such as [[Nile Blue]] or Nile Red) which he placed on a particular cell or population of cells in ''Xenopus'' embryos until the dye absorbed into the yolk platelets within the desired cell(s).  Once the cells were effectively labeled, the agar chip could be removed and the embryo was allowed to develop normally.  With this method, Vogt was able to discern movements of particular cell populations and the ultimate organ or tissue into which they integrated.  Although innovative for the time, this technique is limiting in that the size of a chip of agar may not accommodate single-cell resolution studies at later stages of development, since successive cell divisions will yield smaller cells (until the embryo develops into a [[larva]]l form that can eat, and thereby grow larger).  Additionally, the cell or cell population of interest must be superficial, since the agar chip with the dye must be placed on the surface of the embryo.

The information Vogt gathered from his tracing experiments of distinct cells and populations of cells in ''Xenopus'' was then pooled to construct a fate map.  The map was a representation of an early-stage embryo (such as a [[blastula]]) that has particular regions highlighted which are known to give rise to specific tissues in the adult organism. For instance, in '''Figure 1''', Nile Blue staining of a 32-cell blastula at the dorsal side of the animal pole yields a blue-stained brain and (depending on the size of the agar chip) may also stain the anterior portion of the [[notochord]].

In 1978, David Weisblat and colleagues in [[Gunther Stent]]'s lab at Berkeley improved the technique of single-cell resolution fate mapping by injection of [[horseradish peroxidase]] (HRP) enzyme, and later fluorescent peptides (1980), into individual cells in ''Helobdella triserialis'' (leech) embryos during early development.  All progeny of the injected cells could later be discerned by staining for HRP using benzidine substrate or visualized by fluorescence microscopy.  This technique allowed the experimenter greater control and selectivity over what cell was labeled and traced.  However, the opaque character of the HRP stain prevented use of vital dye [[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] counter-stains such as [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] 33258 (blue) to observe the [[mitosis|mitotic]] state of the injected cell's progeny.  Also, embryos had to be fixed in order to stain for the HRP, thus allowing only a single timepoint view of each individual leech embryo injected.  The use of fluorescent peptides such as [[Rhodamine]]-D-protein (red, RDP) and [[Fluorescein]]-D-protein (yellow/green, FDP) conjugated to large carrier molecules to prevent diffusion through cell [[gap junction]]s, alleviated several of the shortcomings of HRP injection.  Leech embryos injected with the fluorescent tracers could be visualized, and images collected of the same specimen at multiple timepoints, without fixation.  The fluorescent tracers could also be combined with nuclear Hoechst staining to visualize the mitotic status of the progeny of injected cells.  Seth Blair, also in Stent's lab, introduced a novel ablation technique that could be used in tandem with lineage tracing to pursue the questions relating to developmental potential changes in cell fate in experimentally perturbed embryos that were first raised by Roux and Driesch (1980).  For this purpose, specific cells were ablated by microinjection with [[Pronase]] (an enzyme that digests proteins) to ablate the cell; later modifications of this technique employed [[DNase]] or the [[ricin]] A chain.  The single-cell injection technique is now also in use by researchers studying other model organisms such as ''Xenopus'' (frogs), ''Danio rerio'' ([[zebrafish]]), and ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' (worms).

Genetic cell lineage tracing became an extremely powerful approach when Nat Sternberg and Daniel Hamilton identified a [[topoisomerase]] in P1 bacteriophage called [[Cre recombinase]], which has site-specific (loxP site) recombination activity (1981).  Subsequent studies have used the Cre-lox system in transgenic mice and zebrafish to create tissue specific conditional knockouts.  In order to conditionally ablate a tissue or cell population of interest, one can create a transgenic mouse using a construct containing the promoter of a gene that is specific to the target cell population, so that the Cre recombinase is only expressed in that tissue type.  A second transgenic line must be created, in which loxP recognition sites flank a portion of a particular critical "housekeeping" gene such as [[DNA polymerase-β]].  Each transgene is completely harmless by itself; however, when the two strains are crossed, the Cre expressed in the target cell population will cause the excision of DNA pol-β in those cells, which will die.  Use of the Cre system instead of injected Pronase ensures that when the targeted cell(s) dies, its intracellular contents will not harm neighboring cells since the Cre is innocuous by itself and outside the cell, whereas Pronase can damage other cells and the extracellular matrix and thus may have nonspecific effects on development.  This approach allows tissue-specific targeted ablation studies, which are important for understanding the importance of particular progenitor cells in the establishment and functionality of adult tissues.

However, in some cases a particular gene of interest is turned on multiple times during development, and Cre-mediated ablation during that first wave of expression is lethal.  In this scenario, it is possible to use an inducible version of the transgene: the Cre-ERt loxP approach.  Here, the Cre-ERt is a fusion of the recombinase and Tamoxifen-responsive estrogen receptor (ERt).  Cre-ERt will be expressed in the cytoplasm of cells expressing its upstream promoter, but will not translocate to the nucleus to conduct recombination until the animal is dosed with [[Tamoxifen]].  This tightly-regulated genetic approach to ablation studies has been an invaluable tool for learning about the hierarchy of cell fate during embryogenesis – as well as many other fields of research.

Cre-lox can also be used to permanently, fluorescently label cells by using a transgenic which contains a ubiquitous promoter such as β-actin driving a super-stop sequence flanked by loxP sites, upstream of a fluorescent protein sequence such as RFP.  In this fashion, Julien Bertrand from David Traver's lab and Neil Chi discovered the endothelial-origin of [[hematopoietic]] (blood) stem cells in zebrafish by using a transgenic with an endothelial promoter, kdrl, driving Cre recombinase crossed to β-actin loxP transgenic fish (2010). Thus, in the presence of Cre, all [[endothelium]]-derived cells became indelibly fluorescent red since the super-stop was removed from the genome, and RFP will be expressed under the control of β-actin in all cellular progeny.  Indeed, they found that nearly all hematopoietic stem cells and differentiated blood cells were RFP+, indicating their embryonic endothelial origin (See '''Figure 2''').  Similar site-directed recombination technology such as [[FLP-FRT recombination]] (Flippase and Flippase recognition target sites) is extremely powerful in cell fate mapping, ablation studies, and genetic mosaic analysis; this tool is also used heavily in studies in animal systems as divergent as mice and flies. In a similar fashion to reporter gene activation, Cre-lox recombination system can also be used to activate or inactivate a gene of interest, creating gain-of-function or loss-of-function models. As a matter of fact, researchers often need to perform lineage tracing whist perturbing a gene of interest. To this purpose, one could design a genetic model where within a cell one recombination event is designed for manipulating the gene of interest and the other recombination event is designed for activating a reporter gene. The fate of the cell whose gene is perturbed can then be followed and the function of the gene be revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewandoski|first1=Mark|title=Conditional control of gene expression in the mouse|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2001|volume=2|doi=10.1038/35093537|pmid=11584291|pages=743–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretation of this kind of cell lineage tracing experiments should be made with caution because the two recombination events may not occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1= J | last2 = Willet| first2 = SG| last3=Bankaitis| first3=ED| year =2013 | title = Non-parallel recombination limits Cre-LoxP-based reporters as precise indicators of conditional genetic manipulation | journal = Genesis | volume = 51 | issue = 6  | pages = 436–42| doi=10.1002/dvg.22384 |pmid = 23441020 | pmc=3696028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fate mapping fig2.jpg|thumb|right]]
Work in other animal models such as the nematode ''C. elegans'' was done with single-cell resolution prior to the widespread use of injectable cell tracers. The rapid embryonic development and transparent nature of the nematode allowed the construction of a hierarchical fate map of each mitotic event, from the single-cell zygote to the multicellular adult worm by [[John Sulston]] and colleagues in 1982.  This cell lineage map was based entirely on observation using [[Nomarski]] optics, with no dyes.

For a comprehensive scientific review of fate mapping, this ''Lineage Tracing'' review published in Cell 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kretzschemar|first1=K|last2=Watt|first2=F.M.|title=Lineage tracing|journal=Cell|date=Jan 12, 2012|volume=148|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.01.002|pages=33–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a great one.

==New Techniques==
More recently, scientists have developed new tools inspired by past approaches.  The use of fluorescent peptide tracers can be helpful, but in order to extend fate mapping to later stages when cells are smaller and thus difficult to consistently and selectively inject (unlike the 0.5mm leech embryo), modifications were made.  Chemically-"caged" fluorescent peptides, such as caged Rhodamine-dextran or caged Fluorescein-dextran (FITC), have been developed to be non-fluorescent until hit with an ultraviolet (450&amp;nbsp;nm) laser, which "uncages" the compound and causes it to fluoresce.  This tool was particularly well received in the zebrafish community since it is ideal to inject caged compound into a freshly fertilized, single-cell embryo that will rapidly develop over 24 hours into a transparent swimming larvae with approximately 30,000 cells.  Injection of the compound into the single-cell embryo allows uniform distribution throughout all the cells of the developing embryo, and the dextran carrier, developed by Jochen Braun and Bob Glimich prevents diffusion between cells through [[gap junctions]], which are common during embryogenesis.  At a given stage of development, one can use a UV laser to uncage the compound in a distinct cell or set of cells, effectively labeling them red (Rhodamine) or green (FITC).  The embryos can be allowed to develop normally until a later time, at which point they can be imaged for red or green fluorescence in the progeny of the uncaged cells.  However, it is important to note that properly focusing the UV laser beam on an individual cell deep within the embryo is difficult.  Sub-optimal focusing can lead to unintentional uncaging of cells outside the focal plane of the target cell.  Also, uncaged Rhodamine has a short half-life, and must be imaged within 48 hours or the signal may be difficult to see.  Similarly uncaged FITC is sometimes difficult to image later in development, and thus detection by [[immunostaining]] is often performed.  Injected embryos must also be kept in the dark to avoid non-specific uncaging from ambient light.

Aside from chemical tracers, we can also lineage trace with [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] mRNA injection, over-express a protein of interest by injecting [[mRNA]], [[gene knockdown|knockdown]] expression by [[shRNA]] injection or mutant protein construct injection to see what cell types and tissues are affected during embryogenesis.  Particularly mRNAs encoding [[histone]] tagged with green, cyan, yellow or red fluorescent proteins co-injected with mRNA for a membrane-bound fusion protein conjugated to another [[fluorophore]], greatly enhance our ability to obtain high-resolution images of individual cell movements over time.  Such microinjection experiments allow highly specific and selective cell manipulations superior to gross ablation experiments.  Thus, specificity will facilitate the effective observation of injected cells and their neighbors and resultant deviations from normal development.

Fate mapping is therefore an extremely powerful tool for biologists, with new and improved tools constantly evolving to allow great resolution of what goes on during embryogenesis in various model organisms.  Many genetic and chemical tools have been generated that allow long-term cell lineage tracing, bringing insight into the longevity of embryonic stem cells for various tissues.  The ability to over-express and knockdown putative cell-fate patterning molecules and fluorescently label them, will also enhance our understanding of the extrinsic and intrinsic molecular cues required by various cell types during embryogenesis.

A '''functional beverage''' is a drink typically intended to convey a health benefit. Some include ingredients like herbs, vitamins, minerals, nootropics, [[amino acid]]s, or additional raw fruit or vegetables.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Examples of functional beverages include [[sports drinks|sports]] and performance drinks, [[energy drink]]s, ready to drink (RTD) teas, smart drinks (shine+), enhanced fruit drinks, [[soy beverage]]s, and [[enhanced water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flex-news-food.com/pages/16777/Beverages/Ingredients/USA/us-functional-beverages-market-young-market-growing-popularity.html U.S. Functional Beverages Market: A Young Market with Growing Popularity]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popularity ==
Functional beverages have become popular among people who want specific health benefits from their foods and beverages. Both convenience and health have been identified as important factors in consumers' decision-making about food and beverage purchases. Functional drinks are advertised as having various health benefits. For example, some claim to improve heart health, [[immune system|immunity]], [[digestion]], and [[joint]] health, while others promote themselves as [[satiety|satiating]] and energy-boosting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association: Functional Beverages]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The functional beverage industry is a subsector of the [[functional food]] and non-alcoholic beverage industry. It is the fastest-growing sector of the industry, partially due to the maturity of the carbonated [[soft drink]] sector and heavy investments by major food and beverage companies.&lt;ref name="scholan"&gt;Scholan, I. "Functional Beverages-- where next? Innovation in functional beverages market is set to continue." ''International Food Ingredients'' December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the industry's growth may be the consumer-oriented market scheme whereby innovative ideas come from consumers. By 2008, in the U.S., the market share of functional beverages accounted for 48.9% of the non-alcoholic industry, which is worth $118.3 billion.&lt;ref name="roberts"&gt;Roberts, W. "Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods'' August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, functional beverage consumption [[per capita]]{{where|date=October 2015}} rose to 66.4 gallons, while the carbonated soft drink sector saw a decline{{when|date=October 2015}} in per-capita consumption to 50.4 gallons (decreased from an average per-capita consumption of 192.5 gallons in 2006).&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages" /&gt;

Functional beverage industry players are generally categorized into four types:&lt;ref name="packaged2009"&gt;"Functional Foods and Beverages in US. MaryLand." ''Packaged Facts.'' May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Traditional non-alcoholic beverage companies, like [[PepsiCo]], [[Fuze Beverage]], and [[The Coca-Cola Company]]. 
# Major food companies, such as [[Nestlé]], [[Altria]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[General Mills]], and the [[Campbell Soup Company]].
# Smaller-scaled private companies, like SALOMED GmbH&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.salomed.com/functional-beverages&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Austria]], and specialized companies like Traditional Medicinals and [[POM Wonderful]].
# [[Agricultural cooperative]]s, such as [[Ocean Spray (cooperative)|Ocean Spray]] and [[Sunsweet Growers]].

== Product trends ==
The functional beverage industry encompasses a wide range of varieties targeting different health-related concerns.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; One trend has been toward hybrid drinks, which are marketed as having benefits like thirst-quenching ability, with daily dosages of vitamins or other nutrients.&lt;ref name="roberts" /&gt; Another trend is the rise of [[probiotics]], exemplified by [[Activia]] yogurt, marketed for intestinal and immune health. Other beverages, like [[Function Drinks#Function: BRAINIAC|Function: BRAINIAC]], a [[carambola]] punch energy drink in the [[Function Drinks]] line, advertise improved memory and mental sharpness. Functional drinks marketed to children have also been developed, and received attention with Nestlé's [[Boost (beverage)|Boost]].

A 2005 trend toward single-serve functional beverages was fueled by consumers' demands for convenience.{{vague|date=October 2015}} According to Campbell's director of single-serve beverages, "People know they will be seen when they are drinking single-serving beverages, so the package is critical." &lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Bob "Sweet Revenge." ''Progressive Grocer'' 2005 84(5): 34-36, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Drinks marketed toward weight loss, health, and beauty (like Nova the Essential Drink) account for a considerable [[market share]]. Lastly, "energy-boosting" functional beverage products, such as [[Red Bull]] and [[5-Hour Energy]], have been rated fastest{{when|date=January 2015}} in growth in the functional beverage market.

== Market ==

The functional beverage industry generally competes using four primary strategies:&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;
# Promote their own products as healthy and unique, by clearly distinguishing their health claims from similar products, and by specifying naturally healthy ingredients.
# Consider extensions of existing brand lines. For example, Nestle extended their Boost product line by adding Kids Essentials to the line, thereby extending the adult-focused Boost line to a new market (children).
# Larger companies compete for market share by [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquiring]] smaller companies that may own a particular market sector.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt; For example, Coca-Cola purchased Glaceau from [[Energy Brands]], and [[Odwalla]] and [[Fuze Beverage]] from their respective founders, in order to increase Coca-Cola's market share.
# Explore new functional brands by identifying new markets and demands.

Market segments of the functional beverage industry are divided mainly into four parts.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Those include hydration; energy/rejuvenation; health and wellness; and weight management.&lt;ref name="scholan" /&gt; Each segment has its own [[target market]] and consumers. Overlapping of target consumers does occur—not because of undefined market needs, but due to consumer acceptance of functional beverages.&lt;ref name="packaged2009" /&gt;

=== Hydration ===
Recently,{{when|date=October 2015}} there has been an increase in the promotion of [[hydrational fluid|hydration]] drinks.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Fowhich it marketed as an exclusive hydration drink, sold only in [[Neiman Marcus]] stores. Among the drink's ingredient list were [[antioxidant]] vitamins and fruit extracts, which the company claims "hydrate the inner and outer layer of the skin" and protect drinkers from [[free radical]]s.&lt;ref name="Benefiting Beverages"&gt;Benefiting Beverages. ''Prepared Foods'' 2009 178(8): 13-24, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 30 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gatorade]] has also created several drinks marketed as hydration beverages with various health benefits. Its "Thirst Quencher" drinks, according to advertisements, each contain an "excellent source" of various vitamins:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* 25% of the [[Reference Daily Intake|RDI]] of B vitamins (including vitamins [[vitamin B3|B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[vitamin B5|B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]], and [[vitamin B6|B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]]);
* 20% of the RDI of the [[antioxidant]] [[vitamin E]]; and,
* 20% of the RDI of [[vitamin C]].

In tandem with these adjustments, a low-calorie version called G2 was also reformulated. According to Gatorade, G2 now also provides:&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;
* an "excellent source" (25% of the RDI) of B vitamins (including vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;); and,
* a "good source" (10% of the RDI) of vitamins [[Vitamin C|C]] and [[vitamin E|E]].

Gatorade's new products are a good example of the first major strategy of competition, listed in the "Market" section above. By reformulating its products, Gatorade's goals were to promote their own new products as healthier, and to emphasize the healthy ingredients in the drinks.

=== Energy and stimulation ===
Highly caffeinated, often highly sweetened "energy drinks" have become popular on the beverage market in the United States, as well as globally, in the past decade. Consumer demand has helped generate a new generation of "energy drink" brands containing similar amounts of caffeine, calories, and sugar.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt;

Various stimulants found in energy drinks include [[taurine]], [[glucoronolactone]], [[caffeine]], [[B vitamins]], [[guarana]], [[ginseng]], [[ginkgo biloba]], [[L-carnitine]], [[sugars]], antioxidants, [[yerba maté]], [[creatine]], and [[milk thistle]].&lt;ref name="sharon"&gt;Sharon Palmer. "Functional Beverages" http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm. Accessed Dec 3 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these ingredients have been approved by the [[FDA]], health experts still recommend that consumers read their energy drinks' labels, as these ingredients may not improve health.&lt;ref name="sharon" /&gt;

=== Health and wellness ===
"Health-conscious" individuals are among the target consumers of many functional beverage companies. To target these individuals, many companies have introduced functional beverages which contain less sugar, and therefore less calories.{{synthesis inline|date=October 2015}} For example, [[VitaminWater]] 10 contains only 10 calories per serving (25 calories for a 351mL bottle, with 7.5&amp;nbsp;grams of sugar). An entire bottle also contains 250% of the RDI of vitamin C,&lt;ref name="rebecca"&gt;Rebecca Wright. "Functional Beverages: Surviving or Thriving?" http://www.nutraceuticalsworld.com/articles/2009/07/functional-beverages-thriving-or-surviving. Retrieved December 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and 25% of the RDI of vitamins B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt; VitaminWater 10 lowered its calorie content by using an all-natural sweetener ([[stevia]]) extracted from the ''[[Stevia rebaudiana]]'' plant. This also makes it possible for the company to advertise VitaminWater 10 as "natural".&lt;ref name="rebecca" /&gt;

=== Weight management ===
With increased worries about [[obesity]] and its implications on health, combined with consumer demand for convenience goods, consumer demand has increased for easy weight loss methods that can be easily integrated into daily lifestyles.&lt;ref name="william" /&gt; Functional beverages are striving to market themselves as such, by adding ingredients that are claimed to promote weight loss.&lt;ref name="william"&gt;"Benefiting Beverages." ''Prepared Foods.'' 1 August 2009. Assessed 3 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Nestlé and The Coca-Cola Company have partnered to produce [[Enviga]], which they describe as a "calorie-burning beverage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/healthy-weight-commitment Coca-Cola – Press Center – New Products – Enviga Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Skinny Water (owned by Skinny Nutritional Corp.) and [[Nutrisoda]]'s Slenderized (owned by PepsiCo) have both used a [[polyphenol]] called [[epigallocatechin gallate]] (EGCG) in their products for their "{{Sic|metabolize boosting}} effect". 
* A tea extract called "Blue California", which has a 95% EGCG content, is now on the market.&lt;ref&gt;Landi, Heather "Tea Revolution." ''Beverage World'' 2009 128(10): 78, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigators report slimming actions induced by [[chlorogenic acid]]s from [[green coffee]], but further investigations need to be performed.&lt;!-- Need to list the risks here --&gt;

===Sales===
As of 2008, based on dollar sales, the most popular functional beverages, in order, were:&lt;ref name="Functional Beverages"&gt;Functional Beverages. ''Beverage World'' 2008 127(3): 14, online in [[EBSCO]] assessed 29 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
# Health and wellness drinks, with 62.2% of dollar sales
# Hydration drinks (28%)
# Energy/Rejuvenation drinks (8.4%)
# Weight Management drinks (1.2%)

== Consumer demographic ==
According to a 2006 article, the functional beverage market's [[consumer group]] is characterized as well-educated females aged 35–55, belonging to the upper middle, middle, and lower middle classes.&lt;ref name="bogue 2006" /&gt; This is thought to result from this group's perceptions that functional drinks produce positive health beliefs, as well as their relatively high [[disposable income]].&lt;ref name="bogue 2006"&gt;Bogue, J., Seymour, C. and Sorenson, D. "Market-oriented new product development of meal replacement and meal complement beverages." ''Journal of Food Products Marketing’’, 2006 12(3): 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 article stated that within the energy and stimulant drink sector, young adults aged 18 to 34 are considered to be the main target market, as evidenced by high consumption rates.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, C. and Emerton, V. "Food and Drinks through the Lifecycle." ''Surrey:Leatherhead International’’. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to constant changes in attitudes about different types of functional beverages, these target markets could change.&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Van Trijp, H.C.M. and Van Der Lans, I.A. (2007). "Consumer perceptions of nutrition and health claims." ''Appetite’’. 2007 48(3):305–324&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health concerns ==
Health experts are concerned about the increased consumption and popularity of functional beverages. Although these beverages may serve to hydrate the individual, they may not mitigate or even address today's major health issues, such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]], and [[cancer]]. Most functional beverages are sweetened, and consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with higher levels of obesity and heart disease.&lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks"&gt;http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition_16066_ENU_HTML.htm American Dietetic Association – Functional Beverages Accessed 2 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these drinks contain significant amounts of [[sugars]] and hence calories, which would add to discretionary and total [[caloric]] intake. As such, these ingredients pose health risks because of what they contain (sugar and caffeine) or what they replace in the diet (vitamin and mineral-rich foods).

Another set of concerns is that some functional beverages contain ingredients that have not been sufficiently studied for health benefits, safety, and dosage. At the same time, many functional beverages have higher levels of a certain ingredient, like caffeine—which, when consumed in large amounts, is associated with heart disease and cancer.&lt;!-- need citation --&gt; &lt;ref name="ADA, Functionaldrinks" /&gt;

=== Sugar content ===
Many functional drinks have high levels of sugar, even if they have other "healthy" ingredients. For example, a 20oz bottle of [[Glacéau]]'s [[VitaminWater]] has been reported to contain approximately 33 g of sugar, which is similar to the sugar content of a can of [[Coca-Cola]]. This prompted [[The Coca-Cola Company]] to be sued for claiming that VitaminWater was a healthy beverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/200901151.html  [[Coca-Cola]] was sued for Fraudulent Claims on Obesity-Promoting "Vitaminwater" Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Given their sugar content, many functional beverages may not be as healthy an alternative as other commonly consumed beverages. In addition, the sugar content of such beverages promotes dental cavities amongst frequent users.

=== Energy drinks ===
{{Main article|Energy drink}}
In some functional beverages, particularly energy drinks, the caffeine content can be up to 141 milligrams per serving, more than an average 8-ounce cup of coffee containing 133&amp;nbsp;mg of caffeine. There have been reports to Health Canada of adverse reactions involving energy drinks.&lt;ref name="Health Canada"&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hl-vs/iyh-vsv/prod/energy-energie-eng.php#he It's Your Health – Safe Use of Energy Drinks. Accessed 2 December 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graduate Medical Program (GMP)''' or sometimes also known as '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Program (GEP)]]''' or '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM)]]''' are terms generally used outside of the United States to refer to medical programs usually of 4-years duration where applicants are [[university]] graduates who have taken aptitude tests such as the [[GAMSAT]], [[UKCAT]] or [[MCAT]]. These tests are not to be confused with tests such as the [[UMAT]] since tests such as the [[UMAT]] are designed for high school graduates. Medical programs in the United States technically do not require the completion of a previous degree, but do require the completion of 2–3 years of pre-medical sciences at the university level and so are thus classified as [[Second entry degree]]s. However, since in places such as [[Australia]] medical applicants were historically generally high school graduates and only recently have medical schools changed to requiring the completion of a previous [[bachelor's degree]], the terms '''Graduate Medical Program''' and '''Graduate Entry Medicine''' arose to differentiate the new courses.

[[Image:The Stranger at the Door.jpg|thumb|"The Stranger at the Door" (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]
'''''Hávamál''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|h|ɑː|v|ə|m|ɑː|l}} {{respell|HAH|və-mahl}}; "sayings of the high one"; {{IPA-non|ˈhɒːwaˌmɒːl}}, {{IPA-is|ˈhauvaˌmaul̥}}) is presented as a single poem in the [[Codex Regius]], a collection of [[Old Norse]] poems from the Viking age. The poem, itself a combination of different poems, is largely [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]], presenting advice for living, proper conduct and wisdom.

The verses are attributed to [[Odin]]; the implicit attribution to Odin facilitated the accretion of various mythological material also dealing with the same deity.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows (1936), introductory note.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part composed in the [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] [[Alliterative verse#Ljóðaháttr|''Ljóðaháttr'']], a metre associated with wisdom verse, ''Hávamál'' is both practical and philosophical in content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=Df3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA283&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=havamal+reviewed&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uUAdThDbNA&amp;sig=a-EUTIfEqnRFftft1qMgfXYfwqM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwifxc-L0vzVAhXizIMKHYmrAewQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Church Review|last=Richardson|first=Nathaniel Smith|last2=Boggs|first2=Edward Brenton|last3=Baum|first3=Henry Mason|date=1872|publisher=Bassett and Bradley|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the gnomic  "''Hávamál'' proper" comes the ''Rúnatal'', an account of how Odin won the [[rune]]s, and the ''Ljóðatal'', a list of magic chants or [[galdr|spells]].&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 14. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textual history==
The only surviving source for ''Hávamál'' is the 13th century [[Codex Regius]]. The part dealing with ethical conduct (the ''Gestaþáttr'') was traditionally identified as the oldest portion of the poem by scholarship in the 19th and early 20th century.
Bellows (1936) identifies as the core of the poem a "collection of proverbs and wise counsels" which dates to "a very early time", but which, by the nature of oral tradition, never had a fixed form or extent.
[[Von See]] (1981) identifies direct influence of the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' on the ''Gestaþáttr'', suggesting that also this part is a product of the high medieval period and casting doubt on the "unadulterated Germanic character" of the poem claimed by earlier commentators.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus von See: „Disticha Catonis und Hávamál.“ In: Klaus von See: Edda, Saga, Skaldendichtung. Heidelberg 1981, 27-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] core of the poem, other fragments and poems dealing with wisdom and proverbs accreted over time. A discussion of authorship or date for the individual parts would be futile, since almost every line or stanza could have been added, altered or removed at will at any time before the poem was written down in the 13th century.
Individual verses or stanzas nevertheless certainly date to as early as the 10th, or even the 9th century. Thus, the  line ''deyr fé, deyja frændr'' ("cattle die, kinsmen die") found in verses 76 and 77 of the ''Gestaþáttr'' can be shown to date to the 10th century, as it also occurs in the ''[[Hákonarmál]]'' by [[Eyvindr skáldaspillir]].

==Structure==
The ''Hávamál'' is edited in 165 stanzas by Bellows (1936). Other editions give 164 stanzas, combining Bellow's stanzas 11 and 12, as the manuscript abbreviates the last two lines of stanzas 11. Some editors also combine Bellow's stanzas 163 and 164. In the following, Bellow's numeration is used.

The poems in ''Hávamál'' is traditionally taken to consist of at least five independent parts,
#the ''Gestaþáttr'', or ''Hávamál'' proper,  (stanzas 1–80), a collection of proverbs and [[gnomic poetry|gnomic]] wisdom
#a dissertation on the faithlessness of women (stanzas 81–95), prefacing an account of the love-story of Odin and the [[daughter of Billingr]] (stanzas 96-102) and the story of how Odin got the [[mead of poetry]] from the maiden [[Gunnlöð]]  (stanzas 103–110)
#the ''Loddfáfnismál'' (stanzas 111–138), a collection of gnomic verses similar to the ''Gestaþáttr'', addressed to a certain Loddfáfnir
#the  ''Rúnatal'' (stanzas 139–146), an account of how Odin won the runes, introductory to the  ''Ljóðatal''
#the '' Ljóðatal'' (stanzas 147–165), a collection of charms

Stanzas 6 and 27 are expanded beyond the standard four lines by an additional two lines of "commentary". Bellow's edition inverses the manuscript order of stanzas 39 and 40. Bellow's stanza 138 (''Ljóðalok'') is taken from the very end of the poem in the manuscript, placed before
the ''Rúnatal'' by most editors following Müllenhoff. Stanzas 65, 73–74, 79, 111, 133–134, 163 are defective.

Stanzas  81-84 are in ''[[málaháttr]]'', 85–88 in ''[[fornyrðislag]]''. The entire section of 81–102 appears to be an ad hoc interpolation. Stanza 145 is also an interpolation in  ''málaháttr''.

==Contents==

===''Gestaþáttr''===
The first section '''''Gestaþáttr''''', the "guest's section". Stanzas 1 through 79 comprise a set of maxims for how to handle oneself when a guest and traveling, focusing particularly on [[manners]] and other behavioral relationships between hosts and guests and the sacred [[Folklore|lore]] of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]] and [[hospitality]] to the [[Norse paganism|Norse pagans]].

The first stanza exemplifies the practical behavioral advice it offers:
&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em"&gt;
All the entrances, before you walk forward,
you should look at,
you should spy out;
for you can't know for certain where enemies are sitting,
ahead in the hall''&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON14/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Number 76 is possibly the most known section of ''Gestaþáttr'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Deyr fé,
deyja frændur, 
deyr sjálfur ið sama; 
en orðstír 
deyr aldregi
hveim er sér góðan getur." }}
|
Cattle die,
kinsmen die
you yourself die;
One thing now
that never dies
the fame of a dead man’s deeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Poetic Edda: The Heroic Poems|last=Bellows|first=Henry Adams|publisher=Dover Publications|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===On women===
[[File:Billingr's girl, bitch, and Odin by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Billingr's girl watches on while Odin encounters the bitch tied to her bedpost (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]].]]
Stanzas 83 to 110 deal with the general topic of [[romantic love]] and the character of [[women]].

It is introduced by a discussion of the faithlessness of women and advice for the seducing of them in stanzas 84–95, followed by two mythological accounts of Odin's interaction with women also known as "Odin's Examples" or "Odin's Love Quests". The first is an account of Odin's thwarted attempt of possessing the daughter of [[Billingr|Billing]]  (stanzas 96–102), followed by the story of the [[mead of poetry]] which Odin won by seducing its guardian, the maiden [[Gunnlöð]] (stanzas 103–110).

===''Loddfáfnismál''===
The '''''Loddfáfnismál'''''  (stanzas 111–138) is again gnomic, dealing with morals, ethics, correct action and codes of conduct. The section is directed to [[Loddfáfnir]] ("stray-singer").

===''Rúnatal''===
[[Image:Odin's Self-sacrifice by Collingwood.jpg|thumb|"Odin's Self-sacrifice" (1908) by W. G. Collingwood.]]
[[File:Jelling gr Stein 3.JPG|thumb|The younger [[Jelling stone]] (erected by [[Harald Bluetooth]] ca. 970) shows the [[crucifixion of Christ]] with the victim suspended in the branches of a tree instead of on a cross.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Patton 2009:271.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''''Rúnatal''''' or '''''Óðins Rune Song''''', ''Rúnatáls-þáttr-Óðins'' (stanzas 139-146) is a section of the ''Hávamál'' where Odin reveals the origins of the [[runes]].
In stanzas 139 and 140, Odin describes his  sacrifice of himself to himself:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Veit ec at ec hecc vindga meiði a
netr allar nío,
geiri vndaþr oc gefinn Oðin,
sialfr sialfom mer,
a þeim meiþi, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rótom renn.

Við hleifi mic seldo ne viþ hornigi,
nysta ec niþr,
nam ec vp rvnar,
opandi nam,
fell ec aptr þaðan.}}
|
I know that I hung on a windy tree
[[Numbers in Norse mythology|nine]] long nights,
wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,
myself to myself,
on that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.

No bread did they give me nor a [[Drinking horn|drink from a horn]],
downwards I peered;
I took up the runes,
screaming I took them,
then I fell back from there.&lt;ref name=LARRINGTON34&gt;Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 34. [[Oxford World's Classics]] {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The "windy tree" from which the victim hangs is often identified with the world tree [[Yggdrasil]] by commentators. The entire scene, the sacrifice of a god to himself, the execution method by hanging the victim on a tree, and the wound inflicted on the victim by a spear, is often compared to the [[crucifixion of Christ]] as narrated in the [[gospel]]s.
The parallelism of Odin and Christ during the period of open co-existence of Christianity and Norse paganism in Scandinavia (the 9th to 12th centuries, corresponding with the assumed horizon of the poem's composition) is also evident from other sources. To what extent this parallelism is an incidental similarity of the mode of [[human sacrifice]] offered to Odin and the crucifixion, and to what extent a Pagan influence on Christianity, or vice versa, may have occurred, is a complex question on which scholarly opinions vary.&lt;ref&gt;a sketch of the problem is given by  Kimberley Christine Patton, ''Religion of the gods: ritual, paradox, and reflexivity'' Oxford University,  {{ISBN|978-0-19-509106-9}}, chapter 7 "Myself to Myself: The Norse Odin and Divine Autosacrifice".&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ljóðatal''===
The last section, the '''''Ljóðatal''''' enumerates eighteen songs (''ljóð''), sometimes called "charms", prefaced with
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|Ljóð ek þau kann
er kann-at þjóðans kona
ok mannskis mǫgr}}
|attr1=stanza 147|
The songs I know
that king's wives know not
Nor men that are sons of men.}}

The songs themselves are not given, just their application or effect described.
They are explicitly counted from "the first" in stanza 147, and "a second" to "an eighteenth" in stanzas 148 to 165, given in Roman numerals in the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Bellows separates the "seventeenth" item into stanzas 163 and 164. There is a gap in stanza 163, and some editors have also combined 163 and 164 into a single stanza.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no explicit mention of runes or [[runic magic]] in the ''Ljóðatal'' excepting in
the twelfth song (stanza 158), which takes up the motif of Odin hanging on the tree and its association with runes,
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|non|svá ek ríst
ok í rúnum fá'k}}
|
So do I write
and color the runes}}

Nevertheless, because of the ''Rúnatal'' preceding the list, modern commentators sometimes reinterpret the ''Ljóðatal'' as referring to runes, specifically with the sixteen letters of the [[Younger Futhark]].

Müllenhoff takes the original ''Ljóðatal'' to have ended with stanza 161, with the final three songs (16th to 18th) taken as late and obscure additions.

==Germanic Neopaganism==
The difference of sixteen runes of the [[Younger Futhark]] vs. eighteen charms in the ''Ljóðatal'' has notably motivated proponents of [[Ariosophy|Germanic mysticism]] to expand the row by two extra runes. The best-known attempt to this effect are the [[Armanen runes]] by [[Guido von List]] (1902).

Various proponents of [[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagan]] groups place an emphasis on ''Hávamál'' as a source of a Norse pagan ethical code of conduct. The  "[[Nine Noble Virtues]]", first compiled by [[Odinic Rite]] founder John "Stubba" Yeowell in the 1970s are "loosely based" on the Hávamál.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
The [[Northvegr Foundation]] cites the Hávamál among other Old Norse and Old English sources to illustrate "the ethical ideal of the Northern spiritual faith of Heithni."&lt;ref&gt;Alfta Lothursdottir, ''Trulog and Sogumal'', Northvegr (2006); [http://www.northvegr.org/northern/book/trulog.php Trúlög: Northern Truisms] (northvegr.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]], leader of the Icelandic ''[[Ásatrúarfélagið]]'', published his performance of a number of Eddaic poems, including the Hávamál,  chanted in [[rímur]] style.&lt;ref&gt;"Edda", Current 93 (1991); [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY7dtuYH7B0 youtube.com link]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information space analysis''' is a [[deterministic]] method, enhanced by [[Artificial intelligence|machine intelligence]], for locating and assessing [[resource]]s for team-centric efforts.

Organizations need to be able to quickly assemble teams backed by the support services, information, and material to do the job. To do so, these teams need to find and assess sources of services that are potential participants in the team effort. To support this initial team and resource development, information needs to be developed via analysis tools that help make sense of sets of [[Computer file|data sources]] in an [[Intranet]] or [[Internet]]. Part of the process is to characterize them, partition them, and sort and filter them.

These tools focus on three key issues in forming a collaborative team: 
#Help individuals responsible for forming the team understand what is available.
#Assist team members in identifying the structure and categorize the [[information]] available to them in a manner specifically suited to the task at hand.
#Aid team members to understand the mappings of their information between their [[organization]] and that used by others who might participate.

Information space analysis tools combine multiple methods to assist in this task. This causes the tools to be particularly well-suited to integrating additional [[technology|technologies]] in order to create specialized systems.

The '''International Planetarium Society, Inc.''' (IPS) is the global association of [[planetarium]] professionals. Its nearly 700 members come from [[List of planetariums|35 countries]] around the world. They represent schools, colleges and universities, museums, and public facilities of all sizes, including both fixed and portable planetariums. The primary goal of the Society is to encourage the sharing of ideas among its members through conferences, publications, and networking. By sharing their insights and creative work, IPS members become better planetarians.

IPS membership is open to anyone interested in planetariums. Members include directors, teachers, technicians, writers, artists, media specialists, digital artists and producers, presenters, vendors, scientists, students, and sponsors and friends of the planetarium dome and its starry sky.

More than 20 regional and national planetarium associations from around the world are affiliated with IPS. Representatives from those affiliates, together with the elected officers, make up the Executive Council, the ruling body of the organization.

== History&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=a_Engle1982 Historical Aspects of the International Planetarium Society]," Paul R. Engle, ''Planetarian'', Vol. 11 No. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=weinrich40year A Forty-year Perspective of the International Planetarium Society]," Dave Weinrich, ''Proceedings of the 47th Annual GLPA Conference'' in Champaign, Illinois, October 19–22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ==
The genesis of what was to become the International Planetarium Society began with a meeting of planetarium educators in 1958 at the Cranbrook Institute in Michigan. Sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), about 100 delegates from 67 facilities attended. The conference's proceedings were published as ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1958_cranbrook_proceedings.pdf Planetaria and Their Uses for Education]''.

Another meeting was sponsored by the NSF in 1960, this time in Cleveland, Ohio, and resulted in ''[https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/resource/resmgr/pdf-pubs/1960_cleveland_proceedings.pdf Planetariums and Their Uses for Education, Volume 2].'' At this meeting those attending voted to initiate a national planetarium association called the American Association of Planetarium Operators, but nothing came out of the action.

Regional associations of planetarium educators formed in the 1960s, resulting in the forming of GLPA, MAPS, SWAP, PPA, RMPA, and SWAP, and PAC was formed in Canada.

More than 300 planetarians gathered in 1970 at the Abrams Planetarium at Michigan State University in East Lansing at a meeting called CAPE - the Conference of Planetarium Educators. At this meeting the decision was made to organize a North American planetarium association and publish a journal. By-laws for the International Society of Planetarium Educators were approved in 1971, and the journal, ''Planetarian'', began in 1972. Paul Engle from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock Planetarium became the first president, and the first editor was Frank C. Jettner from the Department of Astronomy at the State University of New York at Albany. Among the articles in the first issue was "Science and Communication" by Isaac Asimov.

== Early Planetarians ==
The planetarium field's earliest members were those who invented and modified the equipment used to project the stars onto the dome.
Among them are
* [[Walther Bauersfeld]], often called the "father" of planetariums, for his development of the Zeiss 1 model opto-mechanical projector in 1923
* [[Armand Spitz]], who developed an early inexpensive opto-mechanical projector
* [[Richard H. Emmons]], who helped establish more than 23 planetariums

== Awards ==
The highest award given by IPS is the '''Service Award''', started in 1982. This award is bestowed, from time to time, by the Society upon an individual or institution whose presence and work in the planetarium field has been, through the years, an inspiration to the profession and its members.” Since 1982 there have been 23 people&lt;ref&gt;https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=awardees&lt;/ref&gt; awarded with the IPS Service Award.

Similarly, the IPS '''Technology and Innovation Award''' is given by the Society, from time to time, upon an individual whose technology and/or innovations in the planetarium field have been, through the years, used or replicated by other members and/or other planetariums.” The award began in 2009 and 4 persons&lt;ref&gt;https://ips-planetarium.site-ym.com/?page=awardees&lt;/ref&gt; have been recognized.

Deserving IPS members also may be named a '''Fellow''' of the Society. To be named, a member must have continuous active membership in good standing in IPS for at least five years and substantial contributions in at least two of the following respects:

'''Interpersonal deception theory'''
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Interpersonal.png|thumb]] --&gt;
('''IDT''') attempts to explain how individuals handle actual (or perceived) deception at the conscious or subconscious level while engaged in face-to-face communication. IDT assumes that communication is not static; it is influenced by personal goals and the meaning of the interaction as it unfolds. The sender's overt (and covert) communications are affected by the overt and covert communications of the receiver, and vice versa. Intentional deception requires greater cognitive exertion than truthful communication, regardless of whether the sender attempts falsification ([[Lie|lying]]), [[:wikt:concealment|concealment]] (omitting material facts) or [[equivocation]] (skirting issues by changing the subject or responding indirectly). IDT explores the interrelation between the sender's communicative meaning and the receiver's thoughts and behavior in deceptive exchanges.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Theoretical perspective{{anchor|Theoretical Perspective}}==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Theoretical.png|thumb]] --&gt;
IDT views deception through the lens of interpersonal communication, considering deception as an interactive process between sender and receiver. In contrast with previous studies of deception (which focused on the sender and receiver individually), IDT focuses on the [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] and relational nature of deceptive communication. Behaviors by sender and receiver are dynamic, multifunctional, multidimensional and multi-modal.&lt;ref&gt;Buller and Burgoon, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Dyadic communication is communication between two people; a dyad is a group of two people between whom messages are sent and received. Relational communication is communication in which meaning is created by two people simultaneously filling the roles of sender and receiver. [[Dialogic]] activity is the active communicative language of the sender and receiver, each relying upon the other in the exchange.

In [[psychotherapy]] and psychological counseling, dyadic, relational and dialogic activity between therapist and patient relies on honest, open communication if the patient is to recover and be capable of healthier relationships. Deception uses the same theoretical framework in reverse; the communication of one participant is deliberately false.

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] studied nonverbal cues to detect deception about a century ago. Freud observed a patient being asked about his darkest feelings. If his mouth was shut and his fingers were trembling, he was considered to be lying. In 1989, DePaulo and Kirkendol developed the Motivation Impairment Effect (MIE). MIE states the harder people try to deceive others, the more likely they are to get caught. Burgoon and Floyd, however, revisited this research and formed the idea that deceivers are more active in their attempt to deceive than most would anticipate or expect.

IDT was developed by two communication professors, David B. Buller and [[Judee K. Burgoon]]. Prior to their study, deception had not been fully considered as a communication activity. Previous work had focused upon the formulation of principles of deception. These principles were derived by evaluating the lie detection ability of individuals observing unidirectional communication. These early studies found initially that "although humans are far from infallible in their efforts to diagnose lies, they are substantially better at the task than would result merely by chance." Buller and Burgoon discount the value of highly controlled studies – usually one-way communication experiments – designed to isolate unmistakable cues that people are lying. Therefore, IDT is based on two-way communication and intended to describe deception as an interaction communicative process.&lt;ref&gt;https://managingresearchlibrary.org/glossary/communicative-interaction&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|18 Propositions|18 propositions}}Propositions==
IDT's model of interpersonal deception has 18 verifiable propositions. Based on assumptions of interpersonal communication and deception, each proposition can generate a testable hypothesis. Although some propositions originated in IDT, many are derived from earlier research. The propositions attempt to explain the cognition and behavior of sender and receiver during the process of deception, from before interaction through interaction to the outcome after interaction.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"&gt;Buller and Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|The Superordinate Role of Context and Relationship|The superordinate role of context and relationship}}Context and relationship===
IDT's explanations of interpersonal deception depend on the situation in which interaction occurs and the relationship between sender and receiver. 
:1. Sender and receiver cognition and behaviors vary, since deceptive communication contexts vary in access to social cues, immediacy, relationship, conversational demands and spontaneity. 
:2. In deceptive interchanges, sender and receiver cognition and behaviors vary; relationships vary in familiarity (informational and behavioral) and [[Valence (psychology)|valence]].&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Other Communication-Relevant Preinteraction Factors|Other communication-relevant preinteraction factors}}Other factors before interaction===
Individuals approach deceptive exchanges with factors such as expectancy, knowledge, goals or intentions and behaviors reflecting their communication competence. IDT posits that these factors influence the deceptive exchange.
:3. Compared with truth-tellers, deceivers engage in more strategic activity designed to manage information, behavior and image and have more nonstrategic arousal cues, negative and muted [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and non-involvement.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Effects of Preinteraction Features on Senders’ Initial Detection Apprehension and Deception Displays|Effects of preinteraction features on senders' initial detection apprehension and deception displays}}Effects on sender's deception and fear of detection===
IDT posits that factors before the interaction influence the sender's [[deception]] and fear of detection.
:4. Context moderates deception; increased interaction produces greater strategic activity (information, behavior and image management) and reduced nonstrategic activity (arousal or muted affect) over time.
:5. Initial expectations of honesty are related to the degree of interactivity and the relationship between sender and receiver.
:6. Deceivers' fear of detection and associated strategic activity are inversely related to expectations of honesty, a function of context and relationship quality.
:7. Goals and motivation influence behavior.
:8. As receivers' informational, behavioral and relational familiarity increase, deceivers have a greater fear of detection and exhibit more strategic information, behavior and image management and nonstrategic leakage behavior.
:9. Skilled senders convey a truthful demeanor, with more strategic behavior and less nonstrategic leakage, better than unskilled ones.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Effects of Preinteraction Features and Initial Interaction on Receiver Cognitions|Effects of preinteraction features and initial interaction on receiver cognitions}}Effects on receiver cognition===
IDT also posits that factors before the interaction, combined with initial behavior, affect receiver suspicion and detection accuracy.
:10. Receiver judgment of sender credibility is related to receiver truth biases, context interactivity, sender encoding skills and sender deviation from expected patterns.
:11. Detection accuracy is related to receiver truth biases, context interactivity, sender encoding skills, informational and behavioral familiarity, receiver decoding skills and sender deviation from expected patterns.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Iterative Interactional Patterns|Iterative interactional patterns}}Interaction patterns===
IDT describes receiver suspicion and sender reaction.
:12. Receiver suspicion is displayed in a combination of strategic and nonstrategic behavior.
:13. Senders perceive suspicion.
:14. Suspicion, perceived or actual, increases senders' strategic and nonstrategic behavior.
:15. Deception and suspicion displays change over time.
:16. Reciprocity is the predominant interaction pattern between senders and receivers during interpersonal deception.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

==={{anchor|Postinteraction Outcomes|Postinteraction outcomes}}Outcomes===

IDT posits that interaction between sender and receiver influences how credible the receiver thinks the sender is and how suspicious the sender thinks the receiver is.
:17. Receiver detection accuracy, bias, and judgments of sender credibility after an interaction are functions of receiver cognition (suspicion and truth bias), receiver decoding skill and final sender behavior.
:18. Sender perceived deception success is a function of final sender cognition (perceived suspicion) and receiver behavior.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Receiver's Role in IDT|Receiver's role in IDT}}Receiver's role==
Although most people believe they can spot deception, IDT posits that they cannot. A deceiver must manages his or her verbal and nonverbal cues to ensure that what they are saying appears true. According to IDT, the more [[Social intelligence|socially aware]] a receiver is, the better he or she is at detecting deceit.

In a common social agreement, people are honest with one another and believe that others will be honest with them. If a deceiver begins a deceptive exchange with an accurate statement, the statement may induce the receiver to believe the rest of the deceiver's story is also true. The sender prepares the receiver to accept his or her information as truth, even if some (or all) of the dialogue is false. If the sender repeats the same tactic, the receiver will become more aware that the sender is lying.&lt;ref name="Buller and Burgoon, 1996"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Emotion in IDT}}Emotion==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:20160425153327-emotions-mosaic-different-expressions-faces-angry-mad-sad-smile-feelings.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;
Emotion plays a central role in IDT as a motivation and result of deception. Emotion can motivate deception, with the sender relying on relevant knowledge (informational, relational and behavioral familiarity)&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve goals such as self-gratification, avoiding a negative emotional outcome or creating a negative emotional outcome for the target of deception. Emotion can be a result of deception, since a physical response occurs in the sender (usually arousal and negative affect).&lt;ref&gt;Ekman &amp; Friensen, 1969; Zuckerman, DePaulo et al., 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leakage===
Leakage in deception is manifested most overtly in nonverbal signals; studies indicate that over 90 percent of emotional meaning is communicated non-verbally. Humans are sensitive to body signals, and communication is often ambiguous; something is communicated verbally and its opposite non-verbally. Leakage occurs when nonverbal signals betray the true content of a contradictory verbal message. Facial expression is difficult to read, and the [[Facial Action Coding System]] (FACS) is a means of uncovering deception. Small facial movements, known as micro-expressions, can be detected in this system using action units.

==={{anchor|Micro-expressions and Action Units}}Micro-expressions and action units===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Micro expressions.png|thumb]] --&gt;
Action units (AUs) can be examined frame by frame, since these micro-expressions are often rapid. [[Paul Ekman]]’s research in facial deception has found several constants in certain expressions, with the action units relating to lip-corner pulling (AU12) and cheek-raising (AU6) qualifiers for happiness in most people. Brow-lowering (AU4) and lip-stretching (AU20) are disqualifiers for happiness. Emotional leakage appears in these fleeting expressions.

A study of Ekman’s observations revealed that AUs appear in over 90 percent of facial expressions. Despite the progress of the facial deception theory and the use of video to capture micro-expressions, it is more practical to search the body for signs of betraying what the sender is trying to communicate. The following signs may indicate deception: 
*Increased, rapid, or strained blinking
*Dilation of the pupils
*Pitch change in voice
*Increased tempo or rate of speech
*Hesitations more pronounced
*Nonverbal and verbal inconsistencies
*Sweating

University of Virginia social psychologist [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/experts/bella-depaulo-phd Bella DePaulo] has said, "Facial cues&amp;nbsp;... are indeed faking cues".{{cn|date=July 2015}}

====Facial expression{{anchor|Facial Expression}}====
Seven basic emotions are communicated through facial expression: [[anger]], [[fear]], [[sadness]], [[joy]], [[disgust]], [[surprise (emotion)|surprise]] and [[contempt]]. These emotions are recognized universally. These expressions are innate of develop through [[socialization]].

Cultures have a variety of rules governing the social use of facial expression; for example, the Japanese discourage the display of negative emotions. Individuals may find it difficult to control facial expression, and the face may "leak" information about how they feel.

====Gaze====
{{Main|Eye contact}}
People use eye contact to indicate threat, intimacy and interest. Eye contact is used to regulate [[turn-taking]] in conversation, and indicates how interested the listener (receiver) is in what the speaker is saying. Receivers make eye contact about 70–75 percent of the time, with each contact averaging 7.8&amp;nbsp;seconds.

====Gesture====
[[Gestures]] are among the most culture-specific forms of nonverbal communication, and may lead to misinterpretation. Involuntary self-touching, such as touching the face, scratching, gripping the hands together or putting the hands in (or near) the mouth, occur when people experience intense emotions such as depression&lt;ref&gt;https://psychcentral.com/disorders/depression/&lt;/ref&gt;, elation or extreme anxiety.

Ekman and Friesen demonstrated gesture leakage by showing films of a depressed woman to a group, which was asked to judge the woman's mood. Those shown only the woman's face thought she was happy and cheerful, while the group who saw only her body thought she was tense and disturbed.

====Touch====
Touch can reassure and indicate understanding. Humans touch one another in sexual intimacy, affiliation and understanding; in greetings and farewells; as an act of aggression, and to demonstrate dominance. According to Argyle (1996), there "appear to be definite rules which permit certain kinds of touch, between certain people, on certain occasions only. Bodily contact outside these narrow limits is unacceptable".

=={{anchor|Criticism of IDT}}Criticism==
DePaulo, Ansfield and Bell questioned IDT: "We can find the 'why' question in Buller and Burgoon's synthesis. There is no intriguing riddle or puzzle that needs to be solved, and no central explanatory mechanism is ever described."&lt;ref&gt;DePaulo et al., 1996, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Although they praised Buller and Burgoon's 18 propositions as a comprehensive description of the timeline of deceptive interactions, they said the propositions lacked the interconnectedness and predictive power of a unifying theory. DePaulo ''et al.'' criticized IDT for failing to distinguish between interactive communication (which emphasizes the situational and contextual aspects of communicative exchanges) from interpersonal communication, which emphasizes exchanges in which the sender and receiver make psychological predictions about the other's behavior based on specific prior knowledge; this conceptual ambiguity limited IDT's explanatory power.&lt;ref&gt;DePaulo et al., 1996; see also Stiff, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==David Buller and Judee Burgoon==
Buller and Burgoon have conducted over two dozen experiments in which they ask participants to deceive another person, and the researchers have found that people often find themselves in situations where they make statements that are not completely honest "to avoid hurting or offending another person, to emphasize their best qualities, to avoid getting into a conflict, or to speed up or slow down a relationship".&lt;ref name="afirstlook.com"&gt;http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/interpersdecep.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Experiments}}Experiment==
Buller and Burgoon asked participants to put themselves in the following situation:
"You've been dating Pat for nearly three years and feel quite close in your relationship. Since Pat goes to a different school upstate, the two of you have agreed to date other people. Nevertheless, Pat is quite jealous and possessive. During the school year you see Pat only occasionally, but you call each other every Sunday and talk for over an hour. On Friday one of your friends invites you to a party on Saturday night, but the party is 'couples only' so you need a date. There's no way that Pat could come down for the weekend. You decide to ask someone from your class who you've been attracted to so that you can go to the party. The two of you go and have a great time. On Sunday afternoon, there's a knock on your door and it's Pat. Pat walks in and says, 'Decided to come down and surprise you, tried calling you all last night, but you weren't around. What were you doing?{{'"}} The researchers listed three possible responses: lying ("I was at the library getting ready for my theory exam"), telling part of the truth while omitting important details ("Went to a party at a friend's apartment") or being intentionally vague or evasive ("Went out for a while").&lt;ref name="afirstlook.com"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Interpersonal Deception and Online Dating}}Online dating==
A [[Qualitative research|qualitative study]] investigated deception in online dating. The study focused on four questions: (1) About what characteristics are online daters deceptive? (2) What motivation do online daters have for their deception of others in the online-dating environment? (3) What perceptions do online daters have about other daters' deceit towards them in the online-dating environment? (4) How does deception affect romantic relationships formed in the online-dating environment? In an online survey, data was collected from 15 open-ended questions. The study had 52 participants, ranging in age from 21 to 37, and found that most online daters consider themselves (and others) mostly honest in their online self-presentation. Online daters who used deception were motivated to do so by the desire to attract partners and project a positive self-image. Daters were willing to overlook deception in others if they viewed the dishonesty as a slight exaggeration or a characteristic of little value to the dater. Despite deception, participants believe that the online-dating environment can develop successful romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Wagner|first=Lyndsey|type=Master's thesis|title=Interpersonal Relationships and Online Dating|url=http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/masters/210/|publisher=[[Liberty University]]|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3711">[[Image:Image-Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences.jpg|thumb|right|Sideviews of the Center. Façade facing Bosphorus.]]
The '''Istanbul Center for Mathematical Sciences''' ('''IMBM''') is an independent center for mathematics situated in the South Campus of [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Istanbul]], in close proximity to the Mathematics  Department. The center was initiated by several major universities in Istanbul and was formally inaugurated in 2006. The center aims to host and encourage the mathematical research and the interaction of researchers.

==Background==
IMBM is currently the only center for mathematics in Turkey. The first idea was brought by Betül Tanbay in 2003, then the chairwoman of the Mathematics Department of Boğaziçi University to its rector Sabih Tansal who immediately allocated a site. The center was opened in 2006 by the rectors of three leading universities in Istanbul, Boğaziçi University (state), [[Koç University]] (private) and [[Sabancı University]] (private). At that time, the three rectors were all mathematicians ([[Ayşe Soysal]], [[Atilla Aşkar]] and [[Tosun Terzioğlu]] respectively) which made the contract easier. The universities ensured to give academic and from time to time small amounts of financial support (an account of the history can be found in [[Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society|EMS Newsletter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ems-ph.org/journals/newsletter/pdf/2010-09-77.pdf  | title = EMS Newsletter September 2010, page 49}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

IMBM is administrated by a management committee, a scientific steering committee, and an international scientific advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.imbm.org.tr/governance.htm  | title = IMBM Governance Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific advisory board consists of the following mathematicians: [[David Mumford]] (Brown and Harvard Universities), 
[[Victor Kac]] (MIT),
[[Selman Akbulut]]  (Michigan State University),
[[Gilles Pisier]] (Paris 6 and Texas A&amp;M ),
[[Edriss Titi]]  (Weizmann Institute and University of California Irvine).

David Mumford accepted to participate in the Scientific Advisory Board during his visit to Turkey back in 2003. He has reported his personal observations in Notices of the AMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200505/comm-mumford.pdf  | title = David Mumford's observations in Notices of the AMS, Volume 52 Number 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening seminar of IMBM was delivered by [[Dan Goldston]], [[János Pintz]] and [[Cem Yalçın Yıldırım]] in 2006. Since then, the center hosted many activities with distinguished participants.

Resources of IMBM come from endowment income, personal and institutional grants and collaboration agreements and gifts.

== Buildings==
There are two buildings of the center. Both have an excellent view of the [[Bosphorus]] strait. The buildings had been in very bad condition and were brought to life by the initiative of Betül Tanbay (Boğaziçi University Mathematics Department), the first codirector of IMBM. The first floor of the main building consists of three offices with a modest library and computers. A 40-person seminar room is on the second floor.

There are four bedrooms of the center, accommodating up to six people. Two bedrooms are located in the last floor of the main building. The other two are located in a self-contained one-storey house next to the main building, which has, besides, a kitchen and a living room.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Keywords''' are the words that academics use to reveal the internal structure of an author's 
reasoning.  While they are used primarily for [[rhetoric]], they are also used in a strictly 
grammatical sense for structural composition, reasoning, and comprehension.  Indeed, they are 
an essential part of any language.

There are many different types of keyword categories including: Conclusion, Continuation, Contrast,
Emphasis, Evidence, Illustration and Sequence. Each category serves its own function, as do the keywords
inside of a given category.

When someone uses a search engine, they type in one or more words describing what they are looking for:
'Norwich florist' or 'cheap holidays Greece', for example. These words or phrases are known as keywords.

==Corpus linguistic keywords==
In [[corpus linguistics]], key words are words that appear with statistically unusual frequency in a text
or a corpus of texts. They are identified by software that compares a word-list of the text with a word-list
based on a larger reference corpus. A suitable term for the phenomenon is [[keyness]]. The procedure used,
for example by [[WordSmith]], to list key words and phrases and plot where they appear in texts. These items
are very often of interest—particularly those human readers would not likely notice, such as prepositions,
time adverbs, and pronouns.

==Teaching Keywords==
One method used to teach keywords is called the "keyword method." It involves taking complex keywords that students do not know very well, and makes them into easier words. The easier words must have something to do with the complex keywords so students can correlate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uberti|first1=H. Z.|last2=Scruggs|first2=T.

A '''legal debate''' is a discussion between [[lawyers]], [[legal academics]], [[jurists]], [[politicians]], and others who might have an interest or expertise in the [[law]], about a particular legal issue.

== Overview ==
Legal debates can take many forms, and do not necessarily need to be face-to-face debates.  Most legal debates take place on paper—judges within a court, for example, might debate each other most effectively when the court publishes a decision.  Legal debates include (but are not limited to) the following:

*'''Debates between judges.'''  These debates, as well, will often occur face to face during judicial conferences, but they find their most prominent voice in written opinions.  Splintered U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions present a prominent example.  [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissents with the majority epitomize the nature of judicial legal debate—a debate that often centers around the proper means of interpreting federal statutes or the Constitution.
*'''Debate between politicians.'''  An example of this debate is that between the [[President of the United States]] and the [[United States Congress]] over the ability of the executive power to issue clandestine wiretaps without seeking a warrant.  The legal debate at issue is the scope of executive power vis-a-vis the other branches of government.
*'''General debate within society.'''  Societies always debate the legal order.  The process of electing politicians and lobbying is a form of legal debate: the majority tends to become part of a coalition that agrees on the laws that will be implemented.

== Contemporary issues in legal debates ==
Debates in Western societies often follow broad themes, including

*The balance between state power and civil liberties
*The proper breadth of civil liberties relative to social norms and moral expectations

In the United States, legal debates over the past decade have concerned the following important topics:

*The [[right to privacy]], including the right to have an [[abortion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Editors |title= The Abortion Debate: Finding a Forum |journal=Policy Today  |date=2006-06-01 |url=http://www.policytoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=68&amp;Itemid=2 |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The balance between civil rights and the need for greater security after September 11, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Godoy |first=Maria |title=NSA Wiretapping: The Legal Debate |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2008-02-23 |url=https://www.npr.org/news/specials/nsawiretap/legality.html |accessdate= 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The proper method of interpreting the Constitution
*[[Affirmative Action]]
*[[Welfare reform]]#
*The right to a child

In general, the variety of debates—ranging from basic social policy to grander theory about constitutional design and democratic theory—suggests that legal debates overlap with several other social institutions and expectations.

[[Image:201 Penelope light curve.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Light curve of the asteroid [[201 Penelope]] based on images taken on 6 October 2006 at [[Mount John University Observatory]]. Shows just over one full [[rotation period|rotation]], which lasts 3.7474 hours.]]

In [[astronomy]], a '''light curve''' is a graph of light intensity of a [[celestial object]] or region, as a function of time. The light is usually in a particular frequency interval or [[Frequency band|band]]. Light curves can be periodic, as in the case of [[eclipsing binary|eclipsing binaries]], [[Cepheid variable]]s, other periodic variables, and [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit photometry|transiting]] [[extrasolar planets]], or [[aperiodic]], like the light curve of a [[nova]], a [[cataclysmic variable star]], a [[supernova]] or a [[Gravitational microlensing|microlensing event]] or binary as observed during [[occultation]] events. The study of the light curve, together with other observations, can yield considerable information about the physical process that produces it or constrain the physical theories about it.

== Variable stars ==
{{main|Variable star}}
[[File:Delta Cephei lightcurve.jpg|thumb|left|Light curve of [[δ Cephei]] showing [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] versus pulsation [[phase (waves)|phase]]]]

Graphs of the [[apparent magnitude]] of a variable star over time are commonly used to visualise and analyse their behaviour. Although the categorisation of variable star types is increasingly done from their spectral properties, the amplitudes, periods, and regularity of their brightness changes are still important factors. Some types such as [[Cepheid variable|Cepheids]] have extremely regular light curves with exactly the same period, amplitude, and shape in each cycle. Others such as [[Mira variable]]s have somewhat less regular light curves with large amplitudes of several magnitudes, while the [[semiregular variable]]s are less regular still and have smaller amplitudes.&lt;ref name=gcvs/&gt;

The shapes of variable star light curves give valuable information about the underlying physical processes producing the brightness changes. For eclipsing variables, the shape of the light curve indicates the degree of totality, the relative sizes of the stars, and their relative surface brightnesses.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt; It may also show the [[Eccentricity (astronomy)|eccentricity]] of the orbit and [[Ellipsoidal variable|distortions in the shape]] of the two stars.&lt;ref name=kron/&gt;  For pulsating stars, the amplitude or period of the pulsations can be related to the luminosity of the star, and the light curve shape can be an indicator of the pulsation mode.&lt;ref name=wood/&gt;

=== Supernovae ===
{{main|Supernova}}
[[File:Comparative supernova type light curves.png|thumb|left|Comparative [[supernova]] type light curves]]

Light curves from [[supernova]]e can be indicative of the type of supernova. Although supernova types are defined on the basis of their spectra, each has typical light curve shapes. [[Type I supernova]]e have light curves with a sharp [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] and gradually decline, while [[Type II supernova]]e have less sharp maxima. Light curves are helpful for classification of faint supernovae and for the determination of sub-types. For example, the type II-P (for plateau) have similar spectra to the type II-L (linear) but are distinguished by a light curve where the decline flattens out for several weeks or months before resuming its fade.&lt;ref name=hyperphysics/&gt;
{{clear|left}}

== {{anchor|Planetology}} Planetary astronomy ==
{{main|Planetary science}}

In [[planetary science]], a light curve can be used to derive the [[rotation period]] of a [[minor planet]], [[natural satellite|moon]], or [[comet]] nucleus. From the [[Earth]] there is often no way to resolve a small object in the [[Solar System]], even in the most powerful of [[telescope]]s, since the apparent angular size of the object is smaller than one pixel in the detector. Thus, astronomers measure the amount of light produced by an object as a function of time (the light curve). The time separation of peaks in the light curve gives an estimate of the rotational period of the object. The difference between the maximum and minimum brightnesses (the [[amplitude]] of the light curve) can be due to the shape of the object, or to bright and dark areas on its surface. For example, an asymmetrical asteroid's light curve generally has more pronounced peaks, while a more spherical object's light curve will be flatter.&lt;ref name="lc"/&gt; This allows astronomers to infer information about the shape and spin (but not size) of asteroids.

=== Asteroid lightcurve database ===

==== {{anchor|LCDB quality code}} Light curve quality code ====

The ''Asteroid Lightcurve Database'' (LCDB) of the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) uses a numeric code to assess the quality of a period solution for minor planet light curves (it does not necessarily assess the actual underlying data). Its quality code parameter "U" ranges from 0 (incorrect) to 3 (well-defined):&lt;ref name="LCDB"/&gt;
* ''U = 0'' → Result later proven incorrect
* ''U = 1'' → Result based on fragmentary light curve(s), may be completely wrong.
* ''U = 2'' → Result based on less than full coverage. Period may be wrong by 30 percent or ambiguous. 
* ''U = 3'' → Secure result within the precision given. No ambiguity.
* ''U = n.a.'' → Not available. Incomplete or inconclusive result.

A trailing plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) is also used to indicate a slightly better or worse quality than the unsigned value.&lt;ref name="LCDB" /&gt;

=== Occultation light curves ===
{{Further|Occultation#Occultations by minor planets}}
[[File:LightCurve AsteroidOccultation.png|thumb|Light Curve of the asteroid 1247 Dysona occulting 4UCAC 174-171272, showing instantaneous disappearance and reappearance. Duration is 6.48 seconds.]]

The [[Asteroid occultation|occultation]] light curve is often characterised as binary, where the light from the star is terminated instantaneously, remains constant for the duration, and is reinstated instantaneously. The duration is equivalent to the length of a [[Chord (astronomy)|chord]] across the occulting body.

Circumstances where the transitions are not instantaneous are;
* when either the occulting or occulted body are double , e.g. a [[double star]] or [[Binary asteroid|double asteroid]], then a step light curve is observed.

== Light curve inversion ==
Light curve inversion is a mathematical technique used to model the surfaces of rotating objects from their brightness variations. This can be used to effectively image [[starspot]]s or asteroid surface [[albedo]]s.&lt;ref name=harmon/&gt;&lt;ref name=roettenbacher/&gt;

== Microlensing ==
{{main|Gravitational microlensing}}

Microlensing is a process where relatively small and low-mass astronomical objects cause a brief small increase in the brightness of a more distant object. This is caused by the small [[general relativity|relativistic effect]] as larger [[gravitational lens]]es, but allows the detection and analysis of otherwise-invisible stellar and planetary mass objects. The properties of these objects can be inferred from the shape of the lensing light curve. For example, [[PA-99-N2]] is a microlensing event that may have been due to a star in the [[Andromeda galaxy]] that has an [[exoplanet]].&lt;ref name=haugan/&gt;

The '''Buxtehude-Werke-Verzeichnis''' ("Buxtehude Works Catalogue" , commonly abbreviated to '''BuxWV''') is the catalogue and the numbering system used to identify [[music]]al works by the German-Danish [[Baroque]] composer [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] (c. 1637 – 9 May 1707). It was compiled by Georg Karstädt and published in 1974 as ''Thematisch-Systematisches Verzeichnis der Musikalischen Werke von Dietrich Buxtehude''. The second edition, published in 1985, contains minor additions and corrections. The catalogue is organized thematically, not chronologically, and contains 275 individual pieces. The ''Anhang'' ("Appendix") adds 15 spurious and falsely attributed works.

The fourteen [[trio sonata]]s (BuxWV 252&amp;ndash;265) were the only works published during Buxtehude's lifetime. Originally issued in two volumes, the first seven are now commonly referred to as Buxtehude's opus 1 and the next seven as opus 2.

===Canzonetta for keyboard or organ (225)===
The keyboard canzonetta in A minor, BuxWV 225, was found just before the publication and therefore could not be inserted in the catalogue properly. This is why it does not appear with other canzonas and canzonettas and is in the end of the list of organ works.

[[Pulse compression]] is an example of matched filtering. It is so called because impulse response is matched to input pulse signals.  Two-dimensional matched filters are commonly used in [[image processing]], e.g., to improve SNR for X-ray.

== Derivation of the matched filter ==
=== Derivation via matrix algebra ===

The following section derives the matched filter for a [[discrete-time system]].  The derivation for a [[continuous-time|continuous-time system]] is similar, with summations replaced with integrals.

The matched filter is the linear filter, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, that maximizes the output [[signal-to-noise ratio]].

:&lt;math&gt;\ y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h[n-k] x[k].&lt;/math&gt;

Though we most often express filters as the [[impulse response]] of convolution systems, as above (see [[LTI system theory]]), it is easiest to think of the matched filter in the context of the [[inner product]], which we will see shortly.

We can derive the linear filter that maximizes output signal-to-noise ratio by invoking a geometric argument. The intuition behind the matched filter relies on correlating the received signal (a vector) with a filter (another vector) that is parallel with the signal, maximizing the inner product. This enhances the signal. When we consider the additive stochastic noise, we have the additional challenge of minimizing the output due to noise by choosing a filter that is orthogonal to the noise.

Let us formally define the problem. We seek a filter, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, such that we maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio, where the output is the inner product of the filter and the observed signal &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Our observed signal consists of the desirable signal &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and additive noise &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ x=s+v.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Let us define the [[covariance matrix]] of the noise, reminding ourselves that this matrix has [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian symmetry]], a property that will become useful in the derivation:

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_v=E\{ vv^\mathrm{H} \}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v^\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[conjugate transpose]] of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[Expected value|expectation]].
Let us call our output, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, the inner product of our filter and the observed signal such that

:&lt;math&gt;\ y = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} h^*[k] x[k] = h^\mathrm{H}x = h^\mathrm{H}s + h^\mathrm{H}v = y_s + y_v.&lt;/math&gt;

We now define the signal-to-noise ratio, which is our objective function, to be the ratio of the power of the output due to the desired signal to the power of the output due to the noise:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{|y_s|^2}{E\{|y_v|^2\}}.&lt;/math&gt;

We rewrite the above:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{|h^\mathrm{H}s|^2}{E\{|h^\mathrm{H}v|^2\}}.&lt;/math&gt;

We wish to maximize this quantity by choosing &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;. Expanding the denominator of our objective function, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ E\{ |h^\mathrm{H}v|^2 \} = E\{ (h^\mathrm{H}v){(h^\mathrm{H}v)}^\mathrm{H} \} = h^\mathrm{H} E\{vv^\mathrm{H}\} h = h^\mathrm{H}R_vh.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Now, our &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}&lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{ |h^\mathrm{H}s|^2 }{ h^\mathrm{H}R_vh }.&lt;/math&gt;

We will rewrite this expression with some matrix manipulation. The reason for this seemingly counterproductive measure will become evident shortly. Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry of the covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt;, we can write

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{ | {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) |^2 }
                  { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) },&lt;/math&gt;

We would like to find an upper bound on this expression. To do so, we first recognize a form of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\ |a^\mathrm{H}b|^2 \leq (a^\mathrm{H}a)(b^\mathrm{H}b),\, &lt;/math&gt;

which is to say that the square of the inner product of two vectors can only be as large as the product of the individual inner products of the vectors. This concept returns to the intuition behind the matched filter: this upper bound is achieved when the two vectors &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are parallel. We resume our derivation by expressing the upper bound on our &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}&lt;/math&gt; in light of the geometric inequality above:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{ | {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) |^2 }
                  { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) }
             \leq
             \frac{ \left[
             			{(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h)
             		\right]
             		\left[
             			{(R_v^{-1/2}s)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s)
             		\right] }
                  { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) }.
             &lt;/math&gt;

Our valiant matrix manipulation has now paid off. We see that the expression for our upper bound can be greatly simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{ | {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) |^2 }
                  { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) }
             \leq s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s.
             &lt;/math&gt;

We can achieve this upper bound if we choose,

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_v^{1/2}h = \alpha R_v^{-1/2}s&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary real number. To verify this, we plug into our expression for the output &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{ | {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) |^2 }
                  { {(R_v^{1/2}h)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{1/2}h) }
           = \frac{ \alpha^2 | {(R_v^{-1/2}s)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) |^2 }
                  { \alpha^2  {(R_v^{-1/2}s)}^\mathrm{H} (R_v^{-1/2}s) }
           = \frac{ | s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s |^2 }
                  { s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s }
           = s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s.
           &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, our optimal matched filter is

:&lt;math&gt;\ h = \alpha R_v^{-1}s.&lt;/math&gt;

We often choose to normalize the expected value of the power of the filter output due to the noise to unity. That is, we constrain

:&lt;math&gt;\ E\{ |y_v|^2 \} = 1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

This constraint implies a value of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for which we can solve:

:&lt;math&gt;\ E\{ |y_v|^2 \} = \alpha^2 s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s = 1,&lt;/math&gt;

yielding

:&lt;math&gt;\ \alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s}},&lt;/math&gt;

giving us our normalized filter,

:&lt;math&gt;\ h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s}} R_v^{-1}s.&lt;/math&gt;

If we care to write the impulse response of the filter for the convolution system, it is simply the complex conjugate time reversal of &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;.

Though we have derived the matched filter in discrete time, we can extend the concept to continuous-time systems if we replace &lt;math&gt;R_v&lt;/math&gt; with the continuous-time [[autocorrelation]] function of the noise, assuming a continuous signal &lt;math&gt;s(t)&lt;/math&gt;, continuous noise &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and a continuous filter &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Derivation via Lagrangian ===

Alternatively, we may solve for the matched filter by solving our maximization problem with a Lagrangian. Again, the matched filter endeavors to maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio (&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}&lt;/math&gt;) of a filtered deterministic signal in stochastic additive noise. The observed sequence, again, is

:&lt;math&gt;\ x = s + v,\,&lt;/math&gt;

with the noise covariance matrix,

:&lt;math&gt;\ R_v = E\{vv^\mathrm{H}\}.\, &lt;/math&gt;

The signal-to-noise ratio is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{|y_s|^2}{ E\{|y_v|^2\} }.&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the expression in the numerator, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\ |y_s|^2 = {y_s}^\mathrm{H} y_s = h^\mathrm{H} s s^\mathrm{H} h.\, &lt;/math&gt;

and in the denominator,

:&lt;math&gt;\ E\{|y_v|^2\} = E\{ {y_v}^\mathrm{H} y_v \} = E\{ h^\mathrm{H} v v^\mathrm{H} h \} = h^\mathrm{H} R_v h.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The signal-to-noise ratio becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR} = \frac{h^\mathrm{H} s s^\mathrm{H} h}{ h^\mathrm{H} R_v h }.&lt;/math&gt;

If we now constrain the denominator to be 1, the problem of maximizing &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SNR}&lt;/math&gt; is reduced to maximizing the numerator. We can then formulate the problem using a [[Lagrange multipliers|Lagrange multiplier]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\ h^\mathrm{H} R_v h = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \mathcal{L} = h^\mathrm{H} s s^\mathrm{H} h + \lambda (1 - h^\mathrm{H} R_v h ) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \nabla_{h^*} \mathcal{L} = s s^\mathrm{H} h - \lambda R_v h = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ (s s^\mathrm{H}) h = \lambda R_v h &lt;/math&gt;

which we recognize as a generalized eigenvalue problem

:&lt;math&gt;\ h^\mathrm{H} (s s^\mathrm{H}) h = \lambda h^\mathrm{H} R_v h. &lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;s s^\mathrm{H}&lt;/math&gt; is of unit rank, it has only one nonzero eigenvalue. It can be shown that this eigenvalue equals

:&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda_{\max} = s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s, &lt;/math&gt;

yielding the following optimal matched filter

:&lt;math&gt;\ h = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s^\mathrm{H} R_v^{-1} s}} R_v^{-1} s. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the same result found in the previous subsection.

== The matched filter as a least squares estimator ==

=== Derivation ===

Matched filtering can also be interpreted as a least squares estimator for the optimal location and scaling of a given model or template. Once again, let the observed sequence be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\ x_k = s_k + v_k,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v_k&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated zero mean noise. The signal &lt;math&gt;s_k&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be a scaled and shifted version of a known model sequence &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ s_k = \mu_0\cdot f_{k-j_0}&lt;/math&gt;

We want to find optimal estimates &lt;math&gt;j^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu^*&lt;/math&gt; for the unknown shift &lt;math&gt;j_0&lt;/math&gt; and scaling &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; by minimizing the least squares residual between the observed sequence &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; and a "probing sequence" &lt;math&gt;h_{j-k}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ j^*,\mu^* = \arg\min_{j,\mu} \sum_k \left(x_k - \mu\cdot h_{j-k}\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The appropriate &lt;math&gt;h_{j-k}&lt;/math&gt; will later turn out to be the matched filter, but is as yet unspecified. Expanding &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; and the square within the sum yields

:&lt;math&gt;\ j^*,\mu^* = \arg\min_{j,\mu}\left[ \sum_k (s_k+v_k)^2 + \mu^2\sum_k h_{j-k}^2 - 2\mu\sum_k  s_k h_{j-k} - 2\mu\sum_k  v_k h_{j-k}\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

The first term in brackets is a constant (since the observed signal is given) and has no influence on the optimal solution. The last term has constant expected value because the noise is uncorrelated and has zero mean. We can therefore drop both terms from the optimization. After reversing the sign, we obtain the equivalent optimization problem

:&lt;math&gt;\ j^*,\mu^* = \arg\max_{j,\mu}\left[ 2\mu\sum_k  s_k h_{j-k} - \mu^2\sum_k h_{j-k}^2\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Setting the derivative w.r.t. &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to zero gives an analytic solution for &lt;math&gt;\mu^*&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \mu^* = \frac{\sum_k  s_k h_{j-k}}{\sum_k h_{j-k}^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting this into our objective function yields a reduced maximization problem for just &lt;math&gt;j^*&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\ j^* = \arg\max_j\frac{\left(\sum_k  s_k h_{j-k}\right)^2}{\sum_k h_{j-k}^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

The numerator can be upper-bounded by means of the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\ \frac{\left(\sum_k  s_k h_{j-k}\right)^2}{\sum_k h_{j-k}^2} \le \frac{\sum_k  s_k^2 \cdot \sum_k h_{j-k}^2}{\sum_k h_{j-k}^2} = \sum_k  s_k^2 = \mathrm{const}&lt;/math&gt;.

The optimization problem assumes its maximum when equality holds in this expression. According to the properties of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, this is only possible when

:&lt;math&gt;\ h_{j-k}=\nu \cdot s_k = \kappa\cdot f_{k-j_0}&lt;/math&gt;.

for arbitrary non-zero constants &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;, and the optimal solution is obtained at &lt;math&gt;j^*=j_0&lt;/math&gt; as desired. Thus, our "probing sequence" &lt;math&gt;h_{j-k}&lt;/math&gt; must be proportional to the signal model &lt;math&gt;f_{k-j_0}&lt;/math&gt;, and the convenient choice &lt;math&gt;\kappa=1&lt;/math&gt; yields the matched filter

:&lt;math&gt;\ h_{k}=f_{-k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the filter is the mirrored signal model. This ensures that the operation &lt;math&gt;\sum_k  x_k h_{j-k}&lt;/math&gt; to be applied in order to find the optimum is indeed the convolution between the observed sequence &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; and the matched filter &lt;math&gt;h_k&lt;/math&gt;. The filtered sequence assumes its maximum at the position where the observed sequence &lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt; best matches (in a least-squares sense) the signal model &lt;math&gt;f_k&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Implications ===

The matched filter may be derived in a variety of ways,&lt;ref name="turin" /&gt; but as a special case of a [[least squares|least squares procedure]] it may also be interpreted as a [[maximum likelihood]] method in the context of a (coloured) [[Gaussian noise]] model and the associated [[Whittle likelihood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Choudhuri|first1=N.|last2=Ghosal|first2=S.|last3=Roy|first3=A.|title=Contiguity of the Whittle measure for a Gaussian time series|journal=Biometrika|volume=91|issue=4|year=2004|pages=211–218|doi=10.1093/biomet/91.1.211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the transmitted signal possessed ''no'' unknown parameters (like time-of-arrival, amplitude,...), then the matched filter would, according to the [[Neyman–Pearson lemma]], minimize the error probability. However, since the exact signal generally is determined by unknown parameters that effectively are estimated (or ''fitted'') in the filtering process, the matched filter constitutes a ''generalized maximum likelihood'' (test-) statistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mood|first1=A. M.|last2=Graybill|first2=F. A.|last3=Boes|first3=D. C.|title=Introduction to the theory of statistics|edition=3rd|publisher=McGraw-Hill|place=New York|chapter=IX. ''Tests of hypotheses''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filtered time series may then be interpreted as (proportional to) the [[profile likelihood]], the maximized conditional likelihood as a function of the time parameter.&lt;ref name="roever"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Röver|first=C.|title=Student-t based filter for robust signal detection|journal=Physical Review D|volume=84|issue=12|year=2011|pages=122004|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.84.122004|arxiv=1109.0442|bibcode=2011PhRvD..84l2004R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implies in particular that the [[type I and type II errors|error probability]] (in the sense of Neyman and Pearson, i.e., concerning maximization of the detection probability for a given false-alarm probability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neyman|first1=J.|last2=Pearson|first2=E. S.|title=On the problem of the most efficient tests of statistical hypotheses|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A|volume=231|issue=694–706|year=1933|pages=289–337|doi=10.1098/rsta.1933.0009|bibcode=1933RSPTA.231..289N}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is not necessarily optimal.
What is commonly referred to as the ''[[Signal-to-noise ratio|Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)]]'', which is supposed to be maximized by a matched filter, in this context corresponds to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2\log(\mathcal{L})}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the (conditionally) maximized likelihood ratio.&lt;ref name="roever" /&gt; {{refn|group=nb|The common reference to ''SNR'' has in fact been criticized as somewhat misleading: "''The interesting feature of this approach is that theoretical perfection is attained without aiming consciously at a maximum signal/noise ratio. As the matter of quite incidental interest, it happens that the operation [...] does maximize the peak signal/noise ratio, but this fact plays no part whatsoever in the present theory. Signal/noise ratio is not a measure of information [...].''" ([[Philip Woodward|Woodward]], 1953;&lt;ref name="woodward" /&gt; Sec.5.1).}}

The construction of the matched filter is based on a ''known'' [[power spectral density|noise spectrum]]. In reality, however, the noise spectrum is usually [[Spectral density estimation|estimated]] from data and hence only known up to a limited precision. For the case of an uncertain spectrum, the matched filter may be generalized to a more robust iterative procedure with favourable properties also in non-Gaussian noise.&lt;ref name="roever" /&gt;

== Frequency-domain interpretation ==

When viewed in the frequency domain, it is evident that the matched filter applies the greatest weighting to spectral components exhibiting the greatest signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., large weight where noise is relatively low, and vice versa).  In general this requires a non-flat frequency response, but the associated "distortion" is no cause for concern in situations such as [[radar]] and [[digital communications]], where the original waveform is known and the objective is the detection of this signal against the background noise. On the technical side, the matched filter is a ''weighted least squares'' method based on the ([[heteroscedasticity|heteroscedastic]]) frequency-domain data (where the "weights" are determined via the noise spectrum, see also previous section), or equivalently, a ''least squares'' method applied to the [[whitening transformation|whitened]] data.

== Examples ==
=== Matched filter in radar and sonar ===

Matched filters are often used in [[detection theory|signal detection]].&lt;ref name="woodward" /&gt; As an example, suppose that we wish to judge the distance of an object by reflecting a signal off it. We may choose to transmit a pure-tone sinusoid at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. We assume that our received signal is an attenuated and phase-shifted form of the transmitted signal with added noise.

To judge the distance of the object, we correlate the received signal with a matched filter, which, in the case of [[white noise|white (uncorrelated) noise]], is another pure-tone 1-Hz sinusoid. When the output of the matched filter system exceeds a certain threshold, we conclude with high probability that the received signal has been reflected off the object. Using the speed of propagation and the time that we first observe the reflected signal, we can estimate the distance of the object. If we change the shape of the pulse in a specially-designed way, the signal-to-noise ratio and the distance resolution can be even improved after matched filtering: this is a technique known as [[pulse compression]].

Additionally, matched filters can be used in parameter estimation problems (see [[estimation theory]]). To return to our previous example, we may desire to estimate the speed of the object, in addition to its position. To exploit the [[Doppler effect]], we would like to estimate the frequency of the received signal. To do so, we may correlate the received signal with several matched filters of sinusoids at varying frequencies. The matched filter with the highest output will reveal, with high probability, the frequency of the reflected signal and help us determine the speed of the object. This method is, in fact, a simple version of the [[discrete Fourier transform|discrete Fourier transform (DFT)]]. The DFT takes an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-valued complex input and correlates it with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; matched filters, corresponding to complex exponentials at &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; different frequencies, to yield &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; complex-valued numbers corresponding to the relative amplitudes and phases of the sinusoidal components (see [[Moving target indication]]).

=== Matched filter in digital communications ===

The matched filter is also used in communications. In the context of a communication system that sends binary messages from the transmitter to the receiver across a noisy channel, a matched filter can be used to detect the transmitted pulses in the noisy received signal.

[[File:Matched Filter Total System.jpg]]

Imagine we want to send the sequence "0101100100" coded in non polar [[Non-return-to-zero]] (NRZ) through a certain channel.

Mathematically, a sequence in NRZ code can be described as a sequence of unit pulses or shifted [[rectangular function|rect functions]], each pulse being weighted by +1 if the bit is "1" and by -1 if the bit is "0". Formally, the scaling factor for the &lt;math&gt;k^\mathrm{th}&lt;/math&gt; bit is,

:&lt;math&gt;\ a_k =
		\begin{cases}
			+1,  &amp; \mbox{if bit } k \mbox{ is 1}, \\
			-1, &amp; \mbox{if bit } k \mbox{ is 0}.
	  \end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;

We can represent our message, &lt;math&gt;M(t)&lt;/math&gt;, as the sum of shifted unit pulses:

:&lt;math&gt;\ M(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty a_k \times
							 \Pi \left(
				 							\frac{t-kT}{T}
				 		 			 \right).
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the time length of one bit.

Thus, the signal to be sent by the transmitter is

[[Image:Original message.svg|400px]]

If we model our noisy channel as an [[AWGN]] channel, white Gaussian noise is added to the signal. At the receiver end, for a Signal-to-noise ratio of 3&amp;nbsp;dB, this may look like:

[[Image:Received message.svg|400px]]

A first glance will not reveal the original transmitted sequence. There is a high power of noise relative to the power of the desired signal (i.e., there is a low [[signal-to-noise ratio]]). If the receiver were to sample this signal at the correct moments, the resulting binary message would possibly belie the original transmitted one.

To increase our signal-to-noise ratio, we pass the received signal through a matched filter. In this case, the filter should be matched to an NRZ pulse (equivalent to a "1" coded in NRZ code). Precisely, the impulse response of the ideal matched filter, assuming white (uncorrelated) noise should be a time-reversed complex-conjugated scaled version of the signal that we are seeking. We choose

:&lt;math&gt;\ h(t) = \Pi\left( \frac{t}{T} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, due to symmetry, the time-reversed complex conjugate of &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is in fact &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, allowing us to call &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; the impulse response of our matched filter convolution system.

After convolving with the correct matched filter, the resulting signal, &lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{filtered}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is,

:&lt;math&gt;\ M_\mathrm{filtered}(t) = M(t) * h(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; denotes convolution.

[[Image:Filtered message.svg|400px]]

Which can now be safely sampled by the receiver at the correct sampling instants, and compared to an appropriate threshold, resulting in a correct interpretation of the binary message.

The '''medieval art''' of the [[Western world]] covers a vast scope of time and place, over 1000 years of art in [[Western art history|Europe]], and at times the Middle East and North Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists' crafts, and the artists themselves.

Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty.  A generally accepted scheme includes the later phases of [[Early Christian art]], [[Migration Period art]], [[Byzantine art]], [[Insular art]], [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], [[Romanesque art]], and [[Gothic art]], as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming  [[nation]]s or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] or [[Norse art]].

Medieval art was produced in many media, and works survive in large numbers in [[sculpture]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[stained glass]], [[metalwork]] and [[mosaic]]s, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media such as [[fresco]] wall-paintings, work in precious metals or [[History of clothing and textiles#Medieval clothing and textiles|textile]]s, including [[tapestry]].  Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative arts]], such as metalwork, ivory carving, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[embroidery]] using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or [[monumental sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Heslop traces the beginning of the change to "around the twelfth century", quoted, 54; Zarnecki, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval art in Europe grew out of the artistic heritage of the [[Roman art|Roman Empire]] and the [[Christian iconography|iconographic traditions]] of the [[early Christian church]]. These sources were mixed with the vigorous "barbarian" artistic culture of Northern Europe to produce a remarkable artistic legacy. Indeed, the history of medieval art can be seen as the history of the interplay between the elements of [[classical art|classical]], early Christian and "barbarian" art.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger (throughout), Hinks (especially Part 1) and Henderson (Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 4) in particular are concerned with this perennial theme. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNobJFWygcC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=Medieval+art+classical+barbarian+Gardner's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AUZrn-wyQw&amp;sig=y2nS9GdW5mslQ8b5r7aRRr4119s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m5KBStT8HIy5jAfaocSKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the formal aspects of classicism, there was a continuous tradition of realistic depiction of objects that survived in Byzantine art throughout the period, while in the West it appears intermittently, combining and sometimes competing with new expressionist possibilities developed in Western Europe and the Northern legacy of energetic decorative elements.  The period ended with the self-perceived [[Renaissance]] recovery of the skills and values of classical art, and the artistic legacy of the [[Middle Ages]] was then [[Dark Ages (historiography)|disparaged]] for some centuries.  Since a revival of interest and understanding in the 19th century it has been seen as a period of enormous achievement that underlies the development of later Western art.

==Overview==

[[File:Lorenzetti amb.effect2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of ''The Effects of Good Government'', a [[fresco]] in the [[Palazzo Pubblico|City Hall of Siena]] by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], 1338.]]

The [[Middle Ages]] in Europe saw a decrease in prosperity, stability, and population in the first centuries of the period—to about 800 AD, and then a fairly steady and general increase until the massive setback of the [[Black Death]] around 1350, which is estimated to have killed at least a third of the overall population in Europe, with generally higher rates in the south and lower in the north.  Many regions did not regain their former population levels until the 17th century.  The [[Medieval demographics|population of Europe]] is estimated to have reached a low point of about 18 million in 650, to have doubled around the year 1000, and to have reached over 70 million by 1340, just before the Black Death. In 1450 it was still only 50 million. To these figures, Northern Europe, especially Britain, contributed a lower proportion than today, and Southern Europe, including France, a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html Fordham University] Josiah Russell's figures - all estimates are of course very imprecise.  See [[Consequences of the Black Death]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in prosperity, for those who survived, was much less affected by the Black Death. Until about the 11th century most of Europe was short of agricultural labour, with large amounts of unused land, and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] benefited agriculture until about 1315.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2002AGUFMPP71C..09L | title=Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Periods in Eastern China as Read from the Speleothem Records | journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts | year=2002 | authors=Li, H.; Ku, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Courtly scenes Louvre MRR197.jpg|thumb|left|Scenes of [[courtly love]] on a lady's [[ivory]] mirror-case. Paris, 1300–1330.]]
The medieval period eventually saw the falling away of the invasions and incursions from outside the area that characterized the first millennium.  The [[Islamic conquests]] of the 6th and 7th century suddenly and permanently removed all of North Africa from the Western world, and over the rest of the period Islamic peoples gradually took over the [[Byzantine Empire]], until the end of the Middle Ages when Catholic Europe, having regained the Iberian peninsula in the southwest, was once again under Muslim threat from the southeast.

At the start of the medieval period most significant works of art were very rare and costly objects associated with secular elites, monasteries or major churches and, if religious, largely produced by monks.  By the end of the Middle Ages works of considerable artistic interest could be found in small villages and significant numbers of [[bourgeois]] homes in towns, and their production was in many places an important local industry, with artists from the [[clergy]] now the exception.  However the [[Rule of St Benedict]] permitted the sale of works of art by monasteries, and it is clear that throughout the period monks might produce art, including secular works, commercially for a lay market, and monasteries would equally hire lay specialists where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23, and Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

The impression may be left by the surviving works that almost all medieval art was religious.  This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction.  The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] tended to disparage medieval art.  Most luxury illuminated manuscripts of the Early Middle Ages had lavish [[treasure binding]] book-covers in precious metal, ivory and jewels; the re-bound pages and ivory [[relief]]s for the covers have survived in far greater numbers than complete covers, which have mostly been stripped off for their valuable materials at some point.
[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Treasure binding|jewelled cover]] of the [[Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram]], c. 870, a Carolingian [[Gospel book]].]]

Most churches have been rebuilt, often several times, but medieval palaces and large houses have been lost at a far greater rate, which is also true of their fittings and decoration. In England, churches survive largely intact from every century since the 7th, and in considerable numbers for the later ones—the city of [[Norwich]] alone has 40 medieval churches—but of the dozens of royal palaces none survive from earlier than the 11th century, and only a handful of remnants from the rest of the period.&lt;ref&gt;The [[White Tower (Tower of London)]] was started in 1078, and some later royal apartments in the [[Tower of London]] survive, as do the hall and parts of [[Eltham Palace]], the most significant medieval remains from an unfortified royal palace. Royal apartments survive in some castles.&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation is similar in most of Europe, though the 14th century [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] survives largely intact.  Many of the longest running scholarly disputes over the date and origin of individual works relate to secular pieces, because they are so much rarer - the Anglo-Saxon [[Fuller Brooch]] was refused by the [[British Museum]] as an implausible fake, and small free-standing secular bronze sculptures are so rare that the date, origin and even authenticity of both of the two best examples has been argued over for decades.&lt;ref&gt;the small Carolingian(?) ''Equestrian Statue of an Emperor'' in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] in Paris, Hinks, 125-7; and the 12th(?)-century bronze of a man wrestling with a lion, variously considered English, German or [[Sicily|Sicilian]] in origin, discussed by Henderson (1977), 135–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of valuable materials is a constant in medieval art; until the end of the period, far more was typically spent on buying them than on paying the artists, even if these were not monks performing their duties.  [[Gold]] was used for objects for churches and palaces, personal jewellery and the fittings of clothes, and—fixed to the back of glass [[tesserae]]—as a solid background for [[mosaic]]s, or applied as [[gold leaf]] to miniatures in manuscripts and panel paintings.  Many objects using precious metals were made in the knowledge that their bullion value might be realized at a future point—only near the end of the period could money be invested other than in [[real estate]], except at great risk or by committing [[usury]].
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|360px|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]

The even more expensive [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]], made from ground [[lapis lazuli]] obtainable only from [[Afghanistan]], was used lavishly in the Gothic period, more often for the traditional blue outer mantle of the [[Virgin Mary]] than for skies.  [[Ivory]], often painted, was an important material until the very end of the period, well illustrating the shift in luxury art to secular works; at the beginning of the period most uses were shifting from [[consular diptych]]s to religious objects such as book-covers, [[reliquaries]] and [[crozier]]s, but in the Gothic period secular mirror-cases, caskets and decorated combs become common among the well-off.  As thin ivory panels carved in [[relief]] could rarely be recycled for another work, the number of survivals is relatively high—the same is true of manuscript pages, although these were often re-cycled by scraping, whereupon they become [[palimpsest]]s.

Even these basic materials were costly: when the Anglo-Saxon [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] planned to create three copies of the bible in 692—of which one survives as the [[Codex Amiatinus]]—the first step necessary was to plan to breed the cattle to supply the 1,600 [[calf (animal)|calves]] to give the skin for the [[vellum]] required.&lt;ref&gt;Grocock, Chris has some calculations in [http://www.mayoalive.com/Mag1096/AbbyTalk.htm ''Mayo of the Saxons and Anglican Jarrow'', Evidence for a Monastic Economy], according to which sheep required only one third as much land per page as calves.  1,600 calves seems to be the standard estimate, see {{citation |last=John |first=Eric |title=Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England |year=1996 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-5053-7 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ju8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper]] became available in the last centuries of the period, but was also extremely expensive by today's standards; [[woodcut]]s sold to ordinary pilgrims at shrines were often [[matchbook]] size or smaller.  Modern [[dendrochronology]] has revealed that most of the [[oak]] for panels used in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century was felled in the [[Vistula]] basin in Poland, from where it was shipped down the river and across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]]s to [[Flanders|Flemish]] ports, before being seasoned for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 29 – the following pages describe gold, pigments and other materials.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art in the Middle Ages is a broad subject and art historians traditionally divide it in several large-scale phases, styles or periods.  The period of the Middle Ages neither begins nor ends neatly at any particular date, nor at the same time in all regions, and the same is true for the major phases of art within the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dates are discussed in Calkins (1979), xix-xx, Kitzinger (1955), 1, Beckwith (1964), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The major phases are covered in the following sections.

Early Christian art, more generally described as [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] art, covers the period from about 200 (before which no distinct Christian art survives), until the onset of a fully [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] in about 500.  There continue to be different views as to when the medieval period begins during this time, both in terms of general history and specifically art history, but it is most often placed late in the period.  In the course of the 4th century Christianity went from being a persecuted popular sect to the official religion of the Empire, adapting existing Roman styles and often [[iconography]], from both popular and Imperial art.  From the start of the period the main survivals of Christian art are the tomb-paintings in popular styles of the [[catacombs of Rome]], but by the end there were a number of lavish mosaics in churches built under Imperial patronage.

Over this period imperial Late [[Roman art]] went through a strikingly "baroque" phase, and then largely abandoned classical style and Greek realism in favour of a more mystical and hieratic style—a process that was well underway before Christianity became a major influence on imperial art.  Influences from Eastern parts of the Empire—[[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and beyond, and also a robust "Italic" vernacular tradition, contributed to this process. Figures are mostly seen frontally staring out at the viewer, where classical art tended to show a profile view - the change was eventually seen even on coins. The individuality of portraits, a great strength of Roman art, declines sharply, and the anatomy and drapery of figures is shown with much less realism. The models from which medieval Northern Europe in particular formed its idea of "Roman" style were nearly all portable Late Antique works, and the Late Antique carved [[sarcophagi]] found all over the former Roman Empire;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1977), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the determination to find earlier "purer" classical models, was a key element in the art ''all'antica'' of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, chapters 1 &amp; 2, and Kitzinger, 1955, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine art==
{{Main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol1v.jpg|thumb|left|[[King David]] plays the [[harp]] in the 10th century [[Paris Psalter]], a classicising work of the Macedonian period.]]

Byzantine art is the art of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire formed after the division of the Roman Empire between Eastern and Western halves, and sometimes of parts of Italy under Byzantine rule.  It emerges from Late Antiquity in about 500 CE and soon formed a tradition distinct from that of Catholic Europe but with great influence over it.  In the early medieval period the best Byzantine art, often from the large Imperial workshops, represented an ideal of sophistication and technique which European patrons tried to emulate.  During the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] in 730-843 the vast majority of [[icon]]s (sacred images usually painted on wood) were destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding, and most remaining works are in Italy (Rome and [[Ravenna]] etc.), or Egypt at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].

Byzantine art was extremely conservative, for religious and cultural reasons, but retained a continuous tradition of Greek realism, which contended with a strong anti-realist and hieratic impulse.   After the resumption of icon production in 843 until 1453 the Byzantine art tradition continued with relatively few changes, despite, or because of, the slow decline of the Empire.  There was a notable [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|revival of classical style]] in works of 10th century court art like the [[Paris Psalter]], and throughout the period manuscript illumination shows parallel styles, often used by the same artist, for iconic figures in framed miniatures and more informal small scenes or figures added unframed in the margins of the text in a much more realist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture]] with figures remained a taboo in Byzantine art; hardly any exceptions are known.  But small ivory reliefs, almost all in the iconic mode (the [[Harbaville Triptych]] is of similar date to the Paris Psalter, but very different in style), were a speciality, as was relief decoration on bowls and other metal objects.

The Byzantine Empire produced much of the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with court production centred on [[Constantinople]], although some art historians have questioned the assumption, still commonly made, that all work of the best quality with no indication as to origin was produced in the capital. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to [[mosques]].
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|6th or 7th century [[Coptic art|Coptic]] [[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|icon of Jesus and an abbot]] shares in more homely form the anti-realist style of Byzantine iconic art.]]

Byzantine art exercised a continuous trickle of influence on Western European art, and the splendours of the Byzantine court and monasteries, even at the end of the Empire, provided a model for Western rulers and secular and clerical patrons.  For example, [[Byzantine silk]] textiles, often woven or embroidered with designs of both animal and human figures, the former often reflecting traditions originating much further east, were unexcelled in the Christian world until almost the end of the Empire.  These were produced, but probably not entirely so, in Imperial workshops in Constantinople, about whose operations we know next to nothing—similar workshops are often conjectured for other arts, with even less evidence.  Some other decorative arts were less developed; Byzantine [[ceramic art|ceramics]] rarely rise above the level of attractive [[folk art]], despite the [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek heritage]] and the impressive future in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period of [[İznik pottery|İznik wares]] and other types of pottery.

The [[Coptic art]] of Egypt took a different path; after the [[Coptic Church]] separated in the mid-5th century it was never again supported by the state, and native Egyptian influences dominated to produce a completely non-realist and somewhat naive style of large-eyed figures floating in blank space.  This was capable of great expressiveness, and took the "Eastern" component of Byzantine art to its logical conclusions.  Coptic decoration used intricate geometric designs, often anticipating Islamic art.  Because of the exceptionally good preservation of Egyptian burials, we know more about the textiles used by the less well-off in Egypt than anywhere else.  These were often elaborately decorated with figurative and patterned designs.  Other local traditions in [[Armenia]], [[Syria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and elsewhere showed generally less sophistication, but often more vigour than the art of [[Constantinople]], and sometimes, especially in [[architecture]], seem to have had influence even in Western Europe.  For example, figurative monumental sculpture on the outside of churches appears here some centuries before it is seen in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Judith Collins cover the Eastern influences on Romanesque art in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration Period through Christianization==
{{Main|Migration Period art}}
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder-clasp from [[Sutton Hoo]], Anglo-Saxon, c. 620. Interlaced biting snakes and confronted [[boar]]s (end sections) are depicted entirely schematically.]]

Migration Period art describes the art of the "[[barbarian]]" Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire, during the [[Völkerwanderung|Migration Period]] from about 300-700; the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early [[Anglo-Saxon art]], [[Visigothic art]], [[Norse art]], and [[Merovingian art]], all of which made use of the [[animal style]] as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art.  By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier [[Scythian art]] or [[La Tène style]].  Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism.  The early Anglo-Saxon [[grave good]]s from [[Sutton Hoo]] are among the best examples.

As the "barbarian" peoples were [[Christianization|Christianized]], these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the [[illuminated manuscript]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 8 &amp; 9}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1984|pp=16–27}} on early Anglo-Saxon art.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed [[coin]]s, which attempted to emulate [[Roman provincial coins]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine]] types.  Early coinage like the [[sceat]] shows designers completely unused to depicting a head in profile grappling with the problem in a variety of different ways.

As for larger works, there are references to Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues, all now lost, and in Norse art the tradition of carved [[runestone]]s was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic [[Picts]] of Scotland also [[Pictish stones|carved stones]] before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of [[High cross|large outdoor carved crosses]] may reflect earlier pagan works.  [[Viking art]] from later centuries in [[Scandinavia]] and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|[[Book of Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], c. 715; decoration invades the text of the beginning of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]:"Liber generationis Jesu Christi filii David, filii Abraham".]]

Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 7th century, to about the 10th century, lasting later in Ireland, and parts of Scotland.  The style saw a fusion between the traditions of [[Celtic art]], the Germanic [[Migration period art]] of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxons]] and the Christian forms of the book, [[high cross]]es and liturgical metalwork.

Extremely detailed geometric, [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like [[brooch]]es, spread boldly across manuscripts, usually [[gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], with whole [[carpet page]]s devoted to such designs, and the development of the large decorated and [[historiated initial]].  There were very few human figures—most often these were [[Evangelist portrait]]s—and these were crude, even when closely following Late Antique models.

The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles.  In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words (see illustration) at beginnings of gospels or other sections in a book.  Allowing decoration a "right to roam" was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media.

The buildings of the monasteries for which the insular gospel books were made were then small and could fairly be called primitive, especially in Ireland.  There increasingly were other decorations to churches, where possible in precious metals, and a handful of these survive, like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], together with a larger number of extremely ornate and finely made pieces of secular high-status jewellery, the [[Celtic brooch]]es probably worn mainly by men, of which the [[Tara Brooch]] is the most spectacular.

"Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodwell|1993|pp=74(quote)–75}}, and see index.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of Islamic art==

{{main|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[Islamic art]] during the Middle Ages falls outside the scope of this article, but it was widely imported and admired by European elites, and its influence needs mention.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pre-Romanesque'' is a term for architecture and to some extent pictorial and portable art found initially in Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Southern France) between the Late Antique period to the start of the Romanesque period in the 11th century.  Northern European art gradually forms part of the movement after [[Christianization]] as it assimilates post-classical styles.  The [[Carolingian art]] of the [[Frankish Empire]], especially modern France and Germany, from roughly 780-900 takes its name from [[Charlemagne]] and is an art of the court circle and a few monastic centres under Imperial patronage, that consciously sought to revive "Roman" styles and standards as befitted the new [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire of the West]].  Some centres of Carolingian production also pioneered expressive styles in works like the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and [[Ebbo Gospels]].  Christian [[monumental sculpture]] is recorded for the first time, and depiction of the human figure in narrative scenes became confident for the first time in Northern art.  [[Carolingian architecture]] produced larger buildings than had been seen since Roman times, and the [[westwork]] and other innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinks|1974|loc=Parts II &amp; III}}; {{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 11 &amp; 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the dynasty there was a hiatus before a new dynasty brought a revival in Germany with [[Ottonian art]], again centred on the court and monasteries, with art that moved towards great expressiveness through simple forms that achieve monumentality even in small works like [[ivory]] [[relief]]s and [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript miniatures]], above all those of the [[Reichenau School]], such as the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (1002–1012).  Later [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in England, from about 900, was expressive in a very different way, with agitated figures and even drapery perhaps best shown in the many pen drawings in manuscripts.  The [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] of Christian Spain had strong Islamic influence, and a complete lack of interest in realism in its brilliantly coloured miniatures, where figures are presented as entirely flat patterns.  Both of these were to influence the formation in France of the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=75–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque art==
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[File:Saint-Julien 03.jpg|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] at [[Saint-Julien-de-Jonzy]], mid-12th century. ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' above, the ''[[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]]'' below.]]

Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism in Western Europe. The style developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;A complicated subject, covered in Dodwell (1993), 175, 223, 258 among many other passages.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of the style coincided with a great increase in church-building, and in the size of [[cathedral]]s and larger churches; many of these were rebuilt in subsequent periods, but often reached roughly their present size in the Romanesque period.  [[Romanesque architecture]] is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ed roofs and round-headed windows and arches.

Figurative sculpture, originally colourfully painted, plays an integral and important part in these buildings, in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns, as well as around impressive [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], usually centred on a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the main doors, as at [[Vézelay Abbey]] and [[Autun Cathedral]].  Reliefs are much more common than free-standing statues in stone, but Romanesque relief became much higher, with some elements fully detached from the wall behind.  Large carvings also became important, especially painted wooden [[crucifix]]es like the [[Gero Cross]] from the very start of the period, and figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].  Royalty and the higher clergy began to commission life-size effigies for [[tomb monument]]s.   Some churches had massive pairs of [[bronze]] doors decorated with narrative relief panels, like the [[Gniezno Doors]] or those at [[Hildesheim]], "the first decorated bronze doors cast in one piece in the West since Roman times", and arguably the finest before the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=145–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most churches were extensively frescoed; a typical scheme had ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' at the east (altar) end, a ''[[Last Judgement]]'' at the west end over the doors, and scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' facing [[typology (theology)|typologically]] matching [[Old Testament]] scenes on the [[nave]] walls.  The "greatest surviving monument of Romanesque wall painting", much reduced from what was originally there, is in the [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] near [[Poitiers]], where the rounded [[barrel vault]] of the [[nave]], the [[crypt]], [[portico]] and other areas retain most of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|pp=190(quote)–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent cycle in [[Sant'Angelo in Formis]] at [[Capua]] in southern Italy by Italian painters trained by Greeks illustrates the continuing predominance of Byzantine style in much of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|left|French [[historiated initial]] with men slaying a monster, from a theological manuscript.  1110–1115]]

Romanesque sculpture and painting is often extremely vigorous and expressive, and very inventive in terms of [[iconography]]—the subjects chosen and their treatment.  Though many features absorbed from classical art form part of the Romanesque style, Romanesque artists rarely intended to achieve any sort of classical effect, except perhaps in [[Mosan art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=277 &amp; 284–288}}. {{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|p=149}}, says the bronze column at Hildesheim of c. 1020 "cannot be said to be Romanesque&amp;nbsp;... It stands apart as a curious Ottonian pastiche of a Roman monument&amp;nbsp;... never to be repeated"&lt;/ref&gt;  As art became seen by a wider section of the population, and because of challenges from new [[heresies]], art became more didactic, and the local church the "[[Poor Man's Bible]]".  At the same time grotesque beasts and monsters, and fights with or between them, were popular themes, to which religious meanings might be loosely attached, although this did not impress St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who famously denounced such distractions in monasteries:&lt;blockquote&gt;But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness?  Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  He might well have known the miniature at left, which was produced at [[Cîteaux Abbey]] before the young Bernard was transferred from there in 1115.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 212–214.

During the period [[typology (theology)|typology]] became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, with [[Old Testament]] incidents seen as pre-figurations of aspects of the life of Christ, and shown paired with their corresponding New Testament episode.  Often the iconography of the New Testament scene was based on traditions and models originating in Late Antiquity, but the iconography of the Old Testament episode had to be invented in this period, for lack of precedents.  New themes such as the [[Tree of Jesse]] were devised, and representations of [[God the Father]] became more acceptable.  The vast majority of surviving art is religious. [[Mosan art]] was an especially refined regional style, with much superb metalwork surviving, often combined with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and elements of classicism rare in Romanesque art, as in the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], or the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] at [[Cologne]], one of a number of surviving works by [[Nicholas of Verdun]], whose services were sought across north-western Europe.

[[Stained glass]] became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives.  In illuminated manuscripts the bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the [[psalter]] also remaining important.  The strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art in this period, a feature that strongly distinguishes it from both Byzantine and classical art for the remainder of the Middle Ages and beyond.  The Gero Cross of 965-970, at the cusp of Ottonian and Romanesque art, has been called the first work to exhibit this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the [[Virgin Mary]] in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.

==Gothic art==
{{Main|Gothic art}}
[[File:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chartres cathedral]] c. 1220; the best High Gothic sculpture had largely rediscovered the art of naturalistic figure representation.]]
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with the [[Gothic architecture]] which developed in France from about 1137 with the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey Church of St Denis]].  As with Romanesque architecture, this included [[Gothic sculpture|sculpture]] as an integral part of the style, with even larger [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and other figures on the [[facade]]s of churches the location of the most important sculpture, until the late period, when large carved [[altarpiece]]s and [[reredos]], usually in painted and gilded wood, became an important focus in many churches.  [[Gothic painting]] did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style.  A [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic style in sculpture]] originates in France around 1144  and spread throughout Europe, becoming by the 13th century the international style, replacing Romanesque, though in sculpture and painting the transition was not as sharp as in architecture.

The majority of Romanesque cathedrals and large churches were replaced by Gothic buildings, at least in those places benefiting from the economic growth of the period—Romanesque architecture is now best seen in areas that were subsequently relatively depressed, like many  southern regions of France and Italy, or northern Spain.  The new architecture allowed for much larger windows, and stained glass of a quality never excelled is perhaps the type of art most associated in the popular mind with the Gothic, although churches with nearly all their original glass, like the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, are extremely rare anywhere, and unknown in Britain.

Most Gothic wall-paintings have also disappeared; these remained very common, though in parish churches often rather crudely executed.  Secular buildings also often had wall-paintings, although royalty preferred the much more expensive tapestries, which were carried along as they travelled between their many palaces and castles, or taken with them on military campaigns—the finest collection of late-medieval textile art comes from the Swiss booty at the [[Battle of Nancy]], when they defeated and killed [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and captured all his baggage train.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Historical Museum of Bern]] has many of the best pieces, and these and others were shown in an exhibition on Philip in Bern, Bruges and Vienna in 2008-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio maesta1021.jpg|thumb|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s huge [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] [[altarpiece]] for [[Siena Cathedral]].]]
As mentioned in the previous section, the Gothic period coincided with a greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary, and it was in this period that the [[Virgin and Child]] became such a hallmark of Catholic art.  Saints were also portrayed far more often, and many of the range of [[Saint symbolism|attributes]] developed to identify them visually for a still largely illiterate public first appeared.

During this period [[panel painting]] for altarpieces, often [[polyptych]]es and smaller works became newly important.  Previously [[icon]]s on panels had been much more common in Byzantine art than in the West, although many now lost panel paintings made in the West are documented from much earlier periods, and initially Western painters on panel were very largely under the sway of Byzantine models, especially in Italy, from where most early Western panel paintings come.  The process of establishing a distinct Western style was begun by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], and completed by [[Giotto]], who is traditionally regarded as the starting point for the development of Renaissance painting.  Most panel painting remained more conservative than miniature painting however, partly because it was seen by a wide public.
[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem'', Burgundian miniature, c. 1460.]]

[[International Gothic]] describes courtly Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art begins to merge into the [[Renaissance art]] that had begun to form itself in Italy during the [[Trecento]], with a return to classical principles of composition and realism, with the sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] and the painter [[Giotto]] as especially formative figures.  The [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] is one of the best known works of International Gothic.  The transition to the Renaissance occurred at different times in different places - [[Early Netherlandish painting]] is poised between the two, as is the Italian painter [[Pisanello]]. Outside Italy Renaissance styles appeared in some works in courts and some wealthy cities while other works, and all work beyond these centres of innovation, continued late Gothic styles for a period of some decades.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] often provided an end point for the Gothic tradition in areas that went Protestant, as it was associated with Catholicism.

The invention of a comprehensive mathematically based system of [[linear perspective]] is a defining achievement of the early-15th-century [[Italian Renaissance]] in [[Florence]], but Gothic painting had already made great progress in the naturalistic depiction of distance and volume, though it did not usually regard them as essential features of a work if other aims conflicted with them, and late Gothic sculpture was increasingly naturalistic. In the mid-15th century Burgundian miniature (right) the artist seems keen to show his skill at representing buildings and blocks of stone obliquely, and managing scenes at different distances.  But his general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements is unsystematic. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, [[foreshortening]], and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason.
[[File:Totentanz blockbook q.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Death comes for the Cardinal'', from a printed [[blockbook]] with hand colour, c. 1455–58, an early example of the [[Dance of Death]].]]

The end of the period includes new media such as [[old master print|prints]]; along with small panel paintings these were frequently used for the emotive [[andachtsbilder]] ("devotional images") influenced by new religious trends of the period.  These were images of moments detached from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] designed for meditation on his sufferings, or those of the Virgin: the [[Man of Sorrows]], [[Pietà]], [[Veil of Veronica]] or [[Arma Christi]]. The trauma of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century was at least partly responsible for the popularity of themes such as the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' and ''[[Memento mori]]''.  In the cheap [[blockbook]]s with text (often in the [[vernacular]]) and images cut in a single [[woodcut]], works such as that illustrated (left), the ''[[Ars Moriendi]]'' (''Art of Dying'') and typological verse summaries of the bible like the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' (''Mirror of Human Salvation'') were the most popular.

[[Renaissance Humanism]] and the rise of a wealthy urban middle class, led by merchants, began to transform the old social context of art, with the revival of realistic portraiture and the appearance of printmaking and the [[self-portrait]], together with the decline of forms like stained glass and the illuminated manuscript.  [[Donor portrait]]s, in the Early Medieval period largely the preserve of popes, kings and abbots, now showed businessmen and their families, and churches were becoming crowded with the [[tomb monument]]s of the well-off.
[[File:Meester van Catharina van Kleef - Getijdenboek van de Meester van Catharina van Kleef4.jpg|thumb|Opening from the [[Hours of Catherine of Cleves]], c. 1440, with Catherine kneeling before the Virgin and Child, surrounded by her family heraldry.

The typical exuberantly decorated margins descend from [[insular art]], and are unlike anything in the Byzantine tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plummer|1964|loc=plates 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[book of hours]], a type of manuscript normally owned by laymen, or even more often, laywomen, became the type of manuscript most often heavily illustrated from the 14th century onwards, and also by this period, the lead in producing miniatures had passed to lay artists, also very often women.  In the most important centres of illumination, Paris and in the 15th century the cities of [[Flanders]], there were large workshops, exporting to other parts of Europe.  Other forms of art, such as small ivory reliefs, stained glass, tapestries and [[Nottingham alabaster]]s (cheap carved panels for altarpieces) were produced in similar conditions, and artists and craftsmen in cities were usually covered by the [[guild]] system—the [[goldsmith]]'s guild was typically among the richest in a city, and painters were members of a special [[Guild of St Luke]] in many places.

Secular works, often using subjects concerned with [[courtly love]] or [[chivalry|knightly heroism]], were produced as illuminated manuscripts, carved ivory mirror-cases, tapestries and elaborate gold table centrepieces like [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]].  It begins to be possible to distinguish much greater numbers of individual artists, some of whom had international reputations.  Art collectors begin to appear, of manuscripts among the great nobles, like [[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) and of prints and other works among those with moderate wealth.  In the wealthier areas tiny cheap religious [[woodcut]]s brought art in an approximation of the latest style even into the homes of peasants by the late 15th century.

==Subsequent reputation==

Medieval art had little sense of its own art history, and this disinterest was continued in later periods.  The Renaissance generally dismissed it as a "barbarous" product of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", and the [[Gothic architecture#The term "Gothic"|term "Gothic"]] was invented as a deliberately pejorative one, first used by the painter [[Raphael]] in a letter of 1519 to characterise all that had come between the demise of Classical art and its supposed 'rebirth' in the [[Renaissance]]. The term was subsequently adopted and popularised in the mid 16th century by the Florentine artist and historian, [[Giorgio Vasari]], who used it to denigrate northern European architecture generally. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be collected by [[antiquarian]]s, or sit unregarded in monastic or royal libraries, but paintings were mostly of interest if they had historical associations with royalty or others.  The long period of mistreatment of the [[Westminster Retable]] by [[Westminster Abbey]] is an example; until the 19th century it was only regarded as a useful piece of timber.  But their large portrait of [[Richard II of England]] was well looked after, like another portrait of Richard, the [[Wilton Diptych]] (illustrated above).  As in the Middle Ages themselves, other objects have often survived mainly because they were considered to be [[relic]]s.

There was no equivalent for pictorial art of the "[[Gothic survival]]" found in architecture, once the style had finally died off in Germany, England and [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Gothic Revival]] long focused on [[Gothic Architecture]] rather than art.  The understanding of the succession of styles was still very weak, as suggested by the title of [[Thomas Rickman]]'s pioneering book on English architecture: ''An Attempt to discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' (1817).  This began to change with a vengeance by the mid-19th century, as appreciation of medieval sculpture and its painting, known as Italian or Flemish "Primitives", became fashionable under the influence of writers including [[John Ruskin]], [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]], as well as the romantic [[medievalism]] of literary works like Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1819) and [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1831).  Early collectors of the "Primitives", then still relatively cheap, included [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].
[[File:Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William Burges]]' design for the Summer Smoking Room at [[Cardiff Castle]], 1860s.]]

Among artists the German [[Nazarene movement]] from 1809 and English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] from 1848 both rejected the values of at least the later Renaissance, but in practice, and despite sometimes depicting medieval scenes, their work draws its influences mostly from the [[Early Renaissance]] rather than the Gothic or earlier periods - the early graphic work of [[John Millais]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;In works like [http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1906P646/the-death-of-romeo-and-juliet-compositional-study/ this], stylistically very different from the finished painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Morris]], also a discriminating collector of medieval art, absorbed medieval style more thoroughly into his work, as did [[William Burges]].[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Joseph's Dream'' from the Byzantinesque [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]], the subject of much controversy since their discovery in 1944, and now generally dated to the 10th century.]]By the later 19th century many book-illustrators and producers of decorative art of various kinds had learned to use medieval styles successfully from the new museums like the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] set up for this purpose.  At the same time the new academic field of [[art history]], dominated by Germany and France, concentrated heavily on medieval art and was soon very productive in cataloguing and dating the surviving works, and analysing the development of medieval styles and iconography; though the Late Antique and pre-Carolingian period remained a less explored "no-man's land" until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=1(quote)–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Theodor Kugler]] was the first to name and describe Carolingian art in 1837; like many art historians of the period he sought to find and promote the national spirit of his own nation in art history, a search begun by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century.  Kugler's pupil, the great Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], though he could not be called a specialist in medieval art, was an important figure in developing the understanding of it.  Medieval art was now heavily collected, both by museums and private collectors like [[George Salting]], the [[Rothschild family]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan]].

After the decline of the [[Gothic Revival]], and the [[Celtic Revival]] use of Insular styles, the anti-realist and expressive elements of medieval art have still proved an inspiration for many modern artists.

German-speaking art historians continued to dominate medieval art history, despite figures like [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954) and [[Henri Focillon]] (1881–1943), until the Nazi period, when a large number of important figures emigrated, mostly to Britain or America, where the academic study of art history was still developing.  These included the elderly [[Adolph Goldschmidt]] and younger figures including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], [[Ernst Kitzinger]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Kurt Weitzmann]], [[Richard Krautheimer]] and many others.  [[Meyer Schapiro]] had immigrated as a child in 1907.

== Prejudice ==
During the Middle Ages some Christian art was used as a way to express prejudices and commonly held negative views that were held against other religions and groups of people.

=== Jewish portrayals in medieval Christian art ===
[[File:Ecclesia et synagoga.jpg|thumb|Ecclesia and Sinagoga at the&amp;nbsp;Notre Dame Cathedral]]

In Medieval Europe between the 5th and 15th century many Christians viewed Jews as enemies and outsiders due to a variety of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jewm/hd_jewm.htm|title=Jews and the Arts in Medieval Europe|last=Holcomb|first=Barbara Drake|last2=Holcomb|first2=Melanie|date=June 2008|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tended to hate them for being both culturally and religiously different as well as because of religious teachings that held negative views of Jewish people such as portrayals of the Antichrist as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdtSQ9v9T3IC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;dq=Lipton+%22jewish+hat%22+enemies+of+Christ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqtM2kWlYN&amp;sig=2O0Qt5N7Wf9Ka_216Mh4F93xodc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hpal5t_XAhVGqlQKHYCABtMQ6AEIQjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lipton%20%22jewish%20hat%22%20enemies%20of%20Christ&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous|last=Mittman|first=Asa Simon|last2=Dendle|first2=Peter J.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472418012|location=|pages=383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Jewish people's economic position as moneylenders, coupled with royal protections that were given to them,{{Example needed|date=June 2018}} created a strained relationship between Jews and Christians. This strain manifested itself in several ways, one of which was through the creation of [[Medieval antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity|anti-Judaism]] art and propaganda that served the purpose of discrediting both Jews and their religious beliefs as well as spreading these beliefs even further into society.  Late medieval images of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]] represented the Christian doctrine of [[Supersessionism|supercessionism]], whereby the Christian [[New Covenant]] had replaced the Jewish [[Mosaic covenant]]&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christine, "The Jewish Mother-in-law; Synagoga and the ''Man of Law's Tale''", pp. 8-11, in Delany, Sheila (ed), ''Chaucer and the Jews : Sources, Contexts, Meanings'', 2002, Routledge, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T6YMJAuDAdEC&amp;pg=PA8 google books], {{ISBN|0-415-93882-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sara Lipton has argued that some portrayals, such as depictions of Jewish blindness in the presence of Jesus, were meant to serve as a form of self-reflection rather than be explicitly anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f6gBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=Dark Mirror: The Medieval Origins of Anti-Jewish Iconography|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805079104|location=|pages=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2013 book ''Saracens, Demons, and Jews'', Debra Higgs Strickland argues that negative portrayals of Jews in medieval art can be divided into three categories: art that focused on physical descriptions, art that featured signs of damnation, and images that depicted Jews as monsters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Physical depictions of Jewish people in medieval Christian art were often men with pointed [[Jewish hat]]s and long beards, which was done as a derogatory symbol and to separate Jews from Christians in a clear manner. This portrayal would grow more virulent over time, however Jewish women lacked similar distinctive physical descriptions in high medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2008|title=Where Are the Gothic Jewish Women?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28103">'''Neurodevelopmental framework for learning''', like all frameworks, is an organizing structure through which learners and learning can be understood. Intelligence theories and [[neuropsychology]] inform many of them. The framework described below is a neurodevelopmental framework for learning. The neurodevelopmental framework was developed by the [[All Kinds of Minds Institute]] in collaboration with Dr. Mel Levine and the [[University of North Carolina]]'s Clinical Center for the Study of Development and Learning. It is similar to other neuropsychological frameworks, including [[Alexander Luria]]'s [[cultural-historical psychology]] and psychological [[activity theory]], but also draws from disciplines such as [[speech-language pathology]], [[occupational therapy]], and [[physical therapy]].  It also shares components with [[#Other learning frameworks|other frameworks]], some of which are listed below. However, it does not include a [[general intelligence factor]] (abbreviated '''g'''), since the framework is used to describe learners in terms of profiles of strengths and weaknesses, as opposed to using labels, diagnoses, or broad ability levels.  This framework was also developed to link with academic skills, such as reading and writing. Implications for education are discussed below as well as the connections to and compatibilities with several major educational policy issues.

This framework consists of 8 constructs, sometimes referred to as systems.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, M.D.  (1998). ''Developmental Variation and Learning Disorders'', Second Edition.  Cambridge, MA:  Educators Publishing Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the 8 constructs, this framework includes several "cross-construct" phenomena:  rate alignment (working at optimal speed), strategy use (working and thinking tactically), chunk size capacity – the amount of material that can be processed, stored or generated, and metacognition (degree of knowledge about learning and insight into one's own neurodevelopmental strengths and weaknesses).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benjamin | first1 = A.

==Other learning frameworks==
Numerous frameworks are available that describe development and help to organize observations of [[learning]] behavior.  Intelligence theories date back to the 19th century and the early 20th century, such as [[Charles Spearman]]'s concept of [[general intelligence factor]], or g.  Though there were exceptions (e.g., Thorndike), most theories of intelligence included g, a general index of cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Bolles"&gt;Bolles, R.C.  (1993).  ''The Story of Psychology:  A Thematic History''.  Pacific Grove, CA:  Brooks/Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R.E.  (1990). ''Pioneers of Psychology, Second Edition''.  New York:  Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;
An intelligence theory that has drawn considerable attention is [[Cattell–Horn–Carroll theory|Cattell-Horn-Carroll]] (CHC), which is grounded in extensive factor analytic research from cognitive ability test databases, as well as studies of development and heritability.  CHC is actually an amalgam of Cattell-Horn Gf-Gc theory and Carroll's three-tier model.&lt;ref&gt;
Carroll, J. B. (1993). ''Human Cognitive Abilities: A Survey of Factor Analytic Studies''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework with the broadest level a general intelligence factor conceptually similar to Spearman's g.  This general factor was divided into eight narrower abilities, each consisting of narrow factors.  Cattell-Horn's model was similar on several fronts, including its hierarchical structure.  In the 1990s, Carroll's model was combined with Cattell-Horn's work by Flanagan, McGrew, and Ortiz (2000).&lt;ref&gt;
Flanagan, D.P., McGrew, K.S., &amp; Ortiz, S. (2000). The Wechsler Intelligence Scales and Gf- Gc Theory:  A contemporary approach to interpretation. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  CHC contains three strata:  stratum III is g, stratum II consists of broad cognitive abilities, and stratum I consists of narrow cognitive abilities.  The broad cognitive abilities (stratum II) include fluid reasoning (or Gf, forming and recognizing logical relationships among patterns, inferencing, and transforming novel stimuli) and comprehension-knowledge (or Gc, using language and acquired knowledge).  There is on-going discussion by proponents of CHC about g's importance in the framework.  
The Structure of Intellect (SOI) model includes three axes (with 5-6 components per axis) that form a 3-dimensional cube; because each dimension is independent, there are 150 different potential aspects of intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guilford | first1 = J.P. | year = 1982 | title = Cognitive psychology's ambiguities: Some suggested remedies | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 48–59 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.89.1.48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Howard Gardner]] has written about several categories of intelligence, as opposed to a hierarchical model.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, H. (1999). Intelligence Reframed. Multiple intelligences for the 21st century, New York: Basic Books.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Neuropsychologists have sought to map various mental abilities onto brain structures.  In so doing they have created frameworks that include factors and sub-components.  [[Alexander Luria|Luria]]&lt;ref name="Luria 1973"&gt;Luria, A.R.  (1973). ''The Working Brain:  An Introduction to Neuropsychology'' (B. Haigh, Trans.).  New York:  Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; organized brain functions into now-familiar categories, such as [[speech]] and [[memory]].  Luria's conception of [[attention]] included three units:  Unit 1 (brainstem and related areas) regulates cortical activity and levels of alertness, Unit 2 (lateral and posterior regions of neocortex) analyzes and stores newly received information, and Unit 3 (frontal lobes) programs and regulates activity.&lt;ref name="Luria 1973"/&gt;  More recently, the PASS (Planning, Attention, Successive, and Simultaneous) model&lt;ref&gt;Das, J.P., Naglieri, J.A., &amp; Kirby, J.R.  (1994). ''Assessment of Cognitive Processes: The PASS Theory of Intelligence''.  Boston:  Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; yields both a global index of ability while emphasizing specific cognitive processes.  For example, "successive" refers to information that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered in a serial order (e.g., language), whereas "simultaneous" refers to material that is perceived, interpreted, and/or remembered as a whole (e.g. visual-spatial).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54592">'''Organizational Information Theory (OIT)''' is a [[communication theory]], developed by [[Karl Weick]], offering systemic insight into the processing and exchange of information within [[organizations]] and among its members. Unlike the past structure-centered theory, OIT focuses on the process of organizing in dynamic, information-rich environments. Given that, It contents that the main activity of organizations is the process of making sense of equivocal information. Organizational members are instrumental to reduce equivocality and achieve sensemaking through some strategies — enactment, selection, and retention of information.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With a framework that is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature, organizational information theory's desire to eliminate both ambiguity and complexity from workplace messaging builds upon earlier findings from [[general systems theory]] and [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]].

==Assumptions==
'''1. Human organizations exist in an information environment'''

Unlike senders and receivers models, OIT stands on the situational perspective.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putman|first=L. L.|last2=Sorenson|first2=R. L.|date=1982|title=Equivocal messages in organizations|url=|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=8|issue=2|pages=114–132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Karl Weick views a human organization as an open [[social system]]. People in that system develop a mechanism to establish goals, obtain and process information, or perceive the environment.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karl E.|first=Weick|last2=Daft|first2=Richard L.|date=April 1, 1984|title=Toward a Model of Organizations as Interpretation Systems|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Review|volume=9|issue=2|pages=284–295|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, people and the environment come to conclusions on "what's going on here?". Colville believes that this attributional process is retrospective.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Take an education institutions as an example. A university can obtain information regarding students' needs in numerous ways. It might create feedback section in its website. It could organize alumni panels or academic affairs to attract prospective students and collect concrete questions they are interested in. It may also conduct the survey or host focus group to get the information. After that, the stuff of the university have to decide how to deal with these information, based on which, it has to set and accomplish its goals for current and prospective students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''2. The information an organization receives differs in terms of equivocality'''

Weick's posits that numerous feasible interpretations of reality exist when organizations process information.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Their varying levels of understandability lead to different outcomes of information inputs. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other academic works, scholars tend to say that messages are uncertain or ambiguous. While according to OIT, messages are described to be equivocal. believes that people proactively exclude a number of possibilities to perceive what is going on in the environment. &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Colville|first=Ian|date=July 1994|title=Searching for Karl Weick and Reviewing the Future|url=|journal=Organization|volume=1|issue=1|pages=218–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to OIT's situational perspective, the meanings of messages consist of the messages, the interpretations of receivers, and the interactional context. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, ambiguity and uncertainty can mean that a standard answer - the only one true objective interpretation - exists.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

Also, Weick emphasizes that "the equivocality is the engine that motivates people to organize".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic ambiguities: Essays on communication, organization, and identity|last=Eisenberg|first=E. M.|publisher=Sage|year=2007|isbn=|location=CA|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitlis and Christianson states that the equivocality trigger sensemaking for three reasons: environment jolts and organizational crises, threats to identity, and planned change interventions. &lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maitlis|first=Sally|last2=Christianson|first2=Marlys|date=2014|title=Sensemaking in Organizations: Taking Stock and Moving Forward|url=|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|volume=Vol. 8, Iss. 1|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

'''3. Human organizations engage in information processing to reduce equivocality of information'''

Based upon the first two assumption, OIT proposes that information processing within organizations is a social activity. Sharing is the key feature of organizational information processing.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In that particular context, members jointly make sense the reality by reducing equivocality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication: the Process of Organizing|last=Johnson|first=B.M.|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|year=1977|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It other words, the sensemaking is a joint responsibility which includes numerous interdependent people to accomplish. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this process, organizations and its members combine actions and attributions together in order to find the balance between the complexity of thoughts and the simplicity of actions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Key Concepts ==

=== The organization ===
In order to place Weick's vision regarding Organizational Information Theory into proper working context, exploring his view regarding what constitutes the [[organization]] and how its individuals embody that construct might yield significant insights.

From a fundamental standpoint, he shared a belief that organizational validation is derived---not through bricks and mortar, or locale—but from a series of events which enable entities to "collect, manage and use the information they receive."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=Richard|first=West|last2=Lynn H. Turner|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; In elaborating further on what constitutes an organization during early writings outlining OIT, Weick said, "The word organization is a noun and it is also a myth. if one looks for an organization, one will not find it. What will be found is that there are events linked together, that transpire within concrete walls and these sequences, their pathways, their timing, are the forms we erroneously make into substances when we talk about an organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/encyclop/weick.html|title=Weick's Model of Organizing|last=|first=|date=October 12, 2014|website=Weick's Model of Organizing|publisher=Babson University|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When viewed in this modular fashion, the organization meets Weick's theoretical vision by encompassing parameters that are less bound by concrete, wood, and structural restraints and more by an ability to serve as a repository where information can be consistently and effectively channeled.  Taking these defining characteristics into account, proper channel execution relies on maximization of messaging clarity, context, delivery and evolution through any system.

One example as to how these interactions might unfold on a more granular level within these confines can be gleaned through Weick's double interact loop, which he considers the "building blocks of every organization". Simply put, double interacts describe interpersonal exchanges that, inherently, occur across the organizational chain of command and in life, itself.

Thus:

"An '''''act''''' occurs when you say something (Can I have a [[Popsicle (brand)|Popsicle]]?).

An '''''interact''''' occurs when you say something ''and I respond'' ("No, it will spoil your dinner).

A '''''double interact''''' occurs when you say something, I respond to that, then ''you respond to that, adjusting the first statement'' ("Well, how about half a Popsicle?)

Weick envisions the organization as a system taking in equivocal information from its environment, trying to make sense of that information, and using what was learned for the future. As such, organizations evolve as they make sense out of themselves and the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/theory/organize.html|title=Organizing|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=Oregon State. edu|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"These communication cycles are the reason Weick focuses more on relationships within an organization than he does on an individual's talent or performance. He believes that many outside consultants gloss over the importance of the double interact because they depart the scene before the effects of their recommended action bounce back to affect the actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Look At Communication Theory|last=Green|first=Em|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York City|pages=|chapter=19 (Archived)|chapterurl=http://www.afirstlook.com/docs/infosystems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing us to consider the organization in this alternative framework, Organizational Information Theory provides us with a robust platform from which to explore the communication process, literally, as it unfolds.

=== Loose coupling and the information environment ===
In developing Organizational Information Theory, Weick took a "social psychological stance that notes that individual behavior is more a function of the situation than of personal traits or role definitions. Therefore, people are 'loosely connected' in most organizations and have a large latitude for action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/encyclop/weick.html|title=Weick's Model of Organizing|last=|first=|date=November 15, 2014|website=Weick's Model of Organizing|publisher=Babson University|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a way of formalizing this phenomenon, he "invites us to use the metaphor "[[loose coupling]]" in order to better understand organizations and aspects of organizations --particularly the variant kinds of connections that exist within organizations--that are either marginalized, ignored, or suppressed by normative [[bureaucracy]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/barlosky/karl-weicks-loosely-coupled-systems|title=Educational Organizations As Loosely Coupled Systems: An Exercise In Metaphorical Thinking|last=Barlosky|first=Dr. Martin|date=October 20, 2010|website=slideshare.com|publisher=University of Ottawa, Faculty of Education|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, in much the same way he suggested that organizations be viewed through a non-traditional lens in structure, he acknowledges that, by doing so, one may have to consider circumstances where "several means can produce the same result, while offering the appearance that lack of coordination, absence of regulations, and very slow feedback times are the norm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/org_theory/Scott_articles/weick_lcs.html|title=Karl Weick: Educational Organizations Loosely Coupled Systems|last=|first=|date=1976|website=Karl Weick, "Educational organizations as loosely coupled systems|series=Part 1-9|publisher=Babson University; Administrative Science Quarterly|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many might view these nuances as roadblocks or impediments to progress, Organizational Information Theory views each one as a catalyst for improved performance and positive change through: "increased sensitivity to a shifting environment, room for adaptation and creative solutions to develop, sub-system breakdown without damaging the entire organization, persistence through rapid environmental fluctuations and fostering an attitude where self-determination by the actors is key".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/org_theory/Scott_articles/weick_lcs.html|title=Karl Weick: Educational Organizations As Loosely Coupled Systems|last=|first=|date=1976|website=Karl Weick: Educational Organizations As Loosely Coupled Systems|series=Part 1-9|publisher=Babson University; Administrative Science Quarterly|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another overriding component of Weick's approach is that information afforded by the organization's environment---including the [[culture]] within the organizational environment itself---can impact the behaviors and interpretation of behaviors of those within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider et all|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, creation of organizational knowledge is impacted by each person’s personal [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] as well as the backdrop of the organization’s objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=Ikujiro|date=1994|title=A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation|journal=Organization Science|volume=5|pages=14–37|doi=10.1287/orsc.5.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization must sift through the available information to filter out the valuable from the extraneous. Additionally, the organization must both interpret the information and coordinate that information to "make it meaningful for the members of the organization and its goals."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Communication Theory|last=West and Turner|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|isbn=|location=|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to construct meaning from these messages in their environment, the organization must reduce equivocality, while committing to an interpretation of the message which matches its culture and overall mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication as Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|author2=Elizabeth Van Every|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Accociates|year=2000|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the "flashlight analogy" is used to explain the inseparability of action and knowledge present in this theory. One should imagine he is in a dark field at night with only a flashlight. He can vaguely pick out objects around him, but can't really tell what they are. Is that lump in the distance a bush or a dangerous animal? When he turns on his flashlight, however, he creates a circle of light that allows him to see clearly and act with relative clarity. The act of turning on the flashlight effectively created a new environment that allowed him to interpret the world around him. There is still only a single circle of light, though, and what remains outside that circle is still just as mysterious, unless the flashlight is redirected. With organizational information theory, the flashlight is mental. The environment is located in the mind of the actor and is imposed on him by his experiences, which makes them more meaningful.

=== Equivocality ===
Based on the number of rapidly moving parts within any organization (i.e., information flows, individuals, etc....) the foundation upon which messaging is received constantly shifts, thus leaving room for unintended consequences relative to true intent and meaning. Equivocality arises when communication outreach "can be given different interpretations because their substance is ambiguous, conflicted, obscure, or introduces uncertainty into a situation".&lt;ref name="fisherhouse1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fisherhouse.com/bsu/comm361/biology/tsld013.htm|title = Equivocality Reduction Theory|date = n.d.|accessdate = November 15, 2014|website = fisherhouse.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational Information Theory provides a knowledge base and framework which can help mitigate these risks through by decreasing the level of ambiguity present during relevant communication activities. Simultaneously, it serves as a construct whose potential for growth stems from active use "communicating and organizing" and "reducing the amount of equivocality" within a specified domain.&lt;ref name="fisherhouse1"/&gt;

In looking at how equivocality evolves more closely, it can also manifest itself as a signature for highly interpretive events, along with those where the parameters (and uncertainty levels) are, traditionally, much more concrete. For instance, "equivocality also describes situations where there is agreement on a set of descriptive criteria (say, desirable market/undesirable market) but disagreement on either their boundaries (i.e., the point at which markets go from being desirable to undesirable) or on their application to a particular situation (whether a particular market is desirable or undesirable). Managing equivocality requires coordinating meaning among members of an organization, and is an essential part of organizing. Equivocality arises because everyone's experiences are unique; individuals and communities develop their own sets of values and beliefs and tend to interpret events differently. Equivocality also may result from unreliable or conflicting information sources, noisy communication channels, differing or ambiguous goals and preferences, vague roles and responsibilities, or disparate political interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.cba.neu.edu/~mzack/articles/orgig/orgig.htm|title = Managing Organizational Ignorance|date = 1999|accessdate = November 15, 2014|website = cba.neu.edu|publisher = College of Business Administration, Northeastern University|last = Zack|first = Michael H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensemaking===
Karl Weick's Organizational Information Theory views organizations as " '[[sensemaking]] systems' which incessantly create and re-create conceptions of themselves and of all around them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://commorgiland.wordpress.com/tag/organisations|title = Karl Weick's Theory of Organizing|date = September 16, 2012|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = commorgiland.com|publisher = Penguin Books|last = Hickson|first = D.|last2 = Pugh|first2 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a less clinical (and more intuitive) perspective, Weick and his collaborator, [[Kathleen M. Sutcliffe]], jointly describe sensemaking as an action which "involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words or speech and that serves as a springboard to action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/FlorianMaderebner/karl-e-weick-organizing-and-the-prozess-of-sensemaking?related=1|title = Karl E. Weick--Organizing and the Process of Sensemaking|date = October 13, 2011|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = slideshare.net|publisher = Florian Maderebner|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its more defined organizational context, sensemaking can be looked at as a process "that is applied to both individuals and groups who are faced with new information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs".&lt;ref name="amazon1"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=978-0803971776|title = The Story of Sensemaking|date = September 29, 2013|publisher = |last = Reed|first = William A.|url = http://amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In factoring the uneasiness (or [[cognitive dissonance]]) that results from this experience, they will create narratives to fit the story which serve both as a buffer and a guiding light for further renditions of the story. "This explains how, for example, religious groups can have such stringent beliefs, how political parties can be confident in their diametrically-opposed positions, how organizations can develop very different cultures, and how individuals can develop very different interpretations for the same event".&lt;ref name="amazon1"/&gt;

The process of sensemaking usually starts with a circumstance or problem which requires a certain level of interpretation by others (i.e., something did or did not happen). Whether it is consciously or unconsciously driven, those involved then make a commitment to a perceived viewpoint surrounding those facts. "Commitment forms around the interpretation to bind the interpretation to future action. When publicly communicated, commitment is especially strong. Individuals are motivated to justify their commitments, so they initiate future actions and continually refine their interpretation of the original event so that their commitment to a course of action is deemed appropriate. These new actions produce "evidence" that validates the interpretation and are used to increase decision confidence".&lt;ref name="amazon1"/&gt;

These are critical facets which surround the sensemaking process:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.slideshare.net/FlorianMaderebner/karl-e-weick-organizing-and-the-prozess-of-sensemaking?related=1|title = Karl E. Weick---Organizing And The Process of Sensemaking|date = October 13, 2011|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = slideshare.com|publisher = Florian Maderebner|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

a) sensemaking starts with noticing and bracketing

b) sensemaking is about labeling

c) sensemaking is retrospective

d) sensemaking is about presumption

e) sensemaking is social and systemic

f) sensemaking is about action

g) sensemaking is about organizing through communication

The idea of sensemaking is also a theme within Organizational Information Theory. Organizational sensemaking contrasts with organizational interpretation. When an organization interprets information, there is already a frame of reference in place and this is enough information for an organization to change course. Sensemaking occurs, however, when no initial frame of reference exists and no obvious connection presents itself. According to Weick, sensemaking can be driven by beliefs or actions. Beliefs shape what people experience and give form for the actions they take. For example, disagreement about beliefs in an organization can lead to arguments. This is a form of sensemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Czarniawska|first=Barbara|title=Contemporary Organization Theory|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|pages=271–272|authorlink=Karl Weick: Concepts, style and reflection|editor=Campbell Jones and Rolland Munro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, sensemaking make impact on organizations in three aspects: strategic change, organizational learning, and innovation and creativity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Regarding strategic change, individuals are triggered to alter their own roles and behaviors and also help others to coordinate with their new changes. Then a new organizational order about strategies will be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corley|first=K.G.|date=2004|title=Identity ambiguity and change in the wake of a corporate spin-off|url=|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=49|issue=2|pages=173–208|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for learning, on the one hand, people will learn from error. Organizational understandings and routines will be revised, updated and strengthened in response to the errors. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christensen|first=L.T.|date=2011|title=Bridging corporate and organizational communication: Review, development and a look to the future|url=|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|volume=25|issue=3|pages=383–414|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, sensemaking about material gathered and available options make a great contribution to learn in more conventional contexts, especially in knowledge-intensive work settings. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haas|first=M.R.|date=2006|title=Knowledge gathering, team capabilities, and project performance in challenging work environments|url=|journal=Management Science|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1170–1184|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The details about its impact on innovation can be seen in "extension" section.

=== Choice Points, Behavior Cycles and Assembly Rules ===
When information messaging remains an unclear variable, organizations will usually revert to a number of Organizational Information Theory-based methodologies which are designed to encourage ambiguity reduction:

1. '''''Choice Points'''''--Describes an organization's decision to ask: "should we attend to some aspect of our environment that was rejected before?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4575320|title=Process of Organizing: Karl E. Weicks|date=n.d.|website=academia.edu|publisher=|accessdate=November 16, 2014|last1=Felicia|first1=Ratyh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-tracing one's steps can provide both management and individuals with a comfort zone in addressing frequency and volume regarding messaging, lest anything have been missed.

2. '''''Behavior Cycles'''''--Represents "deliberate communication activities on the part of an organization to decrease levels of ambiguity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Lynn H. Turner|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2014|isbn=|edition=Fifth|location=New York City|pages=304+}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, degrees of messaging equivocality have a direct impact on how many cycles are required to alleviate its effects. Within this realm, three distinct steps emerge that are each focused on providing messaging clarity: act, response and adjustment. Each is designed to facilitate the retention and selection process. Examples of behavior cycles include staff meetings, coffee-break rumoring, e-mail conversations, internal reports, etc..

3. '''''Assembly Rules--'''''Signifies a broader construct, "which may include evaluating how standard operating procedures (SOP) are carried out, along with chain-of-command designations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/theory/organize.html|title=Organizing|last=|first=|date=n.d.|website=cmm|publisher=oregonstate.edu|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By its nature, this approach explores protocol measures that might be effective in handling ambiguity, as well as, how related processes might unfold.

== Strategies ==

=== The Principles of Equivocality ===
Three critical principles, or relationship, guide the the process of equivocality reduction. They are: the relationship among equivocality, the rules and the cycles must be carefully analyzed; the relationship between the number of rules and amount of cycles; the relationship between the number of cycles and the amount of equivocality. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

To be specific, Weick posits that the amount of perceived equivocality influence the number of rules.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Generally speaking, there is a negative correlation between the level of equivocality and the amount of rules. To be specific, the more equivocal the message is, the few rules are available to process that information. &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Meanwhile, an inverse relationship also exists between rules and cycles. In other words, fewer rules lead to more use of cycles. Then, the increasing number of cycles used can reduce the equivocality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Stages of Equivocality Reduction===
According to Weick, organizations experience continuous change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weick and Quinn|year=1999|title=Organizational Change and Development|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=50|pages=361–386|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.50.1.361|pmid=15012461}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are ever-adapting, as opposed to a change followed by a period of stagnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational Change and Development 362|last=Weick and Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building off of [[Orlikowski]]’s idea that the changes that take place are not necessarily planned, but rather inevitably occur over time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orlikowki|year=1996|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational Information Theory explains how organizations use information found within the environment to interpret and adjust to change. In the event that the information available in the information environment is highly equivocal, the organization engages in a series of cycles that serve as a means to reduce uncertainty about the message.  A highly equivocal message might require several iterations of the behavior cycles.  An inverse relationship exists between the number of rules established by the organization to reduce equivocality and the number of cycles necessary to reduce equivocality. Similarly, the more cycles used, the less equivocality remains.

'''Enactment''' 

Weick emphasizes the role of action, or enactment in change within an organization. Through a combination of individuals with existing data and external knowledge, and through iterative process of trial and error, ideas are refined until they become actualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nonaka|first=Ikujiro|year=1994|title=A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation|journal=Organization Science|volume=5|page=27|doi=10.1287/orsc.5.1.14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enactment also plays a key role in the idea of [[sensemaking]], the process by which people give meaning to experience. Essentially, the action helps to define the meaning, making those within the organization's environment responsible for the environment itself.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Organizing|last=Weick|first=Karl|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|year=1979|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Selection''' 

Upon analyzing the information the organization possesses, the selection stage includes evaluation of outstanding information necessary to further reduce equivocality.  The organization must decide the best method for obtaining the remaining information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Communication Theory|last=West and Turner|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2004|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the decision-makers of the organization play a key role in this stage.

There are three critical processes happening in this stage: 1) members make a choice among interpretations; 2) members choose the type and amount of rules for processing those interpretations; 3) communication cycles start to work on those interpretations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Retention''' 

The final stage occurs when the organization sifts through the information it has compiled in attempts to adapt to change, and determines which information is beneficial and worth utilizing again.  Inefficient, superfluous and otherwise unnecessary information that do not contribute to the completion of the project or reduction of equivocality will most likely not be retained for future application of similar project.

== Applications ==
=== Application in Health Care ===
One of the key real-world applications regarding Weick's concept of Organizational Information Theory can be found in healthcare. There, he went so far as to personally develop a dedicated [[health communication]]s approach which "emphasizes the central role of communication and information processing within social groups and institutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samples.jbpub.com/9781449697211/28123_CH03_Pass2.pdf|title=Weick's Health Communication Theory|last=Raingruber|first=Bonnie|date=2014|website=samples.jbpub.com|publisher=Jones and Gartlett Learning|pages=71–72|accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Weick's work draws correlations between accuracy of information and the ability of organizations to adapt to change.

Weick's model of organizing plays a powerful role in improving communication of [[health care]] and [[health promotion]]. The OIT enables consumers and providers to reduce equivocality when they face complex health care and health promotion situations. "In health care and health promotion, enactment processes are used to make sense of different health-related challenges, selection processes are used to choose different courses of action in response to these challenges, and retention processes are used to preserve what was learned from enactment and selection processes for guiding future health care/promotion activities".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kreps|first=Gary L.|date=2009-03-01|title=Applying Weick's model of organizing to health care and health promotion: Highlighting the central role of health communication|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399108006423|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|series=Theories in Health Communication Research|volume=74|issue=3|pages=347–355|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2008.12.002|pmid=19150591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the theory can evaluate the problems of excessive nurse turnover in public hospital and develop interventions to address the problems. Hospital administrators used to deal with the problem by making efforts in recruiting nurses. Although the strategy attracted more new nurses, it was expensive to maintain the recruitment efforts. Thus, a retention program was generated under the Weick's model of organizing. The program used questionnaires, in-depth interviews and [[focus group]] discussion to figure out nurses' concerns (enactment). The research's results identified strategies to solve those problems (selection). Then the program gathered further information about nurses' attitude and advice for these strategies and implemented refined strategies (retention).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Application in Education ===
Some scholars advocate that loosely coupled system and [[Garbage Can Model|garbage can model]] guarantee the flexibility of higher education organizations. Proponents of loose coupling system believe that the university's academic freedom and students' individual identity will be destroyed if administrators tighten up the loose coupling. However, Weick argues that the "unpredictability (of an organization) is insufficient evidence for concluding that the elements in a system are loosely coupled".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weick|first=Karl E.|date=1976-01-01|title=Educational Organizations as Loosely Coupled Systems|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.2307/2391875|jstor=2391875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars notice the Weick's warning that loose coupling should not be used as a normative model. Universities will not lose their academic freedom with a tighter coupled system. Frank W. states that "They (universities) are tightly coupled in some aspects and uncoupled in other aspects. Tight coupling occurs when an issue supports the status quo. Uncoupling occurs when an issue challenges the status quo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lutz|first=Frank W.|date=1982-01-01|title=Tightening up Loose Coupling in Organizations of Higher Education|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=27|issue=4|pages=653–669|doi=10.2307/2392536|jstor=2392536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weick's model of organizing can be applied to reduce equivocality in the large-lecture classroom and to increase students' engagement. Large-lecture classroom can be recognized as an information environment with various degrees of equivocality. Students enact assembly rules to make sense of messages in class with low equivocality. Behavior cycles which focus on act, response and adjustment can be utilized by students to clarify messages with high equivocality. "Students assess how the applied rules and cycles affected their ability to interpret the original input's equivocality and decide if additional rules and cycles are needed to develop an effective response to the input".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ledford|first=Christy J. W.|last2=Saperstein|first2=Adam K.|last3=Cafferty|first3=Lauren A.|last4=McClintick|first4=Stacey H.|last5=Bernstein|first5=Ethan M.|year=2015|title=Any Questions? An Application of Weick's Model of Organizing to Increase Student Involvement in the Large-Lecture Classroom|journal=Communication Teacher|volume=29|issue=2|pages=116–128|doi=10.1080/17404622.2014.1003309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some students feel intimidated when they raise questions in the large-lecture classroom. Thus, the synchronicity and anonymous nature of [[Microblogging|microblog]] make itself a second channel to facilitate students' question asking as well as decreases their equivocality. Faculty enables to retain organizational intelligence through microblog format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Application in Conflict Management ===
It is difficult to find two parties share exact same interest. Thus, conflict and cooperation coexist with each other in organizations. Institutionalized [[conflict management]] is frequently used by managers to create sustained organizations. [[Metaphor]]s provides a comprehensive approach to understand and interpret the information environment which includes new knowledge and new practices. "Metaphor created by subsidiary representatives of the conflict management practice reflects the quality and the depth of [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]]". Metaphors can be recognized as a collective sensemaking and a depict of organizational environment. Individuals are able to make decisions which depends on their metaphors about conflict in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Leigh Anne|last2=Inlow|first2=Lin|last3=Feng|first3=Jing Betty|date=2014-12-01|title=Institutionalizing Sustainable Conflict Management in Organizations: Leaders, Networks, and Sensemaking|journal=Conflict Resolution Quarterly|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=155–176|doi=10.1002/crq.21106|issn=1541-1508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==

=== Utility ===
This theory focuses on the process of communication instead of the role of individual actors. It examines the complexities of information processing in lieu of trying to understand people within a group or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last=West and Turner|first=Richard and Lynn|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2001|location=New York|page=306}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this theory closely examines the act of organizing, rather than organizations themselves. Weick defines organizing as, "the resolving of equivocality in an enacted environment by means of interlocked behaviors embedded in conditionally related process" and that, "human beings organize primarily to help them reduce the information uncertainty in their lives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizations: Rational, Natural, and Open Systems|last=Scott|first=W. Richard|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2003|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Logical Consistency ===
Some scholars argue that this theory fails the test of logical consistency and that people are not necessarily guided by rules in an organization. Some organizational members might not have any interest in communication rules and their actions might have more to do with intuition than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Perspectives on Organizational Communication|last=Daniels|first=T.D.|author2=B.D. Spiker|author3=M.J. Papa|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2008|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics posit that organizational information theory views the organization as a static entity, rather than one that changes over time. Dynamic adjustments, such as downsizing, outsourcing and even advancements in technology should be taken into consideration when examining an organization—and organizational information theory does not account for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication as Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|author2=Elizabeth Van Every|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Accociates|year=2000|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this theory assert that it does not deal significantly with [[Command hierarchy|hierarchy]] or [[Social conflict|conflict]], two prominent themes associated with organizational communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication as Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|author2=Elizabeth Van Every|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Accociates|year=2000|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the hierarchical context makes difficulties for sensemaking and proposes a flow of downward negative feedback. Sensemaking process can be applied to explain why employees remain silence in the organization. Two sensemaking resources which are expectation and identity preclude employees from giving upward negative feedback. Employees expect that their negative feedback for supervisors will pose threat to their job security or might be neglected by supervisors. Besides, employees make sense of their own understanding and identify themselves as deficient experts who are unable to make best decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bisel|first=Ryan S.|last2=Arterburn|first2=Elissa N.|date=2012-07-20|title=Making Sense of Organizational Members' Silence: A Sensemaking-Resource Model|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=29|issue=3|pages=217–226|doi=10.1080/08824096.2012.684985|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ===
The theory also neglects the larger social, historical and [[Institutional theory|institutional context]]. The role of the institutional context and [[Cultural cognition|cultural-cognitive]] institutions in sensemaking should be paid more attention to. According to Taylor and Van Every, "what is missing [in Weick’s 1995 ''Sensemaking in Organizations'' version of enactment] ... is an understanding of the organization as a communicational construction or an awareness of the institutionalizing of human society that accompanies organization with its many internal contradictions and tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-LmPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=The+emergent+organization:+Communication+as+its+site+and+surface#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20emergent%20organization:%20Communication%20as%20its%20site%20and%20surface&amp;f=false|title=The Emergent Organization: Communication As Its Site and Surface|last=Taylor|first=James R.|last2=Every|first2=Elizabeth J. Van|date=1999-11-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135691134|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors are constrained by cognition through socialization in the job, school system and the media when they do sensemaking in institutions. It causes less variety and more stability in institutions. In order to expand the theory, [[Mechanism (sociology)|social mechanism]] can be applied to consider how institutions prime, edit and trigger sensemaking besides the traditional cognitive constraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weber|first=Klaus|last2=Glynn|first2=Mary Ann|date=2006-11-01|title=Making Sense with Institutions: Context, Thought and Action in Karl Weick's Theory|url=http://oss.sagepub.com/content/27/11/1639|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=27|issue=11|pages=1639–1660|doi=10.1177/0170840606068343|issn=0170-8406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dr. Brenda Dervin: the Sense-Making Approach ===
As an adjunct to Weick's work regarding organizational information, noted academician (and fellow researcher), Dr. [[Brenda Dervin]], followed a similar path in exploring how ambiguity and uncertainty are handled across platforms.

However, in broaching these issues from a more communication-driven perspective Dr. Dervin found that these issues evolve from a different place; one, in fact, that unlike Weick, assumes "discontinuity between entities, times and spaces". Instead of [[modularity]], "each individual is an entity moving through time and space, dealing with other entities which include other people, artifacts, systems, or institutions. The individual's making of sense as a strategy for bridging these gaps is the central metaphor of the [[Sense-Making Approach]]".&lt;ref name="washington2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pim.ischool.washington.edu/pim06/files/spurgin-paper.pdf&gt;.|title = The Sense-Making Approach and the Study of Personal Information Management|date = 2006|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = ISchool, University of Washington.edu|publisher = University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|last = Spurgin|first = Kristina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilizing this alternate prism, Dr. Dervin found that "patterns of gap-bridging behavior are better-predicted by the way individuals define the gaps in which they find themselves, than by any attributes that might be typically used to define individuals across space and time, such as demographic categories or personality indicators. Situations and people are constantly changing, but patterns of interaction between people and situations as they are defined by people seem to be somewhat more stable".&lt;ref name="washington2006"/&gt;

=== Organizational Information Theory and Innovation ===
"In 2000, the researchers Doughtery, Borrelli, Munir and O'Sullivan discovered that the level of innovation capability within organizations was connected to the ability of making ''the right'' sense of collective experiences in uncertain or ambiguous situations such as radical changes in the market or technology paradigm shifts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/01/17/for-innovation-to-happen-it-makes-sense-to-sensemake|title = For Innovation To Happen It Makes Sense To Sensemake|date = January 17, 2012|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = Innovation Management|publisher = Innovation Psychology|last = Bill|first = Susanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instinctively, it seems, the sensemaking systems of less innovative companies appeared to be inhibited by tendencies to "play within existing rules...filter out unexpected information or unorthodox competency sets, resulting in [[groupthink]] and more of the same". Meanwhile, "innovative organizations ...dared to challenge existing business logic and made use of new insights"...these, in turn, were used to "change existing interpretations and schemes and thus, influence the overall evolvement of the organization so that the interpretation schemes themselves became more apt to deal with outside forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.innovationmanagement.se/2012/01/17/for-innovation-to-happen-it-makes-sense-to-sensemake|title = For Innovation to Happen It Makes Sense To Sensemake|date = January 17, 2012|accessdate = November 16, 2014|website = Innovation Management|publisher = Innovation Psychology|last = Bill|first = Susanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weick proposes three dynamics which are closely relevant to innovation: "that the knowledge is both tacit and articulated, that linking processes cut across several levels of organizational action, and that linking processes embody several tensions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nz1RT-xskeoC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=sensemaking+in+organizations+weick#v=onepage&amp;q=sensemaking%20in%20organizations%20weick&amp;f=false|title=Sensemaking in Organizations|last=Weick|first=Karl E.|date=1995-05-31|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780803971776|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study applies these dynamics and organizational sensemaking to analyze how people make sense of market and technology knowledge for product innovation. Innovative organizations have a system of sensemaking that allows actors to "construct, bracket, interpret, and rethink the right kinds of market and technology knowledge in the right way for innovation". However, actors in non-innovative organizations make sense of knowledge in a separate way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dougherty|first=Deborah|last2=Borrelli|first2=Leslie|last3=Munir|first3=Kamal|last4=O’Sullivan|first4=Alan|date=2000-09-01|title=Systems of organizational sensemaking for sustained product innovation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092347480000028X|journal=Journal of Engineering and Technology Management|volume=17|issue=3–4|pages=321–355|doi=10.1016/S0923-4748(00)00028-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computer-mediated Communication(CMC) and Sensemaking ===
[[Computer-mediated communication]] have gradually become an essential part of communication in current work context and organizational settings. Weick proposes that sensemaking away from terminals experiences five procedures: effectuate, triangulate, affiliate, deliberate, and consolidate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

According to Garphart, compared with in traditional workplace, sensemaking in electronically enabled work place becomes more complex and ambigous.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gephart|first=R. P.|date=2004|title=Sensemaking and New Media at Work|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=48|issue=4|pages=479–495|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and act differently in the above five procedures. To be specific. four distinct features can be seen. Firstly, the process of reciprocity is much confined. The reciprocity of perspectives might be delayed when communicators are at different "terminals". Also, sensory cues are nearly absent in this process, while textual communication is commonly used. In other words communication modes are limited. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Secondly, the levels of equivocality and the difficulties of sensemaking increase. The problems of understanding computer or new technical terms emerge as a new obstacle to be overcome for achieving sensemaking in organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pentland|first=B.|date=1995|title="Read me what it says on your screen": The interpretive problem in technical service work|url=|journal=Technology Studies|volume=2|pages=50–79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thirdly, less [https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/et+cetera+principle etcetera principles] can be used to in CMC. In other words, CMC tend to build up a rigidly structured communication environment, due to which, people will find it harder to gain additional information from outside the computer system. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Lastly, CMC alters the occupational tasks. Some technical background or computer-related knowledge are required to support general occupational tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In the age of the smart machine: The future of work and power|last=Zuboff|first=S.|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major models proposed to explain the sensemaking with CMC in organizations: Weick's cognitive model and a social interaction model.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  

Weick believes that people will increasingly encounter with problems to make sense information with new technology. Cognitive Model posits states that new computer technologies have a huge impact on sensemaking in organizations in five aspects. First, actions deficiencies always happen because real objects can not be fully captured and represented by simulated images and symbols. Second, comparisons are often deficient due to limited reciprocity of perspectives and nearly absent feedback based on direct action. Third, works at terminals are always solitary and will decrease affiliation of communication. Fourth, constant inflow of information in computer interrupt or even prevent the deliberation. Lastly, sensemaking at terminals always leads to consolidation deficiencies due to self-contained nature of computer. &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weick|first=K.|date=1985|title=Cosmos vs. Chaos: Sense and Nonsense in Electronic Contexts|url=|journal=Organizational Dynamics|volume=14|issue=2|pages=51–64|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Social Interactional Model, deriving from [[phenomenological sociology]] and [[ethnomethodology]], emphasizes the intersubjective and objective features of sensemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The phenomenology of the social world|last=Schutz|first=A.|publisher=Heinemann Educational Books|year=1967|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intersubjective feature reveals that people always try to obtain subjective meanings of others. In CMC, communicators are required to actively figure out whether they share meanings with others, including computers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In this process, people are expected to use normal form objects, terms and utterances to portray correctly the contexts and experiences in order to let computer recognize. &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gephart|first=R.P.|date=1993|title=The textual approach: Risk and blame in disaster sensemaking|url=|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=36|pages=1465–1514|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, increasing number of knowledge are needed to achieve sensemaking than that in traditional workplace. Thus, etcetera principle come into use to deal with vague or implicit meanings.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; People will actively seek additional information to clarify the meanings.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Meanwhile, descriptive vocabularies are used as [[Indexical expression|indexical expressions]] to assist people to resolve equivocal meanings based on contextual, cultural, technical knowledge and information. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''The Pirbright Institute''' (formerly the '''Institute for Animal Health''') is a [[research institute]] in [[Surrey]], England, dedicated to the study of [[infectious disease]]s of [[livestock|farm animals]]. It forms part of the [[Her Majesty's Government|UK government's]] [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC). The Institute employs scientists, vets, PhD students and operations staff.

==History==
It began in 1914 to test cows for [[tuberculosis]]. More buildings were added in 1925. Compton was established by the [[Agricultural Research Council]] in 1937. Pirbright became a research institute in 1939 and Compton in 1942. The Houghton Poultry Research Station at [[Houghton, Cambridgeshire]] was established in 1948. In 1963 Pirbright became the Animal Virus Research Institute and Compton became the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases. The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU) was established in Edinburgh in 1981. This became part of the [[Roslin Institute]] in 2007.

In 1987, Compton, Houghton and Pirbright became the Institute for Animal Health, being funded by BBSRC. Houghton closed in 1992, operations at Compton are being rapidly wound down with the site due to close in 2015.

The [[Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research]] was sited at Compton until October 2005.

Significant investment (over £170 million) is taking place at Pirbright with the development of new world class laboratory and animal facilities. The Institute has been known as "The Pirbright Institute" since October 2012.

==Directors of note==

*Dr [[John Burns Brooksby]] 1964 until 1980&lt;ref&gt;http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/roybiogmem/53/77.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The work previously carried out at Compton has either moved out to the university sector, ended or has been transferred to the Pirbright Site. The Compton site currently carries out work on [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] (commonplace) animal diseases including some Avian Viruses and a small amount of Bovine Immunology whilst Pirbright works on exotic (unusual) [[animal diseases]] (usually caused by virus outbreaks). Pirbright has National and International Reference Laboratories of diseases.

===Funding===
25% of its income comes from a core grant from the BBSRC of around £11m.  Around 50% comes from research grants from related government organisations, such as DEFRA, or industry and charities (such as the [[Wellcome Trust]]). The remaining 25% comes from direct payments for work carried out.

==Function==
The Pirbright Institute carries out research, diagnostics and surveillance [[Animal virology|viruses]] carried by animals, such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), African swine fever, bluetongue, lumpy skin disease and avian and swine flu  [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.  Understanding of viruses comes from [[molecular biology]].

It carries out surveillance activities on farm animal health and disease movement in the UK.

== Location ==
The Institute had two sites at:
* [[Compton, Berkshire|Compton]] in [[Berkshire]] - This was closed in early 2016 and services relocated to Pirbright where new facilities had been constructed.
* [[Pirbright]] in [[Surrey]] — shared with commercial company [[Merial]]

It has some relation to the [[problem play]]. The viewer of the picture is invited to speculate about several different possible explanations of the scene.  The genre has much in common with that of [[book illustration]], then at its most popular, but with the text belonging to the illustration omitted.&lt;ref&gt;See David Skilton,“The Centrality of Literary Illustration in Victorian Visual Culture: the example of Millais and Trollope from 1860 to 1864.” Journal of Illustration Studies (December 2007). 14 May 2014. &lt;http://jois.uia.no/articles.php?article=30&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The genre began to emerge in the second half of the nineteenth century, along with the development of book illustrations that depicted "pregnant" moments in a narrative. One of the earliest problem pictures is [[John Everett Millais]]' ''Trust Me'', which depicts an older man demanding that a young woman hand him a letter she has received. Either character might be uttering the words. The significance and content of the letter is left to the imagination.  Their relationship is also unclear; in view of their ages, they might be a married couple, or a father and daughter. 

Other artists who worked in the genre included [[William Frederick Yeames]], whose ''"[[And When Did You Last See Your Father? (picture)|And when did you last see your father?]]"'' became the most famous example of the genre. It depicts a young boy of the [[English civil war]] period being gently interrogated by [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] troops who are looking for his Royalist father. It is implied that they are asking a trick question designed to discover his location. The painting is poised at the moment the child is about to answer. Yeames painted many other works of this type, including ''Amy Robsart'' and ''Defendant and Counsel''. When the latter was exhibited a newspaper ran a competition for readers to guess what crime the woman was accused of.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm Obituary of Yeames] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822202258/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/biog/yeames.htm |date=2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sickert.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Walter Sickert, ''The Camden Town Murder'', originally titled, ''What Shall We Do for the Rent?'' or ''What Shall We Do to Pay the Rent'' 1908]]
Some [[avant garde]] artists also experimented with the genre, notably [[Edgar Degas]] and his follower [[Walter Sickert]]. Degas's [[Interior (Degas)|''Interior'']] (1869) depicts an ambiguous scene suggestive of sexual transgression and violence (hence the alternative title of "the Rape"). Similar ambiguity is found in Sickert's ''[[The Camden Town Murder]]'' (1908), in which the two figures can be interpreted as a couple, or a killer and his victim.

The genre continued to be popular into the early twentieth century, but was by this time increasingly seen as old fashioned and as over-literary, against the emphasis on pictorial style and form characteristic of [[impressionism]] and [[post-impressionism]].

'''Refund to Savings''' (R2S) is an innovative, rigorously designed and scalable program intended to help low-income households build savings and increase financial security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx Refund to Savings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204204502/http://csd.wustl.edu/AssetBuilding/Pages/Refund-to-savings.aspx |date=2013-02-04 }}. Center for Social Development, Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of a collaboration between the [[Center for Social Development]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Duke University]], and [[Intuit|Intuit Inc]]. R2S is the largest savings experiment conducted in the United States to date. This initiative builds on Intuit’s [[TurboTax]] Free File Alliance Online product, available free to lower-income taxpayers, to reach thousands of households.

The goal of the initiative is to design and test a low-touch, scalable intervention that can transform the tax-refund windfall into savings to improve financial security. The intervention builds on existing infrastructure and integrates with normal financial behavior, so it can quickly and inexpensively be expanded to reach millions of American households.

==Key Researchers and Partners==

The experiment was developed by economics professors [[Michal Grinstein-Weiss]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and  [[Dan Ariely]] at [[Duke University]] and uses [[Intuit Inc|Intuit's]] TurboTax tax preparation software.

==Background==

The moment people are notified about their tax refund is a golden opportunity to divert money into short- and long-term savings. The participant just learned they will be receiving money, the money feels like a windfall (outside of their normal income pattern) and they do not yet have the money in hand.

The R2S initiative capitalizes on this opportunity. The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. For example, would mentioning the names of the taxpayer’s children increases the desire to divert money? Or would providing taxpayers a sense 
of common behavior among their peers motivate increased debt clearing?

The R2S initiative is designed to help us better understand the exact mechanisms that would convince individuals to divert money to savings and debt clearing at this golden moment. The prompts are informed by behavioral economics principles and have been shown in prior research to significantly increase savings intention in lower-income taxpayers. The variation in the prompts tests the influence of particular motivations on financial decision-making, compared with an unprompted control group. The variation in defaults tests the effect of defaults and of anchoring on savings behavior.

==Research Agenda==

The R2S initiative involves collecting three streams of data to evaluate the impact of the intervention and inform the design of future innovations to build savings, including the Intention Survey, In-Product Saving Offer, and Household Financial Survey.

===Intention Survey===

The Intention Survey is cross-sectional and designed to elicit information about possible behaviors and responses to behavioral economics-inspired prompts. It also gauges ownership of financial products (e.g., checking account, savings bond) and interest in using or opening these products at tax time. Findings from the Intention Survey contributed to the development of the In-Product Saving Offer and the Household Financial Survey. In 2012, 4,087 Intuit customers responded to the Intention Survey.

===In-Product Saving Offer===
The In-Product Saving Offer is the largest saving experiment ever undertaken in the U.S. TurboTax Freedom Edition users with refunds are assigned randomly to a treatment condition or control group. The control group uses the regular TurboTax program. The treatment group uses a version of the program in which they receive a prompt and a saving opportunity designed to increase saving. Data generated by program use and refund allocation behavior will be evaluated to determine whether the prompts, saving opportunity, or both increased saving levels compared to the control groups. In 2012, 150,000 people were included in the study, and about 1 million tax filers are expected to be included in 2013.

===Household Financial Survey===
The Household Financial Survey (HFS) is a longitudinal cohort study designed to determine the impact of tax-time saving and examine the effects of supply (e.g., availability of and access to savings products) and demand (e.g., awareness of the need for [[precautionary savings]]) factors that may influence the use and impact of the intervention. HFS participants will be sampled from those randomized in the In-Product Saving Offer and surveyed immediately after tax filing and again six months later. The HFS will allow R2S researchers to understand the impact of saving on the financial lives of households by (a) describing the context in which people choose to save at tax time, (b) determining if savings initiated by the In-Product Offer are new (i.e., not money that would have been saved in the absence of the intervention), and (c) verifying whether the savings ultimately increase households’ financial security. In 2012, the HFS pilot included about 350 households, and the research team expects about 12,000 households to participate in the study in 2013.

==Impact==
Ultimately, R2S has numerous implications for ongoing policy discussions at state and federal levels. First, the findings will show whether (a) the use of behavioral economics-inspired interventions can increase saving at tax time and (b) saving-promotion efforts yield increased financial security and improved household balance sheets. Second, the project could provide evidence on the effect of supply- and demand-side constraints to saving and thus inform policy discussions regarding financial access, financial knowledge, and consumer protection. Third, the design and operation of the R2S initiative may be of interest to those considering policy innovations that leverage private-sector resources or incorporate public-private partnerships to achieve public policy objectives.

The team is also planning an ambitious program of dissemination to share R2S findings with a variety of audiences. Several policy, academic, and general interest publications will be produced detailing the impact of the experiment and findings from the research in each year. R2S also plans to host events to share interesting findings with the research and policy communities and with the general public.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9725">In [[biogeography]] and [[paleontology]] a '''relict''' is a [[population]] or [[taxon]] of organisms that was more widespread or more diverse in the past. A '''relictual population''' is a population that presently occurs in a restricted area, but whose original [[Range (biology)|range]] was far wider during a previous [[Geologic time scale|geologic epoch]]. Similarly, a '''relictual taxon''' is a taxon (e.g. species or other lineage) that is the sole surviving representative of a formerly diverse group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Habel|first1=Jan C.|last2=Assmann|first2=Thorsten|last3=Schmitt|first3=Thomas|last4=Avise|first4=John C.|editor1-last=Habel|editor1-first=Jan Christian|editor2-last=Assmann|editor2-first=Thorsten|title=Relict species: Phylogeography and Conservation Biology|date=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540921608|pages=1–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vMTCbd_7qWUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Relict Species: From Past to Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A relict (or relic) plant or animal is a [[taxon]] that persists as a remnant of what was once a diverse and widespread population. Relictualism occurs when a widespread habitat or range changes and a small area becomes cut off from the whole. A subset of the population is then confined to the available hospitable area, and survives there while the broader population either shrinks or [[Divergent evolution|evolves divergently]]. This phenomenon differs from [[endemism]] in that the range of the population was not always restricted to the local region. In other words, the species or group did not necessarily arise in that small area, but rather was stranded, or insularized, by changes over time. The agent of change could be anything from [[Competition (biology)|competition]] from other organisms, [[continental drift]], or [[climate change]] such as an [[ice age]].

==Examples==
A notable example is the [[thylacine]] of Tasmania, a relict [[marsupial]] carnivore that survived into modern times on an island whereas the rest of its species on mainland Australia had long ago gone extinct.&lt;ref name = "Quammen"&gt;{{Cite book

However, a relict need not be currently living. An evolutionary relict is any organism that was characteristic of the flora or fauna of one age and that persisted into a later age, with the later age being characterized by newly evolved flora or fauna significantly different from those that came before.

An example from the fossil record would be a specimen of [[Nimravidae]], an extinct branch of [[Carnivora|carnivore]]s in the mammalian evolutionary tree, if said specimen came from Europe in the [[Miocene]] epoch. If that was the case, the specimen would represent, not the main population, but a last surviving remnant of the nimravid lineage. These carnivores were common and widespread in the previous epoch, the [[Oligocene]], and disappeared when the climate changed and woodlands were replaced by savanna. They persisted in Europe in the last remaining forests as a relict of the Oligocene: a relict species in a relict habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

An example of divergent evolution creating relicts is found in the shrews of the islands off the coast of Alaska, namely the [[Pribilof Island shrew]] and the [[St. Lawrence Island shrew]].  These species are apparently relicts of a time when the islands were connected to the mainland, and these species were once conspecific with a more widespread species, now the [[cinereus shrew]], the three populations having diverged through [[speciation]].&lt;ref name = "Smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite book

In [[botany]], an example of an ice age relict plant population is the [[Snowdon lily]], notable as being precariously rare in Wales. The Welsh population is confined to the north-facing slopes of [[Snowdonia]], where climatic conditions are apparently similar to ice age Europe. Some have expressed concern that the warming climate will cause the lily to die out in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A well-studied botanical example of a relictual taxon is ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'', the last living representative of [[Ginkgoales]] that is restricted to China in the wild. ''Ginkgo'' trees had a diverse and widespread northern distribution during the [[Mesozoic]], but are not known from the fossil record after the [[Pliocene]] other than ''G. biloba''.&lt;ref name=ZhouZheng&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[Relict leopard frog]] once found throughout [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]] but now only found at [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area]] in Nevada and Arizona

==Relevance==
The concept of relictualism is useful in understanding the ecology and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status of populations that have become insularized, meaning confined to one small area or multiple small areas with no chance of movement between populations. Insularization makes a population vulnerable to forces that can lead to [[extinction]], such as disease, [[inbreeding]], [[habitat destruction]], competition from [[introduced species]], and [[global warming]]. Consider the case of the [[white-eyed river martin]], a very localized species of bird found only in Southeast Asia, and extremely rare, if not already extinct. Its closest and only surviving living relative is the [[African river martin]], also very localized in central Africa. These two species are the only known members of the subfamily Pseudochelidoninae, and their widely disjunct populations suggest they are relict populations of a more common and widespread ancestor. Known to science only since 1968, it seems to have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Studies have been done on relict populations in isolated mountain and valley habitats in western North America, where the [[basin and range]] topography creates areas that are insular in nature, such as forested mountains surrounded by inhospitable desert, called [[sky island]]s. Such situations can serve as [[Refugium (population biology)|refuges]] for certain [[Pleistocene]] relicts, such as [[Townsend's pocket gopher]],&lt;ref name = "Smithsonian"/&gt; while at the same time creating barriers for [[biological dispersal]]. Studies have shown that such insular habitats have a tendency toward decreasing [[species richness]]. This observation has significant implications for conservation biology, because [[habitat fragmentation]] can also lead to the insularization of stranded populations.&lt;ref name = "Quammen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''ResearchChannel''' was an [[educational television]] network based at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and operated by a [[consortium]] of leading [[research]] and [[academia|academic]] institutions which contributed science-related programming to viewers in the United States and in other countries via [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]].

The University of Washington subsidized the operation of ResearchChannel since its founding, without direct compensation from the ResearchChannel consortium. This included providing all staff time and efforts, satellite uplink, and commodity internet bandwidth.

In March 2010, citing budget issues, the University of Washington informed the ResearchChannel Board that UW would end this subsidy; and cease programming and uplinking the channel and maintaining the website. The Research Channel board was unable to find a new sponsor and service provider. At midnight on August 31, 2010, ResearchChannel was shut down on [[Galaxy 18]], along with its broadcast on [[Dish Network]], [[Comcast]], and other terrestrial broadcasting services.

A '''sign system''' is a key concept in [[semiotics]] and is used to refer to any system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]] and relations between signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beynon-Davies P.|year=2010|title=Dances with bees: exploring the relevance of the study of animal communication to informatics|journal=International Journal of Information Management|volume=30|number=1|pages=185–198|doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2010.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[language]]'' is frequently used as a synonym for a sign-system. However, the term ''sign-system'' is preferable to the term ''language'' for a number of reasons. First, the use of the term ''language'' tends to carry with it [[connotation]]s of human language, particularly human spoken language. Human spoken language is only one example of a sign-system; albeit probably one of the most complex sign-systems known.

For example, in traditional forms of face-to-face communication, humans communicate through [[non-verbal communication|non-verbal]] as well as verbal sign-systems; colloquially, this can be referred to as [[body language]]. Hence, humans communicate a great deal by way of facial movements and other forms of bodily expression. Such expressions are also signs and an organised collection of such signs would be considered a sign system. Second, the same concept of a sign-system can be used in considering a vast range of  communication forms such as [[animal communication]] and [[Man-machine interface|man-machine communication]]. Examination of simpler forms of such systems of signs within non-human communication can help to illuminate some of the essence of [[communication]] and in particular can help to provide tentative answers to the question of the nature and function of communication.

== History ==
===Founding===
[[Lalith Athulathmudali]] originally acquired the 25 acre land where SLIIT stands today in the 1980s in the expectation of building a Technological University and the headquarters of the [[Mahapola Trust Fund]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Minister of Commerce [[Kingsley Wickramaratne]] and [[Richard Pathirana]] would eventually use the land for establishing SLIIT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adhikari|first=Deepthi Pramitha|title=Mahapola &amp; SLIIT|url=http://www.divaina.com/2016/08/07/feature17.html|accessdate=9 December 2016|newspaper=Divaina|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology was established in 1999 by incorporation under the Companies Act of 2007 as a [[nonprofit]] company by guarantee (registration number GL 24) with the ability to award [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees following amendments to the Universities Act the same year, thus gaining recognition from the [[University Grants Commission of Sri Lanka|University Grants Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documents.gov.lk/files/egz/2016/2/1955-20_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.drc.gov.lk/App/comreg.nsf/pageS?OpenPage&amp;Start=17500 |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009150649/http://www.drc.gov.lk/App/comreg.nsf/pageS?OpenPage&amp;Start=17500 |archive-date=9 October 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.documents.gov.lk/files/egz/2012/11/1785-22_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SLIIT was established primarily to educate and train information technology professionals.

===Expansions===
Initially limited to the fields of information technology and computing, in 2007 SLIIT  expanding into new fields of study. These include [[electronic engineering]] and [[Business|business management]] in collaboration with [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itpro.lk/node/1109 SLIIT offers UK recognised BBA Degrees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125215421/http://itpro.lk/node/1109 |date=25 November 2010 }}, ITpro.lk&lt;/ref&gt; SLIIT also expanded its presence from [[Colombo]] and its suburbs to other parts of the country, by establishing centres in [[Kandy]] and [[Matara, Sri Lanka|Matara]], making SLIIT accessible in six locations. Presently, SLIIT operates two campuses - the Colombo Metropolitan Campus at Kollupitiya, and the Malabe Campus, with centres in Matara, Kandy, Jaffna and Kurunegala with an undergraduate student population of over 7,000. A further 1,000 students follow master's degree Programmes, Postgraduate Diploma and other Professional Development Programmes.

This was following in 2012, with the establishment of the Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM); the first internationally recognised school for tourism and hospitality management in Sri Lanka. The project is a joint venture of SLIIT, Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management (CAHM),&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;[http://www.cahm.lk Colombo Academy of Hospitality Management]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Angliss Institute of TAFE|William Angliss Institute]] of Australia. It has been developed in line with international standards, housing a multi-use training kitchen, a full-scale banqueting facility, training restaurant, model bedrooms, an IT training centre and team rooms for students' practical training to prepare students for the degree of Bachelor of Tourism and Hospitality Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Globally recognised Hospitality Management degree now offered for the first time in Sri Lanka at SLIIT |url=http://www.sliit.lk/news/globally-recognised-hospitality-management-degree-now-offered-for-the-first-time-in-sri-lanka-at-sliit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History of SLIIT|url=http://www.sliit.lk/history-sliit/|accessdate=2 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502081130/http://www.sliit.lk/history-sliit/|archive-date=2 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The faculty of engineering was formed in 2013, with it awarding its own [[Bachelor of Science in Engineering]] degrees and master's degrees from partner universities such as [[Curtin University]] and [[Sheffield Hallam University]].&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE UNIVERSITIES ACT, No. 16 OF 1978|journal=The Gazette of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka|date=21 November 2012|issue=1785/22|url=http://documents.gov.lk/Extgzt/2012/PDF/Nov/1785_22/1785_22%20(E).pdf|accessdate=2 June 2015}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLIIT Computing was established as a privately managed subsidiary of SLIIT in [[Kollupitiya]] to further expand undergraduate studies.

'''''The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits''''' (sometimes shortened to ''Worms'') is an 1881 book by [[Charles Darwin]] on [[earthworms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the action of Worms, with observations on their Habits''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1882|pages=179–202|volume=153|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092526755;view=1up;seq=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his last scientific book, and was published shortly before his death (see [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms]]). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes over long periods of time can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil [[bioturbation]], although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).

==Paper "On the Formation of Mould"==
After returning from the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey expedition]] in October 1836, Darwin was intensively occupied with further establishing his reputation as an innovative geologist, as well as finding suitable experts to describe his [[natural history]] collections and arranging for publication of their work as the multi-volume ''[[Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle]]''. Near the outset of the voyage he had planned a book on geology, and during it extracts from his letters on geology had been privately published by his tutor [[John Stevens Henslow]]. Darwin now published papers on "proofs of recent elevation on the coast of Chili", "deposits containing extinct Mammalia" and "coral formations". He also rewrote his journal to incorporate observations from his notebooks as the book now called ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'', and began brain-storming in his notebooks about [[transmutation of species]].&lt;ref name=vw&gt;{{Harvnb|van Wyhe|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin’s health suffered from the pressure of work, and on 20 September 1837 having been urged by his doctors "knock off all work" he visited his home in [[Shrewsbury]] then went on to stay with his relatives at [[Maer Hall]], Staffordshire, home of his uncle [[Josiah Wedgwood II|Josiah Wedgwood]]. Uncle Jos pointed out an area of ground where [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[cinders]] spread years previously had vanished into the soil, forming layers under a top layer of [[loam]]. Jos suggested that this might have been the work of [[earthworm]]s, but apparently thought that this would be of little interest to his nephew, who was working on continental scale geological problems.&lt;ref name=dm233&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Charles did find it interesting and throughout his life he sustained an interest in this "unsung creature which, in its untold millions, transformed the land as the [[coral]] polyps did the tropical sea".&lt;!-- Add citation --&gt;

He returned to London on October 21st, and prepared a paper on worms forming mould.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|2006|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR158.1–76&amp;pageseq=22 12 verso–13 recto]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper on the role of earthworms in [[Pedogenesis|soil formation]] was read out by Darwin at the [[Geological Society of London]] on 1 November 1837.&lt;ref name=ew38&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1838}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an uncommonly mundane subject for the society, and his peers may have hoped to hear of something more grandiose, even seeing this paper as highlighting Darwin's growing idiosyncrasies.&lt;ref name=dm233/&gt; The leading geologist [[William Buckland]] subsequently recommended Darwin's paper for publication, praising it as "a new &amp; important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence on the surface of the Earth—in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.&lt;ref name=Letter404&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-404.html |title=Darwin Correspondence Project – Letter 404 – Buckland, William to Geological Society of London, 9 Mar 1838 |accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper appeared in the ''Proceedings of the Geological Society of London'' in 1838,&lt;ref name=ew38/&gt; and was published with a [[woodcut]] illustration in the ''Transactions of the Geological Society'' in 1840.&lt;ref name=ew40&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewed work on earthworms==
From his brain-storming about transmutation towards the end of 1838, Darwin conceived of his theory of [[natural selection]] "by which to work", as his "prime hobby". His main work on the ''Beagle'' collections continued, and in 1842 he published the first of three volumes on geology, ''[[The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs]]''. He then allowed himself to write out the first "pencil sketch" of his theory. Subsequently, in September 1842, the family moved to rural [[Down House]] where he had space for experimental plant and animal breeding, and surroundings to observe nature.&lt;ref name=vw/&gt; In December of that year he had a quantity of broken chalk spread over a part of a long established pasture field near the house, "for the sake of observing at some future period to what depth it would become buried."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1881|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1357&amp;pageseq=154 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 he was having disagreements with [[St George Mivart]] about ''[[The Descent of Man]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} Darwin cut communication with Mivart {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and went the less controversial direction of the lowly worm. His network of [[correspondence of Charles Darwin|correspondents]] and fans responded to his interest and "earthworm anecdotes began surfacing in his mountain of mail". He had been interested in earthworms "since his first fishing days at The Mount and flirting days at Maer". Still, other work constrained him. Broken off from ''Descent'', he had to finish his next work ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stonehenge 1877.JPG|left|thumb|His research included a railway trip to [[Stonehenge]]]]
By 1876, with his [[Bernard Darwin|first grandson]] on the way, he felt his writing life was nearly over, with so much unfinished. He wanted to write on earthworms "before joining them", but also had two more plant books in mind, and a revision of ''[[Fertilisation of Orchids]]'' to work on. He also began an [[The Autobiography of Charles Darwin|autobiographical work]] intended for his family's eyes only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 622}}&lt;/ref&gt; After turning away a request to support a controversial book on contraception (''[[Fruits of Philosophy]]'') – Darwin was opposed to it – he got back to work on flowers and worms. As with much of his geological and [[evolution]]ary work, worms were a case of [[gradualism|gradual]], barely noticeable changes accumulating over time into large effects. He even went on a two-hour excursion to [[Stonehenge]] to see how its monoliths had been buried by earthworm castings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was occupied by worms at [[Downe]] in 1880, his work coming first. He had help from the family, even receiving soil samples from [[Abinger]]'s Roman ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 643}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told Vladimir Kovalevsky (his Russian translator) of slow progress with his new book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earthworm klitellum copulation beentree.jpg|thumb|Earthworms mate in daylight, but are generally [[nocturnal]] above ground.]]
Darwin calculated that there were 53,767 earthworms recycling away per acre. He carried out experiments indoors, where they worked the earth inside pots in a worm-littered room. He experimented with stimuli at night: strong light would send them into their burrows ("like a rabbit" said Darwin's grandson Bernard), but heat and sound had no effect. Their food preferences were also tested, raw carrots being their favourite.&lt;ref name="Moore1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darwin restored2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A photograph of Darwin around the time the book was published.]]
Darwin was fascinated by their [[ethology|behaviour]], from enjoying "the pleasure of eating" (based on their eagerness for certain foods) to their [[mating|sexual passions]], "strong enough to overcome... their dread of light", even to their social feelings ("crawling over each other's bodies").&lt;ref name="Moore1991a"&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 650}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[foraging]] was especially intriguing: they dragged leaves into their burrows, pulling them in the most efficient way, by their pointed end. On these semi-intelligent creatures Darwin wrote that they obtained a "notion, however rude, of the shape of an object", perhaps by feeling it out. Worms, "five or six feet" below the ground ploughed farmers fields. Darwin felt we "ought to be grateful" to these little recyclers, which he compared to "a man... born blind and deaf". He was wondering how long it would be until he would be consumed by worms himself{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. It would surely be his last major work; he told German translator [[Julius Victor Carus|Victor Carus]] "I have little strength &amp; feel very old".&lt;ref name="Moore1991" /&gt;

By 1881 he was unable to summon the strength for revisions and handed ''Worms'' on to [[Francis Darwin|Frank]]. His [[illness of Charles Darwin|health]] gave him troubles; he complained to his long-time friend [[Joseph Dalton Hooker|Hooker]] that he looked forward to "Down graveyard as the sweetest place on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the book he had been anticipating for decades, he hurried his publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] to hasten publication of ''Worms'' even at the risk of not making a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a dinner with [[Edward Aveling]] (soon the son-in-law of [[Karl Marx]]) and other [[atheist]]s, he was asked how he had turned to such an "insignificant" subject as worms, to which he replied "I have been studying their habits for forty years." As with his [[Charles Darwin's views on religion|religious views]], the old naturalist did not see things the same way as Aveling. In Darwin's view, the "insignificant" was the foundation of much greater phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Darwin. Earthworm, Fig. 4B.JPG|thumb|A casting from the Nilgiri Mountains in South India]]
Worms are found in many places, from the forest floor to mountains, and in many locations around the world. Though they are considered terrestrial animals, they are really semi-aquatic, like other [[annelid]]s; they die quickly in air but survive for months in water. Though inactive during the day, they sometimes come out of their burrows at night. They are eaten by [[thrush (bird)|thrush]]es and other birds in large numbers because they lie close to the surface. They have well developed muscular, nervous, circulatory and digestive systems, the latter being quite unique. Though eyeless, they respond to the intensity and duration of light. They also slowly respond to temperature. They have no hearing, but are sensitive to vibrations. Their sense of smell is feeble, but they are able to find their preferred foods. [[Omnivorous]] animals, they swallow much earth and extract food from it. Worms live chiefly on half decayed [[leaf|leaves]], partially digested by a [[Pancreatic juice|pancreatic solution]] before ingestion. This extra-stomachal digestion is not unlike that which Darwin had previously described as occurring in [[Insectivorous Plants (book)|''Insectivorous Plants'']]. The structure and physiology of the [[Oligochaeta#Internal anatomy|calciferous glands]] of earthworms are described. Many hypotheses had been advanced for their function; Darwin believed them to be primarily for [[excretion]] and secondarily a [[digestion]] aid.

Thin leaves are seized with the mouth, while thick ones are dragged by creating a vacuum. Leaves and stones are used to plug up the burrow. This may deter predators, keep out water and/or keep out chilled air (the latter is Darwin's preferred function). Leaves are dragged in mostly by the tips, which is the easiest way of doing it, but when the base is narrower the worms change behaviour. They drag [[pine needle]] clusters in by the base. [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]]s are used to plug up burrows, and for food. Worms drag experimental triangles of paper by the apex most of the time, and do not rely on [[trial and error]]. Worms excavate burrows by consuming material or, preferably, pushing it away. They mainly consume [[soil]] for nutrients. They are found down to six or more feet, especially in extreme conditions. Burrows are lined, which serve several functions, and terminate in a chamber lined with stones or seeds. Worms are found all over the planet, some on isolated islands; how they got there is a mystery. Darwin draws on correspondence with people from around the world such as [[Fritz Müller]] in Brazil.

[[File:Darwin, Earthworm, Fig.  7.JPG|thumb|Figure from the book showing a sunken stone from Stonehenge]]
The amount of earth brought to the surface by worms can be estimated by the rate at which objects on the surface are buried and by weighing the earth brought up in a given time. Information from farmers on marl, cinders etc. sinking into the ground allowed Darwin to make calculations. He conducted a 29-year experiment on chalk at a field near his house. Objects of all sorts "work themselves downards" as farmers say. Large stones sink because worms fill up any hollows with castings, then eject them beyond the perimeter and the ground around them starts to rise. He visited [[Stonehenge]] and found some outer stones partly buried, the turf sloping up to meet them (see figure 7). Darwin weighed castings and had friends do so in other countries. He also weighed castings per unit area per year, then worked out how thick a layer castings would make, compared with rates of sinking. Additionally, he worked out casting weight per worm per year.

[[File:Darwins Wurmstein im Gras, Naturhistorisches Museum Wien.jpg|thumb|Darwin's experiments included measuring the speed with which stones slowly settle into the earth.]]
Worms have preserved many ancient objects under the ground. Darwin describes an ancient [[Roman villa]] in [[Abinger]], Surrey. Worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. Similar subsidence occurred at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], Hampshire, with worms penetrating gaps between the tiles. His sons [[Francis Darwin|Francis]] and [[Horace Darwin|Horace]] visited [[Chedworth Roman Villa]] in Gloucestershire, while William reported on [[Brading Roman Villa]], Isle of Wight. Darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester Roman Town]], Hampshire, with the help of the Rev. J. G. Joyce. Finally he discusses the case of the [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]] Roman town ruins at [[Wroxeter]], Shropshire, with the help of Dr. H. Johnson, who made observations including depth of vegetable mould. He concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins.

[[Denudation]] (removal of matter to a lower level) is caused mainly by air and water movement. [[Humic acid]]s generated by worms disintegrate rock; their burrowing behaviour speeds this up. But as the soil layer thickens, this process is slowed down. Worms swallow hard objects (e.g. stones) to aid digestion, which causes attrition to such objects. This has geological significance, especially for the smaller particles which otherwise are eroded very slowly.

Rain causes castings to move down an incline; Darwin worked out the weight moving a certain distance in a given time. Some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. There is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. The finest earth is washed away. Ledges on hillsides, formerly believed to be caused by grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. High winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope/rain in moving castings. Crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under [[pasture]], due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. Fine earth is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. Dissolving of chalk supplies new earth.

Darwin writes in the conclusion that worms "have played a more important part in the history of the world than most persons would at first suppose."&lt;ref&gt;p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; They are important for many reasons, including their role in decomposition of rocks, gradual denudation of the land, preservation of archaeological remains, and improving soil conditions for plant growth. Despite their rudimentary sense organs, they show complex, flexible behaviour.

==Reception==
[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|"Man is but a worm" caricature published in ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' at the end of 1881 ]]
''Worms'' became available in October 1881 and sold thousands of copies in its first few weeks, despite Darwin's comment to Carus that it was "a small book of little moment".&lt;ref name="Moore1991a" /&gt; Darwin received a "laughable" number of letters containing questions, observations and ideas, even "idiotic" ones. A week's holiday with [[Emma Darwin|Emma]] in [[Cambridge]] was to follow. Darwin [[Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms#Death|died]] the next year on 19 April 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p= 658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theoretical oxygen demand''' ('''ThOD''') is the calculated amount of [[oxygen]] required to [[oxidize]] a compound to its final [[oxidation]] products.&lt;ref name="Penn"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Environmental and Ecological Chemistry |volume=II |title=Biochemical Oxygen Demand |first=Michael R. |last=Penn |author2=James J. Pauer |author3=James R. Mihelcic |editor=Aleksandar Sabljic |year=2009 |publisher=EOLSS}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are  some differences between standard methods that can influence the results obtained: for example, some calculations assume that [[nitrogen]] released from [[organic compound]]s is generated as [[ammonia]], whereas others allow for ammonia [[oxidation]] to [[nitrate]]. Therefore, in expressing results, the calculation assumptions should always be stated.

In order to determine the  '''ThOD''' for [[glycine]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)COOH) using the following assumptions:

#In the first step, the [[organic carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] are  converted to [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[ammonia]]  (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), respectively.
#In the second and third steps, the ammonia is  oxidized sequentially to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]]. 
#The ThOD is the sum of the [[oxygen]] required for all three steps.

We can calculate by following steps:
#Write balanced reaction for the [[Carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand|carbonaceous oxygen demand]].&lt;br&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)COOH + 1.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
#Write balanced reactions for the nitrogenous oxygen demand.&lt;br&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 1.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;br&gt; HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.5O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
#Determine the ThOD.&lt;br&gt;ThOD = (1.5 + 2) mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glycine&lt;br&gt;= 3.5&amp;nbsp;mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/mol glycine × 32 g/mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / 75 g/mol glycine&lt;br&gt;= 1.49 g O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/g glycine

The theoretical oxygen demand represents the worst-case scenario. The actual oxygen demand of any [[chemical compound|compound]] depends on the [[biodegradability]] of the compound and the specific organism [[metabolizing]] the compound. The actual [[oxygen]] demand can be measured experimentally and is called the [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD).
