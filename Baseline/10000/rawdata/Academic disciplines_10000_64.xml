      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6758">'''Alberto Pérez-Gómez''' (born 24 December 1949) is an eminent [[architectural history|architectural historian]]. He is also well known as an theorist with an orientation rooted in a [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenological]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; approach to architecture.

==Biography==
Born December 24, 1949, in [[Mexico City]] he graduated as an engineer and architect from the [[National Polytechnic Institute|National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico]]. Afterwards he did postgraduate work at Cornell University. He then pursued graduate studies in the History and Theory of Architecture at the [[University of Essex]] where he received his [[Master of Arts]] in 1975 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1979.  In 1987 he became a Canadian Citizen and a Quebec resident. In 1984, he won the [[Alice Davis Hitchcock Award]] for his book ''Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science''.&lt;ref&gt;Giamarelos, S. (2015) Interdisciplinary Deflections: Histories of the Scientific Revolution in Alberto Pérez-Gómez's Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science. ''Journal of Architectural Education'' Vol. 69, Iss. 1, http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10464883.2015.987069&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught and lectured at various schools of architecture around the world and was director of the [[Carleton University]] School of Architecture from 1983 to 1986. Currently, he runs the History and Theory of Architecture program at the [[McGill University]] [[McGill University School of Architecture|School of Architecture]], where he is the [[Saidye Rosner Bronfman]] Professor in History and Theory of Architecture.

Dr. Pérez-Gómez is the author of numerous volumes of architectural scholarship.''Polyphilo or The Dark Forest Revisited'' (MIT Press, 1992), an erotic narrative/theory of architecture that retells the love story of the famous fifteenth century novel/treatise ''Hypnerotomachia Poliphili'' in late twentieth-century terms, a text that has become the source of numerous projects and exhibitions (http://www.polyphilo.com). A Spanish version translated by the author was published as ''El Sueño de Polyfilo. El Origen Erótico del Significado Arquitectónico'' (Universidad Iberoamericana, 2012). He was co-editor of the well-known book series ''CHORA: Intervals in the Philosophy of Architecture'' vol. 1-7 (McGill-Queen's University Press) together with Stephen Parcell, which collects essays exploring fundamental questions concerning the practice of architecture through its history and theories. He co-authored a major book with Louise Pelletier, ''Architectural Representation and the Perspective Hinge'' (MIT Press, 1997), tracing the history and theory of modern European architectural representation, with special reference to the role of projection in architectural design. In ''Built Upon Love: Architectural Longing after Ethics and Aesthetics'' (MIT Press, 2006), Pérez-Gómez examines points of convergence between ethics and poetics in architectural history and philosophy, and draws important conclusions for contemporary practice. His most recent title, ''Attunement, Architectural Meaning after the Crisis of Modern Science'' (MIT Press, 2016) calls for an architecture that can enhance our human values and capacities, an architecture that is connected—attuned—to its location and its inhabitants. Architecture, Pérez-Gómez explains, operates as a communicative setting for societies; its beauty and its meaning lie in its connection to human health and self-understanding.

An '''anaphrodisiac''' (also '''antaphrodisiac''' or '''antiaphrodisiac''') is a substance that quells or blunts the [[libido]]. It is the opposite of an [[aphrodisiac]], something that enhances sexual appetite. The word ''anaphrodisiac'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[privative]] [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] [[wikt:ἀν-|ἀν-]], denoting negation, and ''aphrodisiac'', from the Greek goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]]. Some people use anaphrodisiacs in order to curb a very high libido or due to [[hypersexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Gawin, Frank H. "Pharmacologic enhancement of the erotic: Implications of an expanded definition of aphrodisiacs." Journal of Sex Research 14.2 (1978): 107-117.&lt;/ref&gt; However anaphrodisiacs are also used by those with an average libido, at times due to having incessant schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Bills, S. A., and DAVID F. Duncan. "Drugs and sex: a survey of college students' beliefs." Perceptual and Motor Skills 72.3_suppl (1991): 1293-1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Available anaphrodisiacs classes of substances==

Some common anaphrodisiacs are [[ethanol]] (alcohol) and [[tobacco]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}, but this is typically an unintended consequence and not often the main reason for use. While alcohol is used socially because it initially reduces mental inhibitions, studies have shown that over time alcohol physically decreases arousal and makes achieving climax more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Acute Alcohol Intoxication and Female Orgasmic Response | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | date = February 1982 | first = Victor | last = Malatesta |author2=Robert Pollack |author3=Terru Crotty |author4=Leon Peacock  | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17| id = | jstor = 3812507 | doi=10.1080/00224498209551130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason alcohol is considered an anaphrodisiac.

[[Opioid]]s, the class of pain-reducing substances which include [[morphine]], [[heroin]], and [[hydrocodone]], are anaphrodisiacs.

[[Adverse drug reaction|Side effects]] of certain antidepressant [[medication]]s may be anaphroditic in nature (e.g. [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRIs]] and certain [[antipsychotic]]s); however, there are no prescription psychotropic drugs that have reliable anaphroditic effects. {{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;!--SSRIs are fairly safe, if not totally reliable for this purpose. At least good studies have been done on them, which is more than one can say for the herbs--&gt;.

[[Antiandrogen]]s such as [[cyproterone acetate]] and [[medroxyprogesterone acetate]] are sometimes prescribed to convicted sex offenders who are released on parole in an effort to stop them reoffending, however the high doses required often cause a range of side effects which may limit [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]]. Other antiandrogens such as [[spironolactone]] and [[finasteride]] may also lower sex drive. [[Estrogen]]s can act as anaphrodisiacs in men by suppressing [[testosterone]] production by the [[testicle]]s.

==History==

Herbal anaphrodisiacs have been employed by various religious sects and orders throughout history. Most commonly, chaste tree (''[[Vitex agnus-castus]]'') has been used to normalize hormones in both men and women.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} An over-active libido is very often treated herbally by addressing poor adrenal function.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Rumours that the [[British Army]] put the 19th century [[anticonvulsant]] and [[sedative]] [[potassium bromide]] in soldiers' tea during [[World War II]] to damp soldiers' lust appears to be an [[urban myth]].  Given the long half-life of the drug in the body, a mildly sedated army would be unlikely to be an effective fighting force. A similar belief appears to exist in the United States about [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]] in army coffee&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.war-letters.com/0015/0018.html Saltpeter in Food]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Russia about [[potassium bromide]] in army food. There are numerous reports of use of potassium bromide and potassium nitrate in Polish military, prisons, rehabs and mental hospitals, but not in every facility. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Barrister Sir [[Edward Marshall Hall]] theorised that murderer [[Hawley Harvey Crippen]] was using [[hyoscine hydrobromide|hyoscine]] on his wife as an anaphrodisiac but accidentally gave her an [[overdose]] and then panicked when she died.&lt;ref name=spilsbury&gt;{{cite book | title=Bernard Spilsbury: his life and cases | first1=Douglas G. | last1=Browne | first2=E.V. | last2=Tullett | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth | year=1955 | pages=31–54 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=[[Harry Hodge]] | author=Filson Young | title=Famous Trials | volume=I | page=124 | publisher=Penguin Books | location=Harmondsworth | year=1954 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various forms of anaphrodisiacs have been promulgated at various periods in an attempt to cure [[hypersexuality]] in both [[human]]s&lt;ref&gt;Rebal Jr, Ronald F., Robert A. Faguet, and Sherwyn M. Woods. "Unusual sexual syndromes." Extraordinary Disorders of Human Behavior. Springer US, 1982. 121-154.&lt;/ref&gt; and non-human animals.&lt;ref&gt;Freed, Charles S., and William S. Kroger. "Psychologic manifestations of the menstrual cycle." Psychosomatic medicine 12.4 (1950): 229-235.&lt;/ref&gt; In both medieval history and modern times, anaphrodisiacs have been used as a tool intended to reduce the sex drive of [[sex offender]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Raymond C. "Alcohol and drug effects on sexual response: Human experimental and clinical studies." Annual review of sex research 2.1 (1991): 119-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific study==

Studies have evaluated the effect of herbal anaphrodisiacs on men and women. These include studies on the effect of substances on both hormone levels and behavior.

The mechanism of the active component of some plant-based anaphrodisiacs may be the induction of enzymes that catalyze the conversion of sex-hormone precursors into [[androstenedione]], which promotes the reduction of sexual urges. Studies have demonstrated that some of these products inhibit 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17,20-lyase, which catalyzes the conversion of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone of androstenedione to testosterone.&lt;ref&gt;Farese RV Jr, Biglieri EG, Shackleton CHL, Irony I, Gomez-Fontes R. glycyrrhetinic acid-induced hypermineralocorticoidism. N Engl J Med 1991;325:1223-1227. [Medline]&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study a group of men were given an anaphrodisiac and the effect on the metabolism of mineralocorticoids in these men was recorded.  During the period of administration, the testosterone concentrations decreased and the serum 17α-hydroxyprogesterone concentrations increased.  Testosterone levels fell by about 40% after administration and returned to normal after usage was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Yaginuma T, Izumi R, Yasui H, Arai T, Kawabata M Effect of traditional herbal medicine on serum testosterone levels and its induction of regular ovulation in hyperandrogenic and oligomenorrheic women [Article in Japanese]. Nippon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi 1982 Jul;34(7):939-44&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual effect of these medicines on sexual desire was not measured in the study.

The amino acid 5-HTP, or [[5-hydroxytryptophan]], has been anecdotally reported to be a mild anaphrodisiac, as has the serotonergic empathogen [[MDMA]], popularly known as "ecstasy". However, systematic study of these chemicals is lacking, due to the off-patent nature of 5-HTP, and the legal control of MDMA. In addition, other serotonergic euphoriant drugs, like the psychedelic [[LSD]], have been reportedly used to drastically increase sexual pleasure. MDMA in combination with a [[PDE5 inhibitor]] (trade names [[Viagra]], [[Levitra]], and [[Cialis]]) is termed "sextasy". This combination increases libido and performance simultaneously.  A PDE5 inhibitor taken alone has no effect on sex drive, suggesting that serotonergic euphoriants like MDMA may actually increase libido while decreasing performance, similar to [[alcohol]].

A 2003 study has found that [[Glycyrrhizin]], the compound in [[liquorice]] root, can lower levels of testosterone. The findings back up a previous study about the hormonal effects of liquorice (whose results could not be replicated in other studies in the past). The Iranian scientists came to the conclusion that the regular consumption of liquorice can lower libido in men. However, the study also showed that the level of testosterone normalizes after abstinence of liquorice within a few days and the effects completely disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3112606.stm | work=BBC News | title=Liquorice risk to men's sex life | date=17 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], '''anthropopoiesis''' is the self-building process of social man and of a whole culture, particularly referred to what concerns modifications of socialized body. The concept found applications mainly in French and Italian contemporary literatures.

In accordance with theoretic background which supports the idea, man is an unfinished being or better his behaviour is not strongly prefixed by genetic heritage. Human beings become fully finished only by means of culture acquisition.

Anthropopoiesis is both anthropogenesis (man “reborn” as social creature) and manufacturing of ”mankind patterns and fictions”. Therefore social and cultural practices build up the man by means of ritual and institutional constraints.

An example could be circumcision, a practice widely existing in many rites of passage amongst Islamic and Jewish believers and also amongst traditional cultures and communities. Besides, Christians ascribe a clear meaning to the sacred garment and to the tonsure; they are convinced that some sacramental rites mark indelible dispositions. All that affects the body and through this one the perception of one’s own identity and social status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

It serves graphic design professionals, managers, educators and students. Created in 1996 by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] (Bill Pr56),&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario:1523 ROYAL ASSENT / SANCTION ROYALE|author=[http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/hansardeissue/36-1/l064.htm  '''Bill Pr56, An Act respecting the Association of Registered Graphic Designers of Ontario]|date=25 April 1996|journal=online}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Association is Canada's only accredited body of graphic designers with a legislated title&lt;ref name=RGD-founders/&gt; and the second such accredited body of graphic designers in the world. RGD certifies graphic designers and promotes knowledge sharing, continuous learning, research, advocacy and mentorship.

==Advocacy==
RGD works to establish professional standards and innovative thinking within the graphic design industry. The association assumes an advocacy role for best practices for both graphic designers and the clients they work with. They focus on issues such as spec work and crowdsourcing, accessibility, sustainability, salaries and billing practices, pro bono work and internship guidelines.

RGD advocacy initiatives include:
* Supporting, defending and maintaining policies
* Promoting measures that broadly benefit members and the industry
* Increasing public awareness and disseminating information about industry best practices and the value of working with a Registered Graphic Designer (RGD)
* Arguing in favour of a new idea
* Speaking out on issues of concern
* Mediating, coordinating, clarifying and advancing a particular point of view
* Intervening with others on behalf of the profession

==History==
In 1956, Toronto-based designers Frank Davies, John Gibson, Frank Newfeld and Sam Smart formed the Society of Typographic Designers of Canada (TDC).&lt;ref name=RGD-founders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |title=Founders |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702230050/http://www.rgd.ca/about/founders.php |archive-date=2014-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://modern-canada.blogspot.ca/2011/12/graphic-art-and-design-robert-stacey.html |title=Graphic Art and Design / Robert Stacey |type=Weblog post |author=Duncan |website=Modern Canada |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TDC was later renamed the [[Society of Graphic Designers of Canada]] (GDC) to reflect the wider interests of its members.

By 1984 many other design disciplines such as Architecture and Interior Design had been given Acts in Provincial Legislatures so that their respective associations could govern and grant their members exclusive professional designations. RGD's founders recognized the need to align Graphic Design with other design professionals. To ensure Graphic Design could also advance as an acknowledged profession the Association's founders decided to incorporate the Association of Registered Graphic Designers (RGD).

On April 25, 1996 Bill Pr56&lt;ref name="Bill Pr56"/&gt; was passed and Royal Assent was given to an Act Respecting The Association of Registered Graphic Designers by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Sponsored by Mrs. [[Margaret Marland]], Member of Provincial Parliament and signed by the Honourable [[Hal Jackman]] C.M., O.Ont., O.ST.J., B.A., L.L.B., L.L.D., Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Ontario.

In 1999 a separate Examination Board was established to administer the Registered Graphic Designers Qualification Examination, now referred to as the [http://www.rgd.ca/rgd-certification.php Certification Process for RGD].

== Membership ==
In order to obtain the Registered Graphic Designer (RGD) designation, designers must complete go through a Certification Process that includes an application to determine eligibility, a multiple-choice online test, and a virtual portfolio interview. The RGD designation signifies knowledge, experience and ethical practice, guaranteeing that a designer is professionally competent in the areas of accessibility, business, design principles, research and ethics.

RGD offers various forms of membership for professional practitioners, managers, educators and students in graphic design, and for persons in allied professions.

==Conferences==
RGD organizes three annual conferences: a two-day design conference called [http://designthinkers.com DesignThinkers],&lt;ref name=RGD-dt&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://designthinkers.com/ |title=DesignThinkers Conference  }}&lt;/ref&gt; a one-day career development conference for students and emerging designers called [http://www.rgd.ca/events-and-programs/creative-directions Creative Directions], and a one-day Design Educators Conference.&lt;ref name=RGD-de&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designthinkers.com/News/First-Annual-Design-Educators-Conference-is-a-Succ.aspx |title=First annual Design Educators Conference a success |date=December 2, 2013 |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12539">'''Augmented learning''' is an on-demand [[learning]] technique where the environment adapts to the learner. By providing remediation on-demand, learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/09/an-interview-with-mcgraw-hill-higher-education-president-brian-kibby-about-the-future-of-ebooks-tctv/ Augmented learning and super-adaptive learning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies incorporating [[rich media]] and interaction have demonstrated the educational potential that scholars, teachers and students are embracing.  Instead of focusing on [[memorization]], the learner experiences an adaptive learning experience based upon the current context. The augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment by displaying text, images, video or even playing audio (music or speech). This additional information is commonly shown in a pop-up window for computer-based environments.

Most implementations of augmented learning are forms of e-learning. In desktop computing environments, the learner receives supplemental, contextual information through an on-screen, pop-up window, [[toolbar]] or [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar]]. As the user navigates a website, e-mail or document, the learner associates the supplemental information with the key text selected by a mouse, touch or other input device. In mobile environments, augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones.

Augmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence ([[intelligence amplification]]) and [[augmented reality]]. Augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through [[distributed cognition]]. Augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success. Mechanical and electronic devices that function as augmented intelligence range from the [[abacus]], calculator, personal computers and smart phones. Software with augmented intelligence provide supplemental information that is related to the context of the user. When an individual's name appears on the screen, a pop-up window could display person's organizational affiliation, contact information and most recent interactions.

In mobile reality systems,&lt;ref name="Augmented Learning"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1156186 Augmented Learning], Augmented Learning: Context-Aware Mobile Augmented Reality Architecture for Learning&lt;/ref&gt; the annotation may appear on the learner's individual "heads-up display" or through headphones for audio instruction. For example, apps for Google Glasses can provide video tutorials and interactive click-throughs, .&lt;ref name="Augmented Reality"&gt;[http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ Augmented Reality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407044513/http://edcetera.rafter.com/how-augmented-reality-can-enhance-learning-in-higher-ed/ |date=April 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign language educators are also beginning to incorporate augmented learning techniques to traditional paper-and-pen-based exercises. For example, augmented information is presented near the primary subject matter, allowing the learner to learn how to write glyphs while understanding the meaning of the underlying characters. See [[#Understanding language|Understanding language]], below.

==Just-in-time understanding and learning==
Augmentation tools can help learners understand issues, acquire relevant information and solve complex issues by presenting supplementary information at the time of need or "on demand." This contrasts with traditional methods of associative learning, including [[rote learning]], [[classical conditioning]] and [[observational learning]], where the learning is performed in advance of the learner's need to recall or apply what has been learned.

Snyder and Wilson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf Computer Augmented Learning: The Basis of Sustained Knowledge Management] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827221021/http://www.knowledgeharvesting.org/documents/Computer%20Augmented%20Learning.pdf |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; assert that just-in-time learning is not sufficient. Long-term learning demands continuous training should be individualized and built upon individual competencies and strengths.

==Understanding language==
Augmented learning tools have been useful for learners to gain an enhanced understanding of words or to understand a foreign language. The interactive, dynamic nature of these on-demand language assistants can provide definitions, sample sentences and even audible pronunciations. When sentences or blocks of text are selected, the words are read aloud  while the user follows along with the native text or phonetics. Speech rate control can tailor the text-to-speech (TTS) to keep pace with the learner's comprehension.

== Understanding Science ==
Augmented reality has come a long way in the science field, but it is still in its infancy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2012-08-03|title=Affordances of Augmented Reality in Science Learning: Suggestions for Future Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|journal=Journal of Science Education and Technology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=449–462|doi=10.1007/s10956-012-9405-9|issn=1059-0145}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have started using webcams, making them read a certain marker label, then an object where the label would be comes up on the screen. Developers are continuing to gather information on how AR ([[augmented reality]]) could take it's part in the learning environment. Over the past few years there have been technologies added to the classroom such as computers, laptops, projectors, white boards and much more. It is allowing students to be more engaged in what is happening.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Students are also now able to take notes without having to listening to what the teacher is saying, but instead writing what they typed on the projector.&lt;ref name="Eric Klopfer" /&gt; The notes can be more thorough and to the point, rather than an entire explanation. With the help of AR we can also see pictures on the board showing students the space in between certain objects such as planets or atoms.

==Making learning fun==
One researcher&lt;ref name="Eric Klopfer"&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11466 Klopfer, Eric] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223005434/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11466 |date=December 23, 2008 }}, Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that handheld devices like cell phones and portable game machines (Game Boy, PlayStation Portable) can make an impact on learning. These mobile devices excel in their portability, context sensitivity, connectivity and ubiquity. By incorporating social dynamics in a real-world context, learning games can create compelling environments for learners.

At the [[Allard Pierson Museum]] in Amsterdam, visitors view information on-demand at the "A Future for the Past" exhibit. In a virtual reconstruction of [[Satricum]] and the Forum Romanum, users can call up information that is overlaid on room-sized photos and other images. The museum uses both stationary displays and mobile computers to allow users to view translucent images and information keyed to their specific interest.&lt;ref name="Augmented reality"&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/13/augmented-reality-on-hand-at-museum-in-the-netherlands-threaten/ Flatley, Joseph L.], Augmented reality at the Allard Pierson Museum in Netherland&lt;/ref&gt;

==Is augmentation really "learning"?==
Critics may see learning augmentation as a crutch that precludes memorization; similar arguments have been made about using [[calculators]] in the past. Just as rote learning is also not a substitute for understanding, augmented learning is simply another faculty for helping learners recall, present and process information.

Current research suggests that even unconscious visual learning can be effective.&lt;ref name="cell-neuron"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rewards Evoke Learning of Unconsciously Processed Visual Stimuli in Adult Humans |last1=Seitz |first1=Aaron R. |last2=Kim |first2=Dongho |last3=Watanabe |first3=Takeo |journal=Neuron |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=700–707 |date=12 March 2009 |url=http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(09)00083-X |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual stimuli, rendered in flashes of information, showed signs of learning even when the human adult subjects were unaware of the stimulus or reward contingencies.

== Augmented Learning in Education ==
Augmented learning has allowed not only students to learn, but also their parents. Tools like mobile games have made it easier for parents to understand more fully what their child is learning in school. Technology brings the childs content to a new platform which is helpful to parents when trying to make meaningful connections to what their child is learning in school. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=I0kaFNaK704C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=augmented+learning+in+science&amp;ots=_fcI-rZGZ7&amp;sig=Va6-WbBonsgG0kEb8wcmAotXmu0#v=onepage&amp;q=augmented%20learning%20in%20science&amp;f=false|title=Augmented Learning: Research and Design of Mobile Educational Games|last=Klopfer|first=Eric|date=2008|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262113151|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, augmented reality has brought a new way of learning to young children to have the ability to articulate words. By using marker labels in books that are read by a tablet, making pictures appear on the screen along with audio narration for enhanced reading. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheng|first=Kun-Hung|last2=Tsai|first2=Chin-Chung|date=2014-11-11|title=The interaction of child-parent shared reading with an augmented reality (AR) picture book and parents' conceptions of AR learning|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/bjet.12228|journal=British Journal of Educational Technology|language=en|volume=47|issue=1|pages=203–222|doi=10.1111/bjet.12228|issn=0007-1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augmented reality|Augmented Reality]] in education has the potential to change the timing and location of the conventional learning process. This style of learning introduces new methods of studying. With the boom of [[technology]] and younger students being the biggest users, the learning platform has the ability to connect this generation and their smartphones to gain knowledge. Though it has yet to be fully discovered, Augmented Reality in education is looking to become a large market.

This style of learning can gain attention and expand the students interest in subject and topics he would not learn or come across in the conventional classroom lecture. Extra data such as fun facts, visual models, or historical data from events could give a wider understanding of the topics being taught. The learning platform hopes to explain abstract concepts, engage and interact with the learner, and discover and learn additional information about what they what to learn.

More than 161 feet long and weighing at 1,450 tons, the Aurora Simulator was the first gamma radiation simulator of its size in the world at the time. It was also one of only four large machines in the United States that were built specifically to test complete nuclear weapons packages, with the other three being the Hermes I to III simulators at [[Sandia Base]], New Mexico. Situated at the [[Harry Diamond Laboratories]] (which later became a part of the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]]) in Adelphi, Maryland, it was used to test complete weapons electronics packages from the warheads of [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)]] to satellites. After more than 20 years of use during the Cold War, the Aurora Simulator was officially decommissioned and disassembled in 1996.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1986, the Aurora facility set the world record for the largest amount of high-power microwave power generated from a virtual cathode oscillator. As a result, HDL was recognized by the [[American Defense Preparedness Association|American Defense Preparedness Association (ADPA)]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G8wIcWpgq4wC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=history+of+army+research+lab+aurora&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimr4371OfbAhWRtlkKHSmZA8AQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== History ==
Following the use of the [[Atomic Bomb|atomic bomb]] in World War II, studies on flash radiography found that field emission flash x-rays, which were previously used to analyze explosions, could simulate radiation from a nuclear bomb. Given this realization, the U.S. military began to prioritize the development of flash x-ray machines to test parts of missile packages during the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

After the Soviet Union demonstrated the use of the world’s first [[Anti-ballistic missile|anti-ballistic missiles (ABM)]] in 1964, DASA launched a series of projects in response that aimed to hasten the advancement of nuclear effects laboratories in the United States. The U.S. military was concerned that the introduction and subsequent nuclear explosion of Soviet AMBs into the airspace would increase the likelihood of the resulting radiation interfering with the electronics systems of inbound U.S. ICBMs. In order to [[Radiation hardening|thoroughly harden]] U.S. missiles, DASA initiated the construction of the Aurora Simulator as well as a full-threat level facility that engaged in gamma radiation testing and missile refinement in 1969.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When selecting the site for the Aurora facility, DASA wanted the gamma radiation simulator to be situated at an existing military laboratory. After much deliberation between the [[Air Force Weapons Laboratory|Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL)]] in New Mexico and the Army and Navy laboratories in the Washington, D.C. area, DASA chose the latter and granted the Harry Diamond Laboratory (HDL) the responsibility of operating the facility. In order to house the Aurora Simulator, HDL moved from its downtown Washington, D.C. site to an area of land in White Oak, Maryland, which would eventually become the now-present Adelphi.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The cooperation between DASA and HDL on the Aurora project led to many HDL researchers becoming involved in the simulator’s development, including assistant to DASA Deputy Director for Science and Technology Peter Haas and former participant in the Manhattan Project Paul Caldwell, who later was placed in charge of the Aurora Simulator. In turn, Caldwell hired physicist Alexander Stewart from Ion Physics (IP) and HDL’s Robert Lamb and Dennis Whittaker, the four of whom (including Caldwell) made up the bulk of the research and development team for the Aurora project. The construction of the Aurora Simulator was completed on January 1971, costing about $16 million, and the first test was conducted on the Spartan ABM flight control set in April 1972. Throughout its entire run at HDL, which ended in 1995, the Aurora Simulator conducted 287 numbered tests, resulting in more than 9,100 test shots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Operation ==
The Aurora Pulsed Radiation Simulator consisted of four 14 MV [[Marx generator|Marx generators]], each of which contained four parallel 1.25 MJ units connected together to drive four parallel oil-dielectric [[Blumlein generator|Blumlein pulse-forming lines (PFLs)]]. Each PFL was coupled with an [[Electron-beam processing|E-beam]] diode.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Aurora Simulator emitted four short pulses of high energy bremsstrahlung radiation that overlapped to deliver a single 120 ns wide pulse of 20 to 50 krads (Si) into a 1m cube. It could also deliver 25 krads (Si) throughout a 1m diameter and 1m long cylindrical volume or 50 krads (Si) throughout a 25cm sphere. What made the Aurora Simulator unique was its ability to provide an extremely high volumetric dose output. Due to this large irradiation volume, dose measurements ranged up to 200 locations within a single electronics system.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in order to obtain the desired radiation levels, all four 8-MeV, 230-kA bremsstrahlung pulses had to overlay within 10 ns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkel|first=George|last2=Scharf|first2=William|last3=Spohn|first3=Daniel|date=October 1982|title=Use of the AURORA Flash X-Ray Machine as a Source-Region EMP Simulator and Antenna Coupling Analysis Facility|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA122024|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; This synchronization was made possible by the symmetrization of the four Blumleins. During active testing, the Aurora Simulator was capable of accommodating as many as 13 test shots in a single day. In comparison, nuclear weapons testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]] was limited to one test shot per three months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

There were two main limitations to the operation of the Aurora Simulator. First, the long discharge time of the Blumeins often hindered the extraction of the bremsstrahlung pulses. Second, the high internal impedance of the Blumeins made them rather inefficient for energy transfer to low impedance loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Alexander|last2=Huttlin|first2=George|date=February 1979|title=Design Study for an AURORA Modification Leading to a 100-Terawatt Nuclear Weapon Radiation Simulator|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA071339|journal=Harry Diamond Labs|volume=|pages=|via=Defense Technical Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Berman Jewish DataBank''', founded as the '''North American Jewish Data Bank''', is the central online source for social scientific studies of North American Jewry and world Jewish populations and communities. The DataBank’s primary functions are to acquire and archive materials from quantitative studies of North American Jews, including data sets and reports, and to encourage and aid the production and utilization of quantitative research on North American Jews.

The DataBank maintains partnerships with the [[Berman Jewish Policy Archive]] and the [[University of Connecticut]]’s Center for Judaic Studies and Contemporary Jewish Life.

The DataBank holds more than 375 surveys and studies of North American Jews, including more than 200 local community studies usually commissioned by local [[The Jewish Federations of North America|Jewish federations]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the DataBank comes from an endowment provided by the [[Mandell and Madeleine Berman Foundation]] and from [[The Jewish Federations of North America]] (JFNA), and management is provided by JFNA. The DataBank’s professional staff includes Laurence Kotler-Berkowtiz, Director of the Berman Jewish DataBank; [[Ron Miller (sociologist)|Ron Miller]], Senior Research Consultant at the  Berman Jewish DataBank; and [[Arnold Dashefsky]], Director Emeritus and Senior Academic Consultant of the Berman Jewish DataBank.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/staff.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berman Jewish DataBank was founded as the North American Jewish Data Bank in 1986 and operated under that name until July 2013.  Funded throughout that time by the Berman Foundation under an arrangement with the Jewish Federation system, the North American Jewish Data Bank was located at the City University of New York from 1986 until 2002, at Brandeis University (2003-04) and the University of Connecticut (2004-2013) before moving to JFNA and changing names as of July 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24065">'''The Building Strong Families Program''' (BSF) is part of the Healthy Marriage Initiative funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], "to learn whether well-designed interventions can help couples fulfill their aspirations for a healthy relationship, marriage, and a strong family."&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

Between 2002-2011, "BSF programs were implemented by non-profit and public agencies at 12 locations in seven states, and enrolled more than 5,000 volunteer couples ... The intervention featured up to 42 hours of multi-couple group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on skills that, according to earlier research, are associated with relationship and marital stability and satisfaction."&lt;ref name=opre&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/resource/the-building-strong-families-project-implementation-of-eight-programs-to] U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten-year program was implemented through a contract by the [[Administration for Children and Families]] with Mathematica Policy Research.&lt;ref name=mathematica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813065842/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |archivedate=2010-08-13 |df= }} Mathematica Policy Research website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major study questions of the Building Strong Families Project included:&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

* '''Foundation''': What underlying conditions, preparation, resources, and context make it possible to implement programs that focus on promoting healthy marriage for a target population of low-income unwed couples with children? On what theories of behavior and family well-being do the programs rest? What types of organizations are well suited to operating such programs?
* '''Operation''': What are the important issues and challenges in designing, implementing, and operating programs, and what lessons can be drawn from the program experience? What services are included, and how do they complement existing programs for low-income families?
* '''Participation''': Who participates and for how long? What services do they receive? How does participation differ for subgroups?
* '''Impacts''': How do BSF programs affect couples’ attitudes and expectations about marriage, the quality and stability of their relationships, and whether they marry? What effects are found on parents and their relationships with their children, and the well-being and development of children? Which program designs work best?

==Rationale==

"Strengthening relationships and increasing fathers' involvement have emerged as central national policy strategies to improve the lives of low-income families and enhance the well-being of children. We are conducting studies to increase understanding about how to help low-income couples solidify their relationships, engage fathers more fully, and create the best environments in which to raise children ... [our] 10-year Building Strong Families demonstration is testing whether workshops on communication and relationship skills, combined with social supports, can help unwed parents stay together, manage conflict, maintain intimacy, increase the degree to which fathers are involved in their children’s lives, and improve children’s early development. The study is using a rigorous random assignment design and includes more than 5,000 couples in seven states. A report released in May 2010 provides short-term results on BSF’s impacts on couples after about 15 months, focusing on the stability and quality of the couples’ relationships."&lt;ref name="mathematica"/&gt;

==Impact report==
[[File:BSF Impacts.jpg|thumb|BSF 15-Month Impact Report]]

In May 2010, Mathematica reported findings from a 15-month follow-up of program and control group participants:

* BSF had no effect on whether couples were still together 15 months after they had applied for the program, when data from the eight BSF programs are combined. At this point, 76 percent of BSF couples were still romantically involved, compared with 77 percent of control group couples. Similarly, BSF and control group couples were equally likely to be married to each other at that time (17 and 18 percent respectively) and to be living together, whether married or unmarried (62 percent for both research groups)."&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/Family_Support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720101532/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/family_support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }} Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Wood, Robert G., et al., "The Building Strong Families Project," May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifteen months after they applied for the program, BSF and control group couples reported being equally happy in their romantic relationships, with average ratings of 8.4 and 8.3 respectively on a 0-to-10 relationship happiness scale. Similarly, BSF and control group couples gave very similar ratings of supportiveness and affection in their relationships, with average support and affection scale values of 3.5 on a 1-to-4 scale for couples in both research groups. In addition, BSF had no overall effect on how faithful couples were to each other.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
* When results are averaged across all eight programs, BSF did not improve couples’ ability to manage their conflict. Couples in both research groups reported similar levels of use of constructive conflict behaviors, such as keeping a sense of humor and listening to the other partner’s perspective during disagreements. Similarly, there was no difference between the research groups in the avoidance of destructive conflict behaviors, such as withdrawing when there is a disagreement or allowing small disagreements to escalate. In addition, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF had no effect on how likely couples were to experience [[intimate partner violence]]. Similarly, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF did not improve co-parenting or increase father involvement. BSF and control group couples reported that their co-parenting relationships were of equally high quality. In addition, at the 15-month follow-up, couples in both research groups were equally likely to report that fathers were living with their children, spending substantial time with them, and providing them with substantial financial support.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
*The Baltimore BSF program [Loving Couples, Loving Children] had negative effects on couples’ relationships. BSF couples were less likely than control group couples to remain romantically involved, 59 percent versus 70 percent. Baltimore BSF couples reported being less supportive and affectionate toward each other than control group couples did. In addition, women in the Baltimore BSF program were more likely than women in the control group to report having been severely physically assaulted by a romantic partner in the past year, 15 percent compared with 9 percent. Baltimore BSF couples also rated the quality of their co-parenting relationship lower than control group couples did and reported that BSF fathers spent less time with their children and were less likely to provide them financial support than control group fathers were.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

==Impact debate==

Scholars offered different perspectives on the findings:

A study from Harvard's Kennedy School reported: "In general, at the time of the 15-month follow-up the BSF intervention did not have a statistically or substantively significant effect on couples‘ relationship status or quality, or fathers‘ involvement with their children. Although the BSF had little or no effect on couples‘ relationships overall, impacts varied meaningfully across the eight evaluation sites; for example, the Oklahoma City site‘s BSF program had a consistent pattern of positive effects at 15 months. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, at the Baltimore site the BSF intervention had numerous negative effects: at the time of the 15-month follow-up survey, Baltimore couples who had been randomly assigned to participate in the BSF program were much less likely than control group couples to be romantically involved; fathers assigned to the BSF program were less likely to provide substantial financial support for their children or see them regularly; and mothers in the BSF sample were more likely to report experiencing a severe physical assault than were mothers in the control group."&lt;ref&gt;Clarkwest, Andrew; Killewald, Alexandra; Wood, Robert. "Stepping up or Stepping Back: Highly Disadvantaged Parents' Responses to the Building Strong Families Program," Harvard University, John F. Kennedy School of Government, May 23, 2012.[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/wiener/wps/BSF_Baltimore_chapter_05232012_HKS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for RH Reality Check, Joseph DiNorcia wrote, "The evidence is unmistakable: there’s just no amount of government coaxing that will make unmarried couples want to, as Beyoncé would say, 'put a ring on it.' A new report from Mathematica Policy Research, Inc, shows that the relationship skills education programs implemented by the Administration for Children and Families have, with a few exceptions, no effect on participants. These programs provide 'education' and support services to unmarried, low-income, heterosexual couples with newborn babies, and are among the marriage-promotion projects which had been enthusiastically touted by the Bush administration as a magic pill for poverty and unstable families."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/node/14001] DiNorcia, Joseph. "Building Strong Families Found Completely Ineffective," RH Reality Check, August 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Stanley, Ph.D. and Frank Fincham, Ph.D., two leading researchers in the field of Marriage and Relationship Education (MRE), attributed the impact findings to flaws in program implementation, arguing: "A summary from the BSF study that marriage/relationship education (MRE) does not work is not tenable, in our view. In addition to studying many other aspects of program and delivery, BSF really became more of a study of participation rates than of the impacts of MRE and other program elements. The main reason is that, in many sites, the 'dose' of MRE that couples received was quite low. In fact, in some sites, only 40% of couples ever attended even one session together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narme.org]"Comments from Dr. Scott Stanley and Dr. Frank Fincham on the Building Strong Families Study," National Association of Relationship and Marriage Educators, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Loving Couples Loving Children (LCLC) is a curriculum developed by [[John Gottman|John and Julie Gottman]] especially for low-income couples who are expecting a child. John Gottman is world-renowned for his scientific work identifying the predictors of relationship success and failure, while Julie Gottman is a master clinician who provides advanced training in marriage education and couples therapy ... To engage and retain the interest of low-income couples, they substantially modified the presentation of the material by developing a series of video 'talk shows' in which racially and ethnically diverse low-income couples discuss relationship issues. Each of the forty-two sessions in LCLC begins with such a talk show, which leads to a lively discussion among group participants. In these unscripted shows real couples, not actors, describe the challenges they have faced in their relationship and how they overcame them. The second half of each group session is devoted to activities that teach specific skills and techniques that couples can use to address the issues raised in the video. Participants practice skills with their partners during the session, with individual attention from the male and female co-facilitators, as needed."&lt;ref name=dion&gt;Dion, Robin M. "Healthy Marriage Programs: Learning What Works," Marriage and Child Wellbeing, Volume 15, Number 2, Fall 2005. [http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=37&amp;articleid=110&amp;sectionid=714]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Love's Cradle is based on the well-established Relationship Enhancement (RE) program, adapted and supplemented by new material developed especially to address issues identified by researchers as crucial barriers to positive family formation in fragile families. Created by Mary Ortwein, a marriage and family therapist with experience serving low-income families, and Bernard Guerney, the original developer of RE, Love's Cradle relies on a simplified and more culturally sensitive version of Relationship Enhancement taught at the fifth-grade level, and adds content to the standard RE skills. The simplified version avoids psychological jargon and teaches skills at a slower pace, with greater access to individual skills coaching. Love's Cradle consists of twenty-one two-hour group sessions. Ten sessions, most at the beginning of the program, are devoted to the simplified RE skills. Additional sessions allow couples to use their new skills to address the issues indicated by research to be common to low-income couples, including how to build, rebuild, and maintain trust; deal with multiple- partner fertility; manage emotions; work as a team on money matters; and reframe their understanding of marriage. Love's Cradle was field-tested with low-income couples and will be part of the Building Strong Families national evaluation."&lt;ref name="dion"/&gt;

"The Becoming Parents Program (BPP) curriculum, developed by Dr. Pamela Jordan, focused on three areas: (1) communication, problem-solving, friendship, and fun; (2) self-care and anger management; and (3) infant care and development. To meet BSF requirements, BPP was adapted to include material relevant for low-income families. The information on communication, problem-solving, friendship, and fun was largely drawn from the PREP curriculum. Skills included using a 'speaker–listener' technique, establishing ground rules, identifying hidden issues, and maintaining friendship and fun in the relationship. The focus on self-care and anger management included such strategies as using time-out to prevent escalation. Material was adapted from the Stop Anger and Violence Prevention program and the Domestic Conflict Containment Program."&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;"Catalog of Research: Programs for Low-Income Couples," Mathematica Policy Research, May 2012.[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/opre/catalog_couples.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2354">'''Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge''' ('''CITBOK''') is the project sponsored and undertaken by [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] (CIPS) to define and outline the [[body of knowledge]] that defines a Canadian [[Information Systems Professional]] (ISP).

CIPS recognizes that in order to strengthen the criteria of the ISP designation successfully while still maintaining high standards, the association needs to develop a Canadian Information Technology Body of Knowledge (CITBOK) that will set standards for knowledge.  The CITBOK is an outline of the knowledge bases that form the intellectual basis for the IT profession.  CIPS has identified a core CITBOK that all professionals would be expected to master and specialty bodies of knowledge that would depend on your area of practice.  When setting this Canadian standard for Information Technology (IT) knowledge, CIPS looked to other organizations and internationally for standards and bodies of knowledge that CIPS could adopt or adapt, especially for the specialty areas.  For example, in 2004, CIPS adopted the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) Professional Examination Study Guide Syllabus Diploma level (Core and 11 specialist modules) as the initial Body of Knowledge for CIPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |title=Moving towards a Canadian IT Body of Knowledge |accessdate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230307/http://www.cips.ca/news/national/news.asp?aID=2065 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CITBOK aims to:

* be an industry structure model that can be used to define the set of performance, training and development standards for all IT practitioners (CIPS members and non-members) in [[Canada]];
* create alternate paths to certification based on concepts of CITBOK;
* establish guidelines for accreditation criteria based on concepts of CITBOK; and
* create a professional development model that sets the standards criteria for the knowledge base including knowledge, skills, and professional activities for IT practitioners.

'''The Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies''' (abbreviated '''CAPS''') is an [[independent research]] centre based in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]]. The centre came into being in July 2006.

CAPS is one of the very few research centres in Afghanistan that are managed and staffed by [[Afghan people|Afghans]]. The centre is engaged in research and policy analysis; education and training; and capacity building and knowledge sharing.

The centre focuses its research on issues pertaining to [[governance]], [[security]], and [[International development|development]]al challenges in Afghanistan. CAPS is also active in sharing its research findings with the Afghans as well as with the international community. It provides pre-deployment training to various contingents of the international community that are deployed in Afghanistan.

'''Chronology''' (from [[Latin]] ''chronologia'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος|χρόνος]]}}, ''chrónos'', "time"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chronology|volume=6|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of arranging events in their order of occurrence in [[time]]. Consider, for example, the use of a [[timeline]] or [[sequence of events]]. It is also "the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events".&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;Memidex/WordNet, "chronology," [http://www.memidex.com/chronology+humanistic-discipline memidex.com] (accessed September 25, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronology is part of [[periodization]]. It is also part of the discipline of [[history]], including [[earth history]], the [[earth sciences]], and study of the [[geologic time scale]].

==Related fields==
Chronology is the science of locating historical events in time. It relies upon [[chronometry]], which is also known as timekeeping, and [[historiography]], which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods. [[Radiocarbon dating]] estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of [[carbon-14]] [[isotope]] in their [[carbon]] content. [[Dendrochronology]] estimates the age of trees by [[correlation]] of the various [[growth rings]] in their wood to known year-by-year reference sequences in the region to reflect year-to-year climatic variation. Dendrochronology is used in turn as a [[calibration]] reference for [[radiocarbon dating]] curves.

==Calendar and era==
{{Main article|Calendar}}

The familiar terms ''[[calendar]]'' and ''[[era]]'' (within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years) concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology. For example, during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the [[Christian era]], which era was taken in use in the 8th century by [[Bede]], was the Julian calendar, but after the year 1582 it was the Gregorian calendar. [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (about the year 500) was the founder of that era, which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth. An [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is the date (year usually) when an era begins.

===Ab Urbe condita era===
{{Main article|Ab urbe condita}}
''Ab Urbe condita'' is [[Latin]] for "from [[founding of Rome|the founding]] of the City ([[Rome]])",&lt;ref&gt;Literally translated as "From the city having been founded".&lt;/ref&gt; traditionally set in 753 BC. It was used to identify the Roman year by a few Roman historians. Modern historians use it much more frequently than the Romans themselves did; the dominant method of identifying Roman years was to name the two [[consul]]s who held office that year. Before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical Roman works, AUC was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors, making it appear more widely used than it actually was.

It was used systematically for the first time only about the year 400, by the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Pope Boniface IV]], in about the year 600, seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and [[Anno Domini]]. (AD 1 = AUC 754.)

===Astronomical era===
{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}
Dionysius Exiguus’ Anno Domini era (which contains only calendar years ''AD'') was extended by [[Bede]] to the complete [[Christian]] era (which contains, in addition all calendar years ''BC'', but no ''year zero''). Ten centuries after Bede, the French astronomers [[Philippe de la Hire]] (in the year 1702) and [[Jacques Cassini]] (in the year 1740), purely to simplify certain calculations, put the [[Julian Date|Julian Dating System]] (proposed in the year 1583 by [[Joseph Scaliger]]) and with it an astronomical era into use, which contains a [[leap year]] zero, which precedes the year 1 (AD).&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric chronologies==
While of critical importance to the historian, methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science, especially [[astronomy]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]] and [[archaeology]].

In the absence of [[written history]], with its [[chronicle]]s and [[:Category:King lists|king lists]], late 19th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles. In the field of [[Egyptology]], [[William Flinders Petrie]] pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre-dynastic [[Neolithic]] times, using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of Egypt. This method of dating is known as [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]].

Known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites, the product of trade, helped extend the network of chronologies. Some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms, for lack of an idea of what they called themselves: "The [[Beaker People]]" in northern Europe during the 3rd millennium BCE, for example. The study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases, classification and typology: Classification creates categories for the purposes of description, and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Greene | first =Kevin | authorlink = | title =Archaeology : An Introduction | publisher =University of Newcastle Upon Tyne |date=November 2007 | location = | pages = Chapter 4 | url =http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/kevin.greene/wintro/chap4.htm | isbn = | accessdate =2008-01-04 | nopp =true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid-20th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas. Unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology, an axiom of corroborative [[evidence]]. Ideally, archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross-checking. Conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable.

==Chronological synchronism==
The fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events. By synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events. Among historians, a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another. For example, the [[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon of Eusebius]] (325 A.D.) is one of the major works of historical synchronism. This work has two sections. The first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms: Chaldean, Assyrian, Median, Lydian, Persian, Hebrew, Greek, Peloponnesian, Asian, and Roman. The second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns. The adjacent image shows two pages from the second section.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:Eusebius Chronicon example.png|thumb|alt=Example pages from the Chronicon of Eusebius.|Chronicon of Eusebius.]] --&gt;

By comparing the parallel columns, the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous, or how many years separated two different events. To place all the events on the same time scale, Eusebius used an [[Anno Mundi]] (A.M.) era, meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Hebrew [[Pentateuch]]. According to the computation Eusebius used, this occurred in 5199 B.C. The Chronicon of Eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events. Subsequent chronographers, such as [[George Syncellus]] (died circa 811), analyzed and elaborated on the Chronicon by comparing with other chronologies. The last great chronographer was [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] (1540-1609) who reconstructed the lost Chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works, ''De emendatione temporum'' (1583) and ''Thesaurus temporum'' (1606). Much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works.&lt;ref name=Grafton&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|title=Joseph Scaliger: A Study in the History of Classical Scholarship|date=1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scaliger invented the concept of the [[Julian day|Julian Day]] which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as Eusebius, Syncellus and Scaliger, it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means. For example, the [[Eclipse of Thales]], described in the first book of [[Herodotus]] can potentially be used to date the Lydian War because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war. Likewise, various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kelley|first1=David H.|title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|date=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1441976239|pages=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings, such as pottery, to do [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|sequence dating]].

'''claro fair trade''', commonly shortened to '''''claro''''' and written in [[Lower case|minuscules]], is a [[sustainability]]-oriented retail company based in [[Orpund]], Biel/Bienne administrative district, in the Swiss [[Canton of Bern]]. claro was initiated by [[Erklärung von Bern]], a sustainability-oriented independent solidarity development in Switzerland in 1977.&lt;ref name="woz-evb-20090122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/0904/erklaerung-von-bern/erfinderinnen-des-fairen-handels|title=Erklärung von Bern: Erfinderinnen des fairen Handels|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 04/2009|author=Susan Boos|language=German|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and orientation ==
{{main|Erklärung von Bern}}
The history of fair trade in Switzerland is closely linked to the rise of the solidarity movement in Switzerland in the 1970s, and the political development organizations such as the [[Erklärung von Bern]] (EvB) consumer actions. At that time, products such as coffee, bananas and jute were symbols of the growing support for displaying developmental contexts. At the same time consumers demanded more engagement for development aid without supporting the charity mentality. The success of these actions occurred to the establishment of a joint Swiss import central named ''OS3'' that was pioneering fair trade, and specialized in the sale of food and crafts from developing trading partners, i.e. small producers from economic marginal areas, an alternative approach to the world trade.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmittel.ch/Archive/archNeu/Arclaro.html|title=claro fair trade AG|publisher=Schweizerisches Sozialarchiv: Archivfindmittel|author=|language=German|date=2014-04-17|accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''OS3'', in 1977 EvB initiated the organisation ''Suisse Tiers Monde'' which became the first two claro fair trade labels; they resulted in the collaboration with ''Corr-the jute works'' situated in Bangladesh. In the following years the product line was expanded gradually, among them cane sugar from the Philippines and other agriculture products from the so-called third world countries, for example coffee from Tanzania, and tea from Sri Lanka, and the cooperative ''El Ceibo'' in Bolivia around 1985,&lt;ref name="hds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D47101.php|title=Erklärung von Bern (EvB)|publisher=HDS|author=Andrea Weibel|language=German|date=2004-10-29|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as today the popular ''claro'' shops in Switzerland,&lt;ref name="zsz-20120426"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |title=Fair-Trade-Läden müssen sich auf den Markt ausrichten |publisher=[[Zürichsee-Zeitung]] |author=Bettina Bernet-Hug and Silvia Luckner (photo) |language=German |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119044427/http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |archivedate=2015-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among other sustainable initiatives financially supported by the [[Alternative Bank Schweiz]] ABS.

In 1997 the ''claro fair trade'' cooperative was transformed into an [[Aktiengesellschaft]] according to the Swiss law. claro fair trade claims as ultimate goals the continuous improvement of the social, economic and environmental situation of their producers. These include the minimization of middlemen in favor of direct cooperation with local partners and supporting social projects. Whenever possible the products are certified by the Max Havelaar Foundation.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"/&gt;

== Weltladen and claro shops ==
''claro'' contributes its products in the so-called ''claro'' and associated ''Weltladen'' shops.&lt;ref name="claro-überuns"/&gt; As other sustainable corporations, there was a decrease in turnover the past fiscal years, mainly caused to reduced export of the products outside Switzerland.&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

The distributor claimed as of 2014, to support by its import activities more than 260 small producer groups and craft shops, and thus improved the living conditions of more than 100,000 people from the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">{{About|an ecological term||Common (disambiguation)}}

'''Common species''' and '''uncommon species''' are designations used in [[ecology]] to describe the population status of a species.  Commonness is closely related to [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]].  Abundance refers to the frequency with which a species is found in controlled samples; in contrast, species are defined as common or uncommon based on their overall presence in the environment.  A species may be locally abundant without being common.

However, "common" and "uncommon" are also sometimes used to describe levels of abundance, with a common species being less abundant than an abundant species, while an uncommon species is more abundant than a rare species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|work=Birds of the St. Croix River Valley: Minnesota and Wisconsin|title=Methods, Terminology, and Nomenclature|author=Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center|accessdate=2006-12-31|year=2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061222235623/http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/stcroix/methods.htm|archivedate=2006-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common species are frequently regarded as being at low risk of extinction simply because they exist in large numbers, and hence their conservation status is often overlooked. While this is broadly logical, there are several cases of once common species being driven to extinction such as the [[passenger pigeon]] and the [[Rocky Mountain locust]], which numbered in the billions and trillions respectively before their demise. Moreover, a small proportional decline in a common species results in the loss of a large number of individuals, and the contribution to ecosystem function that those individuals represented. A recent paper argued that because common species shape ecosystems, contribute disproportionately to ecosystem functioning, and can show rapid population declines, conservation should look more closely at how the trade-off between species extinctions and the depletion of populations.&lt;ref name=gaston&gt;Gaston, K.J. &amp; Fuller, R.A. 2008. Commonness, population depletion and conservation biology. Trends in Ecology and Evolution, 23, 14-19. {{doi|10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cottey College''' is an independent, women's liberal arts and sciences college in [[Nevada, Missouri]]. While it began as a finishing school, it is now a four-year baccalaureate-granting college. It was founded by Virginia Alice Cottey Stockard in 1884 and is currently owned and supported by the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]], a philanthropic women's organization. It is the only [[nonsectarian]] college in the United States owned and supported by women for women.&lt;ref name="Weitzel"/&gt;

Cottey has 307 enrolled students.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt; Cottey has a student to faculty ratio of 10:1.&lt;ref name="CotteyFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cottey.edu/pdf/Cottey-Facts-2017-2018.pdf|title=Cottey Fact Sheet|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes meet with fewer than 10 students. Faculty includes both men and women, with over 90% holding the terminal [[academic degree]] in their field.&lt;ref name="CotteyFacts"/&gt;

Cottey is situated on {{convert|66|acre|ha|1}} of land in [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]], [[Missouri]], the county seat and a rural town of 8,171 people (by the 2012 estimate). The main campus is situated on 11 city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/pdf/enroll/cottey_map.pdf|title=Cottey College|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five blocks south of this is B.I.L. Hill, a {{convert|33|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} wooded area owned and used by Cottey for recreation, concerts, bonfires, picnics, suite nights, and other traditions.

The official colors of Cottey are yellow and white. Additionally, the senior class color is navy blue and the freshmen class color is "baby" blue.&lt;ref name="CotteyHandbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/campus-community/student-handbook/|title=Webmaster – Cottey College, Nevada, Missouri|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students generally represent over 40 states and 20 different countries.&lt;ref name="Weitzel"/&gt; In the 2018-19 school year, international students came from [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Ethiopia]], [[France]], [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[India]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[ESwatini|Swaziland]], [[Uganda]], [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom,]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/home/academic/journalism/spectrum/15_1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195815/http://www.cottey.edu/home/academic/journalism/spectrum/15_1.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 July 2010|title=Webmaster – Cottey College, Nevada, Missouri|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottey students live in one of three campus halls (P.E.O., Reeves, and Robertson), each having between 10 and 14 [[suite (address)|suite]]s with several bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchenette arranged around a living room. Student rooms have typical college furnishing. Suites have between 8 and 12 students. Most suites are sponsored by a P.E.O. chapter, and suite members usually receive several care packages from these P.E.O.s during the year. Sponsorship of some suites has changed over time, their names changing as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotteyphile.com/suites/|title=Suitelife|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence halls===
'''P.E.O. Hall''' is the oldest of the existing dormitories, and was erected in 1939. It has 10 suites, housing about 100 students. It was the first building to be paid by the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] after they acquired the college.&lt;ref&gt;"Cottey College Is the Only College In the U.S. Maintained By Women." ''Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune''. Chillicothe, MO. 15 Apr 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reeves Hall''' was built in 1949 on the site where a prior Cottey dorm, Missouri Hall, had burned down in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotteyphile.com/missourihall/|title=Missouri Hall|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like P.E.O., it houses 10 suites and about 100 students. It is noted for having the largest basement of the three halls, and a foyer reminiscent of a classic hotel lobby.

[[File:CotteyRobertsonHall.jpg|thumb|Robertson (Robbie) Hall]]
'''Robertson Hall''' (Robbie) was the last Cottey dorm to be built, being erected in 1959. It houses 14 suites (about 150 students) as well as the college's dining facility, Raney Dining Hall and the Centennial Room. It is noted for being the only hall with air conditioning and an elevator, and for having the smallest basement.

Each hall has recreational rooms, computer suites, laundry facilities, and quiet study rooms elsewhere in each building.

Cottey has had several prior dormitories, including Rosemary Hall (est. 1903) and Missouri Hall (1928–1940). Main Hall was also used as a dorm from 1884 to 1939.&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"&gt;Troesch, Dr. Helen DeRusha. The Life of Virginia Alice Cottey Stockard. Wayside Press, Inc., 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
Cottey's [[sport]]s teams are called the ''Comets'' and compete in intercollegiate [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[softball]] (beginning in spring 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/comet-athletics/|title=Cottey College|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[cross country running|cross-country]], [[tennis]] (added in fall 2014), [[golf]], and [[Track and field|track &amp; field]]. All seven are scholarship sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/comet-athletics/|title=Cottey College for Women – Comet Athletics|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the swimming team, ''Swimmin' Women'', competes largely as exhibition, since no other two-year colleges in the area have [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] programs. Cottey's teams compete in Region XVI of the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] playing teams in their region, as well as teams from community colleges in eastern [[Kansas]]. In the spring of 2018, the softball team made it into the [http://www.naia.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9sreBRBAEiwARroYm9RxLPEfuQyzK24DWdjeUOuecnNU01rJVtHWCuEJPmlTHSUwt9kTpRoCDr0QAvD_BwE NAIA] and won the [[NJCAA]] Regional Championships.

===International experience===
In 2018, Cottey College took their senior class on a week-long trip to [[London, England]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Japan]] over spring break. Since then, each second year class has traveled to one of several destinations: [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], [[Rome]], or [[Florence]]. For each European destination, the cost of airfare and hotel stays have been paid by the college.  Alternative trips to destinations including [[Japan]], [[Peru]], [[Thailand]], [[Guatemala]], [[New Zealand]] may incur additional fees. In 2017, Cottey traveled to [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]] or [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cottey.edu/international-experience/ |title=International Experience |publisher=Cottey College |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Cottey Nevada Souvenir.jpg|thumb|Cottey College, circa 1910]]
Cottey College was opened by Virginia Alice Cottey in 1884, and was originally called "Vernon Seminary."&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; After teaching at Central College in [[Lexington, Missouri|Lexington]] since 1875, Alice (as she was called) decided it was time to establish the school she'd always wanted. She had $3,000 saved, and her sisters Dora and Mary lent her nearly $3,000 of their own savings to begin her school.

Several towns bid for the opportunity to host the new girls' school, including [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]] and several towns in [[Missouri]]. After much thought, Alice accepted [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]]'s offer, even though it wasn't the most generous. Nevadans donated {{convert|6|acre|ha|3}} of land upon which Alice erected a three-story brick building, which came to be known as Main Hall.

Vernon Seminary opened its doors in 1884 as a primary, intermediate, and collegiate school.&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; In those early years, before educational standardization in the U.S., placement depended more upon accomplishment than age. In 1886 the school's name was officially changed to "Cottey College," and by 1932, only the college department remained.

In 1927, Alice offered the college to the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] on the condition that they raise a $200,000 endowment for the school (about $2.9 million in 2018 dollars).&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt;  The P.E.O.s accepted, and have since owned and operated Cottey College.

===Enrollment===
Enrollment grew from 28 to 72 students during the first year,&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; and by 1910 there were 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damonwaring.com/genealogy/nevada/souvenir/page18.html|title=Nevada Souvenir|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216024819/http://www.damonwaring.com/genealogy/nevada/souvenir/page18.html|archivedate=16 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance dropped during the 1930s and '40s, but rose to maximum capacity of 350 by the 1970s. Cottey experienced a slow decline in enrollment during the 1990s and into the 2000s, which they are presently attempting to reverse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noellevitz.com/Our+Services/Recruitment/Results/Cottey+College.htm|title=Noel-Levitz partners with Cottey to increase enrollment|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522004203/https://www.noellevitz.com/Our+Services/Recruitment/Results/Cottey+College.htm|archive-date=2013-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they have mostly, with a present enrollment of 307.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt;

'''Cross-boundary subsidies''' are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat [[landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] boundaries, subsidizing the resident [[populations]]. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect [[community]] and [[food web]] structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.

==Introduction and development of the concept==
The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of [[landscape ecology]] and [[food web]] ecology. The ideas from landscape ecology allow the study of population, community, and food web dynamics to incorporate spatial relationships between landscape elements into an understanding of such dynamics (Polis et al. 1997).

Janzen (1986) first defined cross-boundary subsidies as a process whereby organisms that disperse from one patch into another impact resident organisms by providing increased food resources or opportunities for reproduction, thus serving as a subsidy to the residents. By this definition, only the cross-boundary movement of organisms is considered, but broader definitions of cross-boundary subsidies can also include materials such as nutrients and [[detritus]] (i.e. Marburg et al. 2006, Facelli and Pickett 1991).

Cross-boundary subsidies are a subset of the more general process of spatial subsidies (see Polis et al. 1997). Cross-boundary subsidies acknowledge the presence and role of the boundary between different habitat patches in mediating flows of organisms and materials. In contrast, spatial subsidies require only that external inputs of materials and organisms originate from outside the patch of interest.

===Conceptual models===
Few attempts have been made to combine landscape and [[food web]] ecology in such a way that explicitly recognizes the importance of cross-boundary subsidies and spatial features of the landscape on food web dynamics. Often, spatial subsidies are treated as subsidies that simply arrive from outside the patch of interest, not addressing the landscape patterns and processes that may affect the movement of these inputs, such as boundary characteristics and patch connectivity. Polis et al. (1997) published a thorough review of spatially subsidized food web dynamics, focusing on the effect of subsidies on population, [[community]], consumer-resource, and food web dynamics. One of the main conclusions was that subsidies of consumer species (organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy) resulted in declines of food resources in the recipient patch. Callaway and Hastings (2002) built off Polis et al.’s conclusion with a model to show that subsidized consumers may not always drive down the resource in the recipient patch if consumers move between patches frequently. This might occur because consumers often move for reasons other than food resource acquisition.

Cadenasso et al. (2003) developed a framework for studying ecological boundaries, which has implications for understanding the dynamics of specific cross-boundary subsidies. The boundary is defined as the zone of the steepest gradient of change in some characteristic from one patch to another, such as rapidly decreasing light levels as habitat transitions from a field to a forest. In this framework, flows across variable landscapes are characterized by the type of flow (materials, energy, organisms, etc.), patch contrast (architecture, composition, process), and boundary structure (architecture, composition, symbolic and perceptual features). Considering a cross-boundary subsidy in terms of this framework shows how the boundary itself can mediate the subsidy. For example, Cadenasso and Pickett (2001) found that the decreased lateral vegetation at the boundary between a forest and field increased the amount of seeds transferred into the forest interior.

Another conceptual model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies is a model developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by predatory insects. The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch [[productivity]], and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by predatory insects (Fig. 1).

[[Image:Rand2006 adapted.JPG|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual model of cross-boundary subsidies of insect predators from agricultural to adjacent wildland patches. '''a.''' Habitat specialization, the boundary is a hard edge to predators such that they do not disperse to the wildland patch. '''b.''' Differences in [[productivity]], increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This is an example of a directional positive edge response. '''c.''' Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches. This is an example of a reciprocal positive edge response.

==Relation to selected ecological concepts==

===Landscape ecology===
A spatial subsidy, in the context of landscape ecology, is a doner-mediated resource (nutrient, detritus, prey) which is passed from one habitat to a recipient (consumer) in a second habitat. As a result, the productivity of the recipient is increased (Polis et al., 1997). For example, a bear eats a salmon and acquires the resources that have passed through the marine environment across the habitat boundary and into a terrestrial environment.

===Source sink dynamics===
The idea of a subsidy of materials or organisms across a patch boundary affecting resident populations has clear parallels with [[source-sink dynamics]] (Fagan et al. 1999). In this theory, local populations are connected by dispersal, and the extinction of local populations can be prevented through immigration from neighboring patches (Pulliam 1988). In source-sink dynamics, it is assumed that individuals from more productive patches will move to less productive patches with unsustainable populations (Pulliam 1988). Many examples of cross-boundary subsidies can be thought of as exhibiting source-sink dynamics. Rand et al. (2006) found that insects in a high productivity agricultural patch were able to sustain local populations in a lower productivity wildland patch through continued dispersal from the agricultural patch. The effect of these subsidies to local patches can also impact populations of other species in the recipient [[food web]], because the subsidized population may compete with or prey upon other species more effectively than they would be able to without such an influx (Fagan et al. 1999).

===Biotic interactions and trophic structure===
Cross-boundary subsidies have important impacts on species interactions and food web dynamics. Subsidies of materials and organisms can affect all trophic, or feeding, levels of food webs either directly or indirectly. Inputs of nutrient and [[detritus]] from another patch generally increase the population growth of the resident producers (plants) and [[detritus|detritivores]] (Polis et al. 1997). Increased growth at the producer level can result in a bottom-up trophic effect, in which increases in [[populations]] at lower [[trophic level]]s support a higher population of consumers than would otherwise be possible in a closed system (Polis et al. 1997). [[allochthonous]] detrital inputs can also have strong impacts on food web dynamics over a variety of temporal scales, ranging from seconds to millennia, as in the case of [[fossil fuel]] formation from build-up of detritus over millennia (Moore et al. 2004).

====Coarse woody debris====
Many food webs rely on cross-boundary subsidies of detritus for sources of energy and nutrients (Huxel and McCann 1998). For example, a series of lakes in Wisconsin were examined for the presence of [[Coarse woody debris]] (CWD) and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape that might control its input to lakes. Coarse woody debris in these lakes is important for providing habitat and food resources for a variety of organisms including small fish (Werner and Hall 1988), algae, and detritivores (Bowen et al. 1998). Marburg et al. (2006) compared variation within and among lakes in CWD. They found that subsidies of CWD to lakes were lower when the lakes had human development along the shore. Development along the lakeshore can be thought of as an alteration to the characteristics of the patch boundary between the lake and forest. In this case, development decreased both forest density that is the source of CWD and also the permeability of the boundary to flows of CWD (Marburg et al. 2006).

====Predator-prey====
In addition to bottom-up effects, top-down effects may also occur due to cross-boundary subsidies. In top-down effects, subsidies of consumers at the top level of the food web control populations at lower levels more so than would be expected by only the action of resident consumers (Polis et al. 1997). Consumers that cross boundaries may have a greater effect on the recipient patch population if prey in the recipient patch have a lower population growth rate than prey in the source patch (Fagan et al. 1999, Rand et al. 2006). Thus, cross-boundary subsidies may alter predator-prey/competitive interactions that can result in a disproportionate impact on the communities of the recipient patch.

====Trophic cascade====
In subsidizing top trophic levels, effects may also be felt at all lower trophic levels in a phenomenon known as a [[trophic cascade]]. An example of a trophic cascade that also acted as a cross-boundary subsidy is illustrated in a study by Knight et al. (2005) in which changes in the trophic structure of one ecosystem resulted in an effect that cascaded to the adjacent ecosystem. In ponds containing fish, dragonfly larvae were kept to a minimum by fish predation. The resulting low density of adult dragonfly predators led to a high density of bee pollinators. With fish present in adjacent ponds, bees were able to pollinate more flowers in the adjacent upland ecosystem than they were when fish were absent. The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation. That subsidy was then transferred across the pond-upland boundary by adult dragonfly movement to affect the interaction between bee pollinators and plants.

===Subsidy cascade===
Native species that forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

==Human activities affecting cross-boundary subsidies==

===Agriculture ===
Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. For example, Luskin et al (2017) used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illustrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on natural habitats located &gt;1.3 km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

===Fragmentation===
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented due to human activity, the influence of patch boundaries on individual patches becomes relatively more important (Murcia 1995). [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] can both cut off necessary subsidies to patches and increase the magnitude of subsidies from adjacent patches. For example, in a study of fragmentation of wildlands in an agriculturally dominated landscape, subsidies of habitat specialist insects to wildland patches were prevented by surrounding small, wildland patches with inhospitable agricultural land. This isolation reduced the potential for [[gene flow]] and long-term persistence of the population. Subsidies of other insects that specialized on agricultural crops were increased to wildland [[populations]], increasing their effect on the resident wildland species (Duelli 1990).

===Alteration of patch and boundary characteristics===
Changing the internal structure and composition of a patch may substantially alter cross-boundary subsidies. [[Logging]] may temporarily increase subsidies of nutrients and detritus to adjacent streams (Likens et al. 1970). [[Invasive species]] introduced to agricultural patches may act as a subsidy to adjacent wildland invasive populations, preventing native species establishment, even within the protected area (Janzen 1983).

====Marine systems====
Human alterations of patch characteristics may also curtail cross-boundary subsidies such as [[overfishing]] in marine systems, which may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies of organisms to freshwater and riparian systems (Zhang et al. 2003). For example, Helfield and Naiman (2002) found that riparian trees in [[Alaska]] obtain 24-26% of their nitrogen from marine sources, transferred from migrating [[salmon]]. In this system, [[salmon]] that feed in the ocean, incorporating marine nitrogen into their biomass, later return to their natal small streams where they spawn and die. [[Salmon]] carcasses transferred across the stream-riparian zone boundary by terrestrial predators or flooding events subsidized growth of terrestrial plants. Thus, marine overfishing may affect the productivity of Alaskan forests that depend on subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen.

As discussed above, cross-boundary subsidies depend on the characteristics of the patch boundary. Human-induced changes in these characteristics can affect boundary permeability to certain organisms or materials. For example, a cross-boundary subsidy of leaf litter from forest to an adjacent open field may be attenuated at the boundary if a road is present, making the boundary less permeable to flows of leaf litter (Facelli and Pickett 1991).

==Implications for management and future research needs==
Habitat management might benefit from recognizing the effect that humans may have on both individual patches and on the dynamics between patches. In such cases, managers may need to focus on patterns and processes that occur outside of their patch of interest, as these factors may also be important to internal [[population dynamics]]. An understanding of boundary features that influence the various flows of interest is necessary in managing for those flows.

=== Invasive species ===
The implications of [[invasive species]] and the use of [[biological control]] agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. Introducing species into one patch for [[biocontrol]] may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.

Other fields, such as public policy, can also benefit from considering cross-boundary subsidies. For example, governments often provide [[subsidy|financial subsidies]] to [[fisheries]], which have a negative effect on those ecosystems by encouraging overfishing (Munro and Sumaila 2002). Understanding what processes affect how those financial resources flow across that particular government-industry boundary is important to the maintenance of marine [[food web]]s. Considering cross-boundary effects will be essential to a complete understanding of potential consequences of human action on the landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">'''Donald Jay Grout''' (September 28, 1902 – March 9, 1987) was an American [[musicologist]].

Grout was born in [[Rock Rapids, Iowa]]. He attended [[Syracuse University]] and graduated with a degree in [[philosophy]] in 1923. He took his Ph.D. at [[Harvard University]] in 1939. He taught at Harvard from 1936 to 1942, at the [[University of Texas]] from 1942 to 1945 and at [[Cornell University]] until 1970.&lt;ref name=g&gt;Jones, Gaynor G., and Claude V. Palisca.

Early in his career, Grout's main body of research was in [[opera]]. After 1960 he became more interested in philosophies of music history, due in large part to his publication of a general music history textbook, ''[[A History of Western Music]]''. A ninth edition of the book was published in 2014; after Grout's death, the new editions were revised by [[Claude Palisca]] and [[J. Peter Burkholder]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-western-music/oclc/1005164099/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true "A History of Western Music"], WorldCat, retrieved 23 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Grout also performed as a pianist and organist until the early 1950s. He served as editor of ''[[Journal of the American Musicological Society|JAMS]]'' from 1948 to 1951, and was president of the [[American Musicological Society]] (1952–54, 1960–62) and the [[International Musicological Society]] (1961–64).&lt;ref name=g/&gt;

A reassessment of Grout's historiography was published in 2011 in the inaugural volume of ''Journal of Music History Pedagogy''.&lt;ref&gt;Kristy Johns Swift.

==History==
Eskimology traces its beginning to the pioneering work of [[Hans Egede]] (1745) and David Crantz (1767) in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;Fienup-Riordan, Ann. (1990). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=erhrp9-RHiYC&amp;pg=PR10&amp;lpg=PR10&amp;dq=%22Regional+groupings+for+the+Yukon-Kuskokwim+region%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DPWJs6UYY9&amp;sig=i8i0NT3pPLlz0cc7ensiwYLWvE4&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6lh-VMmkNeHTygPH-oAY&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Regional%20groupings%20for%20the%20Yukon-Kuskokwim%20region%22&amp;f=false Eskimo Essays: Yup'ik Lives and Howe We See Them]''. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Eskimology has traditionally had a particular focus on Greenland studies owing to the long-standing relationship between Denmark and Greenland established in the early 18th century, and the academic discipline of Eskimology is today centered at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. The term "Eskimology" was not common until 1967, when a genuine department was established and officially named the ''Department of Eskimology''. From the late 1960s, Eskimology changed its focus toward increasingly contemporary and global political issues.&lt;ref name="Thuesen"/&gt;

A [[Sovereign state|country]]'s '''foreign policy''', also called  '''[[foreign relations]]''' or '''foreign affairs policy''', consists of self-interest strategies chosen by the state to safeguard its national interests and to achieve goals within its [[international relations]] 	milieu. The approaches are strategically employed to interact with other countries. The study of such strategies is called [[foreign policy analysis]]. In recent times, due to the deepening level of globalization and transnational activities, the states will also have to interact with [[non-state actor]]s. The aforementioned interaction is evaluated and monitored in attempts to maximize benefits of multilateral international cooperation. Since the [[national interest]]s are paramount, foreign policies are designed by the government through high-level decision making processes. National interests accomplishment can occur as a result of peaceful cooperation with other nations, or through exploitation. Usually, creating foreign policy is the job of the [[head of government]] and the [[foreign minister]] (or equivalent). In some countries the [[legislature]] also has considerable effects.  Foreign policies of countries have varying rates of change and scopes of intent,  which can be affected by factors that change the perceived national interests or even affect the stability of the country itself.  The foreign policy of a country can have profound and lasting impact on many other countries and on the course of international relations as a whole, such as the [[Monroe Doctrine]] conflicting with the [[mercantilism]] policies of 19th-century European countries and the goals of independence of newly formed [[Central American]] and [[South American]] countries.

==History==

The ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] described humans as social animals. Therefore, friendships and relations have existed between humans since the beginning of human interaction. As the organization developed in human affairs, relations between people also organized. Foreign policy thus goes back to primitive times. The inception in human affairs of foreign relations and the need for foreign policy to deal with them is as old as the organization of human life in groups. Before writing, most of these relations were carried out by word of mouth and left little direct archaeological evidence.

The literature from ancient times, the [[Bible]], the [[Homer]]ic poems, the histories of [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], and many others, show an accumulation of experience in dealing with foreigners. Ancient Chinese and Indian writings{{Which|date=July 2014}} give much evidence of thought concerned with the management of relations between peoples in the form of diplomatic correspondence between rulers and officials of different states and within systems of multi-tiered political relations such as the [[Han dynasty]] and its subordinate [[Kings of the Han Dynasty|kings]], the more powerful of which{{Which|date=February 2015}} conducted their own limited foreign relations as long as those did not interfere with their primary obligations to the central government, treatises by [[Chanakya]] and other scholars, and the preserved text of ancient treaties, as well as frequent references by known ancient writers to other, even older sources which have since been lost or remain in fragmentary form only.

==20th century==

Global wars were fought two times in the twentieth century. Consequently, international relations became a public concern as well as an important field of study and research.
After the [[World War II|Second World War]] and during the 1960s, many researchers{{Who|date=July 2014}} in the U.S. particularly, and from other countries in common, brought forth a wealth of research work and theory. This work was done for international relations and not for foreign policy as such. Gradually, various theories began to grow around international relations, international systems, and international politics, but the need for a theory of foreign policy (that is, the starting point in each sovereign state) continued to receive negligible attention. The reason was that the states used to keep their foreign policies under official secrecy, and unlike today, it was not considered appropriate for the public to know about these policies.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This iron-bound secrecy is an essential part for the framework of foreign policy formulation.

World War II and its devastation posed a great threat and challenge for humanity which revealed to everyone the importance of international relations. Though foreign policy formulation continued to remain a closely guarded process at the national level, wider access to governmental records and greater public interest provided more data from which academic work placed international relations in a structured framework of political science. Graduate and post-graduate courses developed. Research was encouraged, and gradually, international relations became an academic discipline in universities throughout the world.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The subject of whether or not constructive attempts at involvement by citizens benefits the disciplines of the "art," or whether or not such disciplines as intercultural and interpersonal communications and others may play a significant part in the future of international relations could be a subject for further study by interested individuals/groups and is encouraged at the educational level.

Writers{{Who|date=July 2014}} researching foreign policy in the 20th century were unaware of whether or not agencies who most closely dealt with foreign policy kept logs of [[Statistics|statistical]] experience not unlike the [[Actuary|actuarial]] statistics kept by organizations of the [[insurance]] industry assessing the [[risk]] and danger involved (e.g., when situation "C" happened before, and subject included instances of "E" and "L", how was it handled and what was the result? When were peaceful and amicable results leading to better relations ever obtained through considered action and what was that action?).

The writers who worked with the foreign policy can be divided into two groups:
# World war writers who treat international politics and foreign policy as an indifferent, single field of study
# Writers who recognize foreign policy as a source rather than the substance of international politics and bring it under study as a subject
(The second group restricts to foreign policy making.)

The works of the second group come closer to the theory of foreign policy, but there is no attempt to formulate a basic theory of foreign policy. [[Hans Morgenthau]]’s works on principal elements of foreign policy seem to have covered the most ground.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Hans J.. ''Politics among nations; the struggle for power and peace''. 4th ed. New York: Knopf, 1967. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Need for a general theory of foreign policy==
{{Main|International relations theory}}
Shapiro, in his comparative study of the foreign policy of different countries, felt that the lack of a basic theory of foreign policy was particularly disabling and pointed out the harmful effect of the absence of a general theory of foreign policy on foreign policy literature.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The most fundamental question that arises here is: why do we lack theories of foreign policy? Or why do we need a general theory of foreign policy?
 	
The absence of a general theory in this field leads to some serious consequences. Without theory:

* We cannot explain the relationships we discover; we can make predictions only about the foreign policy behavior.
* We will have to depend on luck and educative guesses to come up with worthwhile research hypothesis.
* Research will become an ad-hoc or unplanned research, with no justification provided for the selection of cases—no system and no consistency.
* A field without theory is hardly an area of disciplined scientific inquiry.
* A diplomat will be likely to have a more complex estimate or knowledge of other governments. His or her estimate, however, will certainly be simplistic and heavily influenced by his or her own perceptual blinders, leading to faulty (or biased) policy judgments.

A theoretical framework of foreign policy is needed to analyze the day-to-day interactions in international relations and to compare individual foreign policies. The focus is primarily on the policies of [[state actor]]s with defined territories and jurisdictional boundaries, and less so on non-state actors, except in the context of how they impact national government decisions and policies. The formal field of study of international relations is itself fairly{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} recent and a specific subset of international relations such as foreign policy analysis does not receive wide attention as a field of scientific study, as opposed to the widespread use of terms like "foreign policy" and "foreign policy expert" in news media and general discussions about government when such experts may have more extensive backgrounds in fields other than foreign policy analysis. The organization [[Foreign Policy Interrupted]] recognized the gender disparity in foreign policy expert representation and is amplifying the number of female voices in foreign policy media coverage. Government officials involved in making foreign policy often perceive risk in giving away information about their policy-making processes and do not discuss the subject since control of information is itself often a part of foreign policy.

The vast record of empirical data and research is given academic attention to fit it into the framework of a general theory of foreign policy.

The second group of writers has made contributions in its development in many ways:

* Collation of systematic empirical studies with a view to articulating general pro-positions pertaining to state behavior.
* Analysis of foreign policy making with an emphasis on the process itself and the determinants that influence foreign policy.
* Development of a scientific approach to and model for foreign policy analysis such as the [[rational actor model]], domestic-public model, etc.
* Studies undertaken to prepare [[International relations|world order]] models.

The '''Fortsas hoax''' refers to an incident in [[Binche|Binche, Belgium]], in 1840.  That year, booksellers, librarians, and collectors of rare books throughout [[Europe]] received a catalogue describing a collection of rare books to be auctioned.

According to the message, "Jean Nepomucene Auguste Pichauld, Comte de Fortsas", had been a collector of unique books — books of which only one copy was known to exist.  When he had died, on September 1, 1839, he had possessed 52 such books.  His heirs, not interested in collecting books, had decided to auction the collection.  The auction was to be held on August 10, 1840.

On the appointed date, numerous collectors and intellectuals gathered in Binche, hoping to bid on the books.  They learned, however, that the offices of the notary where the auction was to take place did not exist — nor did the street upon which the offices were supposedly located.  Notices which had been posted around Binche claimed that there would be no auction after all, because the town's public library had acquired the books; however, those attempting to visit the library to view the collection discovered that Binche possessed no public library.  Later it was discovered that there had never been a Comte de Fortsas.

It was eventually revealed that the hoax had been planned and carried out by antiquarian and retired military officer [[Renier Hubert Ghislain Chalon]], who enjoyed playing elaborate [[prank]]s on intellectuals.

Ironically, the original catalogue of fictitious unique books Chalon had sent to his victims has itself become a sought-after collectors' item.  It has since been reprinted several times.

In [[applied mathematics]] and [[mathematical analysis]], the '''fractal derivative''' is a [[ Multiplicative calculus#History|non-Newtonian]] type of [[derivative]] in which the variable such as ''t'' has been scaled according to ''t&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''. The derivative is defined in [[fractal]] geometry.

== Physical background ==

[[Porous media]], [[aquifer]], [[turbulence]] and other media usually exhibit fractal properties. The classical physical laws such as [[Fick's laws of diffusion]], [[Darcy's law]] and [[Fourier's law]] are no longer applicable for such media, because they are based on [[Euclidean geometry]], which doesn't apply to media of non-[[integer]] [[fractal dimension]]s. The basic physical concepts such as [[distance]] and [[velocity]] in fractal media are required to be redefined; the scales for space and time should be transformed according to (''x&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''t&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''). The elementary physical concepts such as velocity in a [[fractal spacetime]] (''x&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''t&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;'') can be redefined by:

:&lt;math&gt;  v' = \frac{dx'}{dt'}=\frac{dx^\beta}{dt^\alpha}\,,\quad \alpha,\beta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''S&lt;sup&gt;α,β&lt;/sup&gt;'' represents the fractal spacetime with scaling indices ''α'' and ''β''. The traditional definition of velocity makes no sense in the non-differentiable fractal spacetime.

== Definition ==

Based on above discussion, the concept of the fractal derivative of a function ''u''(''t'') with respect to a fractal measure ''t'' has been introduced as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha}=\lim_{t_1 \rightarrow t}\frac{f(t_1)-f(t)}{t_1^\alpha-t^\alpha}\,, \quad \alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;,

A more general definition is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial^\beta f(t)}{\partial t^\alpha}=\lim_{t_1 \rightarrow t}\frac{f^\beta (t_1)-f^\beta (t)}{t_1^\alpha-t^\alpha}\,, \quad\alpha&gt;0, \beta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Fractal dervative.jpg|right|thumb|Fractal derivative for function ''f''(''t'') = ''t'', with derivative order is ''α'' ∈ &lt;nowiki&gt;(0,1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]

==Application in anomalous diffusion==

As an alternative modeling approach to the classical Fick’s second law, the fractal derivative is used to derive a linear anomalous transport-diffusion equation underlying [[anomalous diffusion]] process,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d u (x,t)}{d t^\alpha}= D \frac{\partial }{\partial x^\beta} \left(\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x^\beta}\right), -\infty&lt; x &lt; +\infty\,, \quad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;u(x, 0)=\delta(x).&lt;/math&gt;

where 0 &lt; ''α'' &lt; 2, 0 &lt; ''β'' &lt; 1, and ''δ''(''x'') is the [[Dirac Delta function]].

In order to obtain the [[fundamental solution]], we apply the transformation of variables

:&lt;math&gt;t'=t^\alpha\,,\quad x'=x^\beta. &lt;/math&gt;

then the equation (1) becomes the normal diffusion form equation, the solution of (1) has the stretched [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] form:

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,t)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi t^\alpha}} e^{-\frac{x^{2 \beta}}{4t^\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[mean squared displacement]] of above fractal derivative diffusion equation has the [[asymptote]]:
 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle x^2 (t) \right\rangle\propto t^{(3 \alpha-\alpha \beta)/2 \beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Genetic editing''' ([[French language|French]] ''critique génétique''; [[German language|German]] ''genetische Kritik'') is an approach to scholarly editing in which an [[Exemplar (textual criticism)|exemplar]] is seen as derived from a dossier of other [[manuscript]]s and events. The derivation can be through physical [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut and paste]]; writing or drawing in a variety of media; quotation, [[annotation]] or correction; acts of physical defacement; etc.  Genetic editing aims to reconstruct the sequence of actions on the manuscript and exactly which parts of the manuscript were acted upon. Where multiple manuscripts have been combined (through for example cut and paste or quotation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/gencrit/index.html|title=Textual Scholarship: Genetic Criticism|date=|work=textualscholarship.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cts.dmu.ac.uk/index.php?q=objectives.html] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=30227768|title=The "Wake's Progress": Toward a Genetic Edition|first=Dirk|last=Van Hulle|date=17 January 2018|publisher=|journal=Text|volume=13|pages=221–232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic editing is strong in European, particularly French and German, [[textual scholarship]]. Completed works of genetic editing are known as genetic editions.

Whereas traditional scholarly editing can be seen as constructing a new document drawing together and comparing many source documents to cast light on a work, genetic editing closely examines a single [[Extant literature|extant]] manuscript and traces back each aspect to cast light on the work.

Genetic editing is named by analogy with genetics manuscripts (individuals) are derived from other manuscripts (or previous states of the same manuscript) and with the derivation tree being a partial [[Tree (data structure)|ordered tree]].

The [[Text Encoding Initiative]]'s [[XML]] format has support for encoding of genetic editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PH-changes|title=TEI Guidelines 11.7 Identifying Changes and Revisions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The so-called '''Hamburg School of Art History''' (''Hamburger Schule der Kunstgeschichte'') was a school of art historians primarily teaching at the [[University of Hamburg]], who were closely connected with the ''Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg'' (KBW) at the [[Warburg Haus, Hamburg]]. Its main members were scholars such as [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Fritz Saxl]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], who had been schooled to see images as cultural documents and inculcated in the investigation of pictorial types.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sears, "American Iconography: Assessing FSA Photographs, 1945", ''Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation'', Volume 30, Issue 3, 2014, pp. 239-254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hamburg School of Art History is celebrated for the theoretical interpretations of subject matter known as [[iconography]] and [[iconology]]. It was soon established and attracted brilliant students such as [[Edgar Wind]], [[Hugo Buchthal]], [[Adolf Katzenellenbogen]], [[Walter Horn]], [[Charles de Tolnay]], [[Ludwig Heinrich Heydenreich]], [[Lotte Brand Philip]], [[William S.

In Freud's view, jokes (the verbal and interpersonal form of humor) happened when the [[conscious]] allowed the expression of thoughts that society usually suppressed or forbade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Masculinity and Ridicule| first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Anna | last2= Hickey-Moody | journal=Gender: Laughter |publisher=Macmillan Reference|location=Farmington Hills, MI| pages= 215–228 | year= 2017 | url=https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[superego]] allowed the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] to generate [[humor]].&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;  A benevolent [[superego]] allowed a light and comforting type of humor, while a harsh superego created a biting and sarcastic type of humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  A very harsh superego suppressed humor altogether.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;  [[Freud]]’s humor theory, like most of his ideas, was based on a dynamic among [[id, ego, and super-ego]].&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;  The commanding superego would impede the ego from seeking pleasure for the id, or to momentarily adapt itself to the demands of reality,&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt; a mature coping method.  Moreover, Freud (1960)&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; followed [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ideas of energy being conserved, bottled up, and then released like so much steam venting to avoid an explosion.  Freud was imagining psychic or emotional energy, and this idea is now thought of as the relief theory of laughter.

Later, Freud re-turned his attention to humor noting that not everyone is capable of formulating humor.&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name = Newirth8&gt;Newirth, J. (2006). Jokes and their relation to the unconscious: humor as a fundamental emotional experience. ''Psychoanalytic dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 557–571&lt;/ref&gt;

==The different types of humor==
If [[jokes]] let out forbidden thoughts and feelings that the conscious mind usually suppresses in deference to society,&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, A. (2006). ''Humor.'' In The internet encyclopedia of philosophy. http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/humor.htm#H3, retrieved from the web on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there was an interaction between unconscious drives and conscious thoughts.

[[Mimesis]], on the other hand, was a process involving two different representations of the body in our mind.&lt;ref name = Freud2/&gt;&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt; For example, in the phrase “Their hearts are in the right place,” the heart has two representations.  One is, of course, anatomical while the other is a metaphorical reference to caring and meaning well.

===Tendentious jokes===
Tendentious jokes are jokes that have to contain lust, hostility or both.

===Non-tendentious jokes===

The [[comic]] meant applying “to one and the same act of ideation, two different ideational methods” (Freud, 1905, 300; as cited in Matte, G. (2001)&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;). [[William Shakespeare]]’s [[Falstaff]] would be an example of Freud's "comic," generating laughter by expressing previously repressed inhibition.&lt;ref name = Kincaid4&gt;Kincaid, J. R. (2001). ''Falstaff as an example for Freud’s “comic.”'' http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/dickens/kincaid2, retrieved from the web on the 12 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An upset American says at Sunday School: "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] is my Shepherd; I am in want. He makes me to lie down on park benches; he leads me in the paths of destruction for His party's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. (2006) ''Studies in American humor'', University of Southern California, http://www.compedit.com/introduction.htm, retrieved from the web 17 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In advertising ==
An analysis of content from [[business-to-business]] advertising magazines in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany found a high (23 percent) overall usage of humor. The highest percentage was found in the British sample at 26 percent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCullough|first=Lynette S.|last2=Taylor|first2=Ronald K.|date=1993|title=Humor in American, British, and German Ads|url=|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|volume=22|pages=17-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the types of humor found by McCullough and Taylor,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; three categories correspond with Freud’s grouping of tendentious (aggression and sexual) and non-tendentious (nonsense) wit. 20 percent of the humor are accounted for as “aggression” and “sexual.” “Nonsense” is listed at 18 percent.

==Criticism==
It has been claimed that Freud's division is artificial and not very clear.&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1&gt;Altman, N. (2006). And now for something completely different: Humor in psychoanalysis. ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'', '''16'''(5), 573–577.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Altman (2006),&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; these divisions are more semantic than functional.  Hence, all three types of humor may be the result of the dynamic of the [[conscious]] and [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].&lt;ref name = Newirth8/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt; For example, hate and anger can be hidden by a false sense of love and compassion, which could be the opposite of what was meant, and which could formulate a joke.&lt;ref name = Matte7/&gt;&lt;ref name =Freud3/&gt;&lt;ref name =Altman1/&gt;

The '''Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict''' (IFHV) at [[Ruhr University Bochum]] (Germany) is one of the leading research institutes on [[humanitarian law]] and [[humanitarian studies]] in Europe.

It was founded in 1988 on the initiative of Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Knut Ipsen, then rector of Ruhr University Bochum, as a means to conduct research on international conflicts and provide solutions to resolve them. The IFHV’s research is highly interdisciplinary with a focus on international humanitarian studies from a legal and social-scientific perspective.

The Institute also provides high-level academic and professional training for the next generation of personnel in the area of humanitarian action. The IFHV’s interdisciplinary angle is put into practice through its Joint Master’s Programme in International Humanitarian Action, part of the [[European University Network on Humanitarian Assistance]] (NOHA).

Since 2014, the Institute is headed by Prof. Dr. Pierre Thielbörger, M.PP. ([[Harvard]]). Its staff consists of about 25 employees (including student research assistants) and about 10 PhD students.

Current professors involved in the Institute’s work are: 
* Prof. Dr. Dennis Dijkzeul (IFHV)
* Prof. Dr. Horst Fischer (IFHV)
* Prof. Dr. Hans-Joachim Heintze (IFHV)
* Prof. Dr. Pierre Thielbörger, M.PP. (Harvard) (IFHV &amp; Faculty of [[Law]]; Managing Director)

The '''Kiel Institute for the World Economy''' (Institut für Weltwirtschaft, IfW) is an economics research center and a [[think tank]] that is located in [[Kiel]], Germany.
In 2013, it was ranked as one of the top 20 research centers in the world for [[International Trade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.int.html |title=Field Ranking at IDEAS |date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the top four think tanks in the world for [[economic policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012_Global_Go_To_Think_Tank_Report_-_FINAL-1.28.13.pdf |title=University of Pennsylvania, International Relations Program |date=January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627063611/http://www.gotothinktank.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2012_Global_Go_To_Think_Tank_Report_-_FINAL-1.28.13.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With more than four million publications in printed or electronic format and subscriptions to 31,970 periodicals and journals, the Institute has the world's largest specialist library for economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.zbw.eu/e_about_us/e_library_profile.htm |title=ZBW – German National Library |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is affiliated with the [[University of Kiel]] where it cooperates closely with the Department of Business, Economics, and Social Sciences. It is nevertheless legally and academically independent of the University of Kiel. Since 1 January 2007, it has been an independent, nonprofit organization (foundation under public law). It is a member of an association of research institutions, museums, and service centers called the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community or Leibniz Association and is ranked as one of the top six leading economics research institutions in the Leibniz Association. Like all the institutions that are members of the Leibniz Association, it is funded 50% by the German federal government and 50% by the German states. It employs approximately 160 people, of whom more than 80 are economists. It is headed by a president, currently [[Dennis J. Snower]].

==History==
The Kiel Institute was founded under the name of Königliches Institut für Seeverkehr and Weltwirtschaft an der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel (Royal Institute for Maritime Transport and World Economics at the University of Kiel) on 18 February 1914, and opened two days later at the address Schlossgarten 14. With the help of its Sponsors' Association, it was to acquire new premises in 1919, a hotel called the Seebadeanstalt, which was owned by the [[Krupp]] family. It moved into these new premises in the spring of 1920, and changed its name to its current German name in 1934. Its mission as part of the University of Kiel was to study the world economy, which was a unique mission, as other economics institutes at the time studied only national economies. The founding director and first head of the Kiel Institute, {{Interlanguage link multi|Bernhard Harms|de}}, directed the establishment of a research library, which was systematically expanded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Gülich|de}}, the head of the library for a number of years as of 1924, into the world's largest economics library. Harms also established several journals and an economics-related press archive. Further, he attached great importance to linking research to practical economics and to teaching research findings to economics students. The Institute, at the time, conducted international research for the benefit of Germany, which led to the establishment of a war archive and to the expansion of the Institute during [[World War I]]. During the [[Weimar Republic]], the Institute established a reputation for competence in international economics. In 1926, the Institute established a department for statistical economics and business cycle research, which gave the Institute a new profile in business cycle theory and business cycle policies. The new department was headed by [[Adolph Lowe]] and staffed by such researchers as {{Interlanguage link multi|Gerhard Colm|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Neisser|de}}, [[Jacob Marschak]], and [[Wassily Leontief]], all of whom published highly acclaimed research findings.

When the Nazis took over power in Germany, Jewish members of staff and members of staff who were active in the Social Democratic Party were quickly forced to leave the Institute. This affected the new department for statistical economics and business cycle research the most, and many of the staff in the department emigrated to the United States, where they became professors of economics. Bernhard Harms initially supported the Nazis and remained the head of the Institute, but later resisted the Nazi SA when it forced the Jewish members of staff to leave the Institute, and was himself then forced to leave. Formally, he retained his professorship at the University of Kiel, but was actually only active academically as an honorary professor in Berlin until his death in 1939. Harms was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jens Jessen (economist)|de|3=Jens Jessen|lt=Jens Jessen}}, who, because of differences with the Nazis, had himself transferred to the University of Marburg in October 1934. He was succeeded by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Predöhl|de}}, who had worked for a long time under Bernhard Harms. Predöhl served as director of the Institute from July 1934 to November 1945. He strengthened the ties between the Institute and the University of Kiel and prevented the Institute's library from being cleansed of books written by Jews. During his term in office, the library was also able to buy foreign literature until far into World War II. The Institute conducted international economic research that was important for Germany's war planning and its economic aspects, for example, access to natural resources and the geopolitical significance of areas that Germany considered to be part of its "Grossraum" (economic areas under German supremacy), up until 1945. A comprehensive analysis of the research conducted by the Institute between 1933 and 1945 has never been undertaken. The complete holdings of the library were moved to Ratzeburg (Herzogtum Lauenburg) and thus were not destroyed during the war. However, parts of the Institute and its press archive were destroyed. After the war, British occupation authorities dismissed Predöhl as the director of the Institute (in November 1945) but allowed him remain a professor at the University of Kiel, which he left for a professorship at the University of Münster in 1953. He died at the age of 80 in Münster in 1974.

Friedrich Hoffmann was temporarily appointed to replace Predöhl as the acting director of the Institute and was succeeded, in 1948, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Baade|de}} (1893–1974), who devoted himself primarily to research in agricultural economics and food security. Under his leadership and thanks to his good connections in the United States and other countries, he was able to reintegrate the Institute into the international research community and to expand its role as an important economic research center with its own large library and its own archive of press clippings.

{{Interlanguage link multi|Erich Schneider (economist)|de|3=Erich Schneider (Ökonom)|lt=Erich Schneider}} (1900–1970) succeeded Fritz Baade as the director of the Institute in 1961. As the leading proponent of Keynesianism in Germany at the time and the author of a multivolume bestseller entitled "Einführung in die Volkwirtschaftslehre" (Introduction to Economics), he affiliated the Institute more closely with the University of Kiel, which later resulted in many researchers at the Institute becoming professors at German and non-German universities. He also established the Bernhard Harms Prize in 1964, on the occasion of the Institute's 50th anniversary. The first person to be awarded the prize, Gerhard Colm, was a former researcher at the Institute, a professor, an advisor to President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], and the engineer of the German currency reform in 1948.

[[Herbert Giersch]] (1921–2010) was appointed director of the Institute in 1989, and subsequently became president of the Institute. Numerous economic sea changes that determined the Institute's research and policy-advising activities took place during his period in office: the Bretton Woods system collapsed, oil prices began to climb, and developing countries and emerging markets  started producing manufactured goods for world markets. He strengthened the Institute's policy-advising role in Germany by playing a leading intellectual role in the German Council of Economic Experts. In this role, the Institute became involved in numerous controversies with the German government because it differed with the government on such important issues as  exchange rate policies and monetary, labor, and industrial policies. Under Giersch's leadership, the Institute became significantly more active in research of an international, applied nature. As a result, it played a leading role in  the Sonderforschungsbereich 86 "Weltwirtschaft und internationale Wirtschaftsbeziehungen" (Special Research Area 86 for Global Economics and Global Economic Affairs).

Giersch was succeeded by [[Horst Siebert]] (1938–2009) in 1989. Numerous economic sea changes also took place during his period in office: communist economies collapsed, the two Germanys were reunited, China became a world economic power, information technology emerged, and reforms of the labor market and social security systems became topical, as did the sustainable use of environmental resources as well. During his period in office, he was, like Herbert Giersch before, a member of the German Council of Economic Experts. Further, he defined the Institute's public image by often appearing on television and by publishing numerous articles and monographs on topical economic issues. Under his leadership, the Institute became more involved in environmental and resource economics, and international financial market economics. Siebert served as the president of the Institute until 2003, when he was given emeritus status.

After a period of 18 months in which the Institute had difficulties appointing a new president, [[Dennis Snower|Dennis J. Snower]] (born 1950) succeeded Siebert. Snower was appointed president of the Institute in October 2004 and is the first non-German to be appointed head of a leading economic research institute in Germany. He reorganized the Institute from the ground up, redefined its mission, and established such events as the Global Economic Symposium and the Global Economy Prize Awards, both of which are symbolic of the Institute's mission: to be a highly competent center for global economic affairs in research, education and policy-advising pertaining to topics and issues that are of immediate social importance  from a global perspective, and to strike a balance between being a research center on its own and a part of various research networks. The Institute participates in the German Joint Economic Forecast. {{As of|2007|1}}, the Institute's library became an independent nonprofit organization (under public law) called the [[German National Library of Economics]] (ZBW).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1767">The '''laminar sublayer''', also called the '''viscous sublayer''', is the region of a mainly-[[turbulence|turbulent]] flow that is near a [[No-slip condition|no-slip boundary]] and in which the flow is [[Laminar flow|laminar]]. As such, it is a type of [[boundary layer]]. The existence of the laminar sublayer can be understood in that the flow velocity decreases towards the no-slip boundary. Because of this, the [[Reynolds number]] decreases until at some point the flow crosses the threshold from turbulent to laminar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imc.pcz.czest.pl/instytut/pl/3/3.8/materialy/afm_bl/afm_bl4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The laminar sublayer is important for river-bed [[ecology]]: below the laminar-turbulent interface, the flow is stratified, but above it, it rapidly becomes well-mixed. This threshold can be important in providing homes and feeding grounds for [[benthic]] organisms.&lt;ref&gt;journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid...&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether the roughness due to the bed sediment or other factors are smaller or larger than this sublayer has an important bearing in [[hydraulics]] and [[sediment transport]]. Flow is defined as [[hydraulically rough flow|hydraulically rough]] if the roughness elements are larger than the laminar sublayer (thereby perturbing the flow), and as [[hydraulically smooth flow|hydraulically smooth]] if they are smaller than the laminar sublayer (and therefore ignorable by the main body of the flow).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.personal.kent.edu/~amoore5/FST_L_6a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Loc. cit.''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]], short for '''''loco citato''''', meaning "in the place cited") is a [[footnote]] or [[endnote]] term used to repeat the title and page number for a given work (and author). ''Loc. cit.'' is used in place of [[ibid.]] when the reference is not only to the work immediately preceding, but also refers to the same page. Therefore, ''loc. cit.'' is never followed by volume or page numbers. ''Loc. cit.'' may be contrasted with ''[[op. cit.]]'' (''opere citato'', "in the work cited"), in which reference is made to a work previously cited, but to a different page within that work.

==Sample usage==
* Example 1:

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. R. Millan, "Art of Latin grammar" (Academic, New York, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10. ''Loc. cit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the above example, the ''loc. cit.'' in reference #10 refers to reference #9 in its entirety, including page number. Note that ''loc. cit.'' is capitalized in this instance.

* Example 2:

&lt;blockquote&gt;9. R. Millan, "Art of Latin grammar" (Academic, New York, 1997), p. 23.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;10. G. Wiki, "Blah and its uses" (Blah Ltd., Old York, 2000), p. 12.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;11. Millan, ''loc. cit.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the second example, the ''loc. cit.'' in reference #11 refers to reference #9, including page number.

The mental world may be populated with, or framed with, [[intentions]], [[sensory field]]s, and corresponding objects.

The mental world is usually considered to be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and not [[Objectivity (science)|objective]].

In [[psychologism]], [[mathematical objects]] are mental objects.

[[Descartes]] argued for a mental world as separate from the physical world.&lt;ref name="medi-descart"&gt;''Meditations'', [[Renes Descartes]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Debates regarding [[free will]] include how it could be possible for anything in the mental world to have an effect on the physical world.

[[Reasoning]] laws about a mental world are different than the ones for a [[physical world]].

Roughly speaking, in [[decision theory]], [[game theory]], and [[rational choice]], '''menu dependence''' arises when the evaluation of alternatives for choice or the mode of selection guiding choice varies parametrically{{huh|date=October 2016}} with what collection of alternatives is available for choice (i.e., with what "menu" or decision problem a decision maker is facing).  Menu dependence can be accompanied by violations of various so-called consistency (or coherence) constraints, such as Sen's condition α (also known as Chernoff's Axiom, a '''contraction''' condition) and Sen's conditions γ and β ('''expansion''' conditions).   While the phenomenon can arise in a variety of ways, menu dependence is often informally associated with a change in a decision maker's preferences among alternatives with the addition of [[independence of irrelevant alternatives|irrelevant alternative]]s.

'''Metageography''' is a term used by [[Martin W. Lewis]] and [[Kären E. Wigen]]'s 1997 ''The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E. Wigen |title=The Myth of Continents: a Critique of Metageography |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |ISBN=0-520-20742-4 |pages=35 |chapter= |quote= }} (hardcover; {{ISBN|0-520-20743-2}} paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;  which analyzes metageographical constructs such as "East", "West", "Europe", "Asia", "North" or "South". which they define as "the set of spatial structures through which people order their knowledge of the world" Geographies, wrote one reviewer, are thus much more than just the ways in which societies are stretched across the earth's surface. They also include the "contested, arbitrary, power-laden, and often inconsistent ways in which those structures are represented epistemologically."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/4/7.htm Book review by Barney Warf, African Studies Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Martin explained: "By 'metageography' I mean the relatively unexamined and often taken-for-granted spatial frameworks through which knowledge is organized within all fields of the social sciences and humanities." He added that "the distinction between the merely geographical and the metageographical is not always clear-cut.&lt;ref&gt;Leonhardt van Efferink [http://www.exploringgeopolitics.org/interview_lewis_martin_metageographies_postmodernism_fallacy_of_unit_comparability_historical_spatial_ideological_development_constructs_taxonomy_ideas_systems/ Martin Lewis: Metageographies, postmodernism and fallacy of unit comparability] ''Exploring Geopolitics'' August 2010 (Accessed 05/01/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was criticized by [[James M. Blaut]]: "the word metageography seems to have been coined by the authors as an impressive-sounding synonym for 'world cultural geography.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Blaut  |first =James M |authorlink = |title =The Myth of Continents: A Critique of Metageography (Review) |journal =Journal of World History |volume =10 |issue = 1 |pages =205–210 |publisher = |location = |date =1999 |language = |url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/jwh/summary/v010/10.1blaut.html |jstor = |issn = |doi = 10.1353/jwh.2005.0002 |accessdate = |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Wigen, however, disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Lewis, Martin W and Karen Wigen  |first = |authorlink = |title =Third Worldism or Globalism?

In 1969, Soviet geographers Gokhman, Gurevich and Saushkin wrote that "[m]etageography is concerned with study of the common basis of geographical regularities and the potentialities of geography as a science"  and argued that many factors must be taken into account in order to define geographical entities, not simply spatial ones.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Motion graphic design''' is a subset of [[graphic design]] in that it uses graphic design principles in a [[filmmaking]] or [[video production]] context (or other temporally evolving visual medium) through the use of [[animation]] or [[Film techniques|filmic techniques]]. Examples include the [[kinetic typography]] and graphics used in film and television opening sequences, and the spinning, three-dimensional [[station identification]] logos of some [[television channel]]s. The art form has been around for decades, and has advanced in technical sophistication over time.

A motion graphic designer may be a person trained in traditional graphic design who has learned to integrate additional elements into their existing skill set of design knowledge, though motion designers can also come from [[film]]making or animation backgrounds, and may use tools or training from those fields as well. 

Popular use of motion graphic design is used in the film industry. Openings to movies, television shows, and news programs can use photography, typography, and motion graphics to make the introduction more entertaining. The graphics used in television show introductions will usually represent the tone of the program. For example, high action television shows will contain fast-paced and bold graphics in the openings.

==Technology==
Technological advancements during the 20th and 21st centuries have greatly impacted the field; chief among these are improvements in modern computing technology, as [[computer program]]s for the film and video industries became more powerful and more widely available during this period. Modern motion graphic design typically involves any of several computerized tools and processes.

One of the leading computer programs used by modern motion graphic designers has been [[Adobe After Effects]], which allows the user to create and modify graphics over time. Another relatively recent product used in the market is [[Apple Inc.]] [[Motion (software)|Motion]], now a part of [[Final Cut Studio]]. Software such as Maxon Cinema4D has integrated tools to create motion graphics, such as the native MoGraph plugin, or ICE of Softimage, which can also be used for similar purposes.

[[Adobe Flash]] has also been widely used to create motion graphic design, particularly for the web, where it is sometimes used in [[web design]], but also in some animation products, such as animated [[web television]] productions like [[Homestar Runner]].

Recent empirical research suggests that 3 to 5% of the population are affected by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10687919/Dont-like-music-Scientists-explain-why.html|title=Musical anhedonia: why some people just don't like music|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable finding relevant to this phenomenon was borne out of a scientific study conducted in 2014, which revealed that while those exhibiting musical anhedonia do not have a problem comprehending music, they simply fail to experience or exhibit any material form of positive emotional response from listening to it.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/musical-anhedonia_us_586e717ce4b02b5f85875c21|title=Not Liking Music Is An Actual Neurological Condition|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2017-01-06|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-06-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have utilized [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) scans to study patients via scanning their brains while the patients are being presented with the auditory stimulus of musical sounds. Patients were given other psychological and emotional perception-oriented tests that were related to the notion of money during the MRI procedure to effectively control the experiment for music or to isolate the effect or effects of the independent variable of music (i.e., in other words, to make sure they only showed no emotion while listening to music). The studies revealed that, relative to the average person, individuals whom are shown to exhibit this condition tend to have a significantly lesser degree of a connection in their brain between their [[auditory processing]] and [[reward center]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mas-Herrero|first=Ernest|last2=Zatorre|first2=Robert J.|last3=Rodriguez-Fornells|first3=Antoni|last4=Marco-Pallarés|first4=Josep|date=2014-03-17|title=Dissociation between Musical and Monetary Reward Responses in Specific Musical Anhedonia|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14)00133-X|journal=Current Biology|language=English|volume=24|issue=6|pages=699–704|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.01.068|issn=0960-9822}}&lt;/ref&gt; MRI scans also showed that people with this condition have relatively little connection between the [[nucleus accumbens]] and [[auditory processing]] compared to the average person. In fact, it was also empirically deduced that individuals who are shown to enjoy listening to music have a higher connection in this area of the brain than those who are found to have the condition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social stigma==
The majority of the world's population enjoys listening to music.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} According to some, for this reason, music can be considered to be a universal language. Individuals who suffer from musical anhedonia tend to find it challenging for themselves to understand why it is that they do not gain pleasure from listening to music. The core societal benefits that have emerged out of the new empirical research on the phenomenon are two-fold: it has helped people with this condition to better understand why they have it and it has served to educate the rest of the population that it is a real and legitimate condition that significantly impacts the lives of many around the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Neofeminism''' describes an emerging view of women as becoming empowered through the celebration of attributes perceived to be conventionally feminine, that is, it glorifies a womanly essence over claims to equality with men. It is a term that has come into use in the early 21st century to refer to a popular culture trend, what critics see as a type of "[[lipstick feminism]]" that confines women to stereotypical roles, while it erodes cultural freedoms women gained through the [[second-wave feminism]] of the 1960s and 1970s in particular. 

==Origins==
The term has been used since the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] to refer broadly to any recent manifestation of feminist activism, mainly to distinguish it from the [[First-wave feminism]] of the [[suffragettes]]. It was used in the title of a best-selling 1982 book by Jacques J. Zephire about French feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''Le Neo-Feminisme de Simone de Beauvoir'' (Paris: Denoel/Gonthier 9782282202945). Zephir used the term to differentiate de Beauvoir's views from writers described as "Neofeminist", such as literary theorist [[Luce Irigaray]], who indicated in her own writing that women had an essentialist femininity that could express itself in ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (feminine writing/language), among other ways. Céline T. Léon has written, "one can only identify the existentialist's [de Beauvoir's] glorification of transcendence with the type of feminism that Luce Irigaray denounces in ''Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un'': "Woman simply equal to men would be like them and therefore not women"."{{page needed|date=July 2015}}

de Beauvoir's views were quite the opposite: {{blockquote|Over and against the neofeminists' attempts at getting rid of phallogocentrism and creating a new [feminine] writing style, she denounces as a contradiction this imprisonment of women in a ghetto of difference/singularity: "I consider it almost antifeminist to say that there is a feminine nature which expresses itself differently, that a woman speaks her body more than a man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leon|first=Celine T.|title=Feminist Interpretations of Simone de Beauvoir|year=2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=9780271041759|pages=150–2|editor=Margaret A. Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Later writers and popular culture commentators appear to have continued this use of the term to describe essentialist feminism. It has been used by sociologists to describe a new popular culture movement that "celebrates both the feminine body and women's political achievements": {{blockquote|Women do and should realize their autonomy through their femininity. In its "''Elle'' magazine form" (Chollet 2004), Neofeminism champions the free choice of women in appearance, lifestyle, and sexuality. This consumerist orientation retains the advances of legal equality in political space but urges women to celebrate their femininity in their personal lives, a category that includes careers, clothing, and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=John R.|title=Why the French Don't Like Headscarves: Islam, the State, and Public Space|year=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400837564|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Other uses==
The term has also been equated with the [[New feminism]] described by Pope John Paul II. Feminist film scholar, Hilary Radner has used the term neo-feminism to characterized the iteration of feminism advocated by Hollywood's spate of romantic comedies inaugurated by ''Pretty Woman'' (Gary Marshall, 1990) often described as postfeminist. Radner argues that the origins of neo-feminism can be traced back to figures such as Helen Gurley Brown writing in the 1960s, meaning that the term postfeminism (suggesting that these ideas emerged after second wave feminism) is potentially misleading .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/526111216|title=Neo-feminist cinema : girly films, chick flicks and consumer culture|last=Hilary.|first=Radner,|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415877732|location=New York|oclc=526111216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parallel universe''' is a hypothetical self-contained [[reality]] co-existing with one's own. A specific group of parallel universes are called a "[[multiverse]]", although this term can also be used to describe the possible parallel universes that constitute reality. While the terms "parallel universe" and "alternative reality" are generally [[synonym]]ous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternative reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own. The term "parallel universe" is more general, without implying a relationship, or lack of relationship, with our own universe. A universe where the very [[Physical law|laws of nature]] are different – for example, one in which there are no Laws of Motion – would in general count as a parallel universe but not an alternative reality and a concept between both fantasy world and earth.

The actual [[many-worlds interpretation|quantum-mechanical]] hypothesis of parallel universes is "universes that are separated from each other by a single quantum event."{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Overview==
Fantasy has long borrowed an idea of "another world" from [[mythology|myth]], [[legend]] and [[religion]]. [[Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]], and [[Valhalla]] are all "alternative universes" different from the familiar material realm. [[Plato]] reflected deeply on the parallel realities, resulting in [[Platonism]], in which the upper reality is perfect while the lower earthly reality is an imperfect shadow of the heavenly. The lower reality is similar but with flaws.

Modern [[fantasy]] often presents the concept as a series of planes of existence where the laws of nature differ, allowing [[magic in fiction|magical]] phenomena of some sort on some planes. This concept was also found in ancient [[Hindu mythology]], in texts such as the [[Puranas]], which expressed an infinite number of universes, each with its own gods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Similarly in [[Persian literature]], "The Adventures of Bulukiya", a tale in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', describes the protagonist Bulukiya learning of alternative worlds/universes that are similar to but still distinct from his own.&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Irwin|first1=Robert|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|date=2005|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|location=London|isbn=1860649831}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2017}} In other cases, in both fantasy and [[science fiction]], a parallel universe is a single other material reality, and its co-existence with ours is a rationale to bring a protagonist from the author's reality into the fantasy's reality, such as in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]] or even the beyond-the-reflection travel in the two main works of [[Lewis Carroll]]. Or this single other reality can invade our own, as when [[Margaret Cavendish]]'s English heroine sends submarines and "birdmen" armed with "fire stones" back through the portal from ''[[The Blazing World]]'' to Earth and wreaks havoc on England's enemies. In [[dark fantasy]] or [[Horror fiction|horror]] the parallel world is often a hiding place for unpleasant things, and often the protagonist is forced to confront effects of this other world leaking into his own, as in most of the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and the ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' computer game series, or ''[[Warhammer 40,000|Warhammer 40K]]'' miniature and computer games. In such stories, the nature of this other reality is often left mysterious, known only by its effect on our own world.

The concept also arises outside the framework of quantum mechanics, as is found in [[Jorge Luis Borges]] short story ''El jardín de senderos que se bifurcan'' ("[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]"), published in 1941 before the many-worlds interpretation had been invented. In the story, a [[Sinology|Sinologist]] discovers a manuscript by a Chinese writer where the same tale is recounted in several ways, often contradictory, and then explains to his visitor (the writer's grandson) that his relative conceived time as a "garden of forking paths", where things happen in parallel in infinitely branching ways. One of the first [[Science fiction]] examples is [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'', in which portions of alternative universes replace corresponding geographical regions in this universe. ''[[Sidewise in Time]]'' describes it in the manner that similar to requiring both [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] coordinates in order to mark your location on Earth, so too does time: travelling along latitude is akin to [[time travel]] moving through past, present and future, while travelling along latitude is to travel perpendicular to time and to other realities, hence the name of the short story. Thus, another common term for a parallel universe is "another dimension", stemming from the idea that if the 4th [[dimension]] is time, the 5th dimension - a direction at a right angle to the fourth - are alternate realities.

While this is a common treatment in Science fiction, it is by no means the only presentation of the idea, even in [[hard science fiction]]. Sometimes the parallel universe bears no historical relationship to any other world; instead, the laws of nature are simply different from those in our own, as in the novel ''[[Raft (novel)|Raft]]'' by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], which posits a reality where the [[gravitational constant]] is much larger than in our universe. (Note, however, that Baxter explains later in ''[[Vacuum Diagrams]]'' that the protagonists in ''Raft'' are descended from people who came from the [[Xeelee Sequence]] universe.)

One motif is that the way time flows in a parallel universe may be very different, so that a character returning to one might find the time passed very differently for those he left behind. This is found in folklore: King Herla visited Fairy and returned three centuries later; although only some of his men crumbled to dust on dismounting, Herla and his men who did not dismount were trapped on horseback, this being one folkloric account of the origin of the [[Wild Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs (1967) p.50-1&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} [[C. S. Lewis]] made use of this in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''; indeed, a character points out to two skeptics that there is no need for the time between the worlds to match up, but it would be very odd for the girl who claims to have visited a parallel universe to have dreamed up such a different time flow - from their perspective, the girl had only been gone for a few minutes though she was in Narnia for hours, and if she was making it up surely she would have spent a while longer hiding than a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bassham|first1=Gregory|title=Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy: The Lion, the Witch, and the Worldview|date=2005|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago|isbn=0812695887|page=171|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The division between science fiction and fantasy becomes fuzzier than usual when dealing with stories that explicitly leave the universe we are familiar with, especially when our familiar universe is portrayed as a subset of a multiverse. Picking a genre becomes less a matter of setting, and more a matter of theme and emphasis; the parts of the story the author wishes to explain and how they are explained. ''[[Narnia]]'' is clearly a fantasy, and the TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' is clearly science fiction, but works like the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' series or ''[[Glory Road]]'' tend to occupy a much broader middle ground.

==Science fiction==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
While technically incorrect, and looked down upon by hard science-fiction fans and authors, the idea of another "[[dimension]]" has become synonymous with the term "parallel universe". The usage is particularly common in [[movies]], television and [[comic books]] and much less so in modern prose science fiction. The idea of a parallel world was first introduced in comic books with the publication of ''The Flash'' #123, "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

In written science fiction, "new dimension" more commonly – and more accurately – refer to additional [[Coordinate axis|coordinate axes]], beyond the three spatial axes with which we are familiar. By proposing travel along these extra axes, which are not normally [[perceptible]], the traveler can reach worlds that are otherwise unreachable and invisible.

[[File:Flatland cover detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edwin A. Abbott]]'s ''[[Flatland]]'' is set in a world of two dimensions.]]
In 1884, [[Edwin A. Abbott]] wrote the seminal novel exploring this concept called ''[[Flatland|Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]]''. It describes a world of two dimensions inhabited by living squares, triangles, and circles, called Flatland, as well as Pointland (0 dimensions), Lineland (1 dimension), and Spaceland (three dimensions) and finally posits the possibilities of even greater dimensions. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

In 1895, ''[[The Time Machine]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]] used time as an additional "dimension" in this sense, taking the [[Spacetime|four-dimensional]] model of [[classical physics]] and interpreting time as a space-like dimension in which humans could travel with the right equipment. Wells also used the concept of parallel universes as a consequence of time as the fourth dimension in stories like ''[[The Wonderful Visit]]'' and ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', an idea proposed by the astronomer [[Simon Newcomb]], who talked about both time and parallel universes; "Add a fourth dimension to space, and there is room for an indefinite number of universes, all alongside of each other, as there is for an indefinite number of sheets of paper when we pile them upon each other".{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There are many examples where authors have explicitly created additional spatial dimensions for their characters to travel in, to reach parallel universes. In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the Doctor accidentally enters a parallel universe while attempting to repair the [[TARDIS]] console in "[[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]]". The parallel universe was similar to the real universe but with some different aspects, Britain has a fascist government and the royal family has been executed. [[Douglas Adams]], in the last book of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', uses the idea of [[probability]] as an extra [[Coordinate axis|axis]] in addition to the classical four dimensions of space and time similar to the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum physics]]. Though, according to the novel, they're not really parallel universes at all but only a model to capture the continuity of space, time and probability. [[Robert A. Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', postulated a six-dimensional universe. In addition to the three spatial dimensions, he invoked [[symmetry]] to add two new temporal dimensions, so there would be two sets of three. Like the fourth dimension of H. G. Wells' [[The Time Traveller (character)|"Time Traveller"]], these extra dimensions can be traveled by persons using the right equipment.

===Hyperspace===
{{main article|Hyperspace (science fiction)}}

Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of "hyperspace" often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a [[faster-than-light]] shortcut for [[interstellar travel]]. Rationales for this form of hyperspace vary from work to work, but the two common elements are:
#at least some (if not all) locations in the hyperspace universe map to locations in our universe, providing the "entry" and "exit" points for travellers.
#the travel time between two points in the hyperspace universe is much shorter than the time to travel to the analogous points in our universe. This can be because of a different speed of light, different speed at which time passes, or the analogous points in the hyperspace universe simply being much closer to each other.

Sometimes "hyperspace" is used to refer to the concept of additional coordinate axes. In this model, the universe is thought to be "crumpled" in some higher spatial dimension and that traveling in this higher spatial dimension, a ship can move vast distances in the common spatial dimensions. An analogy is to crumple a newspaper into a ball and stick a needle straight through, the needle will make widely spaced holes in the two-dimensional surface of the paper. While this idea invokes a "new dimension", it is not an example of a parallel universe.  It ''is'' a more scientifically plausible use of hyperspace. (See [[wormhole]].)

While use of hyperspace is common, it is mostly used as a [[plot device]] and thus of secondary importance. While a parallel universe may be invoked by the concept, the nature of the universe is not often explored. So, while stories involving hyperspace might be the most common use of the parallel universe concept in fiction, it is not the most common source of fiction ''about'' parallel universes.

===Time travel and alternative history===
[[File:H G Wells pre 1922.jpg|thumb|right|British author [[H. G. Wells]]' 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]'', an early example of [[time travel]] in modern fiction]]
{{Main article|Time travel|Alternate history}}

Parallel universes may be the backdrop to or the consequence of time travel, their most common use in [[Time travel in fiction|fiction]] if the concept is central to the story. A seminal example of both is in [[Fritz Leiber]]'s novel ''[[The Big Time]]'' where there's a war across time between two [[alternative future]]s manipulating history to create a timeline that results in or realizes their own world.

Time travelers in fiction often accidentally or deliberately create [[alternative history|alternative histories]], such as in ''[[The Guns of the South]]'' by [[Harry Turtledove]] where the [[Confederate Army]] is given thousands of [[AK-47]] rifles and ends up winning the [[American Civil War]]. (However, [[Ward Moore]] reversed this staple of alternative history fiction in his ''[[Bring the Jubilee]]'' (1953), where an alternative world where the [[Confederate States of America]] won the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] and the [[American Civil War]] is destroyed after a historian and time traveler from the defeated United States of that world travels back to the scene of the battle and, by inadvertently causing the death of the Confederate officer whose troops occupied [[Little Round Top]], changes the result so that the Union forces are victorious.) The alternative history novel ''[[1632 (novel)|1632]]'' by [[Eric Flint]] explicitly states, albeit briefly in a prologue, that the time travelers in the novel (an entire town from [[West Virginia]]) have created a new and separate universe when they're transported into the midst of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 17th century [[Germany]]. (This sort of thing is known as an ISOT among alternative history fans, after [[S. M. Stirling]]'s ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'': an ISOT is when territory or a large group of people is transported back in time to another historical period or place.){{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Ordinarily, [[alternative history|alternative histories]] are not technically parallel universes. The concepts are similar but there are significant differences. Where characters travel to the past, they may cause changes in the timeline (creating a point of divergence) that result in changes to the present. The alternative present will be similar in different degrees to the original present as would be the case with a parallel universe. The main difference is that parallel universes co-exist whereas only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment.&lt;!--maybe not the best term here but i introduce 'moment' below--&gt; Another difference is that moving to a parallel universe involves some inter-dimensional travel whereas &lt;!--moving between?--&gt;alternative histories involve some type of time travel. (However, since the future is only potential and not actual, it is often conceived that more than one future may exist simultaneously.)

The concept of "sidewise" time travel, a term taken from Murray Leinster's "[[Sidewise in Time]]", is often used to allow characters to pass through many different alternative histories, all descendant from some common branch point. Often worlds that are similar to each other are considered closer to each other in terms of this sidewise travel. For example, a universe where World War II ended differently would be "closer" to us than one where Imperial China colonized the New World in the 15th century. [[H. Beam Piper]] used this concept, naming it "paratime" and writing a series of stories involving the Paratime Police who regulated travel between these alternative realities as well as the technology to do so. [[Keith Laumer]] used the same concept of "sideways" time travel in his 1962 novel ''[[Worlds of the Imperium]]''. More recently, novels such as [[Frederik Pohl]]'s ''[[The Coming of the Quantum Cats]]'' and [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Anathem]]'' explore human-scale readings of the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation|"many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics]], postulating that historical events or human consciousness spawns or allows "travel" among alternative universes.

Universe 'types' frequently explored in sidewise and alternative history works include worlds whose [[Axis victory in World War II|Nazis won the Second World War]], as in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]], ''[[SS-GB]]'' by [[Len Deighton]], and ''[[Fatherland (novel)|Fatherland]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], and worlds whose Roman Empire never fell, as in ''[[Roma Eterna]]'' by [[Robert Silverberg]] and ''[[Romanitas (novel)|Romanitas]]'' by [[Sophia McDougall]]. The novel ''[[Warlords of Utopia]]'' by [[Lance Parkin]] explored a multiverse in which the universes whose Rome never fell go to war with all those whose Nazis won World War II. It fits loosely in the [[Faction Paradox]] series initiated by [[Lawrence Miles]], several of whose novels featured an artificially created universe existing within another; specifically, within a bottle. ''[[Dead Romance]]'' explored the consequences of inhabitants of the 'real' universe entering the Universe-in-a-Bottle.

In [[Philip Pullman]]'s trilogy ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', the protagonist begins in a world that is a Victorian counterpart to ours, although it takes place at the same time.&lt;!--is contemporary to ours?--&gt; It also appears that the [[Protestant Reformation]] happened differently with John Calvin becoming the last Pope.

===Counter-Earth===
The concept of [[Counter-Earth]] is typically similar to that of parallel universes but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-earth is a planet that shares [[Earth's orbit]] but is on the opposite side of the Sun and, therefore, cannot be seen from Earth. There would be no necessity that such a planet would be like [[Earth]] in any way though typically in fiction; it is usually nearly identical to Earth. Since Counter-Earth is always within the [[universe]] (and the [[Solar System]]), travel to it can be accomplished with ordinary space travel.

Gerry and Sylvia Anderson used this concept in their 1969 movie ''[[Doppelgänger (1969 film)|Doppelgänger]]'' (released outside Europe as ''Journey to the Far Side of the Sun''), in which a Counter-Earth is detected by astronomers and a manned mission launched by a US-European space consortium to explore it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Convergent evolution===
[[Convergent evolution]] is a biological concept whereby unrelated species acquire similar traits because they adapted to a similar environment and/or played similar roles in their ecosystems. In fiction, the concept is extended whereby similar planets will result in races with similar cultures and/or histories.

Technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' frequently explored such worlds:

*In "[[Bread and Circuses (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Bread and Circuses]]" the ''Enterprise'' encounters a planet called Magna Roma, which has many physical resemblances to Earth such as its atmosphere, land to ocean ratio, and size. The landing party discovers that the planet is at roughly a late 20th-century level of technology but its society is similar to the Roman Empire, as if the Empire had not fallen but had continued to that time: there is also a reference to the Roman god [[Jupiter]] as the namesake of a new line of automobile, and gladiator fights are televised in [[primetime]]. [[Slavery]] on this world has also developed into an institution, with slaves guaranteed medical benefits and old-age pensions, so the workers grew more content and never rebelled. At the end of the episode, it is discovered that the society has just found their own version of [[Jesus]], referred simply as "the son" (whose followers they had previously mistaken for [[Solar deity|sun worshipers]]).
*In "[[The Omega Glory]]", the crew visit a planet on which there is a conflict between two peoples called the Yangs and the Kohms. They discover that the Yangs are like Earth's "Yankees" (in other words, Americans) and the Kohms are like Earth's Communists; the Yangs, who had at some point in the past been conquered by the Kohms, had a ritual speech that was word for word identical to the American [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], and treated the [[U.S. Constitution]] as a sacred text. (A deleted scene from the episode, however, implied that both the Yangs and Kohms were actually descendants of human colonists.)
*In "[[Miri (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Miri]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew encounter a planet that is physically identical to Earth. Histories on the two planets were apparently identical until the 20th century when scientists had accidentally created a deadly virus that killed all the adults but extended the lives of the children (who call themselves the "Onlies").

===Convergent evolution due to contamination===
A similar concept in biology is [[gene flow]]. In this case, a planet may start as different from Earth, but due to the influence of Earth culture, the planet comes to resemble Earth in some way; technically this is not a type of parallel universe since such planets can be reached via ordinary space travel, but the stories are similar in some respects. ''Star Trek'' used this theory as well: in "[[Patterns of Force (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Patterns of Force]]", a planet is discovered that has become very similar to Nazi Germany due to the influence of a historian that came to reside there (believing that the Nazi fascism itself was not evil and under benevolent leadership could be "good government"), while in "[[A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)|A Piece of the Action]]", the ''Enterprise'' crew visits a planet that, 100 years after a book ''Chicago Mobs of the Twenties'' that had been left behind by previous Earth craft, their society resembles mob ruled cities of the [[Prohibition era]] United States.

===Simulated reality===

{{main article|Simulated reality in fiction}}

Simulated realities are digital constructs featured in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]''.

==Fantasy==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}

===Stranger in a strange land===
[[Image:Oz-and-surrounding-countrie.jpg|right|thumb|[[Land of Oz|Oz]] and its surroundings.]]
Fantasy authors often want to bring characters from the author's (and the reader's) reality into their created world. Before the mid-20th century, this was most often done by hiding fantastic worlds within hidden parts of the author's own universe. Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an [[ogre]] or other fantastical beings could live an hour away, but increasing geographical knowledge meant that such locations had to be farther and farther off.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=C. S.|last2=Hooper|first2=Walter|title=Of Other Worlds: Essays and Stories|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0156678977|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in the author's world could board a ship and find themselves on a fantastic island, as [[Jonathan Swift]] does in ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' or in the 1949 novel ''[[Silverlock]]'' by [[John Myers Myers]], or be sucked up into a [[tornado]] and land in [[Land of Oz|Oz]]. These "[[Lost World (genre)|lost world]]" stories can be seen as geographic equivalents of a "parallel universe", as the worlds portrayed are separate from our own, and hidden to everyone except those who take the difficult journey there. The geographic "lost world" can blur into a more explicit "parallel universe" when the fantasy realm overlaps a section of the "real" world, but is much larger inside than out, as in [[Robert Holdstock]]'s novel ''[[Mythago Wood]]''. Madeleine L'engle, "Wrinkle in Time" series: characters go from the present time to places in the universe.

After the mid-20th century, perhaps influenced by ideas from science fiction, perhaps because exploration had made many places on the map too clear to write "[[Here be dragons|Here there be dragons]]", many fantasy worlds became completely separate from the author's world.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] is a [[Portal (fiction)|portal]] or [[Artifact (fantasy)|artifact]] that connects worlds together, prototypical examples being the wardrobe in [[C. S. Lewis]]' ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', or the sigil in [[James Branch Cabell]]'s ''[[The Cream of the Jest]]''. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]'', [[Chihiro Ogino]] and her parents climb over a small stream into the spirit world. The main difference between this type of story and the "lost world" above, is that the fantasy realm can only be reached by certain people, or at certain times, or after following certain rituals, or with the proper artifact.

In some cases, physical travel is not even possible, and the character in our reality travels in a dream or some other [[altered state of consciousness]]. Examples include the ''[[Dream Cycle]]'' stories by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] or the ''[[Thomas Covenant]]'' stories of [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]. Often, stories of this type have as a major theme the nature of reality itself, questioning if the dream-world can have the same "reality" as the waking world. Science fiction often employs this theme (usually without the dream-world being "another" universe) in the ideas of [[cyberspace]] and [[virtual reality]].

===Between the worlds===
[[Image:Šachovnice.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' -- and the parallel universe [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] found there]]
Most stories in this mold simply transport a character from the real world into the [[fantasy world]] where the bulk of the action takes place. Whatever gate is used &amp;ndash; such as the tollbooth in ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'' by [[Norton Juster]], or the mirror in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' &amp;ndash; is left behind for the duration of the story, until the end, and then only if the protagonists will return.

However, in a few cases the interaction between the worlds is an important element, so that the focus is not on one world or the other, but on both, and their interaction. After [[Rick Cook]] introduced a computer programmer into a [[high fantasy]] world, his ''[[Rick Cook#Wizardry series|Wizardry]]'' series steadily acquired more interactions between this world and ours. In [[Aaron Allston]]'s ''[[Aaron Allston#Doc Sidhe|Doc Sidhe]]'' our "grim world" is paralleled by a "fair world" where the elves live and history echoes ours. A major portion of the plot deals with preventing a change in interactions between the worlds. [[Margaret Ball (writer)|Margaret Ball]], in ''No Earthly Sunne'', depicts the interaction of our world with Faerie, and the efforts of the Queen of Faerie to deal with the slow drifting apart of Earth and Faerie. [[Poul Anderson]] depicts Hell as a parallel universe in ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', and the need to transfer equivalent amounts of mass between the worlds explains why a [[changeling]] is left for a kidnapped child. Interactions between magical and scientific universes, and the protagonists' attempts to restore and maintain the balance between them, are major plot points in [[Piers Anthony]]'s ''[[Apprentice Adept]]'' series; he depicts two worlds, the "SF" planet Proton and the fantasy-based Phaze, such that every person born in either world has a physical duplicate on the other world. Only when one duplicate has died can the other cross between the worlds. Several of his ''[[Xanth]]'' novels also revolve around interactions between the magical realm of Xanth and "[[mundane|Mundania]]".

Multiple worlds, rather than a pair, increase the importance of the relationships. In ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', there are only our world and [[Narnia]], but in other of C. S. Lewis's works, there are hints of other worlds, and in ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', the [[Wood between the Worlds]] shows many possibilities, and the plot is governed by transportation between worlds, and the effort to right problems stemming from them. In [[His Dark Materials]] by [[Philip Pullman]], the two protagonist Lyra and Will find themselves lost amongst many worlds, and travel them looking for the other. In [[Andre Norton]]'s [[Witch World]], begun with a man from Earth being transported to this world, gates frequently lead to other worlds – or come from them. While an abundance of illusions, disguises, and magic that repels attention make certain parts of Witch World look like parallel worlds, some are clearly parallel in that time runs differently in them, and such gates pose a repeated problem in Witch World. In the radio sitcom ''[[Undone (radio series)|Undone]]'', the main character, Edna Turner, prevents people from a parallel version of [[London]] called "Undone" from moving to London and making the city too weird. There are other parallel versions of London, and one of the main plots in the series is the attempt by The Prince to unite all versions of London together. Travel between the [[many-worlds interpretation|manyworlds]] is the central conceit of [[Ian McDonald (British author)|Ian McDonald]]'s ''[[Everness (series)|Everness]]'', where the protagonist travels to a parallel London in a world without fossil fuels.

[[Linking room]]s of various types (not all actual rooms) can hook together any number of worlds. The characters may chose only one, but the choice is all important in determining the worlds.

===Fantasy multiverses===
The idea of a [[multiverse]] is as fertile a subject for fantasy as it is for science fiction, allowing for epic settings and godlike protagonists. Among the most epic and far-ranging fantasy "multiverses" is that of [[Michael Moorcock]].  Like many authors after him, Moorcock was inspired by the [[many worlds]] interpretation of [[quantum mechanics]], saying: {{cquote|It was an idea in the air, as most of these are, and I would have come across a reference to it in ''New Scientist'' (one of my best friends was then editor) ... [or] physicist friends would have been talking about it. ... Sometimes what happens is that you are imagining these things in the context of fiction while the physicists and mathematicians are imagining them in terms of science. I suspect it is the romantic imagination working, as it often does, perfectly efficiently in both the arts and the sciences.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}}}
Unlike many science-fiction interpretations, Moorcock's ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' stories go far beyond [[alternative history]] to include [[mythology|mythic]] and [[sword and sorcery]] settings as well as some worlds more similar to our own. However, the Eternal Champion himself is incarnate in all of them.

[[Roger Zelazny]] used a mythic [[cosmology]] in his ''[[Chronicles of Amber]]'' series. His protagonist is a member of the royal family of Amber, whose members represent a godlike [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] ruling over a prototypical universe that represents Order. All other universes are increasingly distorted "shadows" of it, ending finally at the other extreme, Chaos, which is the complete negation of the prototype. Travel between these "shadow" universes is only possible by beings descended from the blood of this pantheon. Those "of the blood" can walk through Shadow, imagining any possible reality and then walk to it, making their environment more similar to their desire as they go. It is argued between the characters whether these "shadows" even exist before they're imagined by a member of the royal family of Amber, or if the "shadows'" existence can be seen as an act of godlike creation.

In the ''[[World of Tiers]]'' novels by [[Philip José Farmer]], the idea of godlike protagonists is even more explicit. The background of the stories is a multiverse where godlike beings have created a number of [[pocket universe]]s that represent their own desires. Our own world is part of this series, but our own universe is revealed to be much smaller than it appears, ending at the edge of the Solar System.

The term 'polycosmos' was coined as an alternative to 'multiverse' by the author and editor [[Paul le Page Barnett]], best known by the pseudonym John Grant, and is built from [[Greek language|Greek]] rather than [[Latin]] [[morpheme]]s. It is used by Barnett to describe a concept binding together a number of his works, its nature meaning that "all characters, real or fictional [...] have to co-exist in all possible real, created or dreamt worlds; [...] they're playing hugely different roles in their various manifestations, and the relationships between them can vary quite dramatically, but the essence of them remains the same."{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

There also are multiverses in the [[Warcraft universe]], ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series, and [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Chrestomanci]]'', ''[[Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Deep Secret]]'' books and standalone book ''[[A Sudden Wild Magic]]''.

===Fictional universe as alternative universe===
{{main article|Fictional universe}}
There are many examples of the [[meta-fiction]]al idea of having the author's created universe (or any author's universe) rise to the same level of "reality" as the universe we're familiar with. The theme is present in works as diverse as H.G. Wells' ''[[Men Like Gods]]'', Myers' ''Silverlock'', and Heinlein's ''Number of the Beast''. [[Fletcher Pratt]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] took the protagonist of the [[Harold Shea]] series through the worlds of Norse myth, [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'', [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and the ''[[Kalevala]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moorcock|first1=Michael|title=Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy|date=2004|publisher=MonkeyBrain|location=Austin, Texas|isbn=1932265074|page=88|edition=Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; – without ever quite settling whether writers created these parallel worlds by writing these works, or received impressions from the worlds and wrote them down. In an interlude set in "[[Kubla Khan|Xanadu]]", a character claims that the universe is dangerous because the poem went unfinished, but whether this was his misapprehension or not is not established.

Some fictional approaches definitively establish the independence of the parallel world, sometimes by having the world differ from the book's account; other approaches have works of fiction create and affect the parallel world: [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', taking place on an astral plane, is populated by the daydreams of mundane people, and in [[Rebecca Lickiss]]'s ''[[Eccentric Circles]]'', an elf is grateful to [[Tolkien]] for transforming elves from dainty little creatures.  These stories often place the author, or authors in general, in the same position as Zelazny's characters in Amber. Questioning, in a literal fashion, if writing is an act of creating a new world, or an act of discovery of a pre-existing world.

Occasionally, this approach becomes self-referential, treating the literary universe of the work itself as explicitly parallel to the universe where the work was created. [[Stephen King]]'s seven-volume ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|Dark Tower]]'' series hinges upon the existence of multiple parallel worlds, many of which are King's own literary creations. Ultimately the characters become aware that they are only "real" in King's literary universe (this can be debated as an example of [[breaking the fourth wall]]), and even travel to a world – twice – in which (again, within the novel) they meet Stephen King and alter events in the real Stephen King's world outside of the books.  An early instance of this was in works by [[Gardner Fox]] for DC Comics in the 1960s, in which characters from the Golden Age (which was supposed to be a series of comic books within the DC Comics universe) would cross over into the main DC Comics universe. One comic book did provide an explanation for a fictional universe existing as a parallel universe. The parallel world does "exist" and it resonates into the "real world." Some people in the "real world" pick up on this resonance, gaining information about the parallel world which they then use &lt;!--'use to' here is not an error for 'used to'; this comment is to repel well-meaning bots--&gt; to write stories.

[[Robert Heinlein]], in ''[[The Number of the Beast (novel)|The Number of the Beast]]'', quantizes the many parallel fictional universes - in terms of ''fictons''.  A number of fictional universes are accessible along one of the three axes of time which Dr. Jacob Burroughs' "time twister" can access. Each quantum level change - a ''ficton'' - along this time axis corresponds to a different universe from one of several bodies of fiction known to all four travellers in the inter-universal, time travelling vehicle ''Gay Deceiver''.  Heinlein also "[[breaks the fourth wall]]" by having "both Heinleins" (Robert and his wife [[Virginia Heinlein|Virginia]]) visit an inter-universal science-fiction and fantasy convention in the book's last chapter. The convention was convened on Heinlein character [[Lazarus Long]]'s estate on the planet "Tertius" to attract the evil "Black Hats" who pursued the main characters of ''[[The Number of the Beast]]'' through space and time in order to destroy Dr. Burroughs and his invention.  Heinlein continues this literary conceit in ''[[The Cat Who Walks Through Walls]]'' and ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]'', using characters from throughout his science-fictional career, hauled forth from their own "fictons" to unite in the war against the "Black Hats."

Heinlein also wrote a stand-alone novel, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'', whose two protagonists fall from alternative universe into alternative universe (often naked), and after a number of such adventures die and enter a stereotypically [[Fundamentalist Christian]] Heaven (with many of its internal contradictions explored in the novel). Their harrowing adventures through the universes are then revealed to have been "destruction testing" of their souls by [[Loki]], sanctioned by the Creator person of the Christian God ([[Yahweh]]). The Devil appears as the most sympathetic of the gods in the story, who expresses contempt for the other gods' cavalier treatment of the story's main characters.
 
Thus, ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' rings in the theological dimension (if only for the purpose of satirizing evangelical Christianity) of parallel universes, that their existence can be used by God (or a number of gods, Loki seems to have made himself available to do Yahweh's dirty work in this novel).  It manages also to have a fictional multiverse angle in that references are made to Heinlein's early SF/fantasy short story "[[They (Heinlein)|They]]," a solipistic tale in which reality is constantly being transmogrified behind the scenes to throw the central character off his guard and keep him from seeing reality as it is, which was set in the same Heinlein fictional universe as ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]''.

===Elfland===
{{main article|Álfheim}}

[[Álfheim|Elfland]], or Faerie, the otherworldly home not only of [[Elf|elves]] and [[Fairy|fairies]] but [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and other folkloric creatures, has an ambiguous appearance in folklore.

On one hand, the land often appears to be contiguous with 'ordinary' land. [[Thomas the Rhymer]] might, on being taken by the Queen of Faerie, be taken on a road like one leading to Heaven or Hell.

This is not exclusive to English or French folklore. In [[Norse mythology]], Elfland ([[Alfheim]]) was also the name of what today is the Swedish province of [[Bohuslän]]. In the sagas, it said that the people of this petty kingdom were more beautiful than other people, as they were related to the [[elves]], showing that not only the territory was associated with elves, but also the race of its people.

While sometimes folklore seems to show fairy intrusion into human lands – "[[Tam Lin]]" does not show any otherworldly aspects about the land in which the confrontation takes place – at other times the otherworldly aspects are clear. Most frequently, time can flow differently for those trapped by the fairy dance than in the lands they come from; although, in an additional complication, it may only be an appearance, as many returning from Faerie, such as [[Oisín]], have found that time "catches up" with them as soon as they have contact with ordinary lands.

Fantasy writers have taken up the ambiguity. Some writers depict the land of the elves as a full-blown parallel universe, with portals the only entry – as in [[Josepha Sherman]]'s [[Josepha Sherman#Prince of the Sidhe|Prince of the Sidhe]] series or [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''[[Elf Defense]]'' – and others have depicted it as the next land over, possibly difficult to reach for magical reasons – [[Hope Mirrlees]]'s ''[[Lud-in-the-Mist]]'', or [[Lord Dunsany]]'s ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''. In some cases, the boundary between Elfland and more ordinary lands is not fixed. Not only the inhabitants but Faerie itself can pour into more mundane regions. [[Terry Pratchett]]'s ''[[Discworld]]'' series proposes that the world of the Elves is a "parasite" universe, that drifts between and latches onto others such as Discworld and our own world (referred to as "Roundworld" in the novels). In the young teenage book ''[[Mist]]'' by [[Kathryn James]], the Elven world lies through a patch of mist in the woods. It was constructed when the Elven were thrown out of our world. Travel to and fro is possible by those in the know, but can have lethal consequences.

===Isekai===
{{main|Isekai}}
[[Isekai]], is a subgenre of Japanese fantasy light novels, manga, anime, and video games revolving around a normal person being transported to or trapped in a parallel universe. Often, this universe already exists in the protagonist's world as a fictional universe, but it may also be unbeknownst to them.

==Films==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The most famous treatment of the alternative universe concept in film could be considered ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which portrays a parallel world, famously separating the magical realm of the [[Land of Oz]] from the mundane world by filming it in [[Technicolor]] while filming the scenes set in [[Kansas]] in [[sepia tone|sepia]]. At times, alternative universes have been featured in small scale independent productions such as Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo's ''[[It Happened Here]]'' (1964), featuring an alternative United Kingdom which had undergone [[Operation Sea Lion]] in 1940 and had been defeated and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. It focused on moral questions related to the professional ethics of Pauline, a nurse forced into Nazi collaboration.

Another common use of the theme is as a prison for [[villain]]s or [[demons]]. The idea is used in the first two ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' movies starring [[Christopher Reeve]] where [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] villains were sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] from where they eventually escaped. An almost exactly parallel use of the idea is presented in the campy cult film ''[[The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension]]'', where the "8th dimension" is essentially a "phantom zone" used to imprison the villainous Red Lectroids. Uses in [[horror films]] include the 1986 film ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'' (based on the [[H. P. Lovecraft]] [[From Beyond (short story)|story]] of the same name) where a scientific experiment induces the experimenters to perceive [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|aliens]] from a parallel universe, with bad results. The 1987 [[John Carpenter]] film ''[[Prince of Darkness (film)|Prince of Darkness]]'' is based on the premise that the essence of a being described as [[Satan]], trapped in a glass canister and found in an abandoned church in [[Los Angeles]], is actually an alien being that is the 'son' of something even more evil and powerful, trapped in another universe. The protagonists accidentally free the creature, who then attempts to release his "father" by reaching in through a [[mirror]].

Some films present parallel realities that are actually different contrasting versions of the narrative itself.  Commonly this motif is presented as different points of view revolving around a central (but sometimes unknowable) "truth", the seminal example being [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]''. Conversely, often in [[film noir]] and [[crime film|crime dramas]], the alternative narrative is a fiction created by a central character, intentionally – as in ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' – or unintentionally – as in ''[[Angel Heart]]''. Less often, the alternative narratives are given equal weight in the story, making them truly alternative universes, such as in the [[Germany|German]] film ''[[Run Lola Run]]'', the short-lived British [[West End theatre|West End]] musical ''[[Our House (musical)|Our House]]'' and the [[Great Britain|British]] film ''[[Sliding Doors]]''.

More recent films that have explicitly explored parallel universes are: the 2000 film ''[[The Family Man]]'', the 2001 [[cult movie]] ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', which deals with what it terms a "tangent universe" that erupts from our own universe; ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1993) has the eponymous heroes cross over into a parallel universe ruled by humanoids who evolved from dinosaurs; ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' (2001) starring [[Jet Li]], in which there is a complex system of realities in which Jet Li's character is a police officer in one universe and a [[serial killer]] in another, who travels to other universes to destroy versions of himself, so that he can take their energy; and ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'' (2004), the main character runs away from a totalitarian nightmare, and he enters into a cyber-afterlife alternative reality. The current  ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' films are set in an alternative universe created by the first film's villain traveling back in time, thus allowing the franchise to be [[reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] without affecting the continuity of any other ''Star Trek'' film or show. The 2011 science-fiction thriller ''[[Source Code]]'' employs the concepts of quantum reality and parallel universes. The characters in ''[[The Cloverfield Paradox]]'', the third installment of the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|franchise]], accidentally create a ripple in the time-space continuum and travel into an alternate universe, where the [[Clover (creature)|monster]] and the events in the [[Cloverfield (film)|first film]] transpired. [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]] has also experimented with this through some of their animated films such as ''[[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Robin Hood]]'', ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'', ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' and ''[[Zootopia]]'', where anthropomorphic animals take on the role of (in this case, nonexistent) humans and emulating the latter's characteristics, without abandoning their hereditary own.

==Television==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
The idea of parallel universes have received treatment in a number of television series, usually as a single story or episode in a more general [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] storyline.

The 1990s TV series ''[[Sliders]]'' depicts a group of adventurers visiting assorted parallel universes, as they attempt to find their "home" universe. Included in the 1st season is a universe where the world is stuck in the ice age, with no life anywhere. Another episode includes 'Honest Abe' never to be president, in which the United States loses World War I and World War II, and they are controlled by a senator, and technology is at an all-time low.

One of the earliest television plots to feature parallel time was a 1970 storyline on soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. Vampire Barnabas Collins found a room in Collinwood which served as a portal to parallel time, and he entered the room in order to escape from his current problems. A year later, the show again traveled to parallel time, the setting this time being 1841.

A well known and often imitated example is the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode entitled "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]".  The episode introduced an [[Mirror Universe|alternative version of the ''Star Trek'' universe]] where the main characters were barbaric and cruel to the point of being [[evil]].  When the parallel universe concept is [[parody|parodied]], the allusion is often to this ''Star Trek'' episode.  A previous episode for the ''Trek'' series first hinted at the potential of differing reality planes (and their occupants), titled "[[The Alternative Factor]]". A mad scientist from "our" universe, named Lazarus B., hunts down the sane Lazarus A.; resident of an [[antimatter]]-comprised continuum.  His counterpart, in a state of paranoia, claims the double threatens his and the very cosmos' existence. With help from Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], A traps B along with him in a "anti"-universe, for eternity, thus bringing balance to both [[matter]] oriented realms. A similar plot was used in the ''Codename: Kids Next Door'' episode Operation: P.O.O.L..

The mirror universe of ''Star Trek'' was further developed by later series in the franchise. In several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', the later evolution of the mirror universe is explored. A two-part episode of ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', entitled "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]", serves as a [[prequel]], introducing the early developments of the Mirror Universe.

In the 1970s young adult British SF series [[The Tomorrow People]], its second-season episode, ''A Rift in Time'' (March–April 1974) pitted the three telepath core characters and allies against time travelling interlopers from an [[alternative history]] where the [[Roman Empire]] developed the [[steam engine]] in the first century CE, had a technological headstart, did not fragment during the fifth century and underwent accelerated technological development. The Roman eagle standard was planted on the Moon in the fifth century and by its alternative twentieth century, it had mastered interstellar travel, had a galactic empire and time travel. Consequently, the Tomorrow People had to rectify this aberrant timeline by dismantling and disabling the anomalous steam engine.

Multiple episodes of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'' use the concept.  In "Parallel Universe" the crew meet alternative versions of themselves: the analogues of Lister, Rimmer and Holly are female, while the Cat's alternative is a dog.  "Dimension Jump" introduces a heroic alternative [[Ace Rimmer|Rimmer]], a version of whom reappears in "Stoke Me a Clipper".  The next episode, "Ouroboros", makes contact with a timeline in which Kochanski, rather than Lister, was the sole survivor of the original disaster; this alternative Kochanski then joins the crew for the remaining episodes.

''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' experienced a Parallel universe where she was a mental patient in ''[[Normal Again]]'' and not really "The Slayer" at all.  In the end, she has to choose between a universe where her mother and father are together and alive (mother) or one with her friends and sister in it where she has to fight for her life daily. In [[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)]], Cordelia Chase inadvertently created a dystopian alternative reality in which Buffy had never moved from LA to Sunnydale. Her core-universe allies [[Xander Harris]] and [[Willow Rosenberg]] had become vampires in that timeline.

The plot of the [[Charmed (season 4)|season four]] episode of ''[[Charmed]]'', entitled "Brain Drain", features [[The Source (Charmed)|The Source of All Evil]] kidnapping Piper Halliwell and forcing her into a deep coma, where she experiences an alternative reality in which the Halliwell manor is actually a mental institution. She and her sisters serve as patients in this universe, their powers only a manifestation of their minds, a ruse put up to trick Piper into willingly relinquishing the sisters' magic.

The animated series, ''[[Futurama]]'', had [[The Farnsworth Parabox|an episode]] where the characters travel between "Universe 1" and "Universe A" via boxes containing each universe; and one of the major jokes is an extended argument between the two sets of characters over which set were the "evil" ones.

The idea of a parallel universe and the concept of [[déjà vu]] was a major plot line of the first-season finale of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', guest-starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. The show has gone on to feature the parallel universe prominently.

In the 2010 season of ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', the result of characters traveling back in time to prevent the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 apparently creates a parallel reality in which the Flight never crashed, rather than resetting time itself in the characters' original timeline. The show continued to show two "sets" of the characters following different destinies, until it was revealed in the series finale that there was really only one reality created by the characters themselves to assist themselves in leaving behind the physical world and passing on to an afterlife after their respective deaths.

In the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', in the Androids Saga, Future Trunks returns to the past to give Goku medicine to prevent him from dying of a heart disease and warns him of the Androids, in the process creating parallel realities, leading to the appearance of Cell, who killed the same Future Trunks from a different splitting timeline to come back to the main timeline when the Androids are still alive for him to absorb. The Majin Buu Saga later depicts Kaio-Shin Realms and the Afterlife. Its sequel, ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'', later features separate universes that are in pairs whose numbers add up to the total number of the universe: 13 in this case. Previously there were 18 universes, but Zen'o (the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball Multiverse) destroyed 6 of them in a rage. Previously, Daizenshuu 7 stated that the typical Dragon Ball Universe had only 4 galaxies, but ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' effectively retcons this, where Whis says that the universe contains endless galaxies.

The [[anime]] ''[[Turn A Gundam]]'' attempted to combine all the parallel [[Gundam]] universes (other incarnations of the series, with similar themes but differing stories and characters, that had played out at different times since the debut of the concept in the 1970s) of the [[metaseries]] into one single reality.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Eureka Seven: AO]]'' takes place in a parallel universe that is different from the one in the series' predecessor ''[[Eureka Seven]]''. The ''E7'' series started off in the year 12005, and the ''AO'' world, which takes place in the year 2025, would be the home of the two main characters' son.

The [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Katekyo Hitman Reborn!]]'' by Akira Amano features this idea in its third main arc, known as Future arc.

The anime ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' features a parallel world in one of the final episodes. This parallel world is a sharp contrast to the harsh, dark "reality" of the show and presents a world where all the characters enjoy a much happier life. This parallel world would become the basis for the new Evangelion manga series ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days|Angelic Days]]''.

The anime series ''[[Bakugan]]'' features a parallel universe called Vestroia and is the homeworld of fantastic creatures called Bakugan. The series' hero Dan Kuso alongside his friends and teammates must save Earth and Vestroia from total destruction. Season 2 &amp; 3 feature another universe where Dan and his team save the day. They go to another dimension or universe through a pathway. The other universe has also other life forms and other types of technology.

In another anime series, ''[[Digimon]]'', there is parallel universe called "digital world". The show's child protagonists meet digital monsters, or digimon, from this world and becomes partners and friends. In the third story arc of ''[[Digimon Fusion]]'', the Clockmaker (who is later revealed to be Bagramon) and his partner Clockmon travel through space-time to recruit heroes from previous series so they can help the Fusion Fighters to defeat Quartzmon before DigiQuartz can absorb each human and digital world in the multiverse.

In the anime series ''[[Umineko no Naku Koro ni]]'' the rounds of the battle between Battler and Beatrice take place in different dimensions, in order to show all kinds of possibilities (much to Battler's dismay) also the character Bernkastel is known for her ability to travel into different worlds by the usage of "fragments".

In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Parallels]]", Lt. [[Worf]] traveled to several parallel universes when his shuttlecraft went through a time space fissure.

The ''[[Community (TV series)|Community]]'' episode [[Remedial Chaos Theory]], six different timelines and one "prime" timeline are explored, each having a different outcome based on which member of the study group goes to get the [[pizza]]. One timeline, dubbed the "Darkest Timeline", results in the greatest amount of terrible incidents and ends with Abed donning a felt goatee bearing resemblance to Spock's in "Mirror, Mirror".

In the 2003 anime series of ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist (anime)|Fullmetal Alchemist]]'', there exists a gateway that can be conjured by alchemists that acts as a source of all knowledge and energy; towards the end of the series, it is revealed that this gateway connects the world of the anime with the real world, set during the first decades of the 20th century. It is revealed that the two worlds shared a common history until their histories [[Point of divergence|diverged]], apparently due to the success of alchemy in one world and that of modern physics in the other.

===As an ongoing subplot===
Sometimes a television series will use parallel universes as an ongoing subplot.  ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' elaborated on the premise of the original series' "Mirror" universe and developed multi-episode story arcs based on the premise.  Other examples are the science fiction series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the fantasy/horror series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' and the romance/fantasy ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

Following the precedent set by ''Star Trek'', these story arcs show alternative universes that have turned out "worse" than the "original" universe: in ''Stargate SG-1'' the first two encountered parallel realities featured Earth being overwhelmed by an unstoppable [[Goa'uld]] onslaught; in ''Buffy'', two episodes concern a timeline in which Buffy came to [[Sunnydale]] too late to stop the vampires from taking control; ''Lois &amp; Clark'' repeatedly visits an alternative universe where [[Clark Kent]]'s adoptive parents, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], died when he was ten years of age, and [[Lois Lane]] is also apparently dead.  Clark eventually becomes Superman, with help from the "original" Lois Lane, but he is immediately revealed as Clark Kent and so has no life of his own.

In addition to following ''Star Trek's'' lead, showing the "evil" variants of the main storyline gives the writers an opportunity to show what is at stake by portraying the worst that could happen and the consequences if the protagonists fail or the importance of a character's presence.

''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' often talks about alternative realms or universes in which all different forms of magic, and non-magic may occur, depending on the realm. According to the Mad Hatter (Sebastian Stan), they "touch each other in a long line of lands, each just as real as the last." He referred to our world's tendency to deny such things as arrogant.

In the season 1 finale of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse-Flash]] opens a singularity that connects his world to a parallel universe called Earth-2. In the second season, [[Flash (Barry Allen)|The Flash]] starts facing villains from that earth who also have doppelgangers on Prime Earth sent by [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]]. The array of Earth-2 villains consists of [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]], Sand Demon, [[King Shark]], and [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Dr. Light]]; all are sent by Zoom to kill The Flash with the assurance of being taken back home. However, they are not the only ones who arrive from the singularity; this also includes the [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Earth-2 Flash]] after a close death and loss of speed from a confrontation with Zoom. When the Earth-2 Flash (called Jay Garrick) introduces himself to Team Flash, Barry (The Flash) distrusts him at first and places him in the metahuman pipeline at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]]. When The Flash starts having a hard time facing off against Sand Demon, he frees Jay so that he could help him as well as train him in his speed. With a new trick taught by Jay, Barry defeats Sand Demon. Later on, the Earth-2 counterpart of the Reverse-Flash, [[Harrison Wells]], arrives in Prime Earth as well. He steals a weapon from Mercury Labs and saves Barry from the Earth-2 King Shark. When Jay confronts and sees Wells again, the argument gets heated between them before Barry intercedes.

The "Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon" series, created by artist Mr Doodleburger, uses footage from the Australian TV drama show [[Home and Away]], but through the use of clever overlaid audio tracks, casts one of the main characters of the show, long running character [[Alf Stewart]] as a vicious violent character in a parallel version of Home and Away. ''see main article'' [[Alf_Stewart#In_popular_culture| Alf Stewart Rape Dungeon Series]]

===Television series involving parallel universes===
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
There have been a few series where parallel universes were central to the series itself.
* ''[[The Fantastic Journey]]'', in which several travelers lost in the Bermuda Triangle find themselves in another world
* ''[[Otherworld (TV series)|Otherworld]]'', in which a family gets trapped in an alternative world
* ''[[Sliders]]'', where a young man invents a worm-hole generator that allows travel to "alternative" Earths.  Several characters travel across a series of "alternative" Earths, trying to get back to their home universe
* ''[[Parallax (TV series)|Parallax]]'', in which a boy discovers portals to multiple parallel universes in his home town
* ''[[Charlie Jade]]'', in which the titular character is accidentally thrown into our universe and is looking for a way back to his own.  The series features three universes - alpha, beta and gamma
* ''[[Awake (TV series)|Awake]]'', where a man switches between realities whenever he goes to sleep: one in which his wife survived a car accident that killed their son, and one in which his son survived but his wife died
* In the TV series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', a main element of the series is the loss of balance and the eventual collision of two universes and the moral ramifications of it. Most main characters have a doppelganger who is usually slightly different from their prime selves.
* In the South Korean Drama ''[[Dr. Jin]]'' (2012), the concept of parallel universes was used. A doctor travels into the past, specifically, the Joseon era, and this results in major changes in history.
* ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', in which there is an infinite number of realities and universes.
* ''[[Stranger Things]]'', in which a small town becomes home to a gateway between dimensions.
* ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', in which Barry Allen travels to multiple parallel universes in the multiverse with the help of his super speed.
* ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', in which several episodes deal with parallel universes, particularly [[Supernatural (season 13)|the thirteenth season]] which features storylines centering around parallel universes known as Apocalypse World and The Bad Place which appears in the [[backdoor pilot]] to the proposed spinoff ''Supernatural: Wayward Sisters''. Apocalypse World is depicted as a dark post-apocalyptic universe where ''Supernatural's'' main protagonists [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] and [[Dean Winchester]] were never born and thus could not stop the end of the world.

==Comic books==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
Parallel universes in modern comics have become particularly rich and complex, in large part due to the continual problem of [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] faced by the major two publishers, [[Marvel Comics]] and [[DC Comics]]. The two publishers have used the [[multiverse]] concept to fix problems arising from integrating characters from other publishers into their own canon, and from having major [[Serial (literature)|serial]] protagonists having continuous histories lasting, as in the case of [[Superman]], over 70 years. Additionally, both publishers have used new alternative universes to re-imagine their own characters. (See ''[[Multiverse (DC Comics)]]'' and ''[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)]]'')

[[DC Comics]] inaugurated its multiverse in the early 1960s, with the reintroduction of [[Golden Age]] superheroes the [[Justice Society of America]] now located on [[Earth-Two]], and devised a "mirror universe" scenario of inverted morality and supervillain domination of [[Earth-Three]] shortly afterward, several years before ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' devised its own darker alternative universe. There was a lull before DC inaugurated additional alternative universes in the seventies, such as Earth-X, where there was an [[Axis victory in World War II]], Earth-S, home to the [[Fawcett Comics]] superheroes of the forties and fifties, such as [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and Earth-Prime, where superheroes only existed in fictional forms.

Therefore, comic books in general are one of the few entertainment mediums where the concept of parallel universes are a major and ongoing theme. DC in particular periodically revisits the idea in major [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] storylines, such as ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', where Marvel has a series called ''[[What If (comics)|What If...]]'' that's devoted to exploring alternative realities, which sometimes impact the "main" universe's continuity. DC's version of "What If..." is the Elseworlds imprint.

DC Comics series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' heralded the return of the Multiverse. ''52'' was a mega-crossover event tied to ''Infinite Crisis'' which was the sequel to the 1980s ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.  The aim was to yet again address many of the problems and confusions brought on by the Multiverse in the DCU.  Now 52 Earths exist and including some Elseworld tales such as ''[[Kingdom Come (comic book)|Kingdom Come]]'', DC's [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[WildStorm]] and an Earth devoted to the [[Charlton Comics]] heroes of DC. ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' and ''Countdown Presents: The Search for [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]]'' and the ''Tales of the Multiverse'' stories expand upon this new Multiverse.

Marvel has also had many large crossover events which depicted an alternative universe, many springing from events in the [[X-Men]] books, such as 1981's ''[[Days of Future Past]]'', 1995's ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'', and 2006's ''[[House Of M]]''. In addition the [[Squadron Supreme]] is a DC inspired Marvel Universe that has been used several times, often crossing over into the mainstream Universe in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] comic. [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]] is an offshoot of the ''[[X-Men]]'' franchise that allows characters to hop from one alternative reality to another, leaving the original, main [[Marvel Universe]] intact. The [[Marvel UK]] line has long had multiverse stories including the [[Jaspers' Warp]] storyline of [[Captain Britain]]'s first series (it was here that the designation [[Earth-616]] was first applied to the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]]).

Marvel Comics, as of 2000, launched their most popular parallel universe, the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Universe]]. It is a smaller subline to the mainstream titles and features [[Ultimate Spider-Man]], [[Ultimate X-Men]], [[Ultimate Fantastic Four]] and the [[Ultimates]] (their "Avengers").

The graphic novel [[Watchmen]] is set in an alternative history, in a 1985 where superheroes exist, the Vietnam War was won by the United States, and [[Richard Nixon]] is in his fifth term as President of the United States.  The Soviet Union and the United States are still locked in an escalating "Cold War" as in our own world, but as the Soviet Union invades [[Afghanistan]] in this world and threatens Pakistan, nuclear war may be imminent.

In 1973, [[Tammy (comics)|Tammy]] published ''The Clock and Cluny Jones'', where a mysterious grandfather clock hurls bully Cluny Jones into a harsh alternative reality where she becomes the bullied. This story was reprinted in [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] annual 1985 as ''Grandfather's Clock.''

In 1978, [[Misty (comics)|Misty]] published ''The Sentinels''. The Sentinels were two crumbling apartment blocks that connected the mainstream world with an alternative reality where [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] conquered Britain in 1940.

In 1981, [[Jinty (comics)|Jinty]] published ''Worlds Apart.'' Six girls experience alternative worlds ruled by greed, sports-mania, vanity, crime, intellectualism, and fear. These are in fact their dream worlds becoming real after they are knocked out by a mysterious gas from a chemical tanker that crashed into their school. In 1977 Jinty also published ''Land of No Tears'' where a lame girl travels to a future world where people with things wrong with them are cruelly treated, and emotions are banned.

The parallel universe concept has also appeared prominently in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|comic series]] from [[Archie Comics]]. The first and most oft-recurring case of this is another "mirror universe" where Sonic and his various allies are evil or anti-heroic while the counterpart of the evil Dr. Robotnik is good. Another recurring universe featured in the series is a [[perpendicular]] dimension that runs through all others, known as the No Zone. The inhabitants of this universe monitor travel between the others, often stepping in with their Zone Cop police force to punish those who travel without authorization between worlds.

In more recent years, the comic has adapted the alternative dimension from the video games [[Sonic Rush]] and [[Sonic Rush Adventure]], home to Sonic's ally Blaze the Cat. The continuities seen in various other Sonic franchises also exist in the comic, most notably those based on the cartoon series [[Sonic Underground]] and [[Sonic X]]. For some years, a number of other universes were also featured that parodied various popular franchises, such as [[Sailor Moon]], [[Godzilla]], and various titles from [[Marvel Comics]]. Archie has also used this concept as the basis for crossovers between Sonic and other titles that they publish, including [[Sabrina the Teenage Witch]] and [[Mega Man]].

The various [[Transformers]] comics also feature the parallel universe concept, and feature the various continuities from different branches of the franchise as parallel worlds that occasionally make contact with each other. Quite notably, the annual [[Botcon]] fan convention introduced a comic storyline that featured [[Cliffjumper]], an [[Autobot]] from the original Transformers series, entering an alternative universe where his fellow Autobots are evil and the [[Decepticons]] are good. This universe is known as the "Shattered Glass" universe, and continued on in comics and text based stories after its initial release.

==Video games==
{{In popular culture|section|date=February 2017}}
In ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' after the main protagonist, Link, defeats the dark lord, Ganon, he travels back in time to his childhood. This results in two alternative histories for Hyrule. In one a younger version Link travels to the land of Termina in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]''. In the other Link is no longer present allowing Ganon to return to go on a rampage that forced the gods of Hyrule to flood the world in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]''. There is also a scenario in which Link is killed by Ganon in the final battle, resulting in an alternative history in which Hyrule is put in an era of decline, leading to the events of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dutton|first1=Fred|title=Nintendo Feature: Zelda Timeline Explained|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|website=Official Nintendo Magazine|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155115/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/16596/features/zelda-timeline-explained/|archivedate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 psychological horror point-and-click adventure game ''[[Dark Seed (video game)|Dark Seed]]'', the main character Mike Dawson discovers a parallel universe by going through his living room mirror.

The [[Kingdom Hearts]] series features a Disney/Square Enix's [[Final Fantasy]] multiverse, in which various worlds are based on Disney films or concepts from the Final Fantasy line. The series also introduces the concepts of different "Realms" corresponding to Light, Darkness, Twilight, and Nothingness.

In the 1999 role-playing game ''[[Outcast (video game)|Outcast]]'', a probe is sent to a parallel universe and is attacked by an "entity". Cutter Slade must escort a team of scientists across to the other world in order to retrieve and repair the damaged probe before the earth is consumed by a black hole.

The ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' series revolves heavily around alternate universes. [[Xen]] is a location in the first Half-Life game, accidentally discovered by scientists and described as a border world between dimensions, where the player must travel to stop an alien invasion. Half-Life 2 features a multidimensional empire called [[Combine (Half-Life)|The Combine]] which has successfully conquered Earth and subdued humanity, among countless other universes and species.

In the [[survival horror]] video game series ''[[Silent Hill]]'', the town of Silent Hill fluctuates between the real world, where Silent Hill is seemingly just an ordinary tourist town, the Fog World, which is like the real world, except the town is shrouded in thick fog and is nearly uninhabited except for monsters and a few people, and a dark and dilapidated version of the town called the "Other World".

In the 1993 adventure PC game ''[[Myst]]'', the unnamed protagonist travels to multiple alternative worlds through the use of special books, which describe a world within and transport the user to that world when a window on the front page is touched.

In the 1996 adventure PC game ''[[9: The Last Resort]]'', after resolving several mind-blowing and unique puzzles, the player gets past "The Tiki Guards"; and a door opens up to "The Void" - actually a room to another universe, which houses the entirety of space.

Both titles of the ''When They Cry'' visual novel series (''[[Higurashi no Naku Koro ni|Higurashi]]'' and ''[[Umineko]]'' for short) contain the concept of parallel worlds. These series both involve some kind of murder mystery. As soon as the main character has 'lost', another parallel world, called a Fragment, is chosen to be observed. This continues until the entire mystery is solved.

''[[EarthBound]]'' features many areas of the game that can be considered alternative dimensions. The first is an illusion created by the Mani Mani Statue that transforms the metropolis of Fourside into a bizarre neon metropolis called Moonside, filled with unusual characters and enemies. The second is Magicant, the world of Ness's subconscious that is accessed after obtaining the Eight Melodies. Finally, toward the end of the game, the protagonists arrive at the Cave to the Past, where they travel back in time to the haunting past dimension of the cave to face Giygas.

''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' features a "Magic Potion" item that when used, creates a doorway allowing the player to temporarily access "Subspace"; a mirrored silhouette version of the world where items can be found.

After the completion of the Special World in ''[[Super Mario World]]'', the overworld transforms from a green-colored springtime to an orange-colored autumnal setting. Many enemies encountered in the game are transformed into bizarre counterparts.

''[[Super Mario 64]]'' features a world called "Tiny Huge Island" which has two variants: one scaled up, the other scaled down. The player can only access certain parts of the level to obtain certain stars depending on which variant they are into. The two variants can be switched between via portals in the world.

''[[Banjo-Kazooie]]'' features a world called "Click Clock Wood", which has spring, summer, autumn and winter variants. The environment develops between the seasons making some areas accessible or inaccessible, and actions taken in one season affect the outcome in others.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' features a dark and twisted parallel version of [[Hyrule]] called the "Dark World".

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages]]'' use a similar concept to that which is used in ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]''. In those games, the player must switch between the parallel past and present worlds (Ages) and between spring, summer, autumn and winter (Seasons) to progress through the game.

In the first half of ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', areas of Hyrule are veiled by the Twilight Realm. These areas are dusky and brooding in appearance, Link cannot transform out of wolf form, characters only appear as spirits that cannot be communicated with, and enemies are twilight variations of their regular forms. Otherwise, the Twilight Realm is identical to regular Hyrule.

[[Resistance: Fall of Man]] is set in alternative universe where Tsarist [[Russia]] never experienced the [[Russian Revolution]] but instead became the bridgehead for an aggressive [[alien invasion]] from a species known as the "Chimera", who then proceed to overrun [[Western Europe]], [[Great Britain]], [[Canada]] and much of the [[United States]], and where there has been no Second World War as a result. The events of the game and its sequels begin in its alternative 1951.

Each Zone in ''[[Sonic CD]]'' has four variations: Past, Present, Bad Future and Good Future, each displaying some subtle and not-so subtle alterations. The series has also seen alternative dimensions in the case of the ''[[Sonic Rush]]'' series, in which Sonic encounters a hero from another world named Blaze the Cat whose nemesis is an alternative counterpart of his own foe, Dr. Eggman. The ''Sonic'' series also makes use of the concept of alternative timelines.

The story of ''[[Chrono Cross]]'' centers around travel between two alternative timelines, the original or "Another World"  and "Home World" which is a [[Many-worlds interpretation|branch]] created by the actions of the heroes of the game's predecessor, ''[[Chrono Trigger]]''.

In ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', the town "Flipside" (which acts as the game's central hub) has an alternative mirrored version called "Flopside". While Flipside appears pristine and the residents there are typically cheerful, Flopside appears somewhat dilapidated and is populated by surly characters.

The series ''[[Legacy of Kain]]'' is played through several realms and timelines.

''[[Sudeki]]'' is set in a realm of light and a parallel realm of darkness.

''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' features an alternative hellish world called "Oblivion", as well as a painting you can climb into and a quest where you enter a dream world.

''[[The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]'' takes place in Termina, a parallel world to [[Hyrule]]. Almost all of the characters from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time reappear in the game.

''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'' pivots around a world of darkness you travel to when you die, which is occupied by World War 1 soldiers.

''[[Metroid Prime 2: Echoes]]'' involves a world, "Aether", having an alternative self in the, "Dark" realm, universe, or dimension. The protagonist, Samus, finds out that she just dropped into a hopeless war for the Luminoth, the dominant species of Light Aether against the Ing, the dominant species of Dark Aether. She also finds her counterpart, Dark Samus or Metroid Prime's essence inside Samus's Phazon Suit.

''[[Crash Twinsanity]]'' features Crash, Cortex, and Nina traveling to the "10th dimension," which could also be a parallel universe (suggested by the theme and how everything seems to be opposite).

''[[Minecraft]]'' features an alternative dimension called "The Nether", that includes a 'hell' like theme. It also contains a second alternative dimension called "The End", home world of the Endermen, a type of monster that spawns rarely in the main world.

''[[Persona 2: Eternal Punishment]]'' takes place in an alternative universe called "This Side" where in the events of Innocent Sin did not take place and the characters have never met in the past.

The ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series takes place in a subtly different universe. For example, the ship that landed the first men on the moon in 1969 is called ''Valiant 11'', rather than [[Apollo 11]]. This universe diverged from ours after [[World War II]], which resulted in a lack of advanced computers, the Cold War, VHS, etc.

The MMORPG ''[[City of Heroes]]'' features a Player vs Player (PvP) zone called Recluse's Victory. It is an alternative future in a constant state of flux, as heroes and villains battle for the future of Earth.

In the text-based science fiction MMORPG ''[[OtherSpace]]'', refugees from Earth's universe were forced to migrate to a parallel universe called ''Hiverspace'', whose quantum divergence occurred billions of years in the past, after damage to the time/space continuum began to tear their own universe apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Wes Platt]] |title=Otherspace: Down to Earth Chronicle |year=2012 |publisher= |page=139 |quote= ..."You did not 'jump' in time. You have jumped dimensions." Nix clarifies. "Hiverspace's timeline is obviously different from you own. ... Our universe, our Orion Arm, was destroyed by untold number of black holes created by a young Kamir not in control of his own powers. The rest of the Kamir gathered as many people from our universe as possible and rifted us all here. Our universe is gone, but it sound like your version of Normalspace still exists, not destroyed by some cataclysmic event. Such is similar for many others who have been brought here. You are just the newest in a long list that ever growing. But, I am not surprised that you were brought here by Kamir-influenced artifacts. In fact, I would be less surprised if you were not."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, they were able to find a means back to a past universe whose quantum divergence from their original ones was relatively minor.

2011 action-adventure video game ''[[Portal 2]]'' features a game-mode entitled "Perpetual Testing Initiative" (PeTI), where a plot item features protagonist "Bendy" through thousands of different worlds of which character Cave Johnson exist in different roles entitled "The Multiverse", and the PeTI's parallel universes are different from the main Half-Life/Portal timeline.

The 2012 visual novel/puzzle video game ''[[Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward]]'' heavily uses the concept of multiple realities as the basis for its plot as well as its central gameplay mechanic of traversing through realities and altering history.

The 2013 first person shooter ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' features the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. The main character is named Booker Dewitt, an homage to physicist ''[[Bryce DeWitt]]''.

The world of the classic cult adventure games of ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' created by Ragnar Thornqast, along with its sequels, deals with the existence of two parallel universes&amp;nbsp;– technological (Stark) and magical (Arcadia).

The 2014 crossover video game ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' features the iconic characters of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. In the game, heroes and villains from ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', and ''[[StarCraft (series)|StarCraft]]'' have been sucked into a trans-dimensional storm called "Nexus". Stranded in a strange limbo of clashing universes, these combatants are joined by the same fate to battle for dominance.

Plankton drive the "[[biological pump]]", a process by which the [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]] transports [[carbon]] from the surface [[euphotic zone]] to the ocean's depths. Such processes are vital to [[carbon dioxide sink]]s, one of several possibilities for countering [[global warming]]. Modern planktology includes behavioral aspects of drifting organisms, engaging modern ''[[in situ]]'' imaging devices.

Some planktology projects allow the public to participate [[online]], such as the [[Long-term Ecosystem Observatory]].

[[Image:Religious syms.svg|thumb|Various [[religious symbols]]]]
'''Religious studies''', alternately known as the '''study of religion''', is an academic field devoted to research into [[religion|religious]] beliefs, [[religious behaviour|behaviors]], and institutions. It describes, compares, interprets, and explains religion, emphasizing systematic, historically based, and cross-cultural perspectives.

While [[theology]] attempts to understand the nature of transcendent or supernatural forces (such as [[deities]]),  religious studies tries to study religious behavior and belief from outside any particular religious viewpoint. Religious studies draws upon multiple disciplines and their methodologies including [[anthropology of religion|anthropology]], [[sociology of religion|sociology]], [[psychology of religion|psychology]], [[philosophy of religion|philosophy]], and [[history of religion]].

Religious studies originated in the 19th century, when scholarly and historical analysis of the [[Bible]] had flourished, and [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist texts]] were first being translated into European languages. Early influential scholars included [[Friedrich Max Müller]], in England, and [[Cornelis Petrus Tiele|Cornelius P. Tiele]], in the Netherlands. Today religious studies is practiced by scholars worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.S. Adcock|title=The Limits of Tolerance: Indian Secularism and the Politics of Religious Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UMfAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, it was known as "[[comparative religion]]" or the '''science of religion''' and, in the USA, there are those who today also know the field as the History of religion (associated with methodological traditions traced to the University of Chicago in general, and in particular [[Mircea Eliade]], from the late 1950s through to the late 1980s). 

The religious studies scholar [[Walter Capps]] described the purpose of the discipline as to provide "training and practice... in directing and conducting inquiry regarding the subject of religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}} At the same time, Capps stated that its other purpose was to use "prescribed modes and techniques of inquiry to make the subject of religion intelligible."{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xiv}}
Religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal characterised the discipline as "a subject matter" that is "open to many approaches", and thus it "does not require either a distinctive method or a distinctive explanation to be worthy of disciplinary status."{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xvii}}

Different scholars operating in the field have different interests and intentions; some for instance seek to defend religion, while others seek to explain it away, and others wish to use religion as an example with which to prove a theory of their own.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xvi}} Some scholars of religious studies are interested in primarily studying the religion to which they belong.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=15}}

Scholars of religion have argued that a study of the subject is useful for individuals because it will provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly [[globalisation|globalised]] world.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=6–7}} It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.{{sfn|Herling|2016|pp=7–10}}

==Etymology==
The term "[[religion]]" originated from the Latin noun ''religio'', that was nominalized from one of three verbs: ''relegere'' (to turn to constantly/observe conscientiously); ''religare'' (to bind oneself [back]); and ''reeligere'' (to choose again).&lt;ref&gt;McBrien, Richard P.  ''Catholicism.'' New York: HarperCollins, 1994, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of these three different potential meanings, an [[etymology|etymological]] analysis alone does not resolve the ambiguity of defining religion, since each verb points to a different understanding of what religion is. During the Medieval Period, the term "religious" was used as a noun to describe someone who had joined a monastic order (a "religious").

==Defining "religion"==
[[File:Totem poles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Totem pole]]s reflect the beliefs of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]; some religious studies scholars argue that the term "religion" is too Western-centric to encompass the beliefs and practices of communities such as these]]

Throughout the history of religious studies, there have been many attempts to define the term "religion".{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xviii}} Many of these have been ''monothetic'', seeking to determine a key, essential element which all religions share, which can be used to define "religion" as a category, and which must be necessary in order for something to be classified as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Capps|1y=1995|1p=xviii|2a1=Herling|2y=2016|2p=37}} There are two forms of monothetic definition; the first are ''substantive'', seeking to identify a specific core as being at the heart of religion, such as a belief in a God or gods, or an emphasis on power.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} The second are ''functional'', seeking to define "religion" in terms of what it does for humans, for instance defining it by the argument that it exists to assuage fear of death, unite a community, or reinforce the control of one group over another.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}} Other forms of definition are ''polythetic'', producing a list of characteristics that are common to religion. In this definition there is no one characteristic that need be common to every form of religion.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=37}}

Causing further complications is the fact that there are various [[secularism|secular]] world views, such as [[nationalism]] and [[Marxism]], which bear many of the same characteristics that are commonly associated with religion, but which rarely consider themselves to be religious.{{sfn|Smart|1998|pp=22–26}}

Conversely, other scholars of religious studies have argued that the discipline should reject the term "religion" altogether and cease trying to define it.{{sfn|Herling|2016|p=36}} In this perspective, "religion" is argued to be a Western concept that has been forced upon other cultures in an act of intellectual imperialism.{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}} According to scholar of religion [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], "many of the peoples that we study by means of this category have no equivalent term or concept whatsoever".{{sfn|McCutcheon|2001|p=10}} There is, for instance, no word for "religion" in languages like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn|Hinnells|2005|p=2}}

==Intellectual foundation and background==
Before religious studies became a field in its own right, flourishing in the United States in the late 1960s,  several key intellectual figures explored religion from a variety of perspectives. One of these figures was the famous [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[William James]]. His 1902 [[Gifford lectures]] and book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' examined religion from a psychological-philosophical perspective and is still influential today. His essay ''[[The Will to Believe]]'' defends the rationality of faith.

[[Max Weber]] studied religion from an economic perspective in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1904-1905), his most famous work. As a major figure in [[sociology]], he has no doubt influenced later sociologists of religion.
[[Émile Durkheim]] also holds continuing influence as one of the fathers of sociology. He explored [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] attitudes and doctrines regarding suicide in his work ''Suicide''. In 1912, he published his most memorable work on religion, ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]''.

==History==
[[Image:Max Muller.jpg|thumb|right|[[Max Müller]]]]Interest in the general study of religion dates back to at least [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] ([[ca.]] 550 [[Common Era|BCE]] &amp;ndash; ca. 476 BCE) and [[Herodotus]] (ca. 484 BCE &amp;ndash; 425 BCE). Later, during the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]]ic scholars such as [[Ibn Hazm]] (d. 1064 CE) studied [[Zoroastrianism|Persian]], [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], and [[Indian religions]], among others. The first history of religion was the ''Treatise on the Religious and Philosophical Sects'' (1127 CE), written by the Muslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Shahrastani]]. [[Peter the Venerable]], also working in the twelfth century, studied Islam and made possible a Latin translation of the [[Qur'an]].
Notwithstanding the long interest in the study of religion, the academic discipline Religious Studies is relatively new. Dr. Chris Partridge notes that the "first professorships were established as recently as the final quarter of the nineteenth century."[http://www.uccf.org.uk/yourcourse/rtsf/docs/academicstudyofreligion.pdf]
In the nineteenth century, the study of religion was done through the eyes of science. [[Max Müller]] was the first Professor of Comparative Philology at [[Oxford University]], a chair created especially for him. In his ''Introduction to the Science of Religion'' (1873) he wrote that it is "the duty of those who have devoted their life to the study of the principal religions of the world in their original documents, and who value and reverence it in whatever form it may present itself, to take possession of this new territory in the name of true science."

Many of the key scholars who helped to establish the study of religion did not regard themselves as scholars of religious studies, but rather as theologians, philosophers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and historians.{{sfn|Capps|1995|p=xv}}

Partridge writes that "by the second half of the twentieth century the study of religion had emerged as a prominent and important field of academic enquiry." He cites the growing distrust of the empiricism of the nineteenth century and the growing interest in non-Christian religions and spirituality coupled with convergence of the work of social scientists and that of scholars of religion as factors involved in the rise of Religious Studies.

One of the earliest academic institutions where Religious Studies was presented as a distinct subject was University College Ibadan, now the [[University of Ibadan]], where [[Geoffrey Parrinder]] was appointed as lecturer in Religious Studies in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|title=Obituary: Geoffrey Parrinder|first=Ursula|last=King|date=4 August 2005|website=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710093222/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/05/guardianobituaries.religion|archivedate=10 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the term "religious studies" became common and interest in the field increased. New departments were founded and influential journals of religious studies were initiated (for example, ''Religious Studies and Religion''). In the forward to ''Approaches to the Study of Religion'', [[Ninian Smart]] wrote that "in the English-speaking world [religious studies] basically dates from the 1960s, although before then there were such fields as 'the comparative study of religion', the 'history of religion', the 'sociology of religion' and so on..."

In the 1980s, in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[United States|America]], "the decrease in student applications and diminishing resources in the 1980s led to cut backs affecting religious studies departments." (Partridge) Later in the decade, religious studies began to pick up as a result of integrating religious studies with other disciplines and forming programs of study that mixed the discipline with more utilitarian study.

Philosophy of religion uses philosophical tools to evaluate religious claims and doctrines.  Western philosophy has traditionally been employed by English speaking scholars.  (Some other cultures have their own philosophical traditions including [[Hinduism|Indian]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Judaism|Jewish]].)  Common issues considered by the (Western) philosophy of religion are the existence of [[God]], belief and rationality, [[religious cosmology|cosmology]], and logical inferences of logical consistency from sacred texts.

Although philosophy has long been used in evaluation of religious claims (''e.g.'' [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]'s debate concerning original sin), the rise of [[scholasticism]] in the 11th century, which represented "the search for order in intellectual life" (Russell, 170), more fully integrated the Western philosophical tradition (with the introduction of translations of [[Aristotle]]) in religious study.

There is some amount of overlap between subcategories of religious studies and the discipline itself.  Religious studies seeks to study religious phenomena as a whole, rather than be limited to the approaches of its subcategories.

===Anthropology of religion===
The [[anthropology of religion]] is principally concerned with the common basic human needs that religion fulfills.

===Cultural anthropology of religion===
The [[cultural anthropology]] of religion is principally concerned with the cultural aspects of religion. Of primary concern to the cultural anthropologist of religions are rituals, beliefs, religious art, and practices of piety.

===Economics of religion===
Gallup surveys have found that the world's poorest countries may be the most religious. Of those countries with average per-capita incomes under $2000, 95% reported that religion played an important role in their daily lives. This is contrasted by the average of 47% from the richest countries, with incomes over $25000 (with the United States breaking the trend by reporting at 65%).&lt;ref name=GallupE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|title=Religiosity Highest in World's Poorest Nations|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823202612/http://www.gallup.com/poll/142727/religiosity-highest-world-poorest-nations.aspx|archivedate=23 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Social scientists have suggested that religion plays a functional role (helping people cope) in poorer nations.&lt;ref name=GallupE/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/Religion-Provides-Emotional-Boost-World-Poor.aspx|title=Religion Provides Emotional Boost to World’s Poor|first=Gallup,|last=Inc.|date=|website=gallup.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912113232/http://www.gallup.com/poll/116449/religion-provides-emotional-boost-world-poor.aspx|archivedate=12 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The New York Times offers a graphic illustrating the correlation (not necessarily causation) [http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/religions-correlation-with-poverty/ between religion and poverty].

===Geography of religion===
The geography of religion is principally concerned with the spatial elements of religious practice and embodiment.  In the 1960s and 1970s, geographers of religion such as Wilbur Zelinsky and David Sopher were mostly associated with the "Berkeley school" of cultural geography and focused mostly on the cultural imprints of religion on the landscape. 
Since the turn in the new cultural geography of religion through the work of James Duncan on the City as Text, geographers of religion have focused on what Lily Kong has called the "politics and poetics" of religion, especially in relation to the political geographies of secular nation-states. Recent interest{{when|date=September 2018}} in the geography of religion has focused on how religious practitioners enact sacred space through their embodied sacred practices as well as the relationship between religion and geopolitics.

===History of religion===
{{See also|History of religion}}
The history of religions is not concerned with theological claims apart from their historical significance.  Some topics of this discipline are the [[historicity]] of religious figures, events, and the evolution of doctrinal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin M. Schultz and Paul Harvey, "Everywhere and Nowhere: Recent Trends in American Religious History and Historiography," ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', 78 (March 2010), 129–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary approaches===
There are many approaches to the study of sacred texts.  One of these approaches is to interpret the text as a literary object.  Metaphor, thematic elements, and the nature and motivations of the characters are of interest in this approach. An example of this approach is ''[[God: A Biography]]'', by [[Jack Miles]].

===Neurological approaches===
The [[temporal lobe]] has been of interest which has been termed the "God center" of the brain. (Ramachandran, ch. 9) [[Neurological]] findings in regard to religious experience is not a widely accepted discipline within religious studies. Scientific investigators have used a [[SPECT]]scanner to analyze the brain activity of both Christian contemplatives and Buddhist meditators, finding them to be quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Origin of religion===
{{main|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Revelation}}
The "origin of religion" refers to the emergence of religious behavior in [[prehistory]], before written records.

===Psychology of religion===
{{Main|Psychology of religion}}

The psychology of religion is concerned with the psychological principles operative in religious communities and practitioners. [[William James]]'s [[The Varieties of Religious Experience]] analyzed personal experience as contrasted with the social phenomenon of religion. Some issues of concern to the psychologist of religions are the psychological nature of [[religious conversion]], the making of religious decisions, [[religion and happiness]], and the psychological factors in evaluating religious claims.

[[Sigmund Freud]] was another figure in the field of psychology and religion.  He used his psychoanalytic theory to explain religious beliefs, practices, and rituals, in order to justify the role of religion in the development of human culture.

===Sociology of religion===
{{main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the [[dialectic]]al relationship between religion and [[society]]; the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs, though the process of comparing multiple conflicting [[dogma]]s may require what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as inherent "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming the invalidity of the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural [[Concretization|reification]] of religious practise.

It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|economic foundations of society]]. Contemporary debates have centred on issues such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

The sociology of religion also deals with how religion impacts society regarding the positive and negatives of what happens when religion is mixed with society. Theorist such as Marx states that “religion is the opium of the people” - the idea that religion has become a way for people to deal with their problems. At least one comprehensive study refutes this idea. Research has found that secular democracies like [[France]] or [[Scandinavia]] outperform more theistic democracies on various measures of societal health. The authors explains, "Pressing questions include the reasons, whether theistic or non-theistic, that the exceptionally wealthy U.S. is so inefficient that it is experiencing a much higher degree of societal distress than are less religious, less wealthy prosperous democracies. Conversely, how do the latter achieve superior societal health while having little in the way of the religious values or institutions?"&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Paul, "Cross-national correlations of quantifiable societal health with popular religiosity and secularism in the prosperous democracies," ''Journal of Religion &amp; Society'' (2005) 1#1 pp 1-17 [http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123104528/http://globalhealth.washington.edu/docs/Bezruchka%202.pdf |date=2014-01-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law and religion ===
{{main|Law and religion}}
Vogel reports that in the 1970s a new "law and religion" approach has progressively built its own contribution to religious studies.  Over a dozen scholarly organizations and committees were formed by 1983, and a scholarly quarterly, the ''Journal of Law and Religion'' first published that year and the ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' opened in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vogel | first1 = Howard J. | year = 1983 | title = A Survey and Commentary on the New Literature in Law and Religion | journal = Journal of Law and Religion | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 79–169 | jstor=1051074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many departments and centers have been created around the world during the last decades. As of 2012, major Law and Religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, "The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report," ''Ecclesiastical Law Journal'' (2012) 14#3 pp: 327-354.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, '' Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Cole Durham, and Brett G. Scharffs, eds. ''Law and religion: national, international, and comparative perspectives'' (Aspen Pub, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr. and Frank S. Alexander, eds., ''Christianity and Law: An Introduction'' (Cambridge U.P. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Common topics on interest include marriage and the family,&lt;ref&gt;John Witte Jr, ''From Sacrament to Contract: Marriage, Religion, and Law in the Western Tradition'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;John Witte, Jr., ''The Reformation of Rights: Law, Religion and Human Rights in Early Modern Calvinism'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion interrelations in law and religion in the Muslim Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elizabeth Mayer | first1 = Ann | year = 1987 | title = Law and Religion in the Muslim Middle East | journal = American Journal of Comparative Law | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 127–184 | jstor=840165}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pagan Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watson, ''The state, law, and religion: pagan Rome'' (University of Georgia Press, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and film===
The earliest serious writing on the interface between religion and film appeared in the work of film critics like [[Jean Epstein]] in the 1920s.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=16}}
The subject has grown in popularity with students and is cited as having particular relevance given the pervasiveness of film in modern culture.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=13}} Approaches to the study of religion and film differ among scholars; functionalist approaches for instance view film as a site in which religion is manifested, while theological approaches examine film as a reflection of God's presence in all things.{{sfn|Wright|2007|p=14}}

==Methodologies==
A number of methodologies are used in Religious Studies.  Methodologies are [[hermeneutic]]s, or interpretive models, that provide a structure for the analysis of religious phenomena.

===Phenomenology===
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}
[[phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology ]] is "arguably the most influential approach to the study of religion in the twentieth century." (Partridge)  The term is first found in the title of the work of the influential philosopher of [[German Idealism]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], entitled [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]].  Phenomenology had been practiced long before its being made explicit as a philosophical method by [[Edmund Husserl]], who is considered to be its founder.  In the context of [[Phenomenology of religion]] however, the term was first used by [[Pierre Daniel Chantepie de la Saussaye]] in his work "Lehrbuch der Religiongeschichte" (1887). Chantepie's phenomenology catalogued observable characteristics of religion much like a zoologist would categorize animals or an entomologist would categorize insects.

In part due to [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl's]] influence, "phenomenology" came to "refer to a method which is more complex and claims rather more for itself than did Chantepie’s mere cataloguing of facts." (Partridge)  Husserl argued that the foundation of knowledge is [[consciousness]].  He recognized "how easy it is for prior beliefs and interpretations to unconsciously influence one’s thinking, Husserl’s phenomenological method sought to shelve all these presuppositions and interpretations." (Partridge)  Husserl introduced the term "eidetic vision" to describe the ability to observe without "prior beliefs and interpretations" influencing understanding and perception.

His other main conceptual contribution is the idea of the [[epoche]]: setting aside metaphysical questions and observing phenomena in and of themselves, without any bias or commitments on the part of the investigator.  The epoche, also known as phenomenological reduction or bracketing, involves approaching a phenomenon or phenomena from a neutral standpoint, instead of with our own particular attitudes.  In performing this reduction, whatever phenomenon or phenomena we approach are understood in themselves, rather than from our own perspectives.  In the field of religious studies, a contemporary advocate of the phenomenological method is Ninian Smart. He suggests that we should perform the epoche as a means to engage in cross-cultural studies.  In doing so, we can take the beliefs, symbols, rituals etc. of the other from within their own perspective, rather than imposing ours on them.  Another earlier scholar who employs the phenomenological method for studying religion is [[Gerardus van der Leeuw]].  In his ''Religion in Essence and Manifestation'' (1933), he outlines what a phenomenology of religion should look like:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Firstly, argues van der Leeuw, the student of religion needs to classify the religious phenomena into distinct categories: e.g. sacrifice, sacrament, sacred space, sacred time, sacred word, festivals, and myth.
* Secondly, scholars then need to interpolate the phenomena into their own lives. That is to say, they need to empathetically (Einfühlung) try and understand the religion from within....The life examined by the religious studies scholar, insists van der Leeuw, needs to "acquire its place in the life of the student himself who should understand it out of his inner self."
* Thirdly, van der Leeuw stresses perhaps the fundamental phenomenological principle, namely epoch, the suspension of value-judgements and the adoption of a neutral stance.
* Fourthly, scholars needs to clarify any apparent structural relationships and make sense of the information. In so doing, they move towards a holistic understanding of how the various aspects of a religion relate and function together.
* Fifthly, this leads naturally to a stage at which "all these activities, undertaken together and simultaneously, constitute genuine understanding [Verstehen]: the chaotic and obstinate 'reality' thus becomes a manifestation, a revelation" (eidetic vision).
* Sixthly, having thus attained this general grasp, there is a continual need to make sure that it tallies with the up-to-date research of other disciplines, such as archaeology, history, philology etc. For van der Leeuw, as for other phenomenologists, the continual checking of one’s results is crucial to the maintenance of scholarly objectivity. In order to avoid degeneration into fantasy, phenomenology must always feed on facts.
* Finally, having gone through the above six stages, the phenomenologist should be as close as anyone can be to an understanding of the 'meaning' of the religious phenomena studied and be in a position to relate his understanding to others.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The subjectivity inherent to the phenomenological study of religion makes complete and comprehensive understanding highly difficult. However, phenomenologists aim to separate their formal study of religion from their own theological worldview and to eliminate, as far as possible, any personal biases (e.g., a Christian phenomenologist would avoid studying Hinduism through the lens of Christianity).

There are a number of both theoretical and methodological attitudes common among phenomenologists:[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817094359/http://www.phenomenologycenter.org/phenom.htm source]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose the acceptance of unobservable matters and grand systems erected in speculative thinking;
* Phenomenologists tend to oppose naturalism (also called objectivism and positivism), which is the worldview growing from modern natural science and technology that has been spreading from Northern Europe since the Renaissance;
* Positively speaking, phenomenologists tend to justify cognition (and some also evaluation and action) with reference to what Edmund Husserl called Evidenz, which is awareness of a matter itself as disclosed in the most clear, distinct, and adequate way for something of its kind;
* Phenomenologists tend to believe that not only objects in the natural and cultural worlds, but also ideal objects, such as numbers, and even conscious life itself can be made evident and thus known;
* Phenomenologists tend to hold that inquiry ought to focus upon what might be called "encountering" as it is directed at objects and, correlatively, upon "objects as they are encountered" (this terminology is not widely shared, but the emphasis on a dual problematics and the reflective approach it requires is);
* Phenomenologists tend to recognize the role of description in universal, a priori, or "eidetic" terms as prior to explanation by means of causes, purposes, or grounds; and
* Phenomenologists tend to debate whether or not what Husserl calls the transcendental phenomenological epochê and reduction is useful or even possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scholars of religious studies argued that phenomenology was "the distinctive method of the discipline".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}
In 2006, the phenomenologist of religion [[Thomas Ryba]] noted that this approach to the study of religion had "entered a period of dormancy".{{sfn|Ryba|2006|p=119}}
Phenomenological approaches were largely taxonomical, with [[Robert A. Segal]] stating that it amounted to "no more than data gathering" alongside "the classification of the data gathered".{{sfn|Segal|2006|p=xiii}}

===Functionalism===
[[Structural functionalism|Functionalism]], in regard to religious studies, is the analysis of religions and their various communities of adherents using the functions of particular religious phenomena to interpret the structure of religious communities and their beliefs. The approach was introduced by British anthropologist [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Connolly|title=Approaches to the Study of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0PUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism of functionalism is that it lends itself to [[teleology|teleological]] explanations.  An example of a functionalist approach is understanding the dietary restrictions contained in the [[Pentateuch]] as having the function of promoting health or providing social identity (''i.e.'' a sense of belonging though common practice).

===Lived religion===
[[Lived religion]] is the ethnographic and holistic framework for understanding the beliefs, practices, and everyday experiences of religious and spiritual persons in religious studies. The name lived religion comes from the French tradition of sociology of religion "la religion vécue".&lt;ref&gt;David Hall, "Lived Religion In America: Toward A History Of Practice", Princeton University Press (1997), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of lived religion was popularized in the late 20th century by religious study scholars like [[Robert A. Orsi]] and [[David D. Hall|David Hall]]. The study of lived religion has come to include a wide range of subject areas as a means of exploring and emphasizing what a religious person does and what they believe. Today, the field of lived religion is expanding to include many topics and scholars.

==Religious studies and theology==
Western philosophy of religion, as the basic ancestor of modern religious studies, is differentiated from theology and the many Eastern philosophical traditions by generally being written from a third party perspective. The scholar need not be a believer. Theology stands in contrast to the philosophy of religion and religious studies in that, generally, the scholar is first and foremost a believer employing both logic ''and'' scripture as evidence.  Theology according to this understanding fits with the definition which [[Anselm of Canterbury]] gave to it in the 11th century, [[credo ut intelligam]], or faith seeking understanding (literally, "I believe so that I may understand").  The theologian then has the task of making intelligible, or clarifying, the religious commitments to which he or she subscribes.  The scholar of religious studies has no such allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M. Riddle|title=A History of the Middle Ages, 300-1500|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rhWpPr93KjMC&amp;pg=PA291|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
A group of scholars have criticized religious studies beginning in the 1990s as a theological project which actually imposes views onto the people it aims to survey. Prominent voices in this critical view include [[Jonathan Z. Smith]], Timothy Fitzgerald, [[Talal Asad]], [[Tomoko Masuzawa]], Geoffrey A. Oddie, [[Richard E. King]], [[Russell T. McCutcheon]], and Daniel Dubuisson. Their areas of research overlap heavily with [[postcolonial studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Dubuisson. "Exporting the Local: Recent Perspectives on 'Religion' as a Cultural Category." ''Religion Compass'' 1.6 (2007), pp. 787-800.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly journals==
Much of the latest scholarship appears in the scholarly journals, which also typically review and evaluate new monographs. There are a large numbers of peer-reviewed scholarly journals in the discipline of Religious Studies. Many journals focus on historical or sociological topics or concentrate on particular religious traditions, such as Judaism or Islam. Religious studies journals have been laggard in gaining accessibility through the Internet, but libraries specializing in religious history have started to catch up.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Eidson, "Electronic journals in religious studies: Theological libraries prepare for the digital future." ''Journal of Religious &amp; Theological Information'' 3.3-4 (2001): 45-67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kate L. Ganski, "Accessibility of E-resources from Theological Library Websites."

Education is carried out in Azerbaijani.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://azertag.az/xeber/Azerbaycan_Ilahiyyat_Institutunun_achilisi_olub-1195028|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun açılışı olub|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Institute was developed under the auspices of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan. A decree of the [[President of Azerbaijan|President of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated 9 February 2018 authorized its creation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/27001|title=Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun yaradılması haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree ensured inclusion of the faculty of Theology of the [[Baku State University]] in the Institute of Theology.

The opening ceremony took place on September 17, 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Logo ==
The Institute announced a contest on 26 July 2018 to organize its logo. For this purpose, a commission was created, consisting of:

* Yagut Aliyeva, the Director of the Public Relations Department of the State Committee for Religious Organizations
* Eldar Mikayilzade, the People's Artist of Azerbaijan
* Zaur Orujov, the scientific worker of the [[Institute of Manuscripts of Azerbaijan]]
* Kevser Tagiyev, the teacher of the Azerbaijan Institute of Theology

106 different logos were presented. On 8 August the submission of Konul Mammadzadeh was chosen. According to the unanimous opinion of the commission, the logo reflected the purpose and mission of the Institute. Specifically, the human symbol whose hands are turned toward the sky reflects how multiculturalism and tolerance communicate with God, the book represents the main source of knowledge, and the olive branch expresses peace and spirituality.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://report.az/din/i-lahiyyat-i-nstitutunun-loqosu-mueyyenlesib/|title=İlahiyyat İnstitutunun loqosu müəyyənləşib|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the institute is to ensure the preservation and development of the religious and spiritual environment, based on the historical traditions of the Azerbaijani people. Philosophy, sociology, psychology, multiculturalism, informatics and other social and humanitarian sciences are to be taught along with religious sciences. 35 places for Islamic studies and 25 places for Religious studies were approved for the academic year 2018-2019.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations of the Republic of Azerbaijan has allocated a scholarship named after [[Heydar Aliyev]] for one student. The Caucasian Muslim Office allocated a monthly scholarship to one student.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Administration ==
Jeyhun Mammadov was appointed as the rector of the institute on May 31, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/28878|title=C.V.Məmmədovun Azərbaycan İlahiyyat İnstitutunun rektoru təyin edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikası Prezidentinin Sərəncamı|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Prorector]] of the Institute was appointed on 13 September 2018.

{{History of war}}
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|right|The mushroom cloud produced by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of the city of Hiroshima]] during [[World War II]]. The bombing was an act of total war.]]
'''Total war''' is [[war]]fare that includes any and all [[civilian]]-associated resources and infrastructure as [[legitimate military target]]s, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over [[non-combatant]] needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as "war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or [[combatant]]s involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the [[law of war|laws of war]] are disregarded."

In the mid-19th century, scholars identified "total war" as a separate class of warfare. In a total war, to an extent inapplicable in less total conflicts, the differentiation between combatants and non-combatants diminishes and sometimes it even vanishes entirely because opposing sides can consider nearly every human resource, even that of non-combatants, to be a part of the [[war effort]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gunn. "The Moral Dilemma of Atomic Warfare", ''Aegis: The [[Otterbein College]] Humanities Journal'', Spring 2006, [http://www.otterbein.edu/Aegis/Aegis_2006.pdf#page=67 p. 67]. NB Gunn cites this Wikipedia article as  it was on {{diff|Total war|pref|24038262|27 September 2005}}, but on only for the text of the song "The Thing-Ummy Bob".&lt;/ref&gt;

Actions that may characterize the post-19th century concept of total war include:
* [[Strategic bombing]], as during [[Strategic bombing during World War II|World War II]], the [[Korean War#Bombing North Korea|Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]] (Operations [[Operation Rolling Thunder|Rolling Thunder]] and [[Operation Linebacker II|Linebacker II]])
* [[Blockade]] and [[siege|sieging]] of population centers, as with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[blockade of Germany]] and the [[Siege of Leningrad]] during the [[Blockade of Germany|First]] and [[Blockade of Germany (1939–45)|Second]] World Wars
* [[Scorched earth]] policy, as with the [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] during the [[American Civil War]] and the Japanese "[[Three Alls Policy]]" during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]
* [[Commerce raiding]], [[tonnage war]], and [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], as with [[privateer]]ing, the German [[U-boat|U-Boat]] campaigns of the First and Second World Wars, and the United States [[Allied submarines in the Pacific War|submarine campaign against Japan]] during World War II
* [[Collective punishment]], pacification operations, and [[reprisal]]s against populations deemed hostile, as with the execution and deportation of suspected [[Communards]] following the fall of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]] or the German reprisal policy targeting resistance movements, insurgents, and [[Untermensch]]en such as in France (e.g. [[Maillé massacre]]) and [[Pacification actions in German-occupied Poland|Poland]] during World War II
* The use of [[civilian]]s and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] as [[forced labor]] for [[military operation]]s, as with Japan and Germany's massive use of forced laborers of other nations during World War II (see [[Slavery in Japan]] and [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Forced labor under German rule during World War II]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861–1871 (Publications of the German Historical Institute) |page=296 |date=August 22, 2002 |publisher=[[German Historical Institute]] |isbn=0-5215-2-119X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Giving [[no quarter]] (i.e. take no prisoners), as with [[Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] during [[World War II]].

==Etymology==
The phrase can be traced back to the 1935 publication of the World War I memoir of German General [[Erich Ludendorff]], ''Der totale Krieg'' ("The total war").{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}  Some authors extend the concept back as far as classic work of [[Carl von Clausewitz]], ''[[On War]]'', as "absoluter Krieg" ([[absolute war]]); however, different authors interpret the relevant passages in diverging ways.&lt;ref name="StrachanHerberg-Rothe2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hew Strachan|author2=Andreas Herberg-Rothe|title=Clausewitz in the twenty-first century|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923202-4|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total war also describes the French "guerre à outrance" during the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="ChickeringFörster2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Chickering|author2=Stig Förster|title=The shadows of total war: Europe, East Asia, and the United States, 1919–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ne0rFJbWfdIC&amp;pg=PA8|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-81236-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taithe1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bertrand Taithe|title=Defeated flesh: welfare, warfare and the making of modern France|year=1999|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-5621-5|page=35 and 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Förster2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stig Förster|title=On the Road to Total War: The American Civil War and the German Wars of Unification, 1861–1871|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qm4o2vsMTdYC&amp;pg=PA550|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52119-2|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his letter to his [[Chief of Staff]], Union General [[Henry Halleck]] on 24 December 1864 described that the Union was "not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies," defending [[Sherman's March to the Sea]], the operation that inflicted widespread destruction of infrastructure in Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/primarysources/william-t-sherman-to-henry.html|title=William T.

[[United States Air Force]] General [[Curtis LeMay]] updated the concept for the [[nuclear age]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In 1949, he first proposed that a total war in the nuclear age would consist of delivering the entire [[nuclear arsenal]] in a single overwhelming blow, going as far as "killing a nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=DeGroot|first=Gerard J.|title=The bomb: a life|year=2004|publisher=Harvard|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0-674-01724-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VQCsAZpPrgC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=the%20entire%20stockpile%20of%20atomic%20bombs%20in%20a%20single%20massive%20attack&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
During the [[Middle Ages]], [[destruction under the Mongol Empire]] in the 13th century effectively exemplified total war.  The military forces of [[Genghis Khan]] slaughtered whole populations and destroyed any city that resisted:

{{quote|As an aggressor nation, the ancient Mongols, no less than the modern [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]], practiced total war against an enemy by organizing all available resources, including [[military personnel]], [[noncombatant]] [[workers]], [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], [[transport]], [[money]], and [[wikt:provision|provisions]].&lt;ref&gt;Janice J. Terry, James P. Holoka, Jim Holoka, George H. Cassar, Richard D. Goff (2011).

==18th and 19th centuries==

===Intertribal warfare===
Author and historian Mark van de Logt wrote: "Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of 'total war' for conflicts between modern industrial nations, the term nevertheless most closely approaches the state of affairs between the [[Pawnee people|Pawnees]] and the [[Great Sioux Nation|Sioux]] and [[Cheyennes]]. Both sides directed their actions not solely against warrior-combatants but against the people as a whole. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy's territory."&lt;ref&gt;Mark van de Logt (2012).

===French and American Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars===
In The [[American Revolution]], also known as the American Revolutionary War, many basic tactics of Total War were created in a modern form, I.E. Scorched Earth. in 1779, The [[Sullivan Expedition]]  began, marching through Western Pennsylvania and up through New York, burning Iroquois villages to the ground, leaving nothing behind but smoldering ruin and dead bodies. In the [[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War]], The British and American Militia did similar campaigns of Extermination, but to their neighbors. Whole towns where depopulated. The British Cavalry led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] join the militia in the creation of the inferno called "South Carolina".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] introduced to mainland Europe some of the first concepts of total war, such as mass conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=David A|title=The First Total War: Napoleon's Europe and the Birth of Warfare as We Know It|date=12 January 2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0618349650|edition=First|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_First_Total_War.html?id=Pw5jup_LyHAC|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fledgling republic found itself threatened by a powerful coalition of European nations.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The only solution, in the eyes of the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]] government, was to pour the entire nation's resources into an unprecedented war effort—this was the advent of the [[levée en masse]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The following decree of the [[National Convention]] on August 23, 1793 demonstrates the immensity of the French war effort, when the French front line forces grew to some 800,000 with a total of 1.5 million in all services—the first time an army in excess of a million had been mobilized in Western history:

{{quote|From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and [[logistics|transport provisions]]; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old lint into linen; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.}}

The wars merged into the [[Napoleonic Wars]] of the [[First French Empire]] from ca. 1803.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Over the coming two decades of almost constant warfare it is estimated that somewhere in the vicinity of five million died—probably about half of them civilians—and France alone counted nearly a million (by some sources in excess of a million) deaths.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]] of 1812 the Russians resorted to destroying infrastructure and agriculture in their retreat in order to hamper the French and strip them of adequate supplies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the campaign of 1813, Allied forces in the German theater alone amounted to nearly one million whilst two years later in [[the Hundred Days]] a French decree called for the total mobilization of some 2.5 million men (though at most a fifth of this was managed by the time of the French defeat at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} During the prolonged [[Peninsular War]] from 1808–1814 some 300,000 French troops were kept permanently occupied by, in addition to several hundred thousand Spanish, Portuguese and British regulars, an enormous and sustained guerrilla insurgency—ultimately French deaths would amount to 300,000 in the Peninsular War alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

=== American Civil War===
During the [[American Civil War]], [[Union Army]] General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s [[Valley Campaigns of 1864#Sheridan's Valley Campaign (August – October 1864)|stripping of the Shenandoah Valley]], beginning on September 21, 1864 and continuing for two weeks, was considered "total war". {{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Its purpose was to eliminate food and supplies vital to the South's military operations, as well as to strike a blow at Southern civilian morale.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Sheridan took the opportunity when he realized opposing forces had become too weak to resist his army.&lt;ref&gt;Lance Janda,  "Shutting the gates of mercy: The American origins of total war, 1860–1880."

Union Army General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s '[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]' in November and December 1864 destroyed the resources required for [[Confederate States of America|the South]] to make war. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and President [[Abraham Lincoln]] initially opposed the plan until Sherman convinced them of its necessity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=551|title=Sherman's March to the Sea – Ohio History Central|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars taking issue with the notion that Sherman was employing "total war" include Noah Andre Trudeau. Trudeau believes that Sherman's goals and methods do not meet the definition of total war and to suggest as much is to "misread Sherman's intentions and to misunderstand the results of what happened".&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Noah Andre. "Southern Storm." Harper, 2008. p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

===World War I===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2008-0084, Belgien, Flandern, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Damage and destruction of civilian buildings in Belgium, 1914]]
Almost the whole of [[Europe]] and the European colonial empires mobilized to wage [[World War I]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Young men were removed from production jobs to serve in military roles, and were replaced on the production line by women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Rationing occurred on the home fronts.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Bulgaria]] went so far as to mobilize a quarter of its population or 800,000 people, a greater share of its population than any other country during the war.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
One of the features of Total War in Britain was the use of government [[propaganda]] posters to divert all attention to the war on the [[home front]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Posters were used to influence public opinion about what to eat and what occupations to take, and to change the attitude of support towards the war effort.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Even the [[Music Hall]] was used as propaganda, with propaganda songs aimed at recruitment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After the failure of the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], the large British offensive in March 1915, the British Commander-in-Chief [[Field Marshal]] John French blamed the lack of progress on insufficient and poor-quality [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shells]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This led to the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] which brought down both the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Premiership]] of [[H. H. Asquith]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} He formed a new coalition government dominated by Liberals and appointed [[David Lloyd George]] as [[Minister of Munitions]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} It was a recognition that the whole economy would have to be geared for war if the Allies were to prevail on the Western Front.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As young men left the farms for the front, domestic food production in Britain and Germany fell.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In Britain the response was to import more food, which was done despite the German introduction of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], and to introduce rationing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The Royal Navy's [[Blockade of Germany|blockade of German ports]] prevented Germany from importing food and hastened German capitulation by creating a food crisis in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

===World War II===
The [[Second World War]] was the quintessential total war of modernity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The level of national mobilization of resources on all sides of the conflict, the [[battlespace]] being contested, the scale of the [[armies]], [[navies]], and [[air forces]] raised through [[conscription]], the active targeting of non-combatants (and non-combatant property), the general disregard for [[collateral damage]], and the unrestricted aims of the belligerents marked total war on an unprecedented and unsurpassed, multicontinental scale.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Shōwa Japan====
During the first part of the [[Shōwa era]], the government of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] launched a string of policies to promote a total war effort [[Second Sino-Japanese War|against China]] and [[Pacific war|occidental powers]] and increase industrial production. Among these were the [[National Spiritual Mobilization Movement]] and the [[Taisei Yokusankai|Imperial Rule Assistance Association]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The [[National Mobilization Law]] had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including [[labor union]]s), [[nationalization]] of strategic industries, price controls and [[rationing]], and nationalized the [[news media]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauer, Japan's War Economy, 1999 pp. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production, and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

To improve its production, Shōwa Japan used millions of [[slave labour]]ers&lt;ref&gt;Unidas, Naciones. ''World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slavery in Japan|pressed more than 18 million people]] in [[East Asia]] into forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;Zhifen Ju, "''Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war''", 2002, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+id0029) Library of Congress, 1992, "Indonesia: World War II and the Struggle For Independence, 1942–50; The Japanese Occupation, 1942–45"] Access date: February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Before the onset of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] drew on its [[World War I|First World War]] experience to prepare legislation that would allow immediate mobilization of the economy for war, should future hostilities break out.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Rationing of most goods and services was introduced, not only for consumers but also for manufacturers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This meant that factories manufacturing products that were irrelevant to the war effort had more appropriate tasks imposed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} All artificial light was subject to legal [[Blackout (wartime)|blackout]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Not only were men conscripted into the armed forces from the beginning of the war (something which had not happened until the middle of World War I), but women were also conscripted as [[Land Girls]] to aid farmers and the [[Bevin Boys]] were conscripted to work down the coal mines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Enormous casualties were expected in bombing raids, so [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during the Second World War|children were evacuated from London and other cities en masse to the countryside]] for compulsory [[billet]]ing in households. In the long term this was one of the most profound and longer-lasting social consequences of the whole war for Britain.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is because it mixed up children with the adults of other classes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Not only did the middle and upper classes become familiar with the urban squalor suffered by working class children from the [[slum]]s, but the children got a chance to see animals and the countryside, often for the first time, and experience rural life.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

The use of statistical analysis, by a branch of science which has become known as [[Operational Research]] to influence military tactics was a departure from anything previously attempted.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} It was a very powerful tool but it further dehumanised war particularly when it suggested strategies which were counter intuitive.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Examples where statistical analysis directly influenced tactics include the work done by [[Patrick Blackett]]'s team on the optimum size and speed of convoys and the introduction of [[bomber stream]]s by the [[Royal Air Force]] to counter the night fighter defences of the [[Kammhuber Line]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Germany====
In contrast, [[Germany]] started the war under the concept of [[Blitzkrieg]]. Officially, it did not accept that it was in a total war until [[Joseph Goebbels]]' [[Sportpalast speech]] of 18 February 1943.

The commitment to the doctrine of the short war was a continuing handicap for the Germans; neither plans nor state of mind were adjusted to the idea of a long war until the failure of the [[Operation Barbarossa]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} A major strategical defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]] forced [[Albert Speer]], who was appointed as Germany's armament minister in early 1942, to nationalize German war production and eliminate the worst inefficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Milward. The End of the Blitzkrieg. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 16, No. 3 (1964), pp. 499–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Speer's direction a threefold increase in armament production occurred and did not reach its peak until late 1944.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} To do this during the damage caused by the growing strategic Allied bomber offensive, is an indication of the degree of industrial under-mobilization in the earlier years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} It was because the German economy through most of the war was substantially under-mobilized that it was resilient under air attack.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Civilian consumption was high during the early years of the war and inventories both in industry and in consumers' possession were high.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} These helped cushion the economy from the effects of bombing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Plant and machinery were plentiful and incompletely used, thus it was comparatively easy to substitute unused or partly used machinery for that which was destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Foreign labour, both slave labour and labour from neighbouring countries who joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Germany, was used to augment German industrial labour which was under pressure by conscription into the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (Armed Forces).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Soviet Union====
[[File:RIAN archive 216 The Volkovo cemetery.jpg|thumb|Three men burying victims of [[siege of Leningrad|Leningrad's siege]], in which about 1 million civilians died.]]
The Soviet Union (USSR) was a [[planned economy|command economy]] which already had an economic and legal system allowing the economy and society to be redirected into fighting a total war.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The transportation of factories and whole labour forces east of the [[Urals]] as the Germans advanced across the USSR in 1941 was an impressive feat of planning.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Only those factories which were useful for war production were moved because of the total war commitment of the Soviet government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The Eastern Front of the [[European Theatre of World War II]] encompassed the conflict in [[central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] from June 22, 1941 to May 9, 1945. It was the largest theatre of war in history in terms of numbers of soldiers, equipment and [[World War II casualties|casualties]] and was notorious for its unprecedented ferocity, destruction, and immense loss of life (see [[World War II casualties]]). The fighting involved millions of [[Nazi army|German]], Hungarian, Romanian and [[Red army|Soviet]] troops along a broad front hundreds of kilometres long. It was by far the deadliest single theatre of [[World War II]]. Scholars now believe that at most 27 million Soviet citizens died during the war, including at least 8.7 million soldiers who fell in battle against [[Hitler]]'s armies or died in [[POW]] camps. Millions of civilians died from [[starvation]], exposure, atrocities, and massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm |work= BBC.co.uk |title= Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead |accessdate= 5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Axis lost over 5 million soldiers in the east as well as many thousands of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;German losses according to: Rüdiger Overmans, ''Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg''. Oldenbourg 2000. {{ISBN|3-486-56531-1}}, p. 265, 272&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], newly built [[T-34 tank]]s were driven—unpainted because of a paint shortage—from the factory floor straight to the front. &lt;!-- World at War series not sure which programme number--&gt;This came to symbolise the USSR's commitment to the [[Great Patriotic War]] and demonstrated the government's total war policy.

====United States====
The United States underwent an unprecedented mobilization of national resources for the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Conditions in the United States were not as strained as they were in the United Kingdom or as desperate as they were in the Soviet Union, but the United States greatly curtailed nearly all non-essential activities in its prosecution of the Second World War and redirected nearly all available national resources to the conflict, including reaching the point of diminishing returns by late 1944, where the U.S. military was unable to find any more males of the correct military age to draft into service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The strategists of the U.S. military looked abroad at the storms brewing on the horizon in Europe and Asia, and began quietly making contingency plans as early as the mid-1930s; new weapons and weapons platforms were designed, and made ready. Following the outbreak of war in Europe and the ongoing aggression in Asia, efforts were stepped up significantly.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The collapse of France and the airborne aggression directed at Great Britain unsettled the Americans, who had close relations with both nations, and a peacetime draft was instituted, along with [[Lend-Lease]] programs to aid the British, and covert aid was passed to the Chinese as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

American [[public opinion]] was still opposed to involvement in the problems of Europe and Asia, however.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In 1941, the Soviet Union became the latest nation to be invaded, and the U.S. gave her aid as well.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} American ships began defending aid convoys to the Allied nations against submarine attacks, and a total trade embargo against the [[Empire of Japan]] was instituted to deny its military the raw materials its factories and military forces required to continue its offensive actions in China.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In late 1941, Japan's [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]]-dominated government decided to seize by military force the strategic resources of South-East Asia and Indonesia since the Western powers would not give Japan these goods by trade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Planning for this action included [[surprise attack]]s on American and British forces in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaya, and the U.S. naval base and warships at [[Pearl Harbor]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} In response to these attacks, the U.K. and U.S. declared war on the [[Empire of Japan]] the next day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Nazi Germany]] declared war on the U.S. a few days later, along with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]]; the U.S. found itself fully involved in a second world war.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

As the United States began to gear up for a major war, information and propaganda efforts were set in motion.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Civilians (including children) were encouraged to take part in fat, grease, and scrap metal collection drives. Many factories making non-essential goods retooled for war production.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Levels of industrial productivity previously unheard of were attained during the war; multi-thousand-ton convoy ships were routinely built in a month-and-a-half, and tanks poured out of the former automobile factories.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Within a few years of the U.S. entry into the Second World War, nearly every man fit for service, between 18 and 30, had been conscripted into the military "for the duration" of the conflict, and unprecedented numbers of women took up jobs previously held by them. Strict systems of rationing of consumer staples were introduced to redirect productive capacity to war needs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Previously untouched sections of the nation mobilized for the war effort.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Academics became technocrats; home-makers became bomb-makers (massive numbers of women worked in heavy industry during the war); union leaders and businessmen became commanders in the massive armies of production.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} The great scientific communities of the United States were mobilized as never before, and mathematicians, doctors, engineers, and chemists turned their minds to the problems ahead of them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

By the war's end a multitude of advances had been made in medicine, physics, engineering, and the other sciences.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Even the [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]], whose theories were not believed to have military applications (at the time), were sent far into the Western deserts to work at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] on the [[Manhattan Project]] that culminated in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] and changed the course of history.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In the war, the United States lost 407,316 military personnel, but had managed to avoid the extensive level of damage to civilian and industrial infrastructure that other participants suffered. The U.S. emerged as one of the two [[superpower]]s after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The world since 1945: a history of international relations|last=McWilliams|first=Wayne|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States entered World War II, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] declared at [[Casablanca conference]] to the other Allies and the press that [[unconditional surrender]] was the objective of the war against the Axis Powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan.&lt;ref name="SOSCasablanca"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Casablanca Conference, 1943|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/casablanca|website=Office of the Historian|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this declaration, the individual regimes of the Axis Powers could have negotiated an [[armistice]] similar to that at the end of World War I and then a conditional surrender when they perceived that the war was lost.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The unconditional surrender of the major Axis powers caused a legal problem at the post-war [[Nuremberg Trials]], because the trials appeared to be in conflict with Articles 63 and 64 of the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Usually if such trials are held, they would be held under the auspices of the defeated power's own legal system as happened with some of the minor Axis powers, for example in the post World War II [[Romanian People's Tribunals]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} To circumvent this, the Allies argued that the major war criminals were captured after the end of the war, so they were not prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions did not cover them.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Further, the collapse of the Axis regimes created a legal condition of total defeat (''[[debellatio]]'') so the provisions of the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] over [[military occupation]] were not applicable.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Wedgwood {{cite web |url=http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |title=Judicial Overreach |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308191908/http://www.sais-jhu.edu/pubaffairs/SAISarticles04/Wedgwood_WSJ_111604.pdf |archivedate=March 8, 2008 |df= }} [[Wall Street Journal]] November 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
{{See also|War by proxy|Coercive diplomacy|Deterrence theory}}
Since the end of World War II, no industrial nation has fought such a large, decisive war.&lt;ref name="GWUniversityWWII"&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II (1939-1945)|url=https://www2.gwu.edu/~erpapers/teachinger/glossary/world-war-2.cfm|website=The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project|publisher=George Washington University|accessdate=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely due to the availability of nuclear weapons, whose destructive power and quick deployment render a full mobilization of a country's resources such as in World War II unnecessary.{{sfn|Baylis|Wirtz|Gray|2012|p=55}} Such weapons are developed and maintained with relatively modest peacetime defense budgets.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

By the end of the 1950s, the [[ideology|ideological]] stand-off of the [[Cold War]] between the [[Western World]] and the [[Soviet Union]] had resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons being aimed by each side at the other.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Strategically, the equal balance of destructive power possessed by each side situation came to be known as [[Mutually assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] (MAD), considering that a nuclear attack by one superpower would result in nuclear counter-strike by the other.&lt;ref name="BBCMAD"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castella|first1=Tom de|title=How did we forget about mutually assured destruction?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17026538|accessdate=19 January 2017|work=BBC News|date=15 February 2012|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would result in hundreds of millions of deaths in a world where, in words widely attributed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]], "The living will envy the dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/73/1257.html|title=1257.

During the Cold War, the two [[superpower]]s sought to avoid open conflict between their respective forces, as both sides recognized that such a clash could very easily escalate, and quickly involve nuclear weapons.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Instead, the superpowers fought each other through their involvement in proxy wars, military buildups, and diplomatic standoffs.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[NATO]] conducted strikes against the electrical grid in enemy territory using [[graphite bomb]]s. Some observers{{who|date=July 2018}} considered this to be an act of total war, owing to the fact that powerplants supported by the electrical grid were essential to water purification and thus the strike represented a direct attack on civilian resources. NATO claimed that the objective of their strikes was to disrupt military infrastructure and communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Michael|title=CRISIS IN THE BALKANS: THE OVERVIEW; NATO AIR ATTACKS ON POWER PLANTS PASS A THRESHOLD|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/04/world/crisis-balkans-overview-nato-air-attacks-power-plants-pass-threshold.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals''' are seven controversial military training manuals which were declassified by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1996. In 1997, two additional CIA manuals were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request filed by ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. The manuals in question have been referred to by various media sources as the "torture manuals".&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Arthur | last =Jones |author2=Dorothy Vidulich | date =October 4, 1996 | title =Pentagon admits use of torture manuals: training books used for Latin Americans at Ft.

==Army manuals==
These manuals were prepared by the U.S. military and used between 1987 and 1991 for intelligence training courses at the U.S. Army [[School of the Americas]] (SOA). Some of the material was similar to the older CIA manuals described below.  The manuals were also distributed by Special Forces Mobile Training Teams to military personnel and intelligence schools in [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref name="bouvier"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Globalization of U.S.-Latin American Relations: Democracy, Intervention, and Human Rights| author = Virginia Marie Bouvier | year = 2002 | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group | page = 132 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xFtVfpcFYuMC&amp;pg=PA132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "abu"&gt;{{cite journal | first =James | last =Hodge | authorlink = |author2=Linda  Cooper | date =November 5, 2004 | title =Roots of Abu Ghraib in CIA techniques | journal =[[National Catholic Reporter]] | url =http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113141641/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2004d/110504/110504a.php | archivedate = 2008-01-13 }} &lt;sup&gt;See https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-124862830/roots-of-abu-ghraib-in-cia-techniques-50-years-of Also google the whale.to site.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Gill | first =Lesley | authorlink = | year =2004 | title =The School of the Americas: Military Training and Political Violence in the Americas | publisher =Duke University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sJmPU-9zEPwC&amp;pg=PA49 | isbn =0-8223-3392-9}} p. 49 &lt;br&gt;*{{cite journal | first =Dana | last =Priest| date =September 21, 1996 | title =U.S. Instructed Latins On Executions, Torture; Manuals Used 1982-91, Pentagon Reveals | journal =[[The Washington Post]] | pages =Section: A Pg.

The Pentagon press release accompanying the release stated that a 1991-92 investigation into the manuals concluded that "two dozen short passages in six of the manuals, which total 1169 pages, contained material that either was not or could be interpreted not to be consistent with U.S. policy."

The Latin America Working Group criticized this: "The unstated aim of the manuals is to train Latin American militaries to identify and suppress anti-government movements. Throughout the eleven hundred pages of the manuals, there are few mentions of democracy, human rights, or the rule of law. Instead, the manuals provide detailed techniques for infiltrating social movements, interrogating suspects, surveillance, maintaining military secrecy, recruiting and retaining spies, and controlling the population. While the excerpts released by the Pentagon are a useful and not misleading selection of the most egregious passages, the ones most clearly advocating torture, execution and blackmail, they do not provide adequate insight into the manuals' highly objectionable framework. In the name of defending democracy, the manuals advocate profoundly undemocratic methods."

After this 1992 investigation, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] discontinued the use of the manuals, directed their recovery to the extent practicable, and destroyed the copies in the field. U.S. Southern Command advised governments in Latin America that the manuals contained passages that did not represent U.S. government policy, and pursued recovery of the manuals from the governments and some individual students.&lt;ref name = "fact"&gt;{{cite journal

Soon after, the U.S. Army issued the [[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]] manual, which was used until September 2006, when it was superseded by [[FM 2-22.3, Human Intelligence Collector Operations]].

The first manual, "KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual. KUBARK was a U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] [[cryptonym]] for the CIA itself.&lt;ref name="NSA" /&gt; The [[cryptonym]] KUBARK appears in the title of a 1963 CIA document ''KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation'' which describes [[interrogation]] techniques, including, among other things, "coercive counterintelligence interrogation of resistant sources". &lt;!--cryptonym sentence not sourced--&gt;This is the oldest manual, and describes the use of abusive techniques, as exemplified by two references to the use of electric shock, in addition to use of threats and fear, sensory deprivation, and isolation.&lt;ref name = "NSA"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second manual, "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983", was used in at least seven U.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including Honduras, between 1982 and 1987. According to a [[Classified information|declassified]] 1989 report prepared for the Senate intelligence committee, the 1983 manual was developed from notes of a CIA interrogation course in Honduras.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

Both manuals deal exclusively with interrogation.&lt;ref name = "inter"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2006-09-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both manuals have an entire chapter devoted to "coercive techniques". These manuals recommend arresting suspects early in the morning by surprise, blindfolding them, and stripping them naked. Suspects should be held incommunicado and should be deprived of any kind of normal routine in eating and sleeping. Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets.

The manuals advise that torture techniques can backfire and that the threat of pain is often more effective than pain itself. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used "to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist." These techniques include prolonged constraint, prolonged exertion, extremes of heat, cold, or moisture, deprivation of food or sleep, disrupting routines, solitary confinement, threats of pain, deprivation of sensory stimuli, hypnosis, and use of drugs or placebos.&lt;ref name = "para"&gt;{{cite web

Between 1984 and 1985, after congressional committees began questioning training techniques being used by the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision. In 1985 a page advising against using coercive techniques was inserted at the front of ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual''.  Handwritten changes were also introduced haphazardly into the text. For example, "While we do not stress the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them and the proper way to use them", has been altered to, "While we deplore the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them so that you may avoid them." (p. A-2) But the entire chapter on coercive techniques is still provided with some items crossed out.&lt;ref name = "balt" /&gt;

The same manual states the importance of knowing local laws regarding detention but then notes, "Illegal detention always requires prior HQS [headquarters] approval." (p. B-2)

The two manuals were completely declassified and released to the public in May 2004, and are now available online.&lt;ref name = "NSA" /&gt;

===The 1983 manual and Battalion 3-16===
In 1983, the Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983 methods were used by the U.S.-trained Honduran [[Battalion 3-16 (Honduras)|Battalion 3-16]].&lt;ref name="abu"/&gt;

On January 24, 1997, ''KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation'' and ''Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983'' were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] request filed by the [[Baltimore Sun]] in 1994. The Baltimore Sun was investigating "kidnapping, torture and murder" committed by the Honduran Battalion 3-16 death squad. The documents were released only after the Baltimore Sun had threatened to sue the CIA.&lt;ref name = "balt"&gt;{{cite journal

}}p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

In the June 11 to 18, 1995 four-part series, ''The Baltimore Sun'' printed excerpts of an interview with Florencio Caballero, a former member of Battalion 3-16. Caballero said CIA instructors taught him to discover what his prisoners loved and what they hated, "If a person did not like cockroaches, then that person might be more cooperative if there were cockroaches running around the room"&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt; The methods taught in the 1983 manual and those used by Battalion 3-16 in the early 1980s show unmistakable similarities. In 1983, Caballero attended a CIA "human resources exploitation or interrogation course," according to declassified testimony by [[Richard Stolz]], who was the deputy director for operations at the time, before the June 1988 [[Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]. The manual advises an interrogator to "manipulate the subject's environment, to create unpleasant or intolerable situations."{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The manual gives the suggestion that prisoners be [[deprived of sleep]] and food, and made to maintain rigid positions, such as standing at attention for long periods. Ines Consuelo Murillo, who spent 78 days in Battalion 3-16's secret jails in 1983, said she was given no food or water for days, and one of her captors entered her room every 10 minutes and poured water over her head to keep her from sleeping.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

The "Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual -- 1983" gives the suggestion that interrogators show the prisoner letters from home to give the prisoner the impression that the prisoner's relatives are in danger or suffering.&lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

''The Baltimore Sun'' reported that former Battalion 3-16 member Jose Barrera said he was taught interrogation methods by U.S. instructors in 1983: "The first thing we would say is that we know your mother, your younger brother. And better you cooperate, because if you don't, we're going to bring them in and rape them and torture them and kill them." &lt;ref name = "balt"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4369">'''Universal Accounting Center (UA)''' is a [[Privately owned enterprise|privately owned]] training organization located in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  Founded in 1979, they offer self-paced [[Home study course|home-study courses]] in [[accounting]], [[bookkeeping]], [[tax preparation]], [[QuickBooks]] and [[marketing]] that specializes in [[small business]].

==History==
Universal Accounting was established in 1979.  The training center was founded as Universal Training Systems by Alf Bostrom with the purpose to teach students full-charge bookkeeping and accounting.  It first functioned under the parent company Metropolitan Business Bureau (MBB) which Alf began as a [[Financial consultant|financial consulting]] firm in 1960.  Through his experience with MBB, Alf established the [[business model]] upon which Universal Accounting would be built. Until quite recently, Universal Accounting was run by Alf’s son, [[Allen Bostrom]].

Universal Training Systems initially followed a [[classroom]]-based learning model, and the first Universal classroom was opened in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Shortly thereafter, several school locations in [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] were opened and franchised.

In 1992, Alf’s sons, Allen and Ken Bostrom, joined his staff, and in 1994, Alf retired, and Allen Bostrom became president and [[CEO]] of the newly named Universal Accounting Center. The school has evolved from offering local live courses to developing and selling home-based study materials for bookkeeping, accounting, tax preparation, QuickBooks and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgrade.slco.org/upAndComing/UaC008.html] Upgrade.com "Teaching Basics Propels Company to Inc. 500 List."&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1st, 2014, Roger Knecht became UAC's new president and CEO; Allen Bostrom remains as the chair of Universal's Board of Directors.

==Accreditation==
Universal Accounting has been approved by the California Tax Education Council (CTEC) to offer the Professional Tax Preparer Certification (PTP) as a [[distance learning]] course in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enewschannels.com/2006/11/09/enc381_012629.php] Berg, Tabitha (2006-11-09).“Universal Accounting Center Tax Education Approved by California.” eNewsChannels.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Continuing professional development|Continuing Professional Education]] (CPE) credits are awarded for each of Universal’s training programs.

'''Urban iconography''' is a branch of [[iconography]], a term used both extensively, to mean a collection of illustrations of a specific subject and, within [[art history]], the study of the subject matter of figurative representations. [[Iconology]] is more specifically concerned with the interpretation of the same subject matter. According to [[Erwin Panofsky]] iconography aims to identify the primary and  secondary subject matter, and therefore  “in doing so, iconography is an invaluable help for the establishment of dates, provenance and, occasionally, authenticity; and it furnishes  the necessary basis for all further interpretation”.
Urban iconography is focused on the city, a complex and dynamic artifact,whose forms are a transparent medium of social ideas, individual and collective needs,like dwelling or gathering for religious, economic or political purposes, needs to which different societies gave different answers.
To interpret town images correctly, it  is necessary to understand the urban mechanisms of evolution, as well as urban culture. On the other hand, the image itself is part of the wider history of figurative handcrafts, and therefore. deciphering its representative code is essential to guarantee a proper interpretation and a proper use.

==Urban iconography as a methodology for research==
The study of urban iconography developed in the last thirty years indifferent contexts, but mainly inside studies in urban history, among which it appeared as one of the most innovative approaches. After the exploration and the surveys of the iconography of single towns, research shifted to methodology, language, techniques, instruments, the relationship between word and image and between material structure and representation. Promising research fields are opening up through the use of computer data processing, and the comparative study on the representation of urban space seems to be one of the next frontiers.
Town representation is no longer studied as source material for the study of urban history, but become a research field in itself, one that has to find its proper place in the history of culture .

==Foundations of Urban Iconography==
Collections of images of single towns began to appear the beginning of  the twentieth century, but more recently urban iconography has been recognized as a methodology of research. After the publication of the "Atlante" ( ''Storia d'Italia'' series, Einaudi, Turin, 1976)  and the launching of the series "Le città nella storia d'Italia" (Bari, Laterza, 1980) aimed at investigating the relationship between towns developments and their iconography, research took new directions. The subject has been discussed in conferences and round tables, the proceedings of some of which are now available.&lt;ref&gt;''L’immagine della città europea in età di antico regime'',Napoli 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iconografia della Città Europee dal XV al XIX secolo'',Napoli 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The representation of lansdcape in the 17th century'',Utrecht 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L’iconografia delle città spagnole dal XV al XIX secolo'',Napoli 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le paysage des cartes.Genèse d'une codification'',Parigi 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città europee dal XV al XIX secolo'',Napoli 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Imago urbis'',Bologna 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'image peinte de la Ville.XVe-XVIIIe siècle Italie-Europe'',Roma 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città europee dal XV al XIX secolo'', Napoli 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Mapmaker's Vision,Beholder's Eyes:The Art of Maps'',Arlington TX 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città europee dal XV al XIX secolo'', Napoli 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Icone urbane'', Macerata 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L'iconografia delle città svizzere e tedesche nel contesto europeo: dai prototipi alla fotografia'', Napoli 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Piante di Roma del Rinascimento e della Controriforma(1551-1625)'', Roma 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le piante di Roma. La città dal Barocco ai Catasti. Architettura, arte e scienza'', Roma 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''El poder de la imagen: retratos de la ciudad barroca'', Siviglia 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Papers focused on urban iconography were presented in sessions of the biennial "International Conferences on the History of Cartography"
(http://www.maphistory.info/ichcintro.html).
Many medium-sized cities began to encourage catalogues of their own iconography, and  museum exhibitions, that were sometimes extended to wider contexts and accompanied by rich catalogues &lt;ref&gt;''Firenze e la sua immagine. Cinque secoli di vedutismo'', Firenze 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''L’immagine della città italiana dal XVI al XIX secolo', Napoli 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A volo d'uccello.

==Online archives==
At the moment many images of cities are available on line, at high and low resolution, but without any historical information. Two websites were created:
one belonging to the Centro Interdipartimentale di Ricerca sull’Iconografia della Città Europea of Naples (http://www.iconografiaurbana.it) and the other, the« Atlante storico-iconografico delle città toscane » (http://asict.arte.unipi.it) hosted by the Università di Pisa.

The '''École des technologies numériques appliquées''' ('''ETNA''') is a [[France|French]] private school in [[computer science]] localized at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]]. Created in 2005 by Patrice Dumoucel, the school since 2006 is part of [[IONIS Education Group]]. The certification delivered by the school are recognized by the [[France|French state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://textes.droit.org/JORF/2010/07/22/0167/0008 Arrêté du 12 juillet 2010 portant enregistrement au répertoire national des certifications professionnelles]&lt;/ref&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://textes.droit.org/JORF/2010/07/22/0167/ Journal officiel de la République Française du 22 juillet 2010, édition n°167]&lt;/ref&gt;

The school is from the same group as [[École Pour l'Informatique et les Techniques Avancées|EPITA]] and [[École pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies|EPITECH]]. The partnership ETNA/EPITA/EPITECH allows students to use the equipment to the two other universities. ETNA graduates can proceed to others courses at the [[IONIS School of Technology and Management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.ionis-stm.com/ IONIS School of Technology and Management]&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Master's in business administration|MBA]] at the ''[[Institut supérieur de gestion]]''. Students of ETNA can prepare major certifications  ([[Microsoft]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]]).

== Curriculum ==

The course is a three-year [[dual education system]] and includes 200 hours of lessons and 400 hours of practical cases study per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.capcampus.com/mba-458/etna-ecole-des-technologies-numeriques-appliquees-o20371.htm ETNA, Ecole des technologies numériques appliquées]&lt;/ref&gt;
Two specializations are available : [[software development]] or system and [[computer network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.jobingenieur.com/ETNA ETNA ECOLE DES TECHNOLOGIES NUMÉRIQUES APPLIQUÉES]&lt;/ref&gt;

Students choose one of these two in the second year.

The main lessons of the first year of study offers the following subjects:  [[management]], [[database]], [[IPv4]] network, web technologies, system administration, PHP / [[World Wide Web|web]], culture [[computer]], English, [[mathematics]] and method.
The second year can address the following topics: project, business valuation, English, [[mathematics]], drafting and document analysis, and [[marketing]] / business / management.
During the last year, the curriculum includes the subjects: project, English, [[mathematics]], drafting and document analysis, [[marketing]] / business / management and [[psychology]] work.

Since September 2013, the school will start a new program in 2 years after French ''[[Baccalauréat]]'' which will be entirely free. 250 tickets are available. The innovation is that there are graduate students who will pay for the students in training (250 euros per month during three years).&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}}[http://www.meltycampus.fr/ionis-group-evoque-son-avenir-a158109.html Ionis Education Group évoque son avenir]&lt;/ref&gt;
