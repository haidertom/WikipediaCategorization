'''''A Waterfall in a Rocky Landscape''''' (c. 1660s) is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "239. LANDSCAPE WITH WATERFALL. The waterfall fills the whole foreground, rushing down over rocks from a broad basin. In the left foreground a fallen tree hangs over the water. In the left middle distance is a wooden bridge, with firs and leafy trees to the left of it. To the right on the bank are leafy trees, one of which has fallen and hangs over the water. Behind the trees on a high bank is a cottage, with firs to the left of it. Dark cloudy sky. [Pendant to 240.] 

Signed in full, "J. Ruysdael" ; canvas, 40 1/2 inches by 34 inches. Engraved in mezzotint by J. G. Prestel. Sale. Count von Brabeck and Count Andreas von Stolberg of Soder, Hanover, October 31, 1859, No. 235 (£1187 : 15 : 6, for the National Gallery). In the National Gallery, London, 1906 catalogue, No. 627."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/79/mode/1up  Entry 239 for ''''Landscape with Waterfall''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Waterfall in a Rocky Landscape'' is very similar to other paintings by the artist from between 1660 and 1670. Although the depicted landscape is [[Scandinavia]], Ruisdael never left a record of visiting foreign countries outside Germany. From the middle of the 1650s he produced a series of waterfalls over boulders, surrounded by high pine trees, inspired by the work of the artist [[Allaert van Everdingen]], who visited [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] in 1644.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19557">The '''art of Urartu''' refers to a historical and regional type of art from [[Urartu]] (Ararat), the ancient state of [[Western Asia]] which existed in the period from the 13th to the 6th centuries BC in the [[Armenian Highland]]. The art of Urartu was strongly influenced by nearby [[Assyria]], the most prominent state of that period in the region. It peaked around the 8th century BC but was mostly looted, scattered and destroyed with the fall of Urartu about a century later.&lt;ref name=c148&gt;Chahin, Mack, 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/619349/Urartu Urartu], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' online&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Urartian Art 04a~.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of a [[bronze]] throne of [[List of kings of Urartu|Urartian kings]]]]

== Overview ==
Urartian art was heavily influenced by neighboring Assyria, and despite the obvious stylistic differences was long considered a branch of Assyrian art. Urartian art is characterized by 1) a style following its [[Aesthetic canon|canon]] more rigorously than in other cultures of the Ancient East, 2) preference for [[Ornament (architecture)|ornaments]] rather than representational scenes of life, and 3) the practice of copying old examples instead of improving them.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"&gt;Пиотровский Б. Б. Искусство Урарту VIII—VI вв. до н. э. ("The Art of Urartu, 8th-6th century BC"). ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], Leningrad, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Afanaseva1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Афанасьева В. К., Дьяконов И. М. |title=Искусство Передней Азии 2 — середины 1 тысячелетия до н. э.. Памятники мирового искусства (The Art of Western Asia from 2nd to the middle of 1st millennium BC. Monuments of world art). Issue 2 (1st series). The Art of the Ancient Orient|publisher=Искусство|place=Moscow|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the style of Urartian craftsmen remained unchanged for several centuries and was gradually simplified.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; Urartian art was relatively poorly characterized until the 1950s, when major archeological work was started at the ancient Urartian cities [[Teishebaini]] and [[Erebuni Fortress|Erebuni]] and many Urartian [[cuneiform]] tables were deciphered.

==Bronze statuettes==
Although Urartian masters were capable of producing large bronze statue, not even fragments of any  have been found so far. Literature&lt;!--where?--&gt; mentions that Assyrians, while looting the city of [[Musasir]], removed a bronze statue of [[List of kings of Urartu|King]] [[Argishti I]] weighing 60 [[Talent (measurement)|talents]] (about 1,8 tons). Small bronze objects of art were exclusively made for the king's palace and are divided into three groups: [[throne]] decorations, ornaments on copper [[cauldron]]s and, rarely, statuettes of Urartian gods.

===Throne decorations===
Between 1877 and 1885, local treasure hunters sold a few small bronze fragments to several European museums. These fragments later turned out to be parts of one and the same Urartian king's throne. They were cast in bronze into a mold and then gilded by wrapping in thin [[gold]] sheets. The fragments are currently preserved in the [[British Museum]], [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Louvre]], [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and in private collections in [[Paris]] and [[Brussels]].

===Boiler decorations===
{{double image|right|UrartianCaldron02.jpg|165|UrartianCaldron03~.jpg|290|Left: cauldron with bull heads found in [[Van, Turkey|Van]], Turkey. Right: cauldron from a [[Phrygia]]n city with figures assigned to the god [[Shivini]].&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ank&gt;[[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], [[Ankara]], Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cauldron decorations are the best-preserved objects of Urartian bronze and therefore were used in the early 20th century to identify the Urartian style in art.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The decorated [[copper]] cauldrons were apparently used for ritual ceremonies. For example, the annals of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] mention a bronze vessel filled with wine being part of the sacrifice to the god [[Ḫaldi]].

The bronze statuettes were cast separately and then attached to the cauldron. They include bull heads and winged deities, possibly the god [[Shivini]] and his wife [[Tushpuea]].&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The technique of [[casting]] bronze ornaments spread from [[Urartu]] to the neighboring countries, in particular to [[Phrygia]], and then to Europe. Urartian cauldron ornaments have been found in [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]], [[Athens]], [[Boeotia]], [[Delphi]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] tombs.&lt;ref name="Pallottino"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pallottino, M. |title=Urartu, Greece and Etruria|journal= East and West|volume=9|issue=1–2|place=Rome|year=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amandry"&gt;Amandry P.

===Statuettes of gods===
{{double image|left|Tesheiba02~.jpg|150|Arubani02~.jpg|200|Left: weather god [[Theispas|Teisheba]], found in 1941 during the excavations at [[Karmir Blur]], in the ruins of the Urartian fortress of [[Teishebaini]] named in honor of the god. Right: goddess [[Arubani]], wife of Ḫaldi.}}

Only three bronze statuettes depicting Urartian deities have been preserved. One, possibly of the god [[Ḫaldi]], is stored in the British Museum, and two others are in the National Museum of the History of Armenia (copy in the Erebuni Museum, Yerevan, see image).

== Weapons ==

=== Helmets===
{{double image|right|Helmet08.jpg|130|Urartu_Helmet_Fragment_2~.jpg|250|Helmet of the Urartu king [[Sarduri II]] found at [[Karmir Blur]] near [[Teishebaini]].&lt;ref name=mus2&gt;National Museum of History of Armenia, Yerevan&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription on the helmet reads: "Sarduri, son of [[Argishti I|Argishti]] dedicates this helmet to God Ḫaldi".&lt;ref name="PerevodP2"&gt;Пиотровский, Б.

Numerous Urartian helmets have been recovered, more than 20 alone during the excavations of [[Teishebaini]]. Royal ceremonial helmets did not differ in shape from simple combat helmets but contained engraved images.

===Shields===
A few decorative bronze Urartian shields have been found near Van (they are stored in the British Museum and Berlin museums) and 14 were excavated at [[Karmir Blur]]. They have diameters ranging between 70 and 100&amp;nbsp;cm and were not made for combat, as judged from the thinness of the metal and the character of the handles. All these shields contain concentric circles of lions and bulls which were designed so that no figure would appear upside down. The images were first stamped and then engraved with various instruments. The Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] described six golden Urartian shields, which were looted in [[Musasir]], weighing 6.5&amp;nbsp;kg each. They have not been recovered thus far.

Poorly preserved remains of Urartian [[Mail (armour)|mail]] of [[Argishti I]] were excavated at [[Teishebaini]].&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Entire (or parts of) wide bronze belts were found in Turkey (Altyn-Tepe), [[Iran]] ([[Lake Urmia]]) and Armenia (Karmir Blur). The belts were about 1 meter long and 12&amp;nbsp;cm wide and were designed to protect archers.

===Jewelry===
Jewelry of Urartu had two gradations: ornaments made of precious metals and stones for the king and his family, and their simplified bronze versions used by the rich. Many jewelry items were also used as amulets.&lt;ref name="Esayan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Есаян С.|title=Ювелирное искусство Урарту (Jewelry art of Urartu) |journal=Историко-филологический журнал|place=Yerevan|volume=3|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annals of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] mention vast amounts of Urartian jewelry items made of silver and gold which were taken from Musasir in 714 BC.&lt;ref name=c148/&gt; They are not preserved and  some may have been melted by treasure hunters.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The two largest recovered jewelry items are shown below. They are the pectoral decoration excavated at the late Urartian capital [[Rusahinili]] and the cover of the cauldron found at Teishebaini. Smaller items include golden pins, earrings, a [[bracelet]] and a few medallions. Jewelry was worn in Urartu by both men and women. Women's jewelry usually portrayed the Urartian goddess [[Arubani]], wife of Ḫaldi – the supreme god of Urartu. Also common are Mesopotamian motifs such as [[tree of life]] and [[winged sun]]. More accessible jewelry included bronze bracelets and earrings and [[carnelian]] beads.&lt;ref name="Esayan"/&gt;

=== Pottery and stone art ===
Contrary to expectations, very few stone reliefs and sculptures were found during excavations,&lt;ref name="Marr"&gt;Марр Н. Я., Орбели И. А. Археологическая экспедиция 1916 года в Ван (Archaeological Expedition in 1916 to Van), Petrograd, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; although the reliefs of the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] depicting the Urartian city of [[Musasir]] clearly show large statues.&lt;ref name=c148/&gt; Only a few minor remnants of stone reliefs were discovered in Turkey: the rest were likely destroyed after the fall of Urartu. However, pottery items were found in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Chahin, Mack, 160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wood and bone ===
A few art items made of bone were found, mostly broken to parts, such as the bone combs excavated near Teishebaini. The only preserved example of wooden art of Urartu is the horse which was attached to some larger wooden item.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt;

Many features of Urartian art were preserved in the neighboring countries after the fall of Urartu in the 6th century BC. Observations by [[Boris Piotrovsky]] suggest that decoration and production techniques of [[Scythians|Scythian]] belts and [[scabbard]]s were borrowed from Urartu.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1962"/&gt; The Urartian way of decorating cauldrons spread over the ancient world, and it is believed that [[Art of Armenia|Armenian art]] and that of [[Georgia (country)|southern Georgia]] were partly based on the Urartian traditions.&lt;ref name="Piotrovskiy1959"/&gt;&lt;ref Name="Stepanyan"&gt;Степанян Н.

In [[fiction]], '''canon''' is the material accepted as officially part of the story in the [[fictional universe]] of that story. It is often contrasted with, or used as the basis for, works of [[fan fiction]]. The alternative terms '''mythology''', '''timeline''', '''universe''' and '''continuity''' are often used, with the former being especially used to refer to a richly detailed fictional canon requiring a large degree of [[suspension of disbelief]] (e.g. an entire imaginary world and history), while the latter two typically refer to a single arc where all events are directly connected chronologically. Other times, the word can mean "to be acknowledged by the creator(s)".

==Origin==
The use of the word "canon" originated in reference to a set of texts derives from [[Biblical canon]], the set of books regarded as [[scripture]], as contrasted with non-canonical [[Apocrypha]].{{sfn|McDonald|2007|p=38}} The term was first used by analogy in the context of fiction to refer to the [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes stories and novels]], written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], as contrasted with numerous Holmes adventures added later by other writers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} This usage was afterwards extended to the writings of various other authors.

The term "canon" nowadays refers to all works of fiction within a franchise's fictional universe which are considered "to have actually happened" within the fictional universe they belong to.

==Canonicity==
When there are multiple "official" works or original media, the question of what is canonical can be unclear. This is resolved either by explicitly excluding certain media from the status of canon (as in the case of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''), by assigning different levels of canonicity to different media (as was in the case of ''Star Wars'' before the franchise was purchased by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]), by considering different but licensed media treatments official and equally canonical to the series timeline within their own [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]] universe, but not across them, or not resolved at all. The use of canon is of particular importance with regard to [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] or re-imaginings of established franchises, such as the ''Star Trek'' remake (2009), because of the ways in which it influences the viewer experience.{{sfn|Urbanski|2013|p=83}}

The official ''[[Star Trek]]'' website describes [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]] as "the events that take place within the episodes and movies" (that is, the television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', and the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' film series]], with ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' having long existed in a [[Star Trek: The Animated Series#Canon issues|nebulous gray area of canonicity]]).&lt;ref name="trek"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/help/faqs/faq/676.html |title=FAQ: Article |date=10 July 2003 |work=startrek.com |publisher=CBS Studios |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events, characters and storylines from tie-in novels, comic books, and video games are explicitly excluded from the ''Star Trek'' canon, but the site notes that elements from these sources have been subsequently introduced into the television series, and says that "canon is not something set in stone."&lt;ref name="trek" /&gt; One example of a non-canonical element that later became canonical in the Star Trek universe were the first names for [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] and [[Uhura]], introduced in novels, plus "Tiberius" becoming the official middle name of Enterprise captain [[James T. Kirk]]. The name was introduced in the ''Star Trek'' animated series, and was later added into the official biography of the character by its mention in the live-action film ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'' (1991).

The [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]] originally existed on several levels. The highest level was the original ''Star Wars'' films, and statements by [[George Lucas]]; tie-in fiction from the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] had a different level of canonicity.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |title=Meet Leland Chee, the Star Wars Franchise Continuity Cop |first=Chris |last=Baker |url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/hollywood/magazine/16-09/ff_starwarscanon?currentPage=all |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]  |date=18 August 2008 |accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex system was maintained by Leland Chee, a [[Lucasfilm]] employee.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; After Disney bought the franchise, all material published prior to April 25, 2014 that was not any of the Star Wars movies or the CGI cartoon ''The Clone Wars'' was declared in the "Legends" continuity, marking them as no longer official canon. All subsequent material exists on the same level of canon, with the Lucasfilm Story Group being established to ensure no contradictions among canon works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page|title=The Legendary Star Wars Expanded Universe Turns a New Page|work=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The makers of ''[[Doctor Who]]'' have generally avoided making pronouncements about canonicity, with [[Russell T Davies]] explaining that he does not think about the concept for the ''Doctor Who'' television series or its [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]].&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine #356&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies RT, "The Writer's Tales"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canon as distinguishing between original works and later additions==
In literature, the term "canon" is used to distinguish between the original works of a writer who created certain characters and/or settings, and the later works of other writers who took up the same characters or setting. For example, the [[canon of Sherlock Holmes]] consists of the 56 [[short story|short stories]] and four [[novel]]s written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] and featuring the detective [[Sherlock Holmes]].&lt;ref name="Doyle 1993"&gt;Peter Haining, "Introduction" in {{cite book | last = Doyle | first = Arthur Conan | title = The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes | publisher = Barnes &amp; Noble Books | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 1-56619-198-X }} Edited by Peter Haining.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|subsequent works]] by other authors who took up Sherlock Holmes are considered "non-canonical".

==Fanon==
&lt;!-- [[Fanon]] links to this section --&gt;
[[Fan fiction]] is almost never regarded as canonical. However, certain ideas may become influential or widely accepted within fan communities, who refer to such ideas as "fanon", a [[portmanteau]] of ''fan'' and ''canon''.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Parrish|2007|p=33}}: 'fanon.' Within an individual fandom, certain plotlines may be reinvented so many times and by so many people—or alternately may be written so persuasively by a few writers—that they take on the status of fan-produced canon.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of the word fanon was by [[Emily Salzfass]] in [https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/alt.startrek.creative.erotica.moderated/x4ZMX4jeQG4/FeEBn8gPjYgJ a post about Star Trek] at [[alt.startrek.creative.erotica.moderated]] on April 1, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the jargon "headcanon" is used to describe a fan's personal interpretation of a fictional universe.

'''The Centre for the History of the Book (CHB)''' was established in 1995 at The [[University of Edinburgh]] as an international and interdisciplinary centre for advanced research into all aspects of the material culture of the text - its production, circulation, and reception from manuscript to the electronic text.

Founded in 1995 by Bill Bell and Jonquil Bevan. Bell, who was Director for almost two decades, was succeeded by Tom Mole. The CHB now serves a community over 30 members of staff across several university departments and is today an internationally recognised centre dedicated to the promotion of [[Bibliography]] and Book History.

As well as hosting international conferences and seminars, it provides a focus for a number of research projects, and facilitates postgraduate study in the field of the [[History of the Book]].

== Research ==

The Centre has been involved in a number of [http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/chb/about/recent research projects].  These include the Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, a four-volume publication whose aim is to investigate the history of the production, circulation, and reception of Scottish texts from earliest times to the present.  The Centre’s director, Tom Mole, has edited [http://broadviewpress.com/product.php?productid=1855 ''The Broadview Book History Reader''] with [https://www.sfu.ca/english/faculty-staff/profiles/michelle-levy.html Michelle Levy] of [[Simon Fraser University]]. The reader reprints 33 key essays in the field, grouped conceptually and provided with headnotes, explanatory footnotes, an introduction, a chronology, and a glossary of terms.

=== Fellows ===

The CHB regularly hosts visiting fellows from other universities.  Past fellows have included Richard Sher, Alexander Dick and others.

== Events ==

=== Public Lectures ===

The CHB hosts an annual public lecture, which at different times has been sponsored by [[James Thin]] Booksellers and [[Blackwell UK]].  Past lecturers have included [[Asa Briggs]], [[Lisa Jardine]], [[Bamber Gascoigne]], [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]], and [[Alberto Manguel]].

=== Seminar Series ===

The CHB hosts a seminar series, which runs bi-weekly during the [[University of Edinburgh]] term.

=== Conferences ===

The CHB has organised a number of conferences, including the ‘Material Cultures’ conferences in 2000, 2005 and 2010, where keynote speakers included [[Robert Darnton]], [[Stephen Greenblatt]] and [[Roger Chartier]].  More recently, it has hosted some smaller conferences, including [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133634/http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/chb/events/creativity-and-commerce Creativity and Commerce in the Age of Print] in 2014.  In 2015, it hosted a pair of symposia in collaboration with Harvard University, called [http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/literatures-languages-cultures/chb/events/symposium-books-and-new-media Books and/as New Media].

'''Dartmoor kistvaens''' are  burial tombs or [[cist]]s from the late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]], i.e. from c 2500 BC to c 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Phil|title=The Field Archaeology of Dartmoor|year=2011|publisher=English Heritage|location=Frome|isbn=978-1-84802-033-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kistvaen]]s have been found in many places, including [[Dartmoor]], a {{convert|954|sqkm|abbr=in}} area of [[moorland]] in south [[Devon]], England. The box-like stone tombs were created when the ancient people of the area lived in [[Grimspound#The hut circles|hut circles]]. Cists are often to be found in the centre of a [[cairn circle]] although some appear solitary which could be the result of the loss of an original slight mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Jeremy|title=Dartmoor Atlas of Antiquities: Vol. 5. - The Second Millennium B.C.|year=1997|publisher=Devon Books|location=Tiverton|isbn=0861149106}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 180&lt;ref name="Newman 2011, p.51"&gt;Newman 2011, p.51.&lt;/ref&gt; known cists on Dartmoor although there could be up to 100 that remain buried underneath unexplored cairns.&lt;ref&gt;Of the cairns excavated by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee 12% contained buried cists which would suggest around 100 cists remain concealed, Butler 1997, p.173.&lt;/ref&gt; In the South West there are no cists to be found on the Quantock Hills, only 2 to be found on Exmoor and 58 to be found on Bodmin Moor.&lt;ref name="Newman 2011, p.51"/&gt; The Dartmoor cists are unique in that about 94% have the longer axis of the tomb oriented in a NW/SE direction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|left|Kistvaen to the south of the [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] [[stone row]]s]]

==Description==
The word "kistvaen" is derived from the Cornu-Celtic ''Cist-veyn'' or ''Cist-vyin''; in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the word is ''Cist-faen''. All these names mean "a stone chest" (''cist'' is a chest or box, ''maen'' is a stone). Kistvaens are formed using four or more flat stones for the sides and for the ends, and a larger flat stone (the "capstone") for the cover. Some kistvaens are surrounded by circles of erected stones. In general, if a body was to be buried without cremation, it was placed into a kistvaen in a [http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/images/Kistvaen3.gif contracted position]. If on the other hand a body was [[cremate]]d, the [[wood ash|ash]]es were usually put in a [[cinerary urn]], and then the urn was placed in a kistvaen.

However, the majority of the known Dartmoor kistvaens were opened at some time in the past, and whatever they used to hold is missing. The cists were probably robbed in the hope of finding [[treasure]]. Kistvaens were known by many [[common name]]s, including "money pits", "money boxes", "crocks of gold", "caves", "Roman graves" and so on. The idea that ancient tombs might contain valuable items is a very old one; one of the first mentions of searching [[tumuli]] in Devon dates back to 1324. Permission to search was granted by [[Edward II of England]].&lt;ref name="The Reliquary &amp; illustrated archæologist"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZQSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA161| last =Allen| first = John Romilly |author2=[[John Charles Cox]]| title =DARTMOOR KISTVAENS| work =| publisher =London, Bermose and sons Limited| date =January 1895| accessdate = 2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently archaeologists usually use the word [[cist]] when talking about kistvaens, but in the past 120+ years other terms have been used, including "chest", "maen" or "vaen", "a stone" "a stone coffin" and so on.&lt;ref name="The tomb raiders"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/tomb_raider.htm|title=The tomb raiders|accessdate=2009-05-31|publisher=legendarydartmoor.co.uk|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
Tombs of the dead were traditionally regarded as sacred places by the people of Dartmoor. However the various treasure-related common names for these burial sites caused some people to break the [[taboo]] that tombs must be revered and not disturbed. As a result of this tomb-raiding, stories came into being which purport to show that a graverobber's inappropriate and greedy actions will be punished in supernatural ways.

One of the legends is about "the [[parson]]", although this may possibly have been someone's [[nickname]] rather than the title of a real man of the cloth. Either way, the story says he made a map of all of the nearby kistvaens, showing the locations as black dots. Very soon his map had more black dots than a [[Psyllobora vigintiduopunctata|ladybird]] has on its back. The lure of the kistvaens was so great that the parson (and a few other people who agreed to help him) opened every kistvaen that was marked on his map.

After this, the parson was seen counting money every night. His wealth did not make him happy, and neither did it last long. One night a huge electrical storm moved over the [[moorland|moor]]s. Furious [[lightning]] was followed again and again almost immediately by very loud [[thunder]]. Nobody could sleep for the noise of the storm.

Surprisingly the next morning there was very little damage to be seen. Actually all the houses around were intact, except for one house&amp;nbsp;— the house of the parson. His house was in ruins, and it was still burning. Some neighbors even thought they smelled burning [[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]]. Presumably the [[devil]] himself had made the parson pay for desecrating the kistvaens.&lt;ref name="The tomb raiders"/&gt;

===The Money Pit kistvaen story===
This story features a very friendly, good-natured farmer. Once he had a dream about a kistvaen close to his farm. In his dream he saw that the kistvaen was filled with money. Next day he went there, and with a huge effort he managed to move the capstone, and started to dig.

As he dug, a huge [[raven]] circled overhead, mocking him, and encouraging him to dig deeper and deeper. Eventually the farmer put his hand inside, and pulled out a small piece of [[flint]], shaped in the form of a heart. He took his find home. After this incident, his personality changed radically: he became mean and angry, and he lost all his friends. His life became miserable. About a year later, his young son found the flint in the house, and took it outside to play with it. Then the boy went out onto the moor to look for something else to play with, and he dropped the flint as he went along.

On that same day the farmer changed once again, reverting to the "jolly farmer" he had always been until the unfortunate day when he opened the kistvaen.&lt;ref name="The Money Pit"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/money_pit.htm|title=The Money Pit|accessdate=2009-05-31|publisher=legendarydartmoor.co.uk|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|ドラゴンクエストIV 導かれし者たち|Doragon Kuesuto Fō Michibikareshi Monotachi|lit. "Dragon Quest IV: The Guided Ones"}}. Known in English speaking parts of Europe and in Australia as '''''Dragon Quest: The Chapters of the Chosen''''', on the Nintendo DS.}}, originally published as '''''Dragon Warrior IV''''' in North America, is a [[role-playing video game]] and the fourth installment of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' video game series developed by [[Chunsoft]] and published by [[Enix]]. It was originally released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] on 11 February 1990 in Japan. A North American NES version followed in October 1992, and would be the last ''Dragon Quest'' game localized and published by Enix's [[Enix#North America|Enix America Corporation]] subsidiary prior to its closure in November 1995, as well as the last ''Dragon Quest'' game to be localized into English prior to the localization of ''[[Dragon Warrior Monsters]]'' in December 1999. The game was [[enhanced remake|remade]] by Heartbeat for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which eventually was available as an [[Ultimate Hit]]s title. This was followed with a second remake developed by [[ArtePiazza]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], released in Japan on 22 November 2007. This remake was released in Australia on 11 September 2008, in Europe on 12 September 2008&lt;ref name="eurorelease"&gt;{{cite web | title=EXPERIENCE DRAGON QUEST IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ZENITHIA TRILOGY ANNOUNCED FOR EUROPE | url=http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/37219/DRAGON-QUEST-The-Chapters-of-the-Chosen | publisher=MCV | date=2008-05-21 | accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America on September 16, 2008. A version based on the Nintendo DS remake for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2014.

''Dragon Quest IV'' differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists. The first four are told from the perspective of the Hero's future companions and the fifth one, from the hero's perspective, brings all the characters together as they start their journey to save the world.&lt;ref name="NP46"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staff |date=March 1993 |title= ''Dragon Warrior IV'' |journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=46 |pages= 82–87 | publisher= Nintendo of America| id= |url=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation remake adds a sixth chapter, which is retained in the DS remake.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dragon Quest IV.png|left|thumb|The Hero and the party with a wagon that is able to travel through one of selected dungeon areas in the NES version of ''Dragon Quest IV'', where menu commands and character stats are displayed]]
''Dragon Quest IV'' offered several new features over the first three titles, while carrying on many of those introduced in the previous games.&lt;ref name="NP46"/&gt; Similar features included are the day and night cycles, the ability to travel via ship and a flying vehicle (this time, a hot air balloon), and the three levels of keys. They are Thief, Magic and Ultimate (originally localized as Final). There are also travel doors, which allow the party to move a great distance on the world map with little travel. Unlike the Hero in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', the Hero of ''Dragon Quest IV'' is not required to be in the party at all once the wagon becomes available. Despite this, the Hero is again the character that possesses the most powerful healing and attack spells. Many spells, weapons, armor, and shops (including the vault/bank) function the same as in past games.

In addition to the new chapter-based storylines, an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] system called "Tactics" was implemented that allowed the player to provide strategies to the party members (who become [[Non-player character|NPCs]] in the final chapter), such as prioritizing damage, healing or MP conservation, while maintaining full control of the Hero. ''[[Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation]]'' and the remakes of IV allow tactics to be set for characters individually rather than using one tactics mode for all characters, as well as including the "Follow Orders" Tactics mode, which allows other characters to be controlled manually.&lt;ref name="kurt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3520/the_history_of_dragon_quest.php|title=The History of Dragon Quest|accessdate=2009-09-30|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|date=2008-02-04|work=Gamasutra|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Tactics" system is seen as a precursor to ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'''s "[[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|Gambits]]" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Ben|title=A Warrior’s Quest: A Retrospective of Square-Enix’s Classic RPG Series|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/14/a-warrior-s-quest-a-retrospective-of-square-enix-s-classic-rpg-series.aspx|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=28 December 2011|date=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wagon, first introduced in this game, allows the player to choose which characters are used in battle. The wagon can also be seen in ''Dragon Quest V'' and ''Dragon Quest VI''. The first casino appears in this installment as a place to play several mini-games ([[slot machine]], [[poker]], and the Monster Betting that was introduced in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'') using tokens that could be traded for special items. Searching drawers and inside of jars was first introduced in this game as a means to find items. Small Medals, later Mini Medals, were introduced as a new item to search for and trade for special unique items from a secluded king.

Saving the game was made easier by allowing one to save a game in a House of Healing, rather than talking to a king.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt; Also, the save ("Confession" in the DS remake) and EXP point to the next level-up ("Divination" in the DS remake) are now separate commands. Returning to the format of the original North American ''Dragon Warrior'', programmers allowed users to open a door using a command appearing in the top level of the menu (rather than requiring users to search through various characters' inventories for the key as in some previous games). The only requirement was that at least one character in the party needed to have an appropriate key in his or her inventory. Since this command was added, an unlocked door was added in this game, as well as large Castle Doors. However, this command was eliminated in later games and the remake, in which doors can be opened by attempting to walk through them.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
In the original version, the game is divided into five [[chapter (books)|chapters]]. The first four provide back-story for the Hero’s party members, while the fifth follows the Hero himself or herself as he or she meets up with the other characters. 

Chapter One begins when a knight from Burland (Ragnar) is tasked to find children who have gone missing from a nearby town.  Ragnar finds and defeats the monster responsible for the abductions and returns the children to their homes. In doing so, he learns the monsters were looking for the Legendary Hero (in order to kill him or her), who is supposedly still a child.  Ragnar decides to leave his home and set out on a quest to protect him.&lt;ref name="kurt" /&gt;

Chapter Two follows the tomboyish Princess Alena and her two friends/mentors, tutor Borya (localized as Brey) and chancellor Kiryl (localized as Cristo) as she travels to prove her strength.&lt;ref name="kurt" /&gt; Partway through her journey, Alena’s father (the King) loses his voice after speaking of a dream he had depicting the end of the world. After restoring his voice, she travels to the town of Endor to enter a fighting tournament. She defeats all of the combatants except a warrior named Psaro the Manslayer (originally localized as Saro until he rescues Rosa from humans and changes his name to Necrosaro), who fails to appear. After the victory, she returns to her home castle to find all the inhabitants have gone missing, so she sets out to find out what happened to everyone.

Chapter Three follows a merchant named Torneko (localized as Taloon), a humble merchant working in a weapon shop in his hometown with his wife and young son.  His dream is to own his own shop and be the world's greatest merchant.  As he travels and performs favors at the towns he visits, Torneko eventually obtains permission to purchase a shop in Endor.  By finding the rare Silver Statuette in a nearby cave, Torneko is able to obtain the funds to purchase the shop and move his family to Endor. After establishing a successful business with his wife, he hears about a set of legendary weapons, which he sets out to find by funding the construction of an underground passageway to a neighboring continent.

Chapter Four follows Maya and Meena, two sisters seeking revenge for the murder of their father. By teaming up with a former student of their father (Oojam), they manage to plot a way into Keeleon Castle and find the man responsible.  They avenge their father’s murder by defeating the King of Keeleon, but are quickly defeated by the King's master and thrown in the dungeon. Oojam sacrifices himself to allow the sisters to escape the castle.  They then decide to flee the continent and head for Endor, where they hope to learn more about their new foe and about the Legendary Hero, whom they became aware of during their travels.

Chapter Five follows the game's [[protagonist]], known as the Hero.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt; It begins with the Hero’s hometown being attacked by monsters, led by Psaro the Manslayer. The Hero manages to escape, and is joined by the main characters of the previous chapters, as well as Hoffman, who drives the cart. Together, they spy on Psaro and discover that Estark, the Ruler of Evil (originally localized as Esturk), has been awakened. Their quest then becomes to travel to Estark’s palace and defeat him.

In the town of Strathbaile&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (originally localized as Izmit), the heroes have a dream that explains Psaro’s plan. Developing a deep hatred of humanity after the death of his [[Elf|elven]] girlfriend, Rose (originally localized as Rosa), at the hands of humans, Psaro plans to become the next Ruler of Evil using the power of [[Transmutation of species|evolution]] he obtained from the "Armlet of [[Alchemy|Transmutation]]" (an item Alena's party had obtained and given away in Chapter 2 as a ransom payment for a kidnapped woman.)  The party then obtains the four pieces of the Zenithian weapons and armor (sword, shield, body armor, and helm) to permit entry into Zenithian Castle. There, they meet the Zenith [[Dragon]], who takes them to Nadiria (originally localized as Evil World), where Psaro is undergoing his evolution into the new Ruler of Evil. There, they defeat his generals before challenging Psaro. After fighting a continually evolving form of Psaro, he is vanquished.

The PlayStation and DS remakes include a sixth chapter. This chapter focuses on the heroes working with Psaro to avenge the death of Rose, and finally put the world back in order. Throughout this chapter, Rose is revived and the party is able to defeat her true killer, the Dark Priest [[Aamon]] (originally localized as Radimvice), one of Psaro the Manslayer's subordinates who intended to take the secrets of evolution for himself and usurp Psaro the Manslayer, setting all plans in motion that drove Psaro to his insanity.

===Characters===
[[File:Dragon Quest IV characters.jpg|thumb|Characters of ''Dragon Quest IV'': ''(top row, from left)'' Torneko, Kiryl, Alena, Meena, and Maya; ''(bottom row)'' Ragnar, the Male Hero, the Female Hero, and Borya]]
These are the main characters of the story, and are controllable party members during their introduction chapters (Chapters 1-4). When they join the Hero in Chapter 5, the other party members become NPC characters that are only controlled by the ''Tactics'' command. In the re-releases, this setting can be changed to ''Follow Orders'', which allows the player to choose their actions. Also, with the re-releases, many of the character's names were changed to be closer, or incorporate their Original Japanese names.

* '''Hero''' ''(Male Hero is named Solo, while the Female Hero is named Sofia) &lt;ref&gt;Dragon Quest 4 Japanese Playstation Manual&lt;/ref&gt; ''The main character of the game, who's eighteen-years-old and does not appear until Chapter 5. The Hero can use the best equipment, and is the only character who can learn lightning spells and the most powerful healing spell in the game, Omniheal (originally localized as HealUsAll). In the DS remake, the Hero also learns Gigasword, the game's most powerful single-target attack spell. The player can choose the name and gender of the hero. The gender of the hero has little impact to the story, only affecting some dialogue, although a few optional weapons, pieces of armor, and accessories can only be equipped by female characters. In the remakes, the Hero first appears during a short prologue chapter before Chapter 1.&lt;ref name="NP230"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Loe |first= Casey|date=July 2008 |title= A flight of Dragons |journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=230 |pages= 50–57| publisher= Future USA, Inc| id= |url=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{nihongo|'''Ragnar McRyan'''|ライアン|''Ryan''|''originally localized as Ragnar''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Captain of the Burland (a Scottish English speaking land) army, and Royal Knight. He investigates a case of children who are disappearing throughout the kingdom which is causing havoc and despair throughout the kingdom. He first appears in Chapter 1. He also cameos in Chapters 2 (Inn by Endor) and 3 (Endor Casino). He is the classic Warrior or Soldier, specializing in melee combat with no magical abilities, and he also has a very low base agility score, so he will often strike last out of all the party members. Ragnar is the last character to join the Hero in Chapter 5, having coincidentally set out to kill the Marquis de Leon (originally localized as Keeleon) at the same time the party arrives.
* {{nihongo|'''[[Tsarevna]] Alena'''|アリーナ姫|''Arîna Hime''|''Arlina'', ''originally localized as Princess Alena''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Tomboyish Princess of the Zamoksva (a Russian dialect English speaking land)&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (''originally localized as Santeem'') Kingdom. She is bored of the palace life and wishes to travel the world, much to the dismay of her father and his officials who urge her to act more like a woman instead of a tomboy. This could be due to the possibility that she had overheard her father discuss a dream he had with his chancellor and wishes to do something to ease his fears. She first appears in Chapter 2 but joins after the party cures Kiryl with a [[Feverfew]] Root (originally localized as "Padequia Root"). She is the classic Fighter or Martial Artist, preferring to use claws as a weapon though she can use other weapons as well.
* {{nihongo|'''Borya'''|ブライ|''Burai''|''originally localized as Brey''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Alena's tutor. He's a magician who travels with Alena to look after her because he promised her late mother to do so. He learns Ice attack magic, and more [[buff (computer gaming)|buff and debuff]] spells than Maya, such as ''Oomph'' and ''Acceleratle''; in the DS remake, he also learns ''Snoop'' (localized as ''MapMagic'' in other games in the series), a spell generally associated with the thief class which reveals the location of treasures. He first appears in Chapter 2, and he joins the party to search for a Feverfew Seed to cure Kiryl's sickness right away.
* {{nihongo|'''Kiryl'''|クリフト|''Kurifuto''|''Clift'', ''originally localized as Cristo''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A priest (originally localized as chancellor) that travels along with Alena and Borya, and has feelings for Alena (but she is oblivious to it)&lt;ref name="DQ4Site"&gt;{{cite web|author=Square-Enix |year=2008 |title=Dragon Quest IV (Official Site) |url=http://na.square-enix.com/dq4/ |work= |accessdate=June 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620055852/http://na.square-enix.com/dq4/ |archivedate=June 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He can use healing and support magic, as well as instant death spells. He first appears in Chapter 2, but is recruited in Chapter 5 after the Hero finds a rare Feverfew Seed to grow into a Feverfew Root and to cure his sickness.
* {{nihongo|'''[[Torneko|Torneko Taloon]]'''|トルネコ|''Toruneko''|''originally localized as Taloon''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A weapons merchant from Lakanaba (an Irish English speaking town), who wishes to open his own store. He first appears in Chapter 3. He is much like the Merchant class in other Dragon Quest games, however he also learns abilities used by Jesters, Thieves and Dancers in other games in the series, when he joins the Hero in Chapter 5 he sometimes performs a random action in battle, such as summoning an army of merchants, throwing sand in the enemy's eyes, tripping and scoring a critical hit on an enemy or stealing an item from an enemy. In the DS remake, he learns four non-combat spells: ''padfoot'', which reduces the encounter rate, ''eye for distance'', which locates the nearest town, ''nose for treasure'', which reveals the number of remaining treasures in the area, and ''whistle'', which causes a [[random encounter]].
* {{nihongo|'''Maya'''|マーニャ|''Mânya''|''originally localized as Mara''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A dancer who works in Lassize Fayre (originally localized as Monbaraba) and is originally from Aubout du Monde (originally localized as Kievs) who can use magic, primarily fire and explosion attack spells. Her father, Mahabala&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (originally localized as Edgar), died under mysterious circumstances. It is later revealed that he was murdered by Balzack, her father's apprentice, who was driven mad by the Secret of Evolution. She and her sister seek revenge. They both first appear in Chapter 4, and are the first to join the Hero in Chapter 5, after Meena reads the Hero's fortune.
* {{nihongo|'''Meena'''|ミネア|''Minea''|''originally localized as Nara''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Maya's younger sister. She is a fortune teller that can use healing spells and wind attack spells, as well as support spells. Unlike Kiryl or the hero, she cannot learn any multi-target healing spells other than the ''Kerplunk'' spell (which knocks her out to heal everyone else at once), but only she can use her Tarot weapon as a battle item to generate random effects, similar to the Chance (or ''Hocus Pocus'') spell in other DQ games. Meena reads the Hero's fortune in Endor and joins because of the unique destiny she read.
* {{nihongo|'''Psaro'''|ピサロ|''originally localized as Saro and Necrosaro}} A monster who is the main villain of Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 of the PlayStation and DS remakes, he is a recruitable party member, seeking revenge against Aamon. Like the Hero, Psaro is a fighter / spellcaster hybrid, with a mixture of attack, healing, buff and debuff magic, and the ability to wield powerful weapons and wear heavy armour. Furthermore, Psaro can learn various special attacks (originally introduced to the series in [[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation|Dragon Quest VI]]), and can use cursed equipment without penalty.

'''Non-Playable Characters:'''

These characters join the party temporarily. Unlike permanent party members, they cannot gain levels or [[experience point]]s, cannot change their equipment, and their actions in battle cannot be controlled through the ''Tactics'' command (instead, they are always lockd into their default AI mode).

* '''Healie''', a friendly Healslime who meets Ragnar during Chapter 1. He is an invaluable ally, providing free healing, saving Ragnar the trouble so he can concentrate on killing monsters. After Ragnar joins the party in Chapter 5, Healie can be seen in a human form in the courtyard of Keeleon Castle.
* '''Laurel''' &amp; '''Hardie''' (''originally localized as Laurent and Strom''), two mercenaries who Taloon can meet in Endor during Chapter 3. Hardie, a soldier, requests 400 Gold and simply uses a powerful physical attack each turn. Laurel, a magician, requests 600 and has a small, versatile magical repertoire along with an average physical attack which can cause paralysis. While unconnected story-wise, their naming in the DS remake is a nod to the early-20th century comedy duo, [[Laurel and Hardy]].
* '''Oojam''' (''originally localized as Orin''), he was a student of Maya and Meena's father that went into hiding after Balzack had killed his teacher. The girls seek him out during Chapter 4 to assist them in their quest for revenge. Oojam provides a powerful physical attack each turn, in addition to being able to pick locks. At the end of Chapter 4, Oojam appears to be mortally wounded fending off the guards of Palais de Léon (originally localized as Castle Keeleon) to allow Meena and Maya to escape, but it is revealed in Chapter 5 that a young woman who was fleeing the castle found him near-dead and managed to get him safely to the town of Vrenor so he can rest and recover.
* '''Hank Hoffman Junior''' (''originally localized as Hector''), a young man hanging out near Casabranca who is initially cold to people, having been betrayed by a friend. After the Hero finds the "Symbol of Faith" in a nearby cave, Hoffman offers to lend the party his services, and his wagon. He tags along for a short while until shortly after Torneko is recruited, then leaves his cart to the Hero so he can pursue his own endeavors in owning an inn. In the DS remake, he resurfaces later at the oasis where he opens up the "Immigrant Town" sidequest.
* '''Tom Foolery''' (''originally localized as Panon''), he is a performer who works at the same stage-house as Maya and Meena. While not particularly good at combat, Tom is necessary for one game mission which nets the Hero the Zenithian Helm.
* '''Orifiela''' (''originally localized as Lucia''), a Zenithian the party encounters at the Great World Tree, [[Yggdrasil]]. She needs the party to help her get back up to Zenithia, and provides the party with information regarding the Zenithian Sword.
* '''Sparkie''' (''originally localized as Doran''), a baby dragon found in Zenithia. Apparently, Zenithians have conducted research that suggests dragons mature faster than Zenithians do. He doesn't have great battle intelligence, but can occasionally mow down enemies or put them to sleep with a breath attack. In the remakes, he leaves the party once Rose is resurrected.

According to [[Yuji Horii]], he wanted to have something the player went around collecting as the previous ''Dragon Quest'' games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did not want to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game.&lt;ref name="Jump8"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:週刊少年ジャンプ|trans-title=[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]|volume=45|year=1989|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|location=Japan|language=Japanese|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist [[Akira Toriyama]], whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.&lt;ref name=techbuffalo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/10/11/history-of-dragon-quest-localizations-1989-to-2001/|title=History of Dragon Quest Localizations - 1989 to 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all the other games up to this point, the changes in this version were not as radical. Among them were the usual religious/violence censorship, new graphics for the opening copyright and ending credits, and the betting in the Casino was slightly modified to allow more money being won during a bet.

=== PlayStation remake ===

[[File:Dragon Quest IV remake.jpg|right|thumb|One of overworld areas of the PlayStation ''Dragon Quest IV'' remake]]

''Dragon Quest IV'' was [[enhanced remake|remade]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on November 22, 2001 in Japan. It was developed by [[Heartbeat (company)|Heartbeat]] and published by Enix. The remake was developed using ''Dragon Quest VII's'' 3D graphics engine. The characters, towns, world maps, sound, battles and enemies all received updates. The character sprites were updated to match the original artwork for the characters in the original ''Dragon Quest IV'' Manual and artwork.
With this remake came several new features. Among these features were a new chapter in which Psaro is available as a party member (as well as a prologue chapter), an intra-party talk command similar to ''Dragon Quest VII'', and the ability to turn off the artificial intelligence for party members to allow for direct control of their attacks (except UC Party Members). The game sold over one million copies in Japan by the end of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Witham, Joseph | date=December 12, 2001 | title=Enix Ships 1 Million Copies of Dragon Quest IV | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2001/121201b.html | work=RPGamer.com | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enix|Enix America]] originally planned to bring the remake to [[North America]] in 2002 and had even advertised this upcoming release on the back cover to the US instruction manual for ''Dragon Warrior VII'', but it was later canceled due to Heartbeat closing its video game development operations before the localization and translation could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN staff | date=August 22, 2001 | title=Dragon Quest IV Headed Stateside | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/097/097618p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Eric Malenfant |author2=Eve C. |author3=Nicole Kirk | year=2002 | title=Enix Interview With Justin Lucas | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e32k2-enix/index.html | work=RPGFan.com | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later explained that the cost and time that a different company would need to invest to complete the translation prevented Enix from passing this to another developer, as Heartbeat was the most familiar with their own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Dwaine Bullock | year=2005 | title=Dragon Warrior IV: The Explanation | url=http://www.dqshrine.com/features/dw4.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111214556/http://www.dqshrine.com/features/dw4.htm | archivedate=2009-01-11 | work= | accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nintendo DS remake ===

''Dragon Quest IV'' was later re-released for the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan in November 2007. The game has been remade into a 2D/3D hybrid, similar to the PlayStation version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Square Enix | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest 4 to 6 | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/dragonquest/4to6/ | work= | accessdate=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release has kept many of the enhancements from the PlayStation, such as the slightly altered immigrant town, but has received enhanced upgrades to smooth the graphics further, and improved sound. This release also allows players to take manual control of all of their party members in the final two chapters.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt;

Shortly after the Japanese release, several people editing the Japanese ROM file discovered a near complete English translation along with Spanish, French, German, and Italian translations already inside the Japanese game.&lt;ref name=discovered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/12/13/dragon-quest-iv-hides-a-partial-english-translation/|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=2016-06-08|date=2007-12-13|author=Spencer|title=Dragon Quest IV hides a partial English translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 2008, Square Enix applied for a trademark to the title "Chapters of the Chosen", and speculation began that this was the new subtitle to ''Dragon Quest IV'' for an American release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Spencer | year=2008 | title=Siliconera » Square Enix trademarks Chapters of the Chosen (update: Dragon Quest IV?) | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/04/16/square-enix-trademarks-chapters-of-the-chosen-any-guesses/ | work= | accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, ''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'' was found to have a rating of E10+ by the ESRB, for Alcohol Reference, Animated Blood, Mild Fantasy Violence, Mild Language, Simulated Gambling, and Suggestive Themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=ESRB| year=2008 | title=Entertainment Software Rating Board | url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp | work= | accessdate=April 18, 2008}} - May need to input ''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'' to get result&lt;/ref&gt; An official release date of September 16, 2008 was finally established on the official North American site.&lt;ref name="NADS"/&gt; The game was released in Europe under the title ''Dragon Quest: Chapters of the Chosen'', omitting the number IV in a similar fashion to the European version of [[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]].&lt;ref name="eurorelease"/&gt;

This version of the game contains an entirely new translation of the script.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; It was claimed in Nintendo Power that the new translation has changed the names of many of the main characters, weapons and towns to be closer to, or include their original Japanese names, while adding several new localizations,&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; yet an analysis of the location and character names indicates the original localization of ''Dragon Warrior IV'' was closer to the original Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year= | title=List of Name Changes in the Zenithia Trilogy | url=https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/List_of_Name_Changes_in_the_Zenithia_Trilogy | work=Dragon Quest Wiki | accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version also uses the new spell naming convention first used in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]]'', such as the spell ''Beat'' from ''Dragon Warrior IV'' becoming ''Whack''.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; The western translations have been slightly changed in places where the Japanese version included sexual components, and the Japanese version's party talk feature was completely excised from the western versions.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt;

=== Manga ===

A five volume manga called ''Dragon Quest: Princess Alena'' was released. It followed the story of Chapter 2, Alena's adventure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=Dragon Quest Manga |url=http://www.dqshrine.com/ma/other/ |work= |accessdate=September 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822182900/http://www.dqshrine.com/ma/other/ |archivedate=August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Beth | last=Cato | year=2003 | title=Besu's Dragon Quest Slime Shrine:Manga: Dragon Quest IV: | url=http://www.slimeshrine.net/manga/DQIVmanga.html | work= | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but begins to divert during the events in the Birdsong Tower. From this point forward, it introduces several new characters, including the evil Evil Leather [[Dominatrix]] Woman, and new locations, including an Arctic location and a haunted house. This story ends with Alena fighting Psaro and defeating him before he goes on with the Golden Bracelet to perfect the secret of evolution.

=== Soundtrack ===

As with every ''Dragon Quest'', [[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed the music and directed all the associated spinoffs. The song heard during gameplay depends on a number of factors. A specific track is always played for towns, another for caves or dungeons, another while the party is mounted on the hot air balloon, for instance. Lastly, while out in the world, each of the first four acts has its own theme song, as does the Hero—in act five, the theme song played depends on who is the first character in the formation.

The original ''Dragon Warrior IV'' was one of the few NES games to feature a ''[[crescendo]]'' during the battle music, a gradual increase in volume from soft to loud. This technique was rare for an NES game. However, the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions do not feature the crescendo in the battle music. This level of detail can be found in the NES version's soundtrack, as well as the 2014 Android and iOS mobile releases.

''Dragon Quest IV ~The People Are Shown the Way~ Symphonic Suite'' is a compilation of music from ''Dragon Quest IV''. The first print of the album was in 1990, the London Philharmonic version came out a year later, and a reprint of the original was released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lucy Rzeminski | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest IV soundtrack | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/dq4-ss/index.html | work= | accessdate=August 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragon Warrior IV'' was awarded "[[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Game Grand Prize]]", "Best RPG Game" and the "[[List of best-selling video games|Best-Seller Award]]" in ''[[Famitsu]]''{{'}}s 1990 awards, "Best Challenge" and 2nd place "Best Overall Game" in 1993 by ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.&lt;ref name="famitsu-award"&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.video/OccmuafYtzc Best Games of 1990], ''Famicom Tsushin''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NintendoPowerAwards"/&gt;

In August 2008, ''Nintendo Power'' ranked ''Dragon Warrior IV'' the 18th best [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game, describing it as the peak of the NES' ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series and praising it for its innovative five-act story that made it one of their favourite old-school role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 2008 |title= Best of the Best |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=231 |page= 71| publisher= Future USA, Inc| id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of ''[[Famitsu]]'' voted the game as the 14th best game of all time in a 2006 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Edge Staff | date=March 6, 2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/japan-votes-all-time-top-100/ | work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, critics noticed with interest that the game's third chapter, Torneko's, departed largely from standard RPGs by making the only goal to collect money and by allowing players to have Torneko simply working in an in-game store.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt;

In Japan, the original Famicom version sold 3.1 million units, it's the fourth best selling game of the system, below its predecessor, ''Dragon Quest III''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Famicom Software| url=https://sites.google.com/site/gamedatalibrary/software-by-platform/famicom| work=Game Data Library | accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million of its sales occurred in its first day of release.&lt;ref name=sales2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Westward, Ho!

"Ragnar McRyan is in no way a character designed off the back of some intense Japanese schoolgirl demographic focus testing", wrote [[Eurogamer]]'s Simon Parkin, pleased.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web | author=Parkin, Simon | title= Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen | date=September 15, 2008 | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dragon-quest-iv-chapters-of-the-chosen-review | work=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequels===
''Dragon Quest IV'' is the first game in the series to spawn spin-offs. The merchant [[Torneko]] (also known as Taloon in the NES version) was popular enough to star his own series, in which he finds himself in quests in order to expand his store. These games are the ''Torneko no Daibouken'' sub-series (translated as ''Torneko's Great Adventure''), [[roguelike]] and [[random dungeon]] games produced by [[Enix]] (and [[Square Enix]]) and developed by [[Chunsoft]]. The success of the games later inspired the creation of the ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' series.

Ragnar, Healie, and Torneko all later appear as cameos in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King#Development and release|Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King]]'' in the Monster Arena. Torneko later cameos in ''[[Dragon Quest: Shōnen Yangus to Fushigi no Dungeon|Dragon Quest Yangus]]'' as a merchant.

[[File:Shinzō Abe and Ivanka Trump (4).jpg|thumb|upright|Advisor to [[US President]] and businesswoman [[Ivanka Trump]] (right) along with [[Japanese Prime Minister|Japanese PM]] [[Shinzō Abe]] wearing Western-style [[business suit]]s, 2017]]

A '''dress code''' is a set of written and, more often, [[unwritten rule]]s with regard to [[clothing]]. Clothing, like other aspects of human [[physical appearance]], has a social significance, with different rules and expectations applying depending on circumstance and occasion. Within a single day, an individual may need to navigate between two or more dress codes. For example, many navigate between a home dress code and a work dress code; usually this ability is a result of cultural acclimatization.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} Different societies and cultures will have different dress norms, although [[Western dress codes]] are widely accepted as valid internationally.

The dress code has built in rules or signals indicating the message being given by a person's clothing and how it is worn. This message may include indications of the person's gender, [[income]], occupation and [[social class]], political, ethnic and religious affiliation, [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] towards comfort, fashion, traditions, gender expression, marital status, sexual availability, and sexual orientation, etc. Clothes convey other social messages including the stating or claiming [[Identity (social science)|personal]] or [[cultural identity]], the establishing, maintaining, or defying [[group (sociology)|social group]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], and appreciating comfort and functionality.

For example, wearing expensive clothes of high quality can communicate [[wealth]] or the [[image]] of wealth. The observer sees the expensive clothes, but may misinterpret the extent to which these factors apply to the wearer. Clothing can convey a social message, even if none is intended: if the receiver's code of interpretation differs from the sender's code of communication, misinterpretation follows. However clothes may be worn because they are comfortable and practical, not to convey a message.

In every culture, current [[fashion]] governs how clothing is constructed, assembled, and worn to convey a social message. The rate of change of fashion varies, clothes and its accessories within months or days, especially in small social groups or in communications media-influenced modern societies. More extensive changes, requiring more time, money, and effort to effect, may span generations. When fashion changes, the messages communicated by clothing change.

==History==
{{expand section|date=November 2015}}

===Europe===
{{Western dress codes}}
{{See also|Western dress codes|Sumptuary laws}}
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[:Category:European nobility|European royalty and nobility]] used a dress code to differentiate themselves from other classes of people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===The Americas===
The [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] had a complex social structure, including slaves, commoners, and nobles, and dress codes to indicate these social distinctions. [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] in 1802-1805, describes how, after some time living there, [[Maquinna]] and the chiefs decided that he must now be "considered one of them, and conform to their customs". Jewitt resented the imposition of this dress code, finding the loose untailored garments very cold, and attributed to them a subsequent illness of which he almost died. He was not allowed to cut his hair, and had to paint his face and body as a Nootka would.&lt;ref&gt;''A Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''[http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/mtq?id=328920feff&amp;doc=90038 digital full text here] p161 onwards&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender===
{{See also|Cross-dressing}}
In most traditions, certain types of clothing are worn exclusively or predominantly by either men or women. For example, long sleeves are common for both genders, and while the wearing of a knee-  
to floor-length [[skirt]] or a knee- to floor-length [[dress]] tends to be associated with female dress, ankle-length [[trousers]] are associated with male dress. [[Hairdressing]] in some societies may also conform to a dress code, such as long hair for women and short hair for men.

===Social status===

[[File:Prokudin-Gorskii-19.jpg|thumb|[[Mohammed Alim Khan|Emir Alim Khan]]'s bemedalled [[robe]] communicates a social message]]

[[File:Ming Dynasty royal attire.jpg|thumb|160px|Formal attire for the Emperor and Empress of the [[Ming Dynasty]] of China&lt;ref&gt;Note that the golden-colored YiShanGuan (翼善冠, lit. 'Winged Crown of Philanthropy') the male model wears is historically incorrect: according to archaeological findings at the Tomb of [[Wanli Emperor]] (明定陵, ''MingDingLing'', lit. 'The Mausoleum of Tranquility of Ming') - the golden version of YiShanGuan was only worn by deceased emperors as part of the burial ritual; a living emperor on the other hand, always wore the YiShanGuan made of black silk with decorative jewels and dragons, therefore a 'black' version of it instead of gold. A historical fact not widely known in modern day China, thus the misrepresentation of the Ming Royal Attire in the photo above.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In many societies, particular clothing may be a [[status symbol]], reserved or affordable to people of high rank. For example, in [[Ancient Rome]] only senators were permitted to wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]; and, in [[Culture of the Native Hawaiians|traditional Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and [[palaoa]] or carved whale teeth. In [[China]] before the establishment of the republic, only the emperor could wear yellow.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

In 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, “School uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.” Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By requiring students to wear a school [[uniform]] they are less likely to have something to make fun of other students for. This would cause the students to get to know one another by their personality and who they really are rather than the clothes they wear.

===Occupation===
Military, police, and firefighters usually wear [[uniform]]s, as do workers in many industries. School children often wear [[school uniform]]s, while college and university students sometimes wear [[academic dress]]. Members of religious orders may wear uniforms known as [[religious habit|habits]]. Sometimes a single item of clothing or a single accessory can declare one's occupation or rank within a profession

===Ethnic and political affiliation===
In many regions of the world, [[national costume]]s and styles in clothing and ornament declare membership in a certain village, caste, religion, etc. A Scotsman declares his clan with his [[tartan]]. A French peasant woman identified her village with her cap or [[coif]]. A Palestinian woman identifies her village with the pattern of [[Palestinian handicrafts#Embroidery and weaving|embroidery]] on her [[Palestinian costumes|dress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dispossessed: The Ordeal of the Palestinians |last=Gilmour |first=David |year=1983 |publisher=Sphere Books |location=London |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes can also proclaim dissent from cultural norms and mainstream beliefs, as well as personal independence. In 19th-century Europe, artists and writers lived ''[[Bohemianism|la vie de Bohème]]'' and dressed to shock: [[George Sand]] in men's clothing, female emancipationists in [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]], male artists in velvet [[waistcoat]]s and gaudy neckcloths. [[Bohemianism|Bohemians]], [[beatnik]]s, [[hippie]]s, [[Goth subculture|Goths]], [[Punk subculture|Punks]], and [[Skinhead]]s have continued the ([[counter-culture|countercultural]]) tradition in the 20th-century [[Western Culture|West]].

===Religious affiliation===
[[File:TiraMarket.jpg|thumb|Mannequins with traditional Muslim [[veil]] at a Saturday market in [[Tira, Israel]].]]
A [[Jewish]] or [[Muslim]] man may display his religious affiliation by wearing a [[cap]] and other traditional clothing. Many Muslim women wear head or body coverings (see [[sartorial hijab]], [[hijab]], [[burqa]] or [[niqab]], [[chador]], and [[abaya]]) that proclaim their status as respectable women and cover the so-called [[Intimate parts in Islam|intimate parts]]. A [[Jew]]ish man may indicate his observance of [[Judaism]] by wearing a [[kippah]].

===Marital status===
{{See also|Visual markers of marital status}}

Traditionally, [[Hindu]] women wear ''[[sindoor]]'', a red powder, in the parting of their hair to indicate their married status; if widowed, they abandon ''sindoor'' and jewelry and wear simple white clothing. However, this is not true of all Hindu women; in the modern world this is not a norm and women without sindoor may not necessarily be unmarried.

In many [[Orthodox Jewish]] circles, married women wear head coverings such as a hat, [[snood (headgear)|snood]], or wig. Additionally, after their marriage, Jewish men of [[Ashkenazi]] descent begin to wear a [[talit]] during prayer.

Men and women of the Western world may wear [[wedding ring]]s to indicate their married status, and women may also wear [[engagement ring]]s when they are engaged.

==Laws and social norms==
{{Main|Clothing laws by country}}
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
[[File:DDR Nude Beach model.jpg|thumb|Model of a nude beach in the DDR Museum, Berlin]]
In [[New Guinea]] and [[Vanuatu]], there are areas where it is customary for the men to wear nothing but penis sheaths in public - this is uncommon in more developed areas. Women wear [[string skirt]]s. In remote areas of [[Bali]], women may go [[toplessness|topless]]. In America and some parts of Europe, there are [[nude beach]]es.

In the [[United States]], a few businesses or [[restaurant]]s display dress code signs requiring shoes and shirts, claiming to be there on account of a health code,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} although no such health codes exist.&lt;ref name="barefoot society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barefooters.org/health-dept/ |title=Bare Feet and the Health Department |publisher=Barefooters.org |date=2010-01-24 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is a common belief that there are laws against driving barefoot. However, no such laws exist. It is quite uncommon for people to be nude in public in the [[United States]] and in many circumstances, it is illegal. Many states and cities have laws and ordinances for [[indecent exposure]] and sometimes nudity can overlap with [[disorderly conduct]]. However, there are a few private beaches and resorts that cater to people who wish to be naked.

The “Free the Nipple Movement” is a global campaign seeking equality and empowerment for women when it comes to dress code. It emerged as a reaction to the idea that it was socially acceptable for men to appear without a shirt in public, whereas a woman appearing topless in public would be construed as indecent. The states of New York, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Ohio, and Texas have made it legal for both men and women to appear topless in public. The remainder of states consider the exposure of the female nipple to be an act of indecent exposure, putting them in a position where they can be charged with a criminal offense. This appears to be a gendered law that promotes different expectations on how a person is expected to dress when in public.

The Gender Nondiscrimination Act prohibits employers, health care providers, and housing authorities from discriminating against people on the basis of gender. While employers are not able to discriminate in their hiring practices, they do have the ability to create a gendered uniform. Employers cannot force someone to wear a uniform for a gender they do not identify themselves as, but this becomes an issue for non binary gendered people. In society, clothing is marketed by gender and dressing across this established line is often construed as an anomaly. Skirts, dresses, and high heels are clothing marketed almost exclusively for women. If a man wore any of these pieces in public it would be seen as outside of the norm.

==Private dress codes==
{{See also|shoe#etiquette|mourning|Sharia}}

[[File:LondonClubDressCode bordercropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Dress code for a private club in [[Soho]], [[London]]]]

Private organisations may insist on particular dress codes or standards in particular situations.

*Religious bodies may insist on their standards of [[modesty]] being followed at their premises and events.
*Employees are sometimes required to wear a [[uniform]] or certain standards of dress, such as a business suit or tie. This may depend on particular situations, for example if they are expected to interact with customers. (see also [[International standard business attire]]) These policies vary depending on the industry with [[lawyers]], [[bankers]], and [[Executive (management)|executives]] often wearing suit and tie. Some work places require that [[tattoo]]s be covered.
*Patrons of a [[disco]] or [[nightclub]] are sometimes expected to dress in a particular style, such as [[clubwear]]; and [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]]s of a disco or nightclub at times refuse entrance to those whose clothing they consider not consistent with the atmosphere of the venue.
*Patrons of a [[casino]], shop, or restaurant are usually expected to dress to a minimum standard, such as [[smart casual]].
*The organisers of some parties sometimes specify a costume or theme for the event, such as a [[naked party]] or [[toga party]].
*[[Fetish club]]s often require patrons to dress in [[fetish fashion|fetish clothing]] or else all in black.

Dress codes function on certain social occasions and for certain jobs. A [[military]] institution may require specified [[uniform]]s; if it allows the wearing of plain clothes it may place restrictions on their use.

A "formal" or [[white tie]] dress code typically means tail-coats for men and full-length evening dresses for women. "Semi-formal" has a much less precise definition but typically means an evening jacket and tie for men (known as [[black tie]]) and a dress for women. "Business casual" typically means not wearing [[necktie]]s or [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s, but wearing instead collared shirts, and more ''country'' trousers (not black, but more ''relaxed'', including things such as [[corduroy]]). "Casual" typically just means clothing for the torso, legs and shoes. "Wedding Casual" defines yet another mode of dress, where guests dress respectfully, but not necessarily fancily. The [[uniform]] may consist of various items that are appropriate length and style depending on what the school suggests: for example, khaki pants or [[shorts]], plaid skirts, a button-up collared shirt, a sweater, a [[coat (clothing)|coat]] and [[necktie|tie]] and even [[socks]]. Some schools have each grade assigned a color type which communicates what grade the student is currently in. That way if a student is lost someone is able to figure out what [[educational stage|grade]] they are in just by looking at the color of their shirt. If the student is younger, older students and faculty are able to look out for them and make sure they are safe.
Organisations which seek to maintain standards of [[modesty]] have difficulties with [[Sheer fabric|sheer]] and [[see-through clothing]].

Dress codes usually set a lower limit on body covering. However, sometimes it can specify the opposite: for example, in UK gay jargon, ''dress code'', means people who dress in a militaristic manner. ''Dress code'' nights in nightclubs, and elsewhere, are deemed to specifically target people who have militaristic fetishes (e.g. leather/[[skinhead]] men).

==Education==

=== History in school ===
Dress codes were first implemented in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to create a safer and more professional environment. Even though dress code was created to positively affect schools, the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the Tinker vs. Des Moines Independent School District. The case was held because students wore black armbands to protest the Vietnam war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===
In some grade schools, students are prevented from wearing short shorts, leggings, crop tops, saggy pants, and other clothing items that are deemed "too revealing" or "inappropriate".

In colleges, the most common type of dress code is business casual, but most colleges don't have dress code requirements.

===Non-communicative and communicative===
Non-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name="Herbon, Beth 2000"&gt;Herbon, Beth, and Jane E. Workman. "Dress and Appearance Codes in Public Secondary School Handbooks." Journal of Family &amp; Consumer Sciences 92.5 (2000): 68-76.&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative dress code violations are violations of an explicit nature, where the clothing has implications of hate, violence, gang-affiliation, etc.&lt;ref name="Herbon, Beth 2000" /&gt;

===Dress code violations and the courts===
In cases where dress code rules in public school systems have been violated by noncommunicative clothing, courts repeatedly legitimise dress code discrimination based on [[gender]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Natalie 2012"&gt;Smith, Natalie. "Eliminating Gender Stereotypes in Public School Dress Codes: The Necessity of Respecting Personal Preference." ''Journal of Law &amp; Education''; 41.1 (2012): 251-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst the [[transgender]] populations, gender based dress codes are primarily enforced against individuals who do not yet [[Passing (gender)|pass]].&lt;ref name="Smith, Natalie 2012"/&gt;

White collar work place clothing has changed significantly through the years. In a corporate office, appropriate clothes are clean, business casual clothes such as (for men) a [[dress shirt]], [[polo shirt]], and [[trousers]], or other similar outfits. [[Suit (clothing)|Suit]]s, [[neckties]], and other formal wear are usually only required in law offices and financial sector offices. Previous business dress code eras (the 1950s in the U.S.) featured standardized business clothes that strongly differentiated what was acceptable and unacceptable for men and women to wear while working. Today, the two styles have merged; women's work clothes expanded to include the suit (and its variants) in addition to the usual dresses, skirts, and blouses; men's clothes have expanded to include garments and bright colours. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Casual wear entered business culture with the advent of the Silicon Valley, California, technology company featuring casual work clothes on the job. Additionally, some companies set aside days — generally Fridays ("dress-down Friday", "[[casual Friday]]") — when workers may wear casual clothes. The clothing a company requires its worker to wear on the job varies with the occupation and profession.

Some businesses observe that anti-discrimination law restricts their determining what is appropriate and inappropriate workplace clothing. Requiring men and women to dress differently at the workplace can be challenged because the gender-specific dress codes would be based on one sex and could be considered stereotypical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/tools-and-samples/toolkits/pages/employeedressandappearance.aspx|website=Society for Human Resource Management|accessdate=27 September 2017|title = Employee Dress and Appearance}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, in fact, most businesses have much authority in determining and establishing what work place clothes they can require of their workers. Generally, a carefully drafted dress code applied consistently does not violate anti-discrimination laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm |title = Dress Code Legal Issues|website =  Personnel Policy Services Inc|last = Thomas|first = Robin|dead-url = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160314064207/http://www.ppspublishers.com/biz/dresscode.htm|archivedate = 14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business casual===
{{Main|Business casual}}
[[File:Obama 013.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|[[Barack Obama]] in what can be considered as men's Business Casual, 2010]]

''Business casual'' dress, also "smart casual", is a popular work place dress code that emerged in [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]] in the 1990s, especially in the United States and Canada. Many [[information technology]] businesses in [[Silicon Valley]] were early adopters of this dress code. In contrast to formal business wear such as [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s and [[necktie]]s (the [[international standard business attire]]), the business casual dress code has no generally accepted definition; its interpretation differs widely among organizations and is often a cause of sartorial confusion among workers.

The [[job search engine]] [[Monster.com]] offers this definition: ''In general, business casual means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together''. A more pragmatic definition is that business casual dress is the mid ground between formal business clothes and street clothes. Examples of clothing combinations considered appropriate for work by businesses that consider themselves as using the business-casual dress code are:

*for men: a shirt with a collar ([[polo shirt]]) and [[cotton]] [[trousers]] (or "khakis" in [[American English]]).
*for women: a tennis shirt and trousers.

Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies — some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.

==Inverse dress codes==
Inverse dress codes, sometimes referred to as "[[undress code]]", set forth an upper bound, rather than a lower bound, on body covering. An example of an undress code is the one commonly enforced in modern communal bathing facilities. For example, in the public bath [[SchwabenQuellen]], no clothing of any kind is allowed in the sauna part of the resort. Other, less strict undress codes are common in public pools, especially indoor pools, in which shoes and shirts are disallowed.

Places where [[social nudity]] is practiced may be "clothing optional," or nudity may be compulsory, with exceptions. See [[issues in social nudity]].

==Violation of clothing taboos==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2017}}
Some clothing ''faux pas'' may occur intentionally for reasons of [[fashion]] or personal [[preference]]. People have the right to express themselves in freedom of speech and expression under the first amendment; however, some styles of clothing that people may chose to wear can be seen as taboos or violations. Dress codes are a way that public schools try to limit violence and danger in the classroom and at the school, as stated by Sue M. Stanley, a professor at California State University, Long Beach, in the journal of Education and Urban Society. She says how clothing styles, such as gang clothing, are linked with violence in schools. She believes that dress codes and uniforms will reduce the focus on fashion contests and violence and instead promote ideas and achievements. Violations of clothing taboos, such as students wearing gang clothing or intentionally baggy clothing, can be viewed as unsafe by administrators. However, these students are just expressing themselves in their style and fashion. For instance, the [[adolescence|teenage]] boys of [[hip hop#Culture|rap]] duo [[Kris Kross]] of the early 1990s wore all of their clothes backwards and extremely baggy. Just because the boys of the rap duo Kris Kross wore their clothing like this it did not make them dangerous. Rather, they were just trying to be different and break common fashion “rules” to express themselves. Limiting students to only wear certain things or uniforms because of fashion taboos is a violation against their freedom of expression. As stated by Paul M. Murphy, a lawyer and writer for the Southern California Law Review, in the article “Restricting Gang Clothing in Public Schools: Does a Dress Code Violate a Student's Right of Free Expression” in the Southern California Law Review, as an attempt to keep schools safe, administrators are prohibiting students from wearing gang related clothing. However this is a violation of the first amendment which is the freedom of speech and expression, says Paul M. Murphy.
There can be different clothing styles that can be viewed as taboo for different age groups and genders to wear as well. For example, for older women to wear brighter colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing is seen as a clothing taboo for this era of women. This information was taken from a survey done by the journal of Ageing and Society, where they had 36 women from the ages 71 to 93 say what clothes they usually don't wear, to see what their perspective on clothing and different styles are for their age group. The majority of women said that they refrain from wearing styles such as bright colors and revealing or overly suggestive clothing. The women view these styles as taboo for their age, however that does not mean that one can not wear these clothing styles if they are in this age group.
There are different clothing brands and stores that can be seen as taboo as well. In a study done in the journal of Middle East Technical University Studies in Development, researchers took 300 participants in an emerging market context to see the effects of different styles and brands on the participants. The results were that customers were becoming less predictable and more diverse in their brands and clothing stores than before. This shows how people have lots of different styles of clothing and fashion, and how that is making clothing taboos become less common and not seen as a restriction.

==Rebellion against dress codes==
{{Example farm|section|date=December 2017}}
Social attitudes to clothing have brought about various rules and social conventions, such as keeping the body covered, and not showing underwear in public. The backlash against these social norms has become a traditional form of rebellion. An example of rebellion of general, universal dress codes is cross dressing. Cross dressing is defined as wearing clothing typical of the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cloud|first1=Duane|title=What is Cross Dressing?|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-cross-dressing-definition-psychology.html|website=Study.com|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a rebellion to dress codes, because it goes against most social norms of a general dress code for men and women. Also over time, western societies have gradually adopted more casual dress codes in the workplace, school, and leisure. This has especially been the case since the early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

On Monday, September 22, 2014, "about 100 pupils walked out of Bingham high school in South Jordan, Utah."&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Rory|title=Students protest 'slut shaming' high school dress codes with mass walkouts|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/24/us-high-schools-dress-codes-protest-sexism-hemline|website=The Guardian|accessdate=8 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students staged a walkout because more than a dozen girls were turned away from a [[homecoming dance]] for wearing dresses which violated the dress code rules.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; "School staff allegedly lined up girls against a wall as they arrived and banished about two dozen for having dresses which purportedly showed too much skin and violated the rules." It is believed that this act was awkward and humiliating towards the female students, which spawned the walkouts.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

Certain dress code restrictions in schools across North America are believed to be perpetuating sexist standards, since they concentrate specifically on females and what they are and are not allowed to wear. There is also an emphasis placed on the effects that girls’ wardrobe choices have on their male classmates, which is seen by some as inappropriate. In March 2014, a group of middle-school girls from Evanston, Illinois protested their school's dress code, which prohibited them from wearing leggings to school under the pretense that it was “too distracting for boys.” Thirteen-year-old student, Sophie Hasty, was quoted in the Evanston Review saying that “not being able to wear leggings because it’s ‘too distracting for boys’ is giving us the impression we should be guilty for what guys do.” In a Time magazine article covering the incident, Eliana Dockterman argued that teachers and administration in these schools are “walking the fine line between enforcing a dress code and slut shaming.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Enforcing School Dress Codes Turns Into Slut Shaming|url=http://time.com/36997/when-enforcing-school-dress-codes-turns-into-slut-shaming/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-11-16|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a similar incident occurred at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, New York. Within the first few days of the semester, two hundred detention slips were handed out to students who violated the school's dress code. Approximately ninety percent of the slips distributed were given to girls as their clothing was deemed “disruptive to teaching and learning.” Many claim that making girls feel guilty for the actions of boys is similar to telling victims of sexual assault that they were “asking for it” by dressing in a particular manner and has thus been linked to the practice of victim-blaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools Are Still Slut-Shaming Girls While Enforcing Dress Code|url=http://time.com/3394549/dress-code-long-island-new-york/|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-11-16|first=Eliana|last=Dockterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Canadian teenager, Lauren Wiggins, was given detention in May 2015 for wearing a floor-length dress with a halter neckline. The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school's assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy "will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control." She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/lauren-wiggins-haltar-top_n_7284528.html|title=High Schooler Lauren Wiggins' Letter Nails Exactly What's Wrong With School Dress Codes|date=14 May 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edible art''' refers to food created to be art. It is distinguished from [[Edible Arrangements]] (which predominantly consist of fruit) because it is usually more elaborate [[dessert]] food. A common form of edible art is [[wedding]] cakes, but options for artistic confections range far beyond marital celebrations. Cakes made into art include [[birthday]] cakes, cakes for [[baby showers]], for [[graduation]] celebrations, and many other types of event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swipely.com/blog/marketing-cakes-how-bakeries-can-promoting-custom-cake-designs-even-better/|title=Marketing Cakes: How Bakeries Can Promote Custom Cake Designs Even Better|website=Swipely.com|date=2012-03-09|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each piece looks unique, even if created for the same event, because each creator has their own idea in mind when creating their food art.

== As an art ==
Each [[graphic art]]ist has their own set of skills in creating their work, but there are several basic starting points for edible dessert art. Most edible art franchises have [[Sheet cake|sheet cakes]], cut-out sheet cakes, [[Layer cake|layered cakes]], sculpted cakes, and tiered cakes to choose from as a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confectionarychalet.com/docs/?page_id=146|title=History of Cake Decorating|author=Flinn, Christine|website=ConfectionaryChalet.com|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One common technique is to [[airbrush]] the piece with [[sugar]] to enhance its features. Many artists in this field have a degree in [[fine arts]],{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} and participate in [[freelance]] decorating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningpath.org/articles/Becoming_a_Cake_Artist_Job_Description_Salary_Information.html|title= Becoming a Cake Artist: Job Description &amp; Salary Information|website=LearningPath.org|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Many edible art shops and edible art artists make pieces relating to popular children's [[movies]], [[books]], and [[television shows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivergrimsley.com/2014/07/cake-decorators-dilemma-to-make-or-not-to-make-that-character-cake/|title=Cake Decorators' Dilemma — To Make Or Not To Make That Character Cake?|author=Grimsley, Kim|date=2014-07-30|website=OliverGrimsley.com|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FairShare''' is an idea for a voluntary [[investment]]-based [[patronage]] system to replace [[patents]] and [[copyright]] while still ensuring that artists are fairly compensated.  It was designed by [[Freenet]] creator [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]], [[Steven Starr]] and Rob Kramer in 2000, in response to allegations that artists would not receive adequate compensation for their work without enforceable copyrights. Starr came up with the name.

In the FairShare system, the investor/patrons would provide [[venture capital]].  Clarke envisions that 45% of the money invested in a given artist would go directly to that artist, while another 45% would be given to previous investors.  The remaining 10% would be kept by the maintainers of each FairShare service company.

In some ways this model is similar to a [[pyramid scheme]], but Clarke counters that a vital difference is that nobody would be promised a return on their investment.  He argues that regardless of any profits, each patron would have the satisfaction of knowing that they supported an artist whose work they appreciate.  Also, earlier investors would profit more, thus rewarding them for investing in artists before they became more popular.  The early investors would serve a similar role to studios' talent scouts.

[[File:She (colorized).jpg|thumb|right|The 1935 [[fantasy film]] ''[[She (1935 film)|She]]'', colorized.]]

'''Film colorization''' (or '''colourisation''') is any process that adds color to [[black-and-white]], [[sepia tone|sepia]], or other monochrome moving-picture images. It may be done as a special effect, to "modernize" black-and-white films, or to restore color films. The first examples date from the early 20th century, but colorization has become common with the advent of [[digital image processing]].

==Early techniques==

===Hand colorization===
{{expand section|date=October 2011}}
{{see also|List of early color feature films}}
The first film colorization methods were hand done by individuals. For example, at least 4% of [[George Méliès]]'s output, including some prints of ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' from 1902 and other major films such as ''[[The Kingdom of the Fairies]]'', ''[[The Impossible Voyage]]'', and ''[[The Barber of Seville (1904 film)|The Barber of Seville]]'' were individually hand-colored by [[Elisabeth Thuillier]]'s coloring lab in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yumibe|2012|pp=71–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified; each worker was assigned a different color in [[assembly line]] style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies of ''A Trip to the Moon'', but only one copy is known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wemaere|Duval|2011|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-length feature film made by a hand-colored process was ''[[The Miracle (1912 film)|The Miracle]]'' of 1912.

The process was always done by hand, sometimes using a [[stencil]] cut from a second print of the film, such as the [[Pathécolor]] process. As late as the 1920s, hand coloring processes were used for individual shots in ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' (1924) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925) (both utilizing the [[Handschiegl color process]]); and rarely, an entire feature-length movie such as ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1925 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1925) and ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1926 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1926).

These colorization methods were employed until effective [[color motion picture film|color film processes]] were developed. During the late 1960s and the early 1970s, black-and-white ''[[Betty Boop]]'', ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'', and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoons were redistributed in color. Supervised by [[Fred Ladd]], color was added by tracing the original black-and-white frames onto new animation [[cel]]s, and then adding color to the new cels in [[South Korea]]. To cut time and expense, Ladd's process skipped every other frame, cutting the frame rate in half; this technique considerably degraded the quality and timing of the original animation, to the extent that some animation was not carried over or mistakenly altered. The most recent redrawn colorized black-and-white cartoons are the [[Fleischer Studios]]/[[Famous Studios]]' ''[[Popeye the Sailor (animated cartoons)|Popeye]]'' cartoons, the [[Harman-Ising]] ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'', and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]]'s ''[[The Captain and the Kids (MGM animated series)|The Captain and the Kids]]'' cartoons, which were colorized in 1987 for airing on the [[Turner Entertainment|Turner]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cztoondb.tripod.com/cztoondb/laddqaart.htm |title=The colorized cartoon database |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522113108/http://cztoondb.tripod.com/cztoondb/laddqaart.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With computer technology, studios were able to add color to black-and-white films by digitally tinting single objects in each frame of the film until it was fully colorized (the first authorized computer-colorizations of B&amp;W cartoons were commissioned by [[Warner Bros.]] in 1990). The initial process was invented by Canadian [[Wilson Markle]] and was first used in 1970 to add color to monochrome footage of the moon from the [[Apollo program]] missions.

===Digital colorization===
Computerized colorization began in the 1970s using the technique invented by Wilson Markle. These early attempts at colourisation have soft contrast and fairly pale, flat, washed-out color; however, the technology improved steadily since the 1980s.

To perform digital colorization, a digitized copy of the best [[monochrome| black and white]] film print available is used. Technicians, with the aid of computer software, associate a range of gray levels to each object, and indicate to the computer any movement of the objects within a shot. The software is also capable of sensing variations in the light level from frame-to-frame and correcting it if necessary. The technician selects a color for each object based on (1) common "memory" colors such as blue sky, white clouds, flesh tones and green grass, and (2) based on any known information about the movie. If color publicity stills or props from the movie are available to examine, authentic colors may be applied. (3) In the absence of any better information, the technician may choose a color which they feel fits the gray level and is consistent with what a director might have chosen for the scene. The computer software then associates a variation of the basic color with each gray level in the object, while keeping intensity levels the same as in the monochrome original. The software then follows each object from frame to frame, applying the same color until the object leaves the frame. As new objects come into the frame, the technician must associate colors to each new object in the same way as described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=colorization |title=COLORIZATION |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was patented in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/1291260/summary.html  |title=Canadian Intellectual Property Office |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major obstacle with this method is it is highly labour-intensive. In order to colourise a still image, an artist typically begins by dividing the image into regions, and then assigning a color to each region. This approach, also known as the [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] method, is laborious, as the process of dividing the picture into correct segments is time-consuming. This occurs primarily when there have been no fully automatic [[algorithm]]s to identify fuzzy or complex region boundaries, such as between a subject's hair and face. Colorization of moving images also requires tracking regions as movement occurs from one frame to the next ([[motion compensation]]). Several companies claim to have produced automatic region-tracking algorithms.

Legend Films describes their core technology as pattern recognition and background compositing which moves and morphs foreground and background masks from frame to frame. In the process, backgrounds are colorized separately in a single composite frame which functions as a visual database of a cut, and includes all offset data on each camera movement. Once the foreground areas are colourised, background masks are applied frame-to-frame.

Timebrush describes a process based on [[Artificial neural network|neural net]] technology which produces saturated and crisp colors with clear lines and no apparent spill-over. The process is cost effective, as it relies on computer, rather than human effort, and is equally suitable for low-budget colorization, as well as broadcast-quality, or theatrical projection.

A team at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]'s Benin School of Computer Science and Engineering describe their method as an interactive process which does not require precise, manual, region detection, nor accurate tracking, and is based on the premise that adjacent pixels in space and time which have similar gray levels, should also have similar colors. At the [[University of Minnesota]], a color propagation method was developed which uses [[Distance (graph theory)|geodesic distance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moon.felk.cvut.cz/~sykorad/literature.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106161817/http://moon.felk.cvut.cz/~sykorad/literature.html |archivedate=2010-11-06 |title=Annotation of colorization methods |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author=Daniel Sýkora |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A highly labor-intensive process, employed by the UK-based film and video colorization artist [[Stuart Humphryes]] in conjunction with video restoration company SVS Resources, was employed by the [[BBC]] in 2013 for the commercial release of two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serials;  the first episode of ''[[The Mind of Evil]]'' and newly discovered black and white footage in the director's cut of ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]''. For these projects, approximately 7,000 key-frames (approximately every 5th [[PAL]] video frame) were fully colorized by hand, without the use of masks, layers or the [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] method. These were then utilised by SVS Resources to interpolate the colour across the intervening surrounding frames using a part computerized/part manual process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://babelcolour.com/dvd-work/mind-of-evil/ |title=Babelcolour Video Colourisation |accessdate=2013-11-15 |author= |authorlink=Stuart Humphryes |date=8 May 2013 |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''Algorithmia'' released a free, online colourisation service. Although sample limited, the service uses [[Artificial neural network|neural nets]] with [[artificial intelligence]] which is trained on colourised images that are fed to [[Deep learning|deep]] [[generative adversarial networks]] along with automatically generated [[grayscale]].[http://demos.algorithmia.com/colorize-photos/]

==Uses of colorization==

===Partial colorization===
The earliest form of colorization introduced limited color into a black-and-white film using dyes, as a visual effect.  The earliest Edison films, most notably the ''[[Annabelle Serpentine Dance]]'' series, were also the earliest examples of colorization, done by painting [[aniline]] dyes onto the emulsion.

Around 1905, [[Pathé]] introduced ''Pathéchrome'', a stencil process that required cutting one or more stencils for each film frame with the aid of a reducing [[pantograph]].

In 1916, the [[Handschiegl Color Process]] was invented for [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s film ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1917). Another early example of the Handschiegl process can be found in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925), in which [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s character can be seen wearing a bright-red cape while the rest of the scene remained monochrome. The scene was toned sepia, and then the cape was painted red, either by stencil or by matrix. Then, a sulfur solution was applied to everything but the dyed parts, turning the sepia into blue tone. The process was named after its inventor, Max Handschiegl. This effect, as well as a missing color sequence, were recreated in 1996 for a [[Photoplay Productions]] restoration by computer colorization (see below).

Partial colorization has also been utilized on footage shot in color to enhance commercials and broadcast television to further facilitate the director's artistic vision. As an example, [[Cerulean Fx]] provided partial colorization for [[Dave Matthews Band]]'s music video ''[[The Space Between]]'' as well as [[Outkast]]'s music videos ''[[Bombs Over Baghdad]]'' and ''[[roses (OutKast song)|Roses]]''.

===Restoration===
{{Main article|Colour recovery}}

A number of British television shows which were made in color in the early 1970s were [[wiping|wiped]] for economic reasons, but in some cases black-and-white [[telerecording]]s were made for export to countries that did not yet have [[color television]]. An example is the [[BBC]]'s five-part ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]''. Only one episode survived in color; the rest existed only as black-and-white film recordings. The only known color recording was a poor-quality over-the-air recording of an abridged broadcast in the United States. In the 1990s the BBC colorized the black-and-white copies by adding the color signal from the over-the-air recordings. The result was judged a success by both technicians and fans. In March 2008, it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/mar/06/research.bbc |title=Putting colour back in the Doctor's cheeks |accessdate=2008-03-14 |author=Charles Norton |authorlink= |date=6 March 2008 |work= |publisher=The Guardian |pages=  |quote= | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; that new technology, which involves detecting color artifacts ("[[dot crawl]]") in high-resolution scans of black-and-white films, will be used to restore other ''Who'' episodes as well as shows like ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' where some episodes originally produced in color only exist in black-and-white. However, there are no plans to use colorization on BBC programmes originally ''produced'' in black-and-white, such as the 1960s ''Who'' episodes since they have no color information available and so cannot be recovered using these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.restoration-team.co.uk/ |title=Doctor Who Restoration Team Official Site |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}

Colorization is also sometimes used on historical [[stock footage]] in color movies. For instance, the film ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' uses colorized news footage from the time of the [[Cuban missile crisis]] of 1962.

The full-color feature film ''[[Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow]]'' (2004), which already made heavy use of digitally generated sets and objects, integrated black-and-white 1940s footage of Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] into scenes by colorizing him.

In his feature film, ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2005), Martin Scorsese seamlessly blended colorized stock footage of the ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' movie premiere with footage of the premiere's re-enactment.  The colorization by Legend Films was designed to look like normal three-strip film but was then color corrected to match the two-strip look of the premiere's re-enactment.  Also in ''The Aviator'', Scorsese used colorized footage of [[Jane Russell]] from the original black-and-white film, ''[[The Outlaw]]'' and dog fight scenes from ''Hell's Angels''.

==Colorization examples, criticism, and controversies==

===Entertainment make-overs===

In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the business of computerized film colorization. Buying a 50 percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization, Inc., it began creating digitally colored versions of some of its films. Roach's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'' (1937), followed by ''[[Way Out West (1937 film)|Way Out West]]'' (1937), became the first black-and-white films to be redistributed in color using the digital colorization process,&lt;ref name="Edgerton"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01956050009602812 |title=The Germans Wore Gray, You Wore Blue |accessdate=2009-12-24 |author= |last=Edgerton |first=Gary R. |authorlink= |date=Winter 2000 |work= |publisher=Journal of Popular Film and Television |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFI Topper"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=4530 |title=Topper |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=Topper |title-link=Topper (film) |year=1985 |publisher=Hal Roach Studios Film Classics, Inc. |quote=It seems fitting that ''Topper'' should again be on the cutting edge of change, this time heralding the age of Colorization as the first completed Color version of a classic black and white motion picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=April 13, 1985 |title=Roach Enters Home Market |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8SMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT11&amp;dq=colorized&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSn-aSvtfNAhUH5IMKHcRKDhY4ChDoAQgvMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=colorized&amp;f=false |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2016-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to controversy. Defenders of the process noted that it would allow black-and-white films to have new audiences of people who were not used to the format. Detractors complained (among other reasons) that the process was crude and claimed that even if it were refined, it would not take into account [[lighting]] compositions chosen for black-and-white [[photography]] which would not necessarily be as effective in color.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963207,00.html |title=Casablanca In Color? |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |date=1987-01-12 |work= |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] |page=3 |language= |quote= | first=Charles | last=Krauthammer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figures opposed to the process included [[Roger Ebert]], [[James Stewart]], [[John Huston]], [[George Lucas]] and [[Woody Allen]].&lt;ref name="Edgerton"/&gt;

[[Cary Grant]] was reportedly "very gung-ho with the outcome" of the colorization of ''Topper''.&lt;ref name="Edgerton"/&gt; Director [[Frank Capra]] met with Wilson Markle about colorizing the perennial Christmas classic ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' and ''[[Lady for a Day]]'' based on Grant's enthusiasm.&lt;ref name="Edgerton"/&gt; Colorization, Inc.'s art director Brian Holmes screened ten minutes of colorized footage from ''It's a Wonderful Life'' to Capra, which led Capra to sign a contract with Colorization, Inc.&lt;ref name="Edgerton"/&gt; However, the film was believed to be in the [[public domain]] at the time, and as a result Markle and Holmes responded by returning Capra's initial investment, eliminating his financial participation, and refusing outright to allow the director to exercise artistic control over the colorization of his films, leading Capra to join in the campaign against the process.&lt;ref name="Edgerton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19850518&amp;id=0tcTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4gYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6540,1564442 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120711050456/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1320&amp;dat=19850518&amp;id=0tcTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4gYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6540,1564442 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-11 |title=Carpra's Movies Lead New Lives |accessdate=2009-12-24 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] did a special episode of ''[[Siskel &amp; Ebert]]'' addressing colorization as "Hollywood's New Vandalism." Siskel explained how networks were unable to show classic black-and-white films in prime-time unless they offer it in color. "They arrest people who spray subway cars, they lock up people who attack paintings and sculptures in museums, and adding color to black and white films, even if it's only to the tape shown on TV or sold in stores, is vandalism nonetheless." Roger Ebert added, "What was so wrong about black and white movies in the first place? By filming in black and white, movies can sometimes be more dreamlike and elegant and stylized and mysterious. They can add a whole additional dimension to reality, while color sometimes just supplies additional unnecessary information."&lt;ref&gt;[http://siskelandebert.org/video/AH4MXGWKMRGH/Colorizing-Hollywood8217s-New-Vandalism-1986 Colorizing, Hollywood’s New Vandalism (1986)], Siskel &amp; Ebert, Buena Vista Television, 1986; air date unknown&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Media mogul]] [[Ted Turner]] was once an aggressive proponent of this process, by employing the San Diego firm American Film Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sec.edgar-online.com/american-film-technologies-inc-de/10-k-annual-report/2000/01/25/Section2.aspx |title=AMERICAN FILM TECHNOLOGIES INC /DE/ – AFTC Annual Report (10-K) ITEM 1. BUSINESS |publisher=Sec.edgar-online.com |accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he told members of the press in July 1988 that he was considering colorizing ''[[Citizen Kane]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Bawden, James, "Colorful Turner sees ''Citizen Kane'' in a different light".''[[Toronto Star]]'', July 28, 1988. "''Citizen Kane?'' I'm thinking of colorizing it."&lt;/ref&gt; Turner's comments led to an immediate public outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=turnerted |title='&amp;#39;The Museum of Broadcast Communications'&amp;#39;: Ted Turner |publisher=Museum.tv |accessdate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1989 the [[Associated Press]] reported that two companies were producing color tests of ''Citizen Kane'' for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased with the AP's report that filmmaker [[Henry Jaglom]] remembered that shortly before his death [[Orson Welles]] had implored him to protect ''Kane'' from being colorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |title=Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize 'Citizen Kane' |agency=[[Associated Press]], January 30, 1989 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 14, 1989, Turner Entertainment president [[Roger Mayer (film industry executive)|Roger Mayer]] announced that work to colorize ''Citizen Kane'' had been stopped:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our attorneys looked at the contract between [[RKO Pictures]] Inc. and Orson Welles and his production company, [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Productions]] Inc., and, on the basis of their review, we have decided not to proceed with colorization of the movie. … While a court test might uphold our legal right to colorize the film, provisions of the contract could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |title=We'll Never Know If Rosebud Was Red |publisher=John Antczyk, Associated Press, February 14, 1989 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One minute of the colorized test footage of ''Citizen Kane'' was included in a special ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary, ''The Complete Citizen Kane'', produced by the [[BBC]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=6476 |title=The Complete Citizen Kane’ documentary is now online |publisher=Wellesnet, May 13, 2013 |accessdate=2014-01-05}} The footage appears at approximately 1:17:00.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b7b72e91f |title=The Complete Citizen Kane |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Huston's opposition to the colorization of his work led to a landmark three-year French legal case after his death, sparked by a colorized version of ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]''. His daughter [[Anjelica Huston]] successfully used [[French copyright law]] to set a binding precedent in 1991 that prevents the distribution or broadcasting in France of any colorized version of a film against the wishes of the original creator or their heirs.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/movies/film-makers-are-victors-in-a-lawsuit-on-coloring.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/C/Color|title=Film Makers Are Victors In a Lawsuit on Coloring |last=Riding|first=Alan|date=25 August 1991|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major legislative reaction in the United States was the [[National Film Preservation Act|National Film Preservation Act of 1988]] (Public Law 100-446), which prohibits any person from knowingly distributing or exhibiting to the public a film that has been materially altered, or a black and white film that has been colorized and is included in the Registry, unless such films are labeled disclosing specified information. This law also created the [[National Film Registry]].

Because of the high cost of the process, Turner Entertainment stopped colorizing titles. With the coming of [[DVD]] technology, the notion of colorization was once again gaining press. Because the DVD format was more versatile, studios could offer viewers the option to choose between both versions without switching discs, and thus, the release of colorized titles once again seemed profitable. Some companies re-released the older colorized versions from the 1980s—an example of this is the [[Laurel and Hardy]] box set being released in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDReviews16/laurel_and_hardy_collection_dvd_review.htm |title=The Laurel and Hardy Collection |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=DVD Beaver |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studios, such as [[Sony|Sony Entertainment]], commissioned West Wing Studios to colorize several [[Three Stooges]] films for DVD release. The studio was given access to the original [[Columbia Studios]] props and sets to lend authenticity to the colorized versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/5651949 |title=Stooges DVD revives colorization debate |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both film and television restoration and colorization is produced by the company [[Legend Films]]. Their patented automated process was used to colorize around 100 films between 2003 and 2009. [[Shirley Temple]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]] and [[Ray Harryhausen]] have worked with the company to colorize either their own films or their personal favorites. Two movies that Legend Films are noted for is the colorization of the [[exploitation film]] ''[[Reefer Madness]]'', for which certain color schemes were used to create a psychedelic effect in its viewers, and ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''. Recently (2007), Legend Films colorized ''It's a Wonderful Life'' for [[Paramount Pictures]] (whose subsidiary, [[Republic Pictures]], had regained control of the copyright in the 1990s) and ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'' in 2008 for rights holder [[Universal Pictures]].

In 2004, a classic Indian film, ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'', was colored for theatrical release all over the world by a company called Indian Academy of Arts and Animation (IAAA) in association with Sankranti Creations. Founder of IAAA and Owner of [Sankranti creations], Rajeev Dwivedi used this technology for the first time in India.

In 2005, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]] released the first season of ''[[Bewitched]]'' on DVD. Because the first season was produced in black-and-white, Sony released two versions of the set: one with the episodes as originally broadcast and a second with the episodes colorized. A year later, the second season of ''Bewitched'' and the first season of ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', another show owned by Sony, were released the same way. These releases were colorized by Dynacs Digital Studios, a Florida-based company with film colorization and animation studios in Patna, India.

Colorization has also been used to restore scenes from color films that were cut from the finished product but were preserved in black-and-white. In 2018, the originally intended closing scene to the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (in which the lead characters kiss) was added to the film's 40th anniversary release. A challenge that still plagues colorization efforts is the fact that the colorized black-and-white film may not match film shot originally in color; [[Randal Kleiser]], the director of ''Grease'', wanted to edit the scene back into the film but found the colors between the scenes did not match well enough to do so. Kleiser is optimistic that colorization technology will be advanced enough to match true color by 2028, when ''Grease'' reaches its 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/05/21/grease-anniversary-danny-sandy-finally-get-their-movie-ending-kiss/625512002/|title=Danny and Sandy finally get their movie-ending 'Grease' kiss, 40 years after it was cut|first=Bryan|last=Alexander|work=USA Today|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentary make-overs===
Colorization is sometimes used on [[documentary film|documentary]] programmes. ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' TV show colorizes some footage of the band, such as the performance of "[[All You Need Is Love]]" from the TV special ''[[Our World (TV special)|Our World]]'' (1967). In the documentary this scene begins in its original black-and-white before [[dissolve (film)|dissolving]] into seemingly realistic, [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beatlesagain.com/breflib/anthvid.html |title=Anthology Home Video |accessdate=2007-01-01 |author= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=Beatles Reference Library |pages= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The color design was based on color photographs taken at the same time as the special was shot.

The documentary series ''[[World War 1 in Colour]]'' (2003) was broadcast on television and released on DVD in 2005. There had previously been full-color documentaries about World War II using genuine color footage, but since true color film was not practical for moving pictures at the time of World War I, the series consists of colorized contemporary footage (and photographs). Several documentaries on the [[Military Channel]] feature colorized war footage from the Second World War and the [[Korean War]].

The 1960 [[Masters Tournament]], originally broadcast in black-and-white and recorded on [[kinescope]], was colorized by Legend Films for the documentary ''[[Jim Nantz Remembers]]''. This was the first time a major sports event had been re-broadcast using colorization.

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s 2018 [[First World War]] well-received documentary, ''[[They Shall Not Grow old]]'', black and white footage from the trenches was colourized.&lt;ref&gt;"The Times" report, 19 November 2018, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1958 NFL Championship Game|The Greatest Game Ever Played]], the 1958 [[National Football League|NFL]] Championship between the [[Baltimore Colts]] and the [[New York Giants]] was colorized by Legend Films for [[ESPN]] for a sports broadcast special in December 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">'''Folk poetry''' (sometimes referred to as ''poetry in action'') is poetry that is part of a society's [[folklore]], usually part of their [[oral tradition]]. When sung, folk poetry becomes a [[folk song]].

==Description==
Folk poetry in general has several characteristics. It may be informal and unofficial, generally lacks an owner and may "belong" to the society, and its telling may be an implicitly social activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = https://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol33/gwyndaf.pdf | title = Poetry in Action: Verse and Narration in Everyday Communication| first = Robin| last = Gwyndaf | doi = 10.7592/FEJF2006.33.gwyndaf | volume = 33 | journal = folklore | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term can refer to poems of an [[oral tradition]] that may date back many years;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url = | page = 170 | title = Folk Poetry | work = CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art: Philippine literature | year  =1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, it is information that has been transmitted over time (between generations) ''only'' in spoken (and non-written) form.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|p=85}} Thus as an oral tradition folk poetry requires a performer to promulgate it over generations.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|p=86}}

The definition can also be extended to include not just oral epics, but [[latrinalia]], many forms of [[childlore]] ([[skipping-rope rhyme]]s, the words of [[counting-out game]]s etc), and [[limericks]];&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Chicano Folklore: A Handbook| first = María | last = Herrera-Sobek | pages = 23-4 | year =2006}} ; definition from Dundes "What is Folkore?", (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as including anonymous or improvised poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Harold| last =Bloom| year = 1989 |title = The Art of the Critic: Early twentieth century | page = 111- }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative folk poetry is often characterized by repetition, a focus on a single event (within an overall epic narrative if present), and an impersonal narration, as well as use of exaggeration and contrast.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|pp=87-90}}

It is thought that epics such as ''[[The Iliad]]'', and ''[[The Odyssey]]'' derive from, or are modeled on earlier folk-poetry forms.{{sfn|Dorson|1982|p=90}}

'''Formalist film theory''' is a [[Film theory|theory of film study]] that is focused on the formal, or technical, elements of a film: i.e., the lighting, scoring, sound and set design, use of color, shot composition, and editing. This approach was proposed by [[Hugo Münsterberg]], [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], and [[Béla Balázs]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dudley Andrew]], ''The Major Film Theories: An Introduction'', Oxford, New York: Oxford University Press, 1976, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is a major theory of film study.

== Overview ==
[[Formalism (philosophy)|Formalism]], at its most general, considers the synthesis (or lack of synthesis) of the multiple elements of film production, and the effects, emotional and intellectual, of that synthesis and of the individual elements.  For example, take the single element of editing. A formalist might study how standard [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] "[[continuity editing]]" creates a more comforting effect and non-continuity or [[jump cut]] editing might become more disconcerting or volatile.

Or one might consider the synthesis of several elements, such as editing, shot composition, and music. The shoot-out that ends [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Spaghetti Western]] [[Dollars Trilogy|"Dollars" trilogy]] is a notable example of how these elements work together to produce an effect: The shot selection goes from very wide to very close and tense; the length of shots decreases as the sequence progresses towards its end; the music builds. All of these elements, in combination rather than individually, create tension. 

Formalism is unique in that it embraces both ideological and auteurist branches of criticism. In both these cases, the common denominator for Formalist criticism is style. Ideologues focus on how socio-economic pressures create a particular style, and auteurists on how auteurs put their own stamp on the material. Formalism is primarily concerned with style and how it communicates ideas, emotions, and themes (rather than, as critics of formalism point out, concentrating on the themes of a work itself).

== Ideological formalism ==
Two examples of ideological interpretations that are related to formalism:

The [[classical Hollywood cinema]] has a very distinct style, sometimes called the [[institutional mode of representation]]: continuity editing, massive coverage, [[three-point lighting]], "mood" music, dissolves, all designed to make the experience as pleasant as possible. The socio-economic ideological explanation for this is, quite crassly, that Hollywood wants to make as much money and appeal to as many ticket-buyers as possible.

[[Film noir]], which was given its name by [[Nino Frank]], is marked by lower production values, darker images, under lighting, location shooting, and general nihilism: this is because, we are told, during the war and post-war years filmmakers (as well as filmgoers) were generally more pessimistic. Also, the German Expressionists (including [[Fritz Lang]], who was not technically an expressionist as popularly believed{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}) emigrated to America and brought their stylized lighting effects (and disillusionment due to the war) to American soil.

It can be argued that, by this approach, the style or 'language' of these films is directly affected not by the individuals responsible, but by social, economic, and political pressures, of which the filmmakers themselves may be aware or not. It is this branch of criticism that gives us such categories as the classical Hollywood cinema, the American independent movement, the New American independent movement, the new queer cinema, and the French, German, and Czech new waves.

== Formalism in auteur theory ==
If the ideological approach is concerned with broad movements and the effects of the world around the filmmaker, then the [[auteur theory]] is diametrical to it, celebrating the individual, usually in the person of the filmmaker, and how his/her personal decisions, thoughts, and style manifest themselves in the material.

This branch of criticism, begun by [[François Truffaut]] and the other young film critics writing for ''[[Cahiers du cinéma]]'', was created for two reasons.

First, it was created to redeem the art of film itself. By arguing that films had auteurs, or authors, Truffaut sought to make films (and their directors) at least as important as the more widely accepted art forms, such as literature, music, and painting. Each of these art forms, and the criticism thereof, is primarily concerned with a sole creative force: the author of a novel (not, for example, his editor or type-setter), the composer of a piece of music (though sometimes the performers are given credence, akin to actors in film today), or the painter of a fresco (not his assistants who mix the colours or often do some of the painting themselves). By elevating the director, and not the screenwriter, to the same importance as novelists, composers, or painters, it sought to free the cinema from its popular conception as a bastard art, somewhere between theater and literature.

Secondly, it sought to redeem many filmmakers who were looked down upon by mainstream film critics. It argued that genre filmmakers and low-budget B-movies were just as important, if not more, than the prestige pictures commonly given more press and legitimacy in France and the United States. According to Truffaut's theory, auteurs took material that was beneath their talents—a thriller, a pulpy action film, a romance—and, through their style, put their own personal stamp on it.

It is this auteur style that concerns formalism.

A perfect example of formalist criticism of auteur style would be the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. Hitchcock primarily made thrillers, which, according to the ''Cahiers du cinema'' crowd, were popular with the public but were dismissed by the critics and the award ceremonies, although Hitchcock's ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'' won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 1940 Academy Awards. Though he never won the Oscar for directing, he was nominated five times in the category. Truffaut and his colleagues argued that Hitchcock had a style as distinct as that of Flaubert or Van Gogh: the virtuoso editing, the lyrical camera movements, the droll humour. He also had "Hitchcockian" themes: the wrong man falsely accused, violence erupting at the times it was least expected, the cool blonde. Now, Hitchcock is more or less universally lauded, his films dissected shot-by-shot, his work celebrated as being that of a master. And the study of this style, his variations, and obsessions all fall quite neatly under the umbrella of formalist film theory.

'''Graphotype''' was a process of autographic [[engraving]] by which [[typography|typographic]] printing blocks were produced.

==Process==
A block of [[chalk]] or some similar material is reduced to a level surface. On this surface, a design is drawn with a [[glutin]]ous [[ink]], the ink being sufficiently fluid to penetrate some little distance into the porous chalk. The ink having become dry, gentle friction is applied to the surface of the block so as gradually to rub away those parts of the chalk which are not indurated by the glutinous ink. The lines of the drawing being thus left in [[relief]], a perfect model of the required printing block is obtained and this model is next hardened by immersion in a bath containing a [[solution]] of an [[alkaline silicate]]. After this, the block is dried and reproduced by the [[Stereotype (printing)|stereotype]] or the [[electrotype]] process.{{sfnp|''EB''|1880}}

This method of [[typography|typographic]] engraving was brought to a practical form and patented in 1860 by an American [[wood carving|wood engraver]], Mr. de Witt Clinton Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent No. 2309.&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in his process is to reduce [[French chalk]] or [[talc]] to an extremely fine state of division by repeated grindings, elutriations, and siftings. After this is complete, a layer of the material (over an eighth of an [[inch]] in thickness) is forced down upon and made to adhere to a thick [[zinc]] plate, the necessary pressure being obtained by means of an [[hydraulic press]], the [[platen]] of which is faced with a polished [[steel]] plate, so as to communicate a good surface to the layer of compressed French chalk. The device is now drawn reversed on the prepared block with an ink consisting of a weak solution of [[glue]] colored by [[lamp black]] or some other [[pigment]]. In drawing on the prepared block, care must be taken not to damage the somewhat tender surface of the compressed chalk and the safest instrument with which to apply the glutinous ink is a fine [[sable]] brush, but an ordinary pen may be employed if the operation of drawing is performed with caution. A pad of [[silk velvet]] or a [[fitch brush]] may be used for rubbing the block so as to leave the lines in relief, and it is quite sufficient to continue the friction until a depth equal to the thickness of an ordinary [[playing card]] is produced, the spaces corresponding to any extended whites of the engraving being then cut out by means of a tool. A 10% solution of [[sodium silicate]] may be used for hardening the block and, when dry, nothing remains but to take a mould from it and to reproduce it in metal.{{sfnp|''EB''|1880}}

[[File:Diffa Niger Griot DSC 0177.jpg|thumb|200px|A [[Hausa people|Hausa]] Griot performs at [[Diffa]], [[Niger]], playing a ''Komsa'' ([[Xalam]]).]]

A '''griot''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|ɡʁi.o|lang}}), '''jali''', or '''jeli''' (''djeli'' or ''djéli'' in French spelling) is a [[West Africa]]n historian, storyteller, praise singer, poet, or musician. The griot is a repository of [[oral tradition]] and is often seen as a leader due to his or her position as an advisor to [[Royal family|royal personages]]. As a result of the former of these two functions, they are sometimes called a [[bard]].

== Role of griots ==
According to [[Paul Oliver]] in his ''Savannah Syncopators: African Retentions in the Blues'', "Though [the griot] has to know many traditional songs without error, he must also have the ability to extemporize on current events, chance incidents and the passing scene. His wit can be devastating and his knowledge of local history formidable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savannah Syncopators: African Retentions in the Blues|last=Oliver|first=Paul|publisher=Littlehampton Book Services Ltd.|year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are sometimes known as praise singers, griots may use their vocal expertise for [[gossip]], [[satire]], or [[political commentary]].

Griots today live in many parts of West Africa and are present among the [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] peoples ([[Mandinka people|Mandinka]], [[Malinké]], [[Bambara people|Bambara]], etc.), [[Fula people|Fulɓe]] ([[Fula people|Fula]]), [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Toucouleur people|Tukulóor]], [[Wolof people|Wolof]], [[Serer people|Serer]], [[Mossi people|Mossi]], [[Dagomba people|Dagomba]], [[Mauritania]]n Arabs, and many other smaller groups. The word may derive from the [[French language|French]] transliteration ''"''guiriot''"'' of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''"''criado''"'', or the masculine singular term for "servant". Griots are more predominant in the northern portions of West Africa.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In African languages, griots are referred to by a number of names: '''jeli''' in northern Mande areas, '''jali''' in southern Mande areas, '''guewel''' in [[Wolof language|Wolof]], '''gawlo''' in [[Fula language|Pulaar]] (Fula), and '''iggawen''' in [[Hassaniya Arabic|Hassaniyan]]. Griots form an [[endogamous]] [[caste]], meaning that most of them only marry fellow griots and those who are not griots do not typically perform the same functions that griots perform.

[[Francis Bebey]] writes about the griot in ''African Music, A People's Art'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The West African griot is a troubadour, the counterpart of the medieval European minstrel... The griot knows everything that is going on... He is a living archive of the people's traditions... The virtuoso talents of the griots command universal admiration. This virtuosity is the culmination of long years of study and hard work under the tuition of a teacher who is often a father or uncle. The profession is by no means a male prerogative. There are many women griots whose talents as singers and musicians are equally remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;Bebey, Francis (1969, 1975). ''African Music, A People's Art''. Brooklyn: Lawrence Hill Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Terms: "griot" and "jali"==
The [[Manding languages|Manding]] term ''jeliya'' (meaning "musicianhood") sometimes refers to the knowledge of griots, indicating the [[Heredity|hereditary]] nature of the class. ''Jali'' comes from the [[root word]] ''jali'' or ''djali'' (blood). This is also the title given to griots in regions within the former [[Mali Empire]]. Though the term "griot" is more common in English, some, such as poet [[Bakari Sumano]], prefer the term ''jeli''.

==In the Mali Empire==
[[File:GriotsSambala.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Griots of Sambala, king of Médina ([[Fula people]], [[Mali]]), 1890]]
The [[Mali Empire]] ([[Malinke Empire]]), at its height in the middle of the 14th century, extended from [[central Africa]] (today's [[Chad]] and [[Niger]]) to West Africa (today's [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]]). The empire was founded by [[Sundiata Keita]], whose exploits remain celebrated in Mali today. In the ''[[Epic of Sundiata]]'', [[Naré Maghann Konaté]] offered his son [[Sundiata Keita]] a griot, [[Balla Fasséké]], to advise him in his reign. Balla Fasséké is considered the founder of the Kouyaté line of griots that exists to this day.

Each [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] family of griots accompanied a higher-ranked family of warrior-kings or emperors, called ''jatigi''. In traditional culture, no griot can be without a ''jatigi'', and no ''jatigi'' can be without a griot. However, the ''jatigi'' can loan his griot to another jatigi.

Most villages also had their own griot, who told tales of births, deaths, marriages, battles, hunts, affairs, and many other things.

==In Mande society==
In [[Mandé peoples|Mande]] society, the ''jeli'' was an historian, advisor, arbitrator, praise singer (patronage), and storyteller. They essentially served as history books, preserving ancient stories and traditions through song. Their tradition was passed down through generations. The name ''jeli'' means "blood" in [[Maninka language|Manika language]]. They were believed to have deep connections to spiritual, social, or political powers. Speech was believed to have power in its capacity to recreate history and relationships.

Despite the authority of griots and the perceived power of their songs, griots are not treated as positively in West Africa as we may imagine. Thomas A. Hale wrote, "Another [reason for ambivalence towards griots] is an ancient tradition that marks them as a separate people categorized all too simplistically as members of a 'caste', a term that has come under increasing attack as a distortion of the social structure in the region. In the worst case, that difference meant burial for griots in trees rather than in the ground in order to avoid polluting the earth (Conrad and Frank 1995:4-7). Although these traditions are changing, griots and people of griot heritage still find it difficult to marry outside of their social group."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Thomas A.|date=|year=1997|title=From the Griot of Roots to the Roots of Griot: A New Look at the Origins of a Controversial African Term for Bard|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/12ii/2_Hale.pdf|journal=Oral Tradition|volume=12|issue=2|pages=249–278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discrimination is now deemed illegal.

==Musical instruments used by griots==
In addition to being singers and social commentators, griots are often skilled instrumentalists. Their instruments include the [[kora (instrument)|kora]], the [[khalam]] (or [[xalam]]), the [[goje]] (or n'ko in the Mandinka language), the [[balafon]], and the [[ngoni (instrument)|ngoni]].

The kora is a long-necked [[lute]]-like instrument with 21 strings. The xalam is a variation of the kora, and usually consists of fewer than five strings. Both have [[gourd]] bodies that act as [[resonator]]. The ngoni is also similar to these two instruments, with five or six strings. The balafon is a wooden [[xylophone]], while the goje is a stringed instrument played with a [[Bow (music)|bow]], much like a [[fiddle]].

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|Encyclopædia Britannica]]: "West African plucked lutes such as the ''konting'', ''khalam'', and the ''nkoni'' (which was noted by Ibn Baṭṭūṭah in 1353) may have originated in ancient Egypt. The ''khalam'' is claimed to be the ancestor of the banjo. Another long-necked lute is the ''ramkie'' of South Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/African-music#ref519742|title=African Music|last=Robotham|first=Donald|last2=Kubik|first2=Gerhard|date=January 27, 2012|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Griots also wrote stories that children enjoyed listening too. These stories were passed down to their children.

==Griots in present day==
Today, performing is one of the most common functions of a griot. Their range of exposure has widened, and many griots now travel internationally to sing and play the kora or other instruments. 

[[Bakari Sumano]], head of the Association of [[Bamako]] Griots in [[Mali]] from 1994 to 2003, was an internationally-known advocate for the significance of the griot in West African society.

==In popular culture==

===Film and theater===
*[[Camille Yarbrough]] wrote a play called ''Tales and Tunes of an'' ''African American Griot'' that was performed at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;La MaMa Archives Digital Collections.

*In ''[[Guimba the Tyrant]]'' (1995), a [[Mali]]an film directed by [[Cheick Oumar Sissoko]], the village griot is a storyteller and provides [[comic relief]].
*''[http://www.olivierjanin.com/portfolio-item/mali-memories/ I was born as a Djeli]'' (2007) is a French [[Documentary film|documentary]] written by Gwenaelle de Kergommeaux and Olivier Janin and directed by Cédric Condom.

===Music===

===Literature===
*[[Alex Haley]]'s novel ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'' references a griot who passed down his family history through the oral tradition. When Haley traces his history, passing from his previous generation through the slave time, back to Africa, he thought there should be griots telling his history and the history of his ancestor, known in the family as "The African", who was captured in the bushes as he was seeking timber to make a [[talking drum]]. When Haley arrived in Africa to do research for his book, he believed he had found griots telling his history. Through them, he learned the ancestor's identity: [[Kunta Kinte]]. Since he first heard the story from his grandmother and then from his older cousin, he believed that these family members were griots themselves until someone put the story to writing. He later learned that his cousin had died within an hour of his arrival at the village. This story also illustrates the complexities of [[oral tradition]], particularly when approached without expert knowledge. In 1981, it was shown by Donald Wright that the story of Kunta Kinte had been manufactured by a well-wisher.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Donald R. (1981). "Uprooting Kunta Kinte: on the perils of relying on encyclopoaedic informants." ''[[History in Africa]],'' volume VIII.

&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of ''Roots'', this story was being told in multiple versions with various embellishments.
*In [[Lawrence Hill]]'s novel [[The Book of Negroes (novel)|''The Book of Negroes'']], main character Aminata Diallo becomes a jeli.
*The [[Ivory Coast|Ivorian]] writer [[Ahmadou Kourouma]]'s novel ''Waiting for the Wild Beasts to Vote'' takes the form of a praise-song by the Sora, the griot, Bingo to the president-dictator of the fictitious République du Golfe. His final novel, ''Allah is not Obliged'', prominently features a griot.
*In [[Paule Marshall]]'s ''[[Praisesong for the Widow]]'', the protagonist Avatara (Avey) takes on some characteristics of a griot, particularly in her commitment to passing on her aunt's oral story of the [[Igbo Landing]] to her grandchildren. In this story, Africans brought to the [[Sea Islands]] to be enslaved turned around and walked back to Africa over the water.
* Malian novelist [[Massa Makan Diabaté]] was a descendant and critic of the griot tradition. Though Diabaté argued that griots "no longer exist" in the classic sense, he believed the tradition could be salvaged through literature. His fiction and plays blend traditional [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] storytelling and [[idiom]] with [[Western culture|Western]] literary forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'assemblée des djinns|last=Diabaté|first=Massa Makan|publisher=Éditions Présence Africaine|year=1985|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5269">'''Grupo Santa Helena''', or '''Santa Helena Group''', was the name given by the critic [[Sérgio Milliet]] to the painters that met in the [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]] of [[Francisco Rebolo]] and [[Mario Zanini]] starting in the 1930s. The ateliers belonged to a [[Praça da Sé]] building named ''Palacete Santa Helena''. This building was demolished in 1971, when the [[List of São Paulo metro stations|Sé station]] of [[São Paulo Metro]] was built.

The Santa Helena Group was formed spontaneously, without any conceptual commitment. Most of its members were [[Italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]], like [[Alfredo Volpi]] and [[Fulvio Pennacchi]]; sons of Italian immigrants, like [[Aldo Bonadei]], [[Alfredo Rizzotti]], Mario Zanini and [[Humberto Rosa (painter)|Humberto Rosa]]; some were [[Spanish people|Spanish immigrants]] like Francisco Rebolo; some [[Portuguese people|Portuguese immigrants]] like [[Manuel Martins (visual artist)|Manuel Martins]].

They all shared a humble origin, and worked as [[artisan]]s or [[proletariat|proletarian]]s. Rebolo, Volpi and Zanini were wall painters. [[Clóvis Graciano]] was a railroad worker. Fulvio Pennacchi was a butcher. Aldo Bonadei worked with [[costume design]] and [[embroidery]]. Rizzotti was an auto mechanic and a [[lathe]] worker. Manoel Martins was a [[goldsmith]]. Rebolo was a football player. Humberto Rosa and Pennacchi taught drawing. Painting was for the weekends or leisure time.

Most of them had courses in the ''[[Liceu de Artes e Ofícios de São Paulo|Liceu de Artes e Ofícios]]'' (or "Arts and Crafts Lyceum", that was one [[Liceo scientifico]]), or the ''Escola Profissional Masculina do Brás'' (or "Men's Professional School of Brás"). However, they reduced what they learned to drawing and painting techniques, not to the academic guiding of formal order, were they aware of that or not.

By this time, some painters associations were created in São Paulo, like the ''Sociedade Pró-Arte Moderna'' (or "Pro-Modern Art Society", aka SPAM) or ''Clube dos Artistas Modernos'' (CAM, or "Modern Artists Club"). They joined the participants of the ''[[Semana de Arte Moderna]]'' (or "Modern Art Week"). These groups were formed by intellectuals and members of the São Paulo elite, which kept a great distance from the Santa Helena members and other proletarian groups, about which they had little or no knowledge.

The group union, that lasted for years, can be explained as a reaction against the enormous prejudice that existed about the poor immigrants, that came not only from the pre-existent Brazilian elite families, but also from immigrants that became wealthy in Brazil. That prejudice was made clear in several criticisms that were directed to the Group's work, particularly when it started to cause a sensation, and to threaten positions already established.

Some Santa Helena artists had already studied art in Europe before arriving in Brazil; for instance Pennacchi, Rizzotti and Bonadei. All others had difficulty learning about the art created there, and could only be taught by teachers in Brazil. Bonadei was a student of [[Pedro Alexandrino]], [[Antonio Rocco (painter)|Antonio Rocco]] and [[Amadeo Scavone]]. Graciano was taught by [[Waldemar da Costa]], and Zanini was a [[Georg Elpons]] student.

The perseverance of the group, in its fight for survival, caused interest and attracted new friends and partners. So, in due time, the place became the meeting point of many other artists.

The Santa Helena Group's major achievement was to reveal some of the most important Brazilian visual artists of the 20th century.

==Exhibitions==

In 1937, an exhibition named ''[[Família Artística Paulista]]'', or "Artistic Family of S&amp;atilde;o Paulo" shown a set of artists, including the ''Grupo Santa Helena'', that could show their work publicly for the first time. From then on, the Grupo became known. They provoked the interest of [[Mário de Andrade]], that identified in them a "S&amp;atilde;o Paulo school of painting".

In 1940, the "Exhibition of French Painters", that presented [[Cézanne]], [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]], among others, caused an enormous impact and several components of the group started to redirect his work, what made them more distant of the Grupo's themes or in their formal aspects.

'''HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞)''' is a permanent multimedia installation in the "Athene-Trakt" of the [[:de:Kunsthalle Mannheim|Kunsthalle Mannheim]]&lt;ref name="Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=100 Yahre Kunsthalle Mannheim 1907-2007 | publisher=Kunsthalle Mannheim | year=2007 | isbn=978-3-89165-210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by [[NatHalie Braun Barends]].

The Kunsthalle is {{asof|2015}} under reconstruction. Following a court decision of the Landgericht Mannheim, the installation will likely not be rebuilt afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/kunst/kunsthalle-muss-mannheimer-loch-nicht-wieder-installieren-13556651.html|title=Landgericht weist Klage ab: Kunsthalle muss „Mannheimer Loch“ nicht wieder installieren|trans-title=|author=|date=24 April 2015|publisher=|access-date=26 January 2017|via=FAZ.NET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landgericht Mannheim decided that the right of the owner of the building (even if against the signed loan contracts) overrides  the copyright and the property of the artist, to allow the city to build the new €70 millions museum. It is to appreciate that the artist, in order to protect the fundamental right of artistic freedom, property right and copyright will go on to the next instance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/kunst-und-architektur/article140084472/Und-ich-sage-dieses-Loch-ist-Kunst.html|title=Mannheimer Loch: Ist es nichts?

== Description ==
HHole for Mannheim (2006-∞) has been conceived as a permanent, conceptual, site specific, developing artwork in progress.&lt;ref name="NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life"&gt;{{cite book | title=NatHalie Braun Barends - Light Art Life | publisher=Art Space | year=2007 | location=Berlin/New York/Santiago | isbn=978-3-941494-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of seven holes which pass through the Athene Trakt that unites the old (Billing-Bau) and the new building (Mitzlaff-Bau) of the Mannheim Kunsthalle.

The natural light flows from the topmost hole above the museum rooftop, through the holes in the floors below, meeting the light projected upwards from a Gobo projector located at the lowest floor. At the rooftop, a custom designed laser light (also used by astronomers to point at stars), projects into the universe the artist's symbol of the HMap. The natural and the artificial lights meet again symbolically at the antipodes of the museum, close to New Zealand at 49° 28′ 56.68″ S, 171° 31′ 29.63″ E.

Seven rooms contain the seven holes, starting from above: Infinite Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/7-infinite/infinite.php-page=text.htm|title=Infinite Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn2b.net/HHole/6-phoenix/phoenix.php-page=text.htm|title=Phoenix Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/5-reflection/reflection.php-page=text.htm|title=Reflection Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silence Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/4-silence/silence.php-page=text.htm|title=Silence Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treasure Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/3-treasure/treasure.php-page=text.htm|title=Treasure Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground Room,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/2-ground/ground.php-page=text.htm|title=Ground Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Earth Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hn2b.net/HHole/1-earth/earth.php-page=text.htm|title=Earth Room|author=|date=|work=hn2b.net|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each room hosts different installations, with videos, HHole specially designed acrylic furniture, waterfall, living tree, pool, and telephone to connect each level.

'''Intersection for the Arts''', established in 1965, is the oldest alternative [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] art space in [[San Francisco, California]]. Intersection's reading series is the longest continuous reading series outside of an academic institution in the state of [[California]].

Intersection produces and presents new and experimental work in the fields of [[literature]], [[theater]], [[music]], and the [[visual arts]]. Intersection's artists regularly provide classes and workshops to the local community. Intersection also maintains an incubation program for emerging literary, visual and performing arts groups.

Intersection is located in the SoMa district of San Francisco, on 925 Mission Street, between 5th and 6th Streets.

== History ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:766 Valencia - Intersection (1988).jpg|left|thumb|Intersection for the Arts in 1988 at their old location on 766 Valencia. The current location is now at 925 Mission St. Suite 109.]] --&gt;

Intersection was founded in the Tenderloin in 1965 by an interfaith coalition of three churches. The organization began as a merger of several faith-based experiments that were using art to reach disenfranchised neighborhood youth while also providing artists who were [[conscientious objector]]s with an alternative to serving in the [[Vietnam War]].  The founding Director was Laird Sutton and full-time staff members were poetry director Adrian Ravarour, Tom Dobson, Paul Donetti, and Juan Elorreaga. By 1967, it moved to North Beach and remained for 20 years. [[Robin Williams]], Father Guido Sarducci ([[Don Novello]]), [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Peter Coyote]], [[Bill Irwin]] and [[Country Joe McDonald]]  performed there. [[Gregory Corso]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Ishmael Reed]] and [[Margaret Atwood]] read there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1985 it lost its North Beach space and a year later, relocated to 766 Valencia Street in the Mission District, moving again in 1989, to a former furniture store on Valencia Street. [[Campo Santo Theatre Company]], [[Joe Goode]] and [[Erika Chong Shuch]], and  [[Marcus Shelby]] performed there. [[Denis Johnson]] and [[Dave Eggers]] read there.

Then it relocated to 925 Mission Street, Suite 109, a 5M space in The Chronicle building at Fifth Street and Mission Street.

Over the years, Intersection has evolved into a more diverse organization with a more prominent profile, but maintains strong ties with the local community.

Intersection has worked with a range of artists including [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Michael Ondaatje]], [[David Henry Hwang]], [[Carolyn Forché]], and [[Ishmael Reed]]. Recently, it has developed and presented work with [[Jessica Hagedorn]], [[Alice Walker]], [[bell hooks]], [[John Trudell]], [[Denis Johnson]], [[Lebbeus Woods]], [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]], [[Dave Eggers]], [[Jimmy Santiago Baca]], [[Stefon Harris]], [[Naomi Iizuka]], [[Claudia Bernardi]], [[Joe Goode]], and [[Gary Snyder]], as well as thousands of emerging artists.

Intersection for the Arts produces anywhere from 6-11 theatrical and dance productions, 10-12 literary readings, 12-16 concerts, and 4-6 art exhibits or installations in a given year, as well as workshops in each discipline taught by the resident artists. Intersection's building also hosts a variety of community, social, and artistic events for other San Francisco artistic organizations throughout the year, including the [[Litquake]] Festival, the [[Jackson Award]], and the [[Phelan Award]].

Intersection for the Arts's resident artists include the theater company [[Campo Santo (theater)|Campo Santo]] ([[Margo Hall]], [[Sean San Jose]], [[Luis Saguar]], [[Michael Torres]] - Founders. [[Denis Johnson]] - Resident Playwright), [[Erika Chong Shuch]] and her dance-theater company the [[Erika Shuch Performance (ESP) Project]], the jazz musician [[Howard Wiley]], [[Marc Bamuthi Joseph]] and [[Youth Speak]]'s theater program [[The Living Word Project]], and photographer [[Scott Chernis]].

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:baca_at_intersection.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jimmy Santiago Baca]] reading at Intersection for the Arts in 2003]] --&gt;
Outside of academic institutions, Intersection for the Arts' literary series is the longest continual reading series in the state of California. The longevity of the series has attracted an increasing number of high-profile writers, but the series continues to regularly showcase the work of emerging, local writers in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In recent years, Intersection has complemented their literary series with the Independent Press Spotlight series, hosting talks with members of San Francisco independent publishers and literary magazines scene while authors perform readings from recent issues. Participants in this series include [[AK Press]],
''[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]]'',
[[City Lights Publishers]],
''[[ColorLines Magazine]]'',
[[Fourteen Hills]],
[[Heyday Books]],
''[[LiP Magazine]]'',
[[Manic D Press]],

[[Switchback (journal)|Switchback]],
[[Tachyon Publications]],
[[University of California Press]],
''[[Zoetrope: All-Story]]'',
and ''[[ZYZZYVA]]'' as well as newer magazines, journals, and publishers.

== Intersection Incubator ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:intersectionincubator.jpg|thumb|Intersection Incubator Logo]] --&gt;
In addition to producing its own work, Intersection for the Arts provides members of its incubation program assistance in funding, developing, and promoting their artists' work. Through fiscal sponsorship, the program has encouraged funding agencies and contributors to take risks in funding new projects and emerging artists by ensuring that the funds will be well managed and spent according to the funder's guidelines.

Currently the Intersection Incubator provides support to more than 120 art projects and organizations in the San Francisco Bay Area across numerous disciplines and levels of experience. Several organizations that have been in the incubation program have gone on to have lasting impact in the San Francisco Bay Area, including [[Youth Speaks]], [[Flyaway Productions]], [[The Traveling Jewish Theater]], and [[Galería de la Raza]].

Truby argues that most [[screenwriting guru|teachers of screenwriting]] emphasize inner transformation of the characters but not the moral effect their actions have on others. He is critical of [[Syd Field|Syd Field's]] [[Screenwriting theories|three-act “Paradigm”]] and has instead crafted his own 22-step outline. Truby's first book ''The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller'' was published in October, 2007 by [[Faber and Faber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479518 The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOgcUsML?url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479518 |date=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screenwriting career==
In the 1980s, Truby received his first credits, writing three episodes of [[21 Jump Street]]. He later received a co-writer credit on the 2011 Disney/BBC film ''[[African Cats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0991399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kolormondo''' is a [[Color model|colour system]], presenting [[Color|colours]] and their interrelations in [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]]. The Kolormondo system is used to understand, identify and communicate colours. Kolormondo is a patent pending Swedish innovation. The founder of Kolormondo, Nicoline Kinch, has received the Inventors Prize of the city of Stockholm.

== Colours in 3D ==
Kolormondo is displayed as a 3D Colour Puzzle and as a digital 3D Colour [[Globe]]. The Kolormondo 3D Colour Puzzle is based on [[CMYK color model|CMYK]], [[Cyan|Cyan (C)]], [[Magenta|Magenta (M)]], [[Yellow|Yellow (Y)]] and on [[Black|Black (K)]]. These are [[Pigment|pigment based colours]], which are used on printed media. Kolormondo´s digital colour globe is built with [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[Red|Red (R)]], [[Green|Green (G)]] and [[Blue|Blue (B)]]. These are light colours and are used on the screen.

The Kolormondo system is three-dimensional displayed as a globe. At the [[Equator]], you find the most pure [[hue]]s, those that constitute the [[Color wheel|colour circle]]. The North Pole is white while the South Pole is black. The closer you get to the white North Pole the lighter the colours become. If you go south towards the black South Pole the colours get darker. Towards the globe’s core, colours gradually turn grey. A pillar or a column between the North and the South Pole is the grey scale.

Kolormondo invites you to systematically navigate between colours and explore how they blend into each other. The gradual change from any given colour in/out to its less/more [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] “relative” colour is clear as well as the change in value going up for a lighter version or down for a more black. You can see how apricot turns into orange, transforms into brown when following colours along the sphere’s longitude; while the same brown turned into purple in one direction along the latitude, and into dark green going the other way.

This is a list of [[planet]]s appearing in the [[fiction]]al ''[[Transformers]]'' universe.

==Akalo==
'''Akalo''' (also known as Archa Nine) is the 9th planet in the Arca System. It is an organic [[forest]] planet that is populated by the Akalouthians (a technological primitive people).

==Andellor==
'''Andellor''' is a [[library]] planet for a highly evolved society.

==Antilla==
'''Antilla''' is an ancient ringed planet which was the site of an early [[Autobot]] colonization effort. This colony was wiped out by the deadly plague known as Cosmic Rust as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Cosmic Rust."

Antilla is also home to adorable creatures known as Antillan Bumble-Puppies.

==Arkus==
'''Arkus''' is a planet that is a home to robotic creatures that first appeared in the 3H Comics.

==Aquatron==
'''Aquatron''' was a planet introduced in the novel ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'' notable for being almost entirely covered in water. It was part of the Quintesson Empire and its inhabitants were enslaved as part of the illusion of the Quintesson "Co-Prosperity Sphere." Aquatron was a Cybertronian colony, and its native inhabitants-the Aquatronians and the Sharkticons-are of Cybertronian descent. The Autobots and Decepticons arrive here and quickly learn that the planet is under Quintesson control, after one of the planet's artificial rings-used to gather and fire energy-disables both their ships. A massive battle then ensues between the Cybertronians and the Sharkticons, with the Sharkticons later abandoning the Quintessons in temporary favor of Megatron. However, the awakening of a massive Quintesson jellyfish known as the Hydratron-which while dormant had served as a continent/city for the inhabitants of the planet-proved devastating, and the Autobots and the Decepticons eventually left the planet behind. One benefit of their visit was that Aquatron was freed from Quintesson rule and fell to the jurisdiction of a massive race of underwater Transformers, including one known as Leviacon. The planet was also inhabited by the [[Pirahnacons]], a deadly race that fed upon Transformers.

Known inhabitants of Aquatron include:

* '''Inquirata the [[Curator]]''' - A Quintesson better known by his title of Curator, Inquirata was stationed on Aquatron to lure the Autobots and Decepticons there. He did so through the use of a replica of the [[Matrix of Leadership]], and hoped to earn the favor of his superiors and be returned to Quintessa. His aspirations were dashed when the Sharkticons rebelled, and he was later killed by Tyrannicon.
* '''Doctor Xeros''' - A Quintesson [[physician]] who worked as the Curator's direct subordinate. He was later killed by the Sharkticons after Megatron took control of them.
* '''Tyrannicon''' - A Sharkticon general created by the Quintessons to lead their enslaved army, and several sizes larger than many of his troops. Tyrannicon forced the Autobots and Decepticons on Aquatron to surrender to him, and was then dispatched to lead the invasion of Cybertron. His forces later rebelled against him under Megatron's command, and he returned to Aquatron, killing the Curator before engaging Megatron in battle. He succeeded in claiming the Matrix replica that had given Megatron control of the Sharkticons and had his own power increased by it, but was killed by the Hydratron.
* '''Leviacon''' - A giant Transformer with a [[whale]]-like alternate form, Leviacon and his race were enslaved by the Quintessons. After Megatron disrupted the Quintessons' control of Aquatron's inhabitants, Leviacon came to Optimus Prime's aid, taking him to face the Curator and later saving him and Megatron from annihilation. He and his people then reclaimed their planet, bidding the Autobots farewell.
* '''The [[Gamekeeper]]''' - A massive, cyborg creature resembling a [[lobster]], the Gamekeeper resided in the bowels of the Hydratron, where he maintained the Quintessons' vicious aquatic pets. On rare occasions he would devour prisoners himself, such as the Sharkticons who dreamed of a future liberator. Unbeknownst to him, that liberator arrived in the form of Decepticon leader Megatron, who with Optimus Prime managed to destroy the Gamekeeper.

==Athenia==

==Beast==
'''Beast''' (also known as '''Beest''') is a distant planet that is inhabited by a race of anthropomorphic animals called [[Battle Beasts|Beastformers]]. There were few dissenters on this planet until the Decepticons arrived. Following this, the inhabitants have each sided with the Autobots or the Decepticons.

==Chaar==
{{Redirect|Chaar|the Indian film|Chaar (film)}}
'''Chaar''' (in Japan, '''Jarr''') appeared in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' television series, debuting in [[List of The Transformers episodes|The Five Faces of Darkness (Part 1)]] in season three. It is a small, burned-out husk of a planet in distant space, easily mistaken for a smudge on a map. It apparently supported a civilization at one point, as abandoned structures are seen on the surface. The surface is desolate and lacks vegetation, but some native lifeforms still exist, including an enormous [[spider]].

Following [[Unicron]]’s attack on [[Cybertron]] in 2005, the [[Autobot]]s reclaimed Cybertron, and the surviving [[Decepticon]]s (who were without their leader [[Galvatron]] at the time) were forced to withdraw to Chaar, where they struggled to eke out an existence, relying on the meager amounts of Energon that could be acquired from other worlds. Eventually, [[Cyclonus]] set out to find Galvatron but, in his absence, the [[Quintessons]] supplied the Decepticons with Energon in return for their assistance in launching an attack against the Autobots. With the return of Galvatron, the alliance was restructured, but the ensuing attack on Cybertron ended in failure, resulting in the Decepticons again returning to Chaar, which served as their base of operations for the remainder of the series.

After [[Earth]] and Cybertron, Chaar appeared in more episodes of the [[The Transformers (TV series)|original television series]] than any other planet.

Chaar was also mentioned in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'', but as an asteroid belt, not a planet.

In ''[[Transformers Animated]]'', Strika leads "Team Chaar" which consists of Spittor, Cyclonus, Oil Slick, and Blackout.

==Cheyne==
'''Cheyne''' is an arid [[desert]] world whose culture is similar to the [[Wild West]] of the late 19th century United States.

==Circuit Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Circuit Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is covered in roads and highways. Circuit Planet was used for a race between the Autobots and Kicker in the episode "Crash Course." It was won by Arcee and Misha Miramond. Circuit Planet was later destroyed by Megatron who was controlling Unicron's body.

==Combatron==
'''Combatron''' is a planet that was established as colony world that by [[King Atlas (Transformers)|King Atlas]] until a war erupted that left it all but devoid of life.

==Cybertron==
{{Main|Cybertron}}
'''Cybertron''' is a [[fictional planet]], the homeworld of the [[Transformers]] in the various fictional incarnations of the metaseries and toyline by [[Hasbro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transformers The Movie |work= IGN|date=|url= http://uk.dvd.ign.com/articles/037/037249p1.html|accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Japanese series, the planet is referred to as "Cybertron" (first shown on Japanese ''Galaxy Force'' packaging, despite the fact that "Cybertron" is the Japanese name for "Autobot") pronounced as セイバートロン ''Seibātoron''.&lt;ref&gt;Transformers a near burnout // Movie tries to conquer both teens and tots
Chicago Sun-Times; August 11, 1986; by Patricia Smith&lt;/ref&gt; Cybertron is populated by mechanical life forms of variable size who can transform into all kinds of machinery. These are called Cybertronians, or Transformers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.02/transformers.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040404085605/http://www.animerica-mag.com/features/10.02/transformers.html |title=Animerica: Animerica Feature: TransACTION |archivedate=4 April 2004 |work=animerica-mag.com |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daffodil II==
'''Daffodil II''' is a luxurious all-natural planet.

==Darhos==
'''Darhos''' is a planet that was a veritable paradise. As time went on, certain groups began to monopolies control of the resources and money, leading to vast class split. Now Darhos’ decadent ruling class lives in the lap of luxury, eating, drinking and enjoying the pleasures of the flesh amidst architecture and fashion that seems a mad blend of many of Earth’s ancient cultures while the poverty-stricken citizens live in slums. Should the disenfranchised attempt to rise up against their self-proclaimed masters, they would be captured and thrown into labor camps in the barren northern hemisphere.

==Delta Pavonis IV==
'''Delta Pavonis IV''' is a planet where the inhabitants are anthropomorphic [[cat]]s and anthropomorphic [[dog]]s. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Big Broadcast of 2006."

==Deneb IV==
'''Deneb IV''' is a planet where Kup nearly lost all of his platoon when the Decepticons used a surprise acid shower on them. It was mentioned in the comic book issue called "The Desert Island of Space."

==Dread==
'''Dread''' is a rather unpleasant planet that is the home of the monster Chaos. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Chaos."

==Earth==
This is a version of the real-world planet '''[[Earth]]''' where humans have made contact with Transformers. Earth is the third planet from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]] in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. It is a world populated by a wide variety of native organic lifeforms, most notably, [[human]]s. Versions of this planet are known to exist in many dimensions within the multiverse, and it frequently becomes involved in the conflicts of the Transformers. Perhaps too frequently. Whenever something (or someone) leaves, escapes, or is otherwise ejected from [[Cybertron]], there's a disproportionate chance it will eventually wind up on Earth.

In some universes, Earth becomes the post-apocalyptic planet [[#Gaea|Gaea]]. In other universes, Earth is the planet that formed around [[Unicron]] as seen in ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.

==Edaps==
'''Edaps''' is a planet that supports mechanized life.

==Eurythma==
'''Eurythma''' is a planet whose culture is based solely on [[music]]. Among their achievements is a three-part harmony of incredible destructive power.

==Femax==
'''Femax''' is a planet in the Marvel Comics series where [[feminism]] has been taken to the extreme: women rule all aspects of the planet and men are only used for labor. Femax first appeared in issue #53 in the U.S. series&lt;ref name="TFArchive"/&gt; and issue #218 in the UK series.&lt;ref name="TFArchive"/&gt; The Autobots [[Cloudburst (Transformers)|Cloudburst]] and [[Landmine (Transformers)|Landmine]] visited Femax during their encounter with the [[Mecannibals]].

==Feminia==
'''Feminia''' is a prosperous planet with the local sapient life being human colonists, Nebulos colonists, and Emusas (an animal that resembles a pink [[rabbit]] with a [[raccoon]] tail and small [[bird]]-like wings).

==Floron 3==
'''Floron 3''' is a planet which is best known as a place to purchase large cans of Robot Insecticide.

==Gaea==
'''Gaea''' (ガイア ''Gaia''), or '''Gaia''', is post-apocalyptic [[Earth]] in the distant future, tens of thousands of years away. Thanks to the millennia without humanity, most of mankind's structures have been completely destroyed and most of the planet has been grown-over with dense jungle.

==Ganzvort==
'''Ganzvort''' is a planet. All that is known about it is that it has a region called New Jersey.

==Ghennix==
'''Ghennix''' is a planet. It was featured in Marvel Comics where it was devoured by Unicron.

==Gigantion==
'''Gigantion''', or '''Giant Planet''', is a fictional planet home to giant [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] in the animated television program ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]''. It is referred to as '''Gigalonia''' in ''Transformers: Galaxy Force'', the Japanese version of the show. Much like how Velocitron is referred to as both "Velocitron" and "Speed Planet", Gigantion has a similar dual name. Its actual name was revealed in the episode "Balance".

Gigantion is home to one of the four Cyber Planet Keys and is one of the four ancient Transformer colonies. The titanic Transformers of Gigantion are large and powerful where their size are compared the combined forms of the known Combiners on both the Autobots' side and the Decepticons' side. The Gigantion Transformers are fortunately not much given to violence and warfare. Most are gentle and peaceful, desiring only to hone their skills and build ever grander structures. They work closely with the small Mini-Con Transformers, who can tackle the delicate tasks too refined for the heavy manipulators of their bulk comrades.

Once part of a star system within the [[Milky Way galaxy]], the planet fell into a spatial rift and was transported to a distant universe. The only Transformers to escape this fate were a quartet of Mini-Cons consisting of Jolt, Six-Speed, Reverb, and Safeguard. Vector Prime eventually discovered and saved them, and they became the Mini-Con Recon Team. Each Transformer on Giant Planet has a Mini-Con partner. The larger Transformers all become construction vehicles with the Mini-Cons integrated into both modes. Gigantion's [[de facto]] leader is [[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]. The Transformers from this world have accents that sound Scottish or Irish.

The Giant Transformers have a habit of building giant cities and abandoning them, with older cities (the oldest of which are buried deep within the planet's crust) forbidden by planetary law by erasing their data so no one could come back. The planet was once the target of an attack from the mysterious Planet X, its inhabitants having eradicated most every other civilization in their universe and seeking to subjugate Gigantion's populace as their next conquest. Gigantion's people, however, retaliated, with its inhabitants modifying themselves including their planet with help from the Cyber Planet Key into becoming large enough to combat the invasion.

This eventually led Planet X's inhabitants to use their planet-busting weapon in a last-ditch effort to win the war, but the weapon overloaded and destroyed Planet X. Horrified and saddened by their part in the extinction of an entire race, Gigantion's inhabitants remodeled themselves into construction vehicles and took up their custom of building and then abandoning cities, perhaps as a form of self-punishment, focusing their energies solely on creation, not destruction. The Giant Transformers built cities underground and used holographic images of the sky on the top to make things nice. They started at the very center where they left the greenery. They have many mottoes like "Safety First" and "Always look forward, never back". Gigantion is mentioned in the first chapter of ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]''.

Known inhabitants of Gigantion include:

* '''[[Metroplex (Transformers)|Metroplex]]''' - The acting leader of Gigantion. He transforms into an excavator.
* '''Quickmix''' - The right-hand mech of Metroplex. He transforms into a cement mixer truck.
* '''Menasor''' - An inhabitant of Gigantion who is displeased with the planet's laws. Menasor temporarily sided with the Decepticons. He transforms into an excavation machine.
* '''Drill Bit''' - The Mini-Con partner of Metroplex. He transforms into a twin drill machine.
* '''Stripmine''' - The Mini-Con partner of Quickmix. He transforms into a treaded vehicle with a cannon on top.

==Goo==
'''Goo''' is the name of many garbage planets in the original Transformers television series, debuting in the season 3 miniseries ''The Five Faces of Darkness''. Goo is filled with [[Waste|garbage]] and belongs to the [[Junkions]], and takes its name from a powerful adhesive that clings to anything unless disabled. After the [[Quintessons]] blew up Quintessa in an attempt to destroy the [[Autobot]]s, the Autobots were set adrift in space until they landed on Goo. The Autobots were attacked by a giant garbage truck that killed [[Springer (Transformers)|Springer]] before [[Rodimus|Rodimus Prime]] could disable it. Later the Quintessons found out that the Autobots were alive on Goo. They made an alliance with the [[Decepticon]]s, who were without their leader, [[Galvatron]], and attacked the Autobots on Goo. When Galvatron returned, he was furious that the Decepticons had abandoned him. He attacked the Decepticons and Quintessons with an army of Sweeps, before being placated by Quintesson manipulation. As the Autobots fled, Galvatron destroyed the planet of Goo. Later, the Junkions were able to repair and resuscitate Springer. Another Goo planet was featured in the episode "Chaos," where the Autobots discovered that the Decepticons had come into possession of crystals produced by the monstrous Chaos that could pierce any metal.

==Gorlam Prime==
'''Gorlam Prime''' is a planet that is in the same sector of space as the Benzuli Expanse cosmic anomaly. Originally inhabited by organic beings, they progressively undergo mechanization until they achieve full mechanical status.

==Greengard==
'''Greengard''' is a paradise planet where its plants never turn brown and its flowers never wither.

==Hive==
'''Hive''' is a planet where its inhabitants are [[insectoid]]s that live beneath the surface of the planet.

==Hub==
'''Hub''' is a powerful planet-spanning network of cyberformed structures. It housed the Decepticon progenitor known as the Liege Maximo. Hub was the seat of power for the Cybertronian Empire.

==Hydrax Plateau==
'''Hydrax Plateau''' is a planet where a younger Ratchet was dispatched to when looking for survivors of a chemical attack caused by Oil Slick. It was featured in the comic tie-ins to ''[[Transformers Animated]]''.

The name has subsequently been assigned to a region of Cybertron in the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' continuity.

==Hydrus Four==
'''Hydrus Four''' is the only planet on which the miracle restorative Nucleon can be found. It was mentioned in ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' episode "A New Hero," in which Blurr instructs E.R.V.I.S. to take the Sigma there.

==Hyperion==
'''Hyperion''' is a planet that is home to the [[mercenary]] Krakon.

==Iron Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Iron Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is metallic in nature and was filled with a lot of Energon. It was destroyed when the Terrorcons deprived it of its Energon.

==Jhi==
'''Jhi''' is a green planet that is home to an ancient race of people with [[dog]]-like faces and [[elf]]-like ears. It was featured in Marvel Comics.

==Jungle Planet==
There had been different versions of '''Jungle Planet''' in the Transformers franchise:

===Jungle Planet #1===
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Jungle Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It was a lush, [[jungle]]-like paradise.

===Jungle Planet #2===
'''Jungle Planet''' (also called the '''Beast Planet''' on occasion) is a fictional planet home to Beast [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] in the animated television program ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]''. It is referred to as '''Animatros''' in the Japanese version of the series ''[[Transformers: Galaxy Force]]''.

The ship that transported the Cyber Planet Key to this world was called [[Hyperborea]]. Home of one of four [[Cyber Planet Key]]s (which exists in the form of a statue called the Beast Totem) and ancient Transformer colonies sent to reacquire them. The Beast Totem is in a temple where there are different wall carvings of Earth's animal life. All of Jungle Planet's inhabitants have animal alternate forms. Jungle Planet is a lush, green planet that contains dangerous volcanic activity, dangerous seismic activity, [[Thunderstorm|lightning storms]], and monstrous sentient plant. The Jungle Planet Transformers took animal alternate modes.

For a time, the Jungle Planet Transformers were leaderless leaving their world torn by violence and poverty. Many were taken under the tutelage under [[Zen]]-master [[Backstop (Transformers)|Backstop]] in the way of non-violence and self-defense. Eventually, [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]], a student of Backstop, grew impatient with his people's suffering and forced a rebellion against those taking advantage of the chaos, strong-arming his way into leadership position in a series of battles to determine who would be strong enough to become leader. Corrupted by his new-found power and position, Scourge forced a "peace through tyranny" campaign, bringing his people the peace and prosperity he promised them, but only through a dictatorship ruled by the credo of "might makes right." However, Scourge couldn't totally rid himself of his old master's teachings and he enforced a strict series of laws regulating disputes being settled only through formal duels of strength with sabotage and especially unjustified death of a defeated foe as the planet's highest offense.

Overhaul was sent to acquire the Cyber Planet Key here while being told not to interact with its inhabitants. This ended up being the opposite when Overhaul was rescued from a seismic activity by Backstop. While protecting Snarl from Scourge and Megatron, Overhaul was transformed into Leobreaker as a result of a combination of tapping into the power of Jungle Planet's Cyber Planet Key and scanning a wall-carving of a [[lion]]. Eventually, Leobreaker, Backstop, and Snarl convinced [[Optimus Prime]] to rethink his credo of non-interaction with local customs in order to acquire the Key.

The ''Hyperborea'' ship would later carry the people of Jungle Planet to safety (along with another ship, [[Ogygia]]), after the planet was consumed by the Black Hole. However, when the Black Hole was destroyed, the planet was restored. When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Jungle Planet back into its orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast, and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.

Known inhabitants of Jungle Planet include:

* '''[[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]]''' - The [[dictator]] of Jungle Planet, a former student of Backstop, and an old friend of Snarl. He transforms into a quadrupedal [[dragon]].
* '''Snarl''' - A student of Backstop and an old friend of Scourge. He transforms into a [[gray wolf]].
* '''Backstop''' - A wise [[Elder (administrative title)|elder]] on Jungle Planet and a Zen-master of Scourge, Snarl, and Undermine. He transforms into a [[black rhinoceros]].
* '''Undermine''' - An enforcer of Scourge and the brother of Repugnus. He transforms into a [[Spinosaurus]].
* '''Brimstone''' - An enforcer of Scourge. He transforms into a [[Pteranodon]].
* '''Wreckloose''' - An enforcer of Scourge who only appeared in the toyline. He transforms into a [[Komodo dragon]].
* '''Repugnus''' - An inhabitant of a swamp near the Steel Shard Mountains and the brother of Undermine. Unlike Undermine, Repugnus doesn't agree with Scourge's methods. He transforms into a [[Spinosaurus]].
* '''Shrapnel''' - He was referenced on Undermine's Cyber Key bio.

Also on Jungle Planet are generic Transformers that each resemble a different animal such as a [[Brontosaurus]], an [[owl]], a [[lobster]], a [[deer]], a [[giraffe]], and a tropical bird.

==Junkion==
'''Junkion''', also known as '''the Planet of Junk''' is the home planet of the Junkions, a group of Transformers who transform into motorcycles. The planet and the Junkions first appeared in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. It is not really a planet in the normal sense of the word, but rather, a landfill in space that has accumulated enough mass to be held together by gravity. Depending on the storyline, it has been depicted as either a traditional spherical planet or as an elongated slab. In the original movie art and storyboards, the Planet of Junk was intended to be a spherical planet, with several rounded slabs seeming to rise off of its surface. In the end, only the "northernmost" rounded section of the planetoid was retained on film. In the third volume of the Devil's due comics the android [[Serpentor]] downloaded information on the history of [[Cybertron]] from [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]]. Mentioned among that information was the [[Quintessons]], [[Alpha Trion]], [[Megatron]] and Soundwave, the planet of Junk, a warrior named [[Optimus Primal]] and the [[Matrix of Leadership|Autobot Matrix of Leadership]]. In ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'', the Autobots aboard the Ark come upon the planet Junkion where they meet [[Wreck-Gar]] and the other Junkions. It is later discovered that Junkion is made up of the wreckage of various ships drawn together by the gravity of the [[Requiem Blaster]], and subsequently ripped apart when the blaster is stolen by the Decepticons.

Known inhabitants of Junkion are:

* '''[[Wreck-Gar]]''' - Leader of the Junkions in most continuities, Wreck-Gar is a curious robot with a mustache and a beard. In the Generation 1 continuity, he–like most Junkions–turns into a motorcycle and is incredibly resilient, able to quickly put himself back together after being damaged. He and all the Junkions learned how to speak English from human television broadcasts received across space, and as such when they talk they typically do in quotations from television, such as "Offer expires while you wait-operators are standing by." In ''Transformers: Exiles'', Wreck-Gar turns into a Cybertronian garbage truck and speaks by shouting, often necessary when operating near his planet's smelting furnaces. He forms an uneasy alliance with the Autobots when they arrived on the planet, but proves less accommodating when their conflict with Megatron rips the planet apart. He and several other Junkions are later captured by Thundertron and the Star Seekers, a band of pirates, and forced to build a space bridge into their vessel, the ''Tidal Wave.'' In ''[[Transformers: Retribution]]'', Wreck-Gar is used to lure the Decepticons into a Star Seeker trap, but takes advantage of the confusion to escape and make his way back to Junkion.
* '''Junkyard''' - Junkyard is unlike most junkions, and usually speaks quite normally using just plain English, without referencing TV shows or media. He is a very skilled in business and is a very skilled technician. Direct combat is not his forte. Junkyard is also known as Junkheap.
* '''Scrapheap''' - Scrapheap is a rebellious junkion, whose average day is racing motorcycles in knock down rallies. Like most junkions he is usually quoting TV and media. He wants to start a career of his home planet, and will do whatever it takes to make it happen.
*  '''Nancy''' - Nancy is a Junkion who appears to be the consort of the Junkion leader, Wreck-Gar, and seems to have some sort of relationship with a him as well. Nancy just like all Junkions can be blasted to pieces without taking any noticeable permanent damage, and is capable of repairing herself within seconds. Nancy is the only known female junkion, and the only transformer with a human name.
* '''Pinion''' - A Junkion tasked with loaded junk into a furnace for recycling. He was later revealed to be one of the components of [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]].
* '''Axer''' - Not a true Junkion, but rather a Decepticon bounty hunter stranded on the artificial planet by an accident with a wrecked ship. Axer professed loyalty to Megatron, but was reluctant to share all his information with his supposed leader. He was later captured by the Star Seekers near the end of ''Exiles'', but helped Wreck-Gar escape in order to effect his own return to the Decepticons in ''Retribution.'' Unfortunately, Megatron had little use for the double-agent, and turned him over to Soundwave for torture.
* '''Shearbolt''' - A Junkion who was found murdered by the Autobots after being impersonated by Makeshift, the Decepticon Shifter.
* '''Detritus''' - A close advisor to Wreck-Gar.
* '''Cannonspring''' - One of Nexus Prime's components, whose ship ended up on Junkion after a space bridge accident. Apparently killed, he was revived in the close proximity of Pinion, Chaindrive, Clocker, and Mainspring, and the five of them reunited into their true form.

==Jörmungandr==
'''Jörmungandr''' is a [[Snake|serpent]]-shaped planet. It was featured in the ''Beast Wars Neo'' manga where it was Cohrada's homeworld.

==Kaiba-5==
'''Kaiba-5''' is a planet that was referenced in ''[[Transformers: The Game]]''.

==Klo==
'''Klo''' appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]] ''[[Transformers (comics)|Transformers]]'' comic book series, and is notable for being the location of the final battle of both the U.S. and UK versions of the series. Klo was introduced in issue #80 in the U.S. version,&lt;ref name="TFArchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfarchive.com/comics/marvel/?s=us_71_80#80|title=TFArchive - Transformers Comics - Marvel Comics Guide|work=tfarchive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #331 in the UK version.&lt;ref name="TFArchive"/&gt; Klo is a beautiful, peaceful planet, rich in natural resources and inhabited by benign, harmless creatures called Klozians. The planet was invaded by [[Decepticon]]s under [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]]'s leadership, after the [[Transformers]] had won the war against [[Unicron]]. Following Unicron's death, [[Cybertron]] seemed to be in danger of being destroyed, so the Decepticons fled the planet in search of new worlds to conquer. They selected Klo, where they started mercilessly slaughtering the native Klozians. The [[Autobot]]s tracked the Decepticons to Klo and attempted to rescue the Klozians, but weak leadership from [[Grimlock]] led to heavy casualties by the Autobots and their forces were nearly wiped out. Finally, a newly resurrected [[Optimus Prime]] and the Last Autobot arrived on Klo, and while Optimus Prime fought against Bludgeon, the Last Autobot resurrected the dead Autobots. Facing invincible opposition, Bludgeon and his Decepticons retreated back into space and Optimus Prime and his Autobots stayed to help the Klozians rebuild their planet.

==Lanarq==
'''Lanarq''' is a robotic planet who waged a centuries-long war with Xetaxxis.

==Lithone==
'''Lithone''' was a planet populated by intelligent Transformer-like machine life. It was destroyed by [[Unicron]] in the Earth year 2005. The last known survivor of the planet, Kranix, was sentenced to death and executed by the [[Quintesson]]s after being found "innocent" of an unspecified crime (It is rumored that the [[Quintesson]]s often judge lifeforms with the crime of "stealing" Cybertron from them 12 million years prior, as seen in the Five Faces of Darkness miniseries, but Kranix was from Lithone, so the "jury reach a verdict" of innocent—yet Kup and Hot Rod, of Cybertron, were found innocent in the film as well).

In the script and in the Marvel Comics ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'' adaptation, the Lithonians could transform into [[starship|spaceships]]. Lithone has also been referenced as "Glithos" or "Glinthos" due to the unclear articulation of its last surviving native, Kranix, before his execution.

==Lucifer==
'''Lucifer''' is a planet that is under the control of the Decepticons.

==LV-117==
'''LV-117''' is a planet in an unknown part of space that contains dangerous robot-eating animals.

==Menonia==
'''Menonia''' is a planet that exists in an alternate dimension as seen in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Madman's Paradise." Its technology is based on Earth's Middle Ages and magic is prominent here. Known inhabitants of Menonina include [[List of avian humanoids|Bird People]], [[Dragon]]s, Humans, Reptile-Birds (a [[Dragon]]/[[Pterosaur]] creature), Tree-[[Centaur]]s (a race of centaur/[[ent]] creatures), and Wood Men.

==Mumu-Obscura==
'''Mumu-Obscura''' was a militarily contested and strategically significant world in the Eigerson-48 star system, until a group of warriors called the Reapers exterminated its population and poisoned its resources. It was featured in IDW Comics.

==Nebulos==
'''Nebulos''', sometimes known as '''Nebulon''', is a [[planet]] in the [[fiction]]al [[Transformers universes]].

Nebulos is a somewhat [[Earth]]-like planet far away from both Earth and [[Cybertron]], and is the home to a [[human]]oid race known as the Nebulans. The planet and its inhabitants were first introduced as the back story for [[Hasbro]]'s new [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] and [[Targetmaster]] toys, later expanded by the [[Powermaster (Transformers)|Powermaster]] toys. These toys are [[robot]]s that transform into [[vehicle]]s or [[animal]]s, and include Nebulan sidekicks that transform into the robot's head, into a [[weapon]], or into the vehicle's [[engine]]. The toys themselves never expanded on Nebulon or its inhabitants, but both the TV series (in its fourth and final season) and the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Transformers (comics)|comic book]] did, with drastically different, mutually inconsistent versions. In the TV series, the Nebulons were shown to be green-skinned. The planet Nebulos does not exist in the Japanese continuation of the franchise. Thus, with no Nebulos and no Nebulons, a different origin was given for the Headmaster and Targetmaster Transformers.

In the Marvel comic book, Fortress Maximus had grown weary of the [[civil war]] on Cybertron, and led a group of Autobots in search of a new planet where they could live in peace. They settled on Nebulos, but the Decepticons followed them. The comic book version of Nebulos is an idyllic, peaceful world where [[war]] has long since been discontinued and all weapons have been locked away. It is governed by a council of peers. The arrival of the Transformers scared the Nebulans, and they were forced to hold an emergency council meeting to deal with these strange new creatures. The Autobots wanted to live in peace with the Nebulans, but the Decepticons wanted to conquer them and kill the Autobots, so the Autobot-Decepticon civil war restarted on Nebulon. Both sides allied themselves with Nebulans, the Autobots generally with common people who had become familiar with them and did not see them as a threat, and the Decepticons generally with [[criminal]]s or corrupt [[politician]]s. The Nebulans, fearing the Transformers' civil war would plunge their own world back into war, finally banished the Transformers and their Nebulan sidekicks back into space, where they finally arrived on Earth.

In the TV series, the Transformers arrived on Nebulos in the three-part episode ''The Rebirth'', which were the only episodes of the fourth season, and the last episode ever produced in the United States. The [[Autobot]]s' spaceship was plunged to Nebulos accidentally by a gigantic [[Voltage spike|power surge]] from the [[Plasma Energy Chamber]], and the [[Decepticon]]s followed them. The TV show version of Nebulos is a hostile, dying world, where a group of eleven rulers known as "[[Hive (Transformers)|The Hive]]" controls the entire world from an underground city, abusing their power for their personal pleasure and oppressing the workers with various [[mechanics|mechanical]] devices controlled by their minds. Upon seeing the Autobots, the Nebulon workers mistook them for machines controlled by The Hive, and imprisoned them, later to destroy them. However, an attack by the Decepticons convinced the workers that the Autobots were good guys, and so they were released and allied themselves with the workers. The Decepticons did the same with the members of The Hive (after being co-erced).

In the Ladybird books continuity, the Nebulans were a race of small transforming robots. The Nebulans have appeared once more in [[IDW Publishing]]'s new continuity, in [[The Transformers: Stormbringer]]. Their planet was attacked by [[Thunderwing]] as part of an unholy pact to rejuvenate Cybertron. Despite the best efforts of the local Decepticon cell (led by [[Dreadwind]] and [[Darkwing]]) much of the planet was devastated. It also appeared chronologically earlier in the [[The Transformers: Spotlight|Spotlight]] issue on [[Ultra Magnus]], where [[Scorponok]] was already seen to be developing the [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] process. Nebulos was also mentioned by [[Swindle (Transformers)|Swindle]] in the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' episode, ''Decepticon Air''.

Nebulos is also featured in several stories of the "Ask [[Vector Prime]]" [[Facebook]] feature. Among these were the ''Armada'' storyline, in which the Nebulans Hi-Q and Arcana were responsible for Overload and Rollout being merged into a Headmaster being in order to save them both from debilitating medical conditions,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/posts/725582070907099&lt;/ref&gt; and a split reality in which the monstrous Zarak Maximus was born from the fusion of Mo Zarak with the remains of Fortress Maximus and Scorponok.

==New Kaon==
'''New Kaon''' is a planet where all kinds of Decepticons that are fleeing from the Autobots take refuge. It was featured in the comic book tie-in to ''[[Transformers Animated]]''.

==Ocean Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Ocean Planet''' was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly covered in an ocean.

==Paradise==
'''Paradise''' is a planet that is a natural wonderland of vast [[jungle]]s, roaring [[river]]s and [[waterfall]]s, smoking [[volcano]]es, and beasts of all shapes and sizes, all co-existing in harmony with the tribes of human-like beings living there. Although choosing to live a primitive existence dressing in robes made from animal skins and living in yurts, the people of the planet Paradise defy appearances by being intelligent, well-spoken creatures.

In the ''Transformers: Headmasters'' episode "Head Formation of Friendship," Paradise was targeted by Galvatron and the Decepticons who were on a quest to drain the energy from planets until they are driven away by the Autobots.

==Paradron==
'''Paradron''' is a peaceful, Energon-rich planet, accessible only through a vortex. Several Autobots fled there when the war against the Decepticons began and set up a colony there. The Autobot [[Sandstorm (Transformers)|Sandstorm]] was one of the inhabitants of this planet. It was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Fight or Flee" when the Decepticons discovered this planet and enslaved the pacifist Autobots. After the Autobots rescued the pacifist Autobots, Rodimus Prime had Paradron destroyed with most of its inhabitants being transferred to Cybertron.

In [[Fun Publications]]' ''Shattered Glass'' storyline, Paradron was a prison planet where Optimus Prime exiled some of his more dangerous Autobot enemies, including Ultra Magnus and Wreck-Gar.

==Pequod==
'''Pequod''' is an oceanic planet that is home to large [[whale]]-like creatures called the Klud. It was featured in Marvel Comics.

==Pirate Planet==
'''Pirate Planet''' is a planet where [[space pirate]]s of all kinds store their loot.

==Plains Planet==
In ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'', '''Plains Planet''' (also called '''Grass Planet''') was the name of a world created by Alpha Q using the power of his Energon sun. It is mostly filled with grasslands.

==Planet Q==
'''Planet Q''' is a desert planet that was featured in ''[[Transformers: Energon]]''. It was home to Alpha Q, Scorponok, and the Terrorcons, and was consumed by Unicron prior to the start of the series. Alpha Q's desire to restore his home planet using Unicron's power served as his primary motivation throughout ''Energon'', and was also the reason for Rodimus' willingness to work with him.

==Planet X==
'''Planet X''' is the name of two different planets in the ''Transformers Universe, the first of which was seen in ''[[Transformers: Victory]]''.

The Planet X featured in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' was first seen in a recording found by the human Lori and the Velocitronian leader, Override, after the latter's battle with [[Scourge (Transformers)|Scourge]] on Giant Planet. It was shown to be a highly advanced world like Cybertron, purple in color, with two golden rings around it forming an X pattern. Later, it would be revealed that Planet X was the dominant force in the alternate universe that Giant Planet had been drawn into. It was capable of non-orbital space travel and annihilating less advanced civilizations it came across. This, however, caused life in its universe to 'die' and, in an attempt to rectify the problem, its denizens sought out another life-rich planet to subjugate. The planet they found, Giant Planet, did not take kindly to being invaded, and its inhabitants reformatted themselves into larger forms with help of the Cyber Planet Key in order to combat the threat of the off-worlders.

Left with few options and little hope of victory, the inhabitants of Planet X powered up their ultimate weapon: a [[Death Star]]-like planetary cannon, in order to wipe out the transformers on Giant Planet. Unfortunately, the cannon was too powerful for them to control and the result destroyed their world. The survivors, including [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Cybertron|Soundwave]] and [[Sideways (Transformers)#Transformers: Cybertron|Sideways]], were scattered all across their universe, and were eventually thrown into the Transformers' proper universe.  Believing Giant Planet to be at fault for their home planet's destruction, the various Transformers plotted revenge against them. In addition, the Giant Planet Transformers also felt at least partially responsible for Planet X's annihilation. This created their custom of building cities and then abandoning them, which became a perpetual, planet-wide act of penance. Eventually, Sideways and Soundwave managed to return to Giant Planet, and sought the [[Cyber Planet Keys]] in order to exact their revenge.

"Ask [[Vector Prime]]" would later feature Planet X in additional storylines, often involving its origin. In one reality, it was the broken body of Unicron from ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', shunted into another dimension by the energies of the Matrix of Leadership. Arriving on the edge of the Earth solar system of that reality, Unicron set out to repair himself but was hindered by the actions of Megatron utilizing a Star Harvester. As in the ''Energon'' series, Unicron revived many of the Transformers he had previously consumed in an effort to expedite his recovery, and the new race renamed their home Planet X. They then traveled to the world of the ''Victory'' series and attacked it, but the efforts of the Autobots using Zone energy split the planet into two: the beautiful world seen in ''Victory'' and one virtually identical to the ''Cybertron'' version, which was later destroyed by the inhabitants of an alternate Gigantion known as Gigalonia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/AskVectorPrime/posts/673768952755078&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions included a ''Cybertron'' Planet X that was once part of the Liege Maximo's Cybertronian Empire, and another in which Planet X was once the home of a smaller scale Unicron who used a cyber key to unite himself with his former homeworld and domain.

==Pz-zazz==
'''Pz-zazz''' is a highly technological planet. Pz-zazz was hopelessly corrupted by [[crime]] until an ancient bird icon was returned to its place and purified the planet.

==Quintessa==
'''Quintessa''' is the home planet of the infamous [[Quintesson]]s as seen in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. Unlike most other planets, Quintessa was shown having a more [[spiral]]-like shape than a simple sphere. The Quintessons eventually destroyed their own home planet in the Generation 1 continuity. In the ''Prime'' continuity, Quintessa is the capital of the so-called "Quintesson Co-Prosperity Sphere," and its location is a closely guarded secret.

==Regalis V==
'''Regalis V''' is a planet filled with thick [[jungle]]s and filled with ambulatory [[plant]]s. It was featured in the ''[[Beast Machines]]'' episode "Home Soil" as the planet where the Cybertronian crew that Botanica was a part of landed.

An inhospitable world consisting of plasma lava and rock, its environment led to the degradation of Galvatron's logic circuits, making him even more unstable and dangerous than he had been previously. Upon being revived and escaping the planet, Galvatron fired an energy blast that caused Thrull to explode.

==Torkulon==
'''Torkulon''' is a planet whose main source of commerce is [[psychotherapy]]. [[Galvatron]] was brought there for treatment in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "Webworld", following his increasingly erratic behavior following the event of ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. The entire planet was a living computer whose circuitry was woven by arachnid-like beings known as the Alya, and manipulated by a furry humanoid race of size comparable to the Transformers themselves. Despite multiple methods used, the Torkulon were unable to cure Galvatron, who madness infected the planet and caused it to go out of control. Galvatron himself then destroyed the Torkulon computer core, leaving the planet devastated, though with the possibility of rebuilding.

==Twin Star==
'''Twin Star''' is a group of two diametrically opposed planets Sperity and Tourin. It was featured in ''[[Transformers: Headmasters]]''.

* '''Sperity''' is rich in energy and covered in glistening cities that are inhabited by small robots.

==Unicron==
{{Main|Unicron}}
'''Unicron''' is a fictional character from the [[Transformers universes|''Transformers'' universe]] and [[Transformers (toyline)|toyline]]. Created by [[Floro Dery]], he was introduced in the 1986 animated film ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A brief history of the Transformers |work=Malaysia Star |date= |url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2004/11/9/features/20041108160036&amp;sec=features |accessdate=2010-10-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622055026/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2004%2F11%2F9%2Ffeatures%2F20041108160036&amp;sec=features |archivedate=2011-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reprised that role in Atari's 2003 [[Transformers (2003 video game)|Transformers video game]]. Unicron is a prodigiously large robot whose scale reaches planetary proportions, and he is also able to transform into a mechanical [[planet]]. Unicron's origin has expanded over the years from simply being a large robot to being a God of chaos who devours realities. He often employs the help of [[Decepticons]] in his work. In some stories, he is considered part of the origin of the Decepticon forces.

==Varas Centralus==
'''Varas Centralus''' is a planet situated in the Kol star system. It is featured in IDW Comics.

==Vehicon==
:''For the Transformers group, see [[Vehicon]]''.

'''Vehicon''' is a planet where Reverse Convoy is the leader of the Autobots.

==Velocitron==
'''Velocitron''' (known as '''Speedia''' in ''Galaxy Force'' and '''Speed Planet''' in promotional materials) is a [[fiction]]al planet featured in ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]'' and is the location of one of four ancient Transformer colonies that lost contact with the home world of [[Cybertron]] long ago, along with [[Earth (Transformers)|Earth]], Jungle Planet, and Gigantion. Each of these colonies possess a [[Cyber Planet Key]], containing a fragment of the power of [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]]. The name Velocitron is used infrequently. The planet is more commonly referred to as "the Speed Planet" or simply "Speed Planet." The planet's full, formal name appears to be "Velocitron, the Speed Planet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panelsonpages.com/?p=5401|title=Rolling Out for 25 Years – Cybertron|work=Panels on Pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variable [[desert]] planet, it was [[terraformed]] into a global race track with the pursuit of perfect speed and performance the primary motivating force in its society and culture. Disputes are settled in formal races with the winner claiming victory over the dispute as well. Automated repair machines maintain the race courses, which include tracks featuring various environments and obstacles as well as simpler straightforward courses. Characteristics of Velocitron's inhabitants include translucent wheels of unknown material, and double-barrelled long-range weaponry.

The planet's leader is [[Override (Transformers)|Override]] as she is the fastest of all Velocitronian Transformers with no equal planetside. She holds semi-annual planetwide races to determine the next leader with the planet's Cyber Planet Key (which exists in the form of a trophy called the Planet Cup) awarded to the winner. The location of Velocitron was first re-discovered by [[Megatron]] using the map he had stolen from [[Vector Prime]]. Vector Prime himself later located the planet as well, by studying a copy of the Atlantis Pattern found at a museum in Mexico.

[[Hot Shot (Transformers)|Hot Shot]] felt right at home on the planet and participated in the planet-wide race alongside a few of his [[Autobot]] comrades, despite reservations by [[Optimus Prime]] who advised them not to interact with any of the inhabitants. Despite quarreling with his companion [[Red Alert (Transformers)|Red Alert]], Hot Shot managed to overcome the challenges of Speed Planet and won the great race. In addition to gaining Override's friendship, the Autobots also learned a valuable lesson about interacting with the inhabitants of the different planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crushable.com/entertainment/transformers-cybertron-dvd-review/|title="Transformers Cybertron": DVD review|work=Crushable}}&lt;/ref&gt; The starship that carried the Cyber Planet Key to this world was named ''[[Ogygia]]''.

In the final episode of ''Transformers: Cybertron'' the "''Speedia 500''" race is held to determine the leader of Velocitron, which Hot Shot wins. [[Dirt Boss]] comes in second, Ransack in third, Dark Crumplezone in fourth, Brakedown in fifth, and Clocker in sixth. Override didn't even compete, as she joins the new Space Bridge project led by Optimus Prime. The name of the race is a reference to the Japanese name of the planet, which is Speedia.

Velocitron is one of the planets mentioned in the first chapter of ''[[Transformers: Exodus]]'' in which many Cybertronians are populated. The sequel novel ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]'' features Optimus Prime and the other Autobots aboard the ''Ark'' coming to Velocitron where they meet Blurr and Override. Velocitronians are obsessed with speed, so that their lives are centered around going faster or helping others race. The Autobots soon discover a war brewing on Velocitron between Override and Ransack, the former sympathizing with the Autobots while the latter finds Decepticon philosophies more appealing. The two sides soon see conflict, and after the Ark's departure are visited not only by Megatron and the Decepticons but also by a group of pirates known as the Star Seekers under Thundertron. Velocitron in this continuity is also threatened by the instability of its sun, which is threatening to go supernova.

''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' included a mention of Velocitron by that series' version of Blurr, who notes that it consists of "all roads, no speed limits."

Known inhabitants of Velocitron are:

* '''Override''' - A female Transformer and the leader of Velocitron. In ''Cybertron'' Override refuses to turn over the Cyber Planet Key to anyone unless they can win the planet's biggest race. After the Autobots succeed, she joins their cause throughout the rest of the series. In ''Exiles'', she and Ransack are the rival rulers of the planet and their disputes turn into armed conflict shortly after the arrival of the Autobots. Despite this, she fights bravely against Ransack's forces, an invading crew of pirates, and even the arrival of the Decepticons.
* '''Brakedown''' - The oldest living inhabitant of Velocitron.
* '''Clocker''' - A young inhabitant of Velocitron that is often seen with Brakedown in ''Cybertron''. In ''Exiles'', he quickly becomes attached to the Autobots and departs Velocitron with them along with Mainspring. He was later revealed to be one of the five components of [[Nexus Prime (Transformers)|Nexus Prime]].
* '''Crumplezone''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who was recruited by Megatron.
* '''Dirt Boss''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who temporarily sided with the Decepticons.
* '''Ransack''' - An inhabitant of Velocitron who was recruited by Megatron in ''Cybertron.'' In the novel ''Exiles'', he is one of two leaders of Velocitron and quickly expresses Decepticon sympathies. When Megatron arrives he initially believes that the two of them will be equals, but Megatron quickly makes it clear that he is in command.
* '''Skyfall''' -
* '''Swerve''' -
* '''Mainspring''' - A Velocitronian mechanic loyal to Override and part of Blurr's pit crew. He later left Velocitron with the Ark and was subsequently revealed to be one of Nexus Prime's components.
* '''Hightail''' - One of Ransack's loyalists in ''Exiles'', Hightail believes that he previously went by another name but forgot it after long ages.
* '''Armco''' - A Velocitronian welder with no strong allegiance to either Ransack or Override. He was later contacted by the Autobot Prowl and asked to provide information in the event that Megatron's agent-not known at that time to be the Shifter Makeshitft-gave specifics on when Megatron would be arriving on the planet.
* '''Backfire''' - Another of Ransack's flunkies, Backfire warmed to the Decepticon cause due to feeling oppressed by Velocitron's social order, where only the fastest competitors would receive sponsorship. He found work as a mechanic, but found it degrading since he received only a fraction of the glory he felt he deserved for making the victories of others possible. As such, he hoped that under Megatron's regime he would be treated as he deserved. His enthusiasm prompted Makeshift, Megatron's spy aboard the Ark, to make him Megatron's contact amongst Ransack's forces.
* '''Blueshift''' - One of Override's engineers in ''Exiles.''
* '''[[Blurr]]''' - A racer native to Velocitron only in the ''[[Transformers: Prime]]'' continuity. One of Velocitron's fastest racers-not to mention talkers-he helps the Autobots by providing them with one of the fragments of the Blades of Time, previously built into the Speedia Trophy. When hostilities break out on Velocitron, he becomes a firm supporter of Override.
* '''Syncol''' - A Velocitronian mechanic who had the misfortune of mistaking [[Starscream]] for [[Silverbolt]] when the former arrived on Velocitron. Fortunately, after being questioned by the Seeker and Megatron, he was allowed to go free.

==Vs'Qs==
'''Vs'Qs''' is actually a moon, not a planet. Vs'Qs is a barren, desolate place, devoid of any natural life. Vs'Qs was the place where the body of [[Optimus Prime]] happened to land on, having been blasted off into space randomly after his death. The [[Matrix of Leadership]] contained within the body was found during the [[Matrix Quest]].

==Wednesday==
'''Wednesday''' is an [[ocean]] planet that is the home of Princess Rage, a Transformer who can turn into a [[jellyfish]]. It was featured in the ''Beast Wars Neo'' manga.

==Xeptos==
'''Xeptos''' is a planet in the Microverse.

==Xetaxxis==
'''Xetaxxis''' is a robotic planet that waged a centuries-long war with Lanark.

==Yst==
'''Yst''' is an Earth-like planet that existed 700 lightyears away from the Unicron Singularity.

==Zamojin==
'''Zamojin''' is a planet sealed by a quadrant lock by the Quintessons and was featured in ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' episode "The Face of Nijika." It is an advanced samurai culture with telepathic power generated by starlight.

==Zarak==
'''Zarak''' is a planet that appeared in ''[[Transformers: Headmasters]]''. It is located within a dark nebula and is where Scorponok used a slave labor force of Beastformers to construct his giant transtector MegaZarak.

==Zel Samine==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80409">[[File:Flanders exposition at the Richelieu wing of the Louvre.jpg|thumb|300px|The cycle in the Richelieu wing of the Louvre]]
The '''Marie de' Medici Cycle''' is a series of twenty-four paintings by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] commissioned by [[Marie de' Medici]], widow of [[Henry IV of France]], for the [[Luxembourg Palace]] in Paris. Rubens received the commission in the autumn of 1621.  After negotiating the terms of the contract in early 1622, the project was to be completed within two years, coinciding with the marriage of Marie's daughter, [[Henrietta Maria]].  Twenty-one of the paintings depict Marie's own struggles and triumphs in life. The remaining three are portraits of herself and her parents.&lt;ref name="belkin173-5"/&gt; The paintings now hang in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

==Commission==
Much speculation exists on the exact circumstances under which Marie de' Medici decided to commission Rubens to paint "such a grandiose project, conceived in truly heroic proportions".&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 2"&gt;Saward, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; John Coolidge suggests the cycle may have even  been commissioned to rival another famous series of Rubens, ''The Constantine Tapestries'', which he designed in his studio at the same time as the first several paintings of the Medici Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Rubens prepared a number of oil sketches, by the request of [[Louis XIII]], the son of Marie de’ Medici and successor to the throne, which may have influenced the Queen's decision to commission Rubens for the cycle by the end of the year 1621.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 2"/&gt; The immortalizing of her life, however, seems to be the most apparent reason for the Queen's choice to commission a painter who was capable of executing such a demanding task. Peter Paul Rubens had already established himself as an exceptional painter and also had the advantage of sustaining close ties with several important people of the time, including Marie de' Medici's sister, the wife of one of Rubens's first important patrons, the Duke of Gonzaga. The information about the commission in the contract Rubens signed is far from detailed and focuses mainly on the number of pictures in the cycle dedicated to the Queen's life, and is far less specific when it comes to the cycle praising her husband [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The contract stated that Rubens was to paint all the figures, which presumably allowed him to employ assistants for backgrounds and details.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marie de' Medici==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 095b.jpg|Maria de' Medici|thumb|upright]]
[[Marie de' Medici]] became the second wife to King [[Henry IV of France]] in a [[proxy marriage|marriage by proxy]] on 5 October 1600 by the power invested in her uncle, [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany]].&lt;ref name="belkin182"&gt;Belkin, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; When Henry was assassinated in 1610, [[Louis XIII]], his son and successor to the throne, was only eight years old. Louis' mother, Marie, acted as his regent as commanded by the [[Franks|Frankish]] [[Salic law]] in case of an infant ruler. However, even after Louis came of age at thirteen in 1614, the queen continued ruling in his stead. In 1617, Louis XIII finally decided to take governing matters in his own hands at the age of fifteen and the queen was exiled to Blois.

Louis and his mother were not reconciled for over four years, and finally in 1621 Marie was permitted to return to Paris.  Upon her return, Marie focused on building and decorating the [[Luxembourg Palace]], an enormous undertaking in which [[Peter Paul Rubens]] played a key role.&lt;ref name="belkin173-5" /&gt; Rubens, then court painter to the [[Duchy of Mantua]] under [[Vincenzo I Gonzaga]],&lt;ref name="belkin42"&gt;Belkin, 42&lt;/ref&gt; had first met Marie at her proxy wedding in Florence in 1600.&lt;ref name="smith127"&gt;Smith, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1621, Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint two large series depicting the lives of herself and her late husband,  Henry IV, to adorn both wings of the first floor of the Luxembourg Palace.&lt;ref name="belkin173-5"&gt;Belkin, pp. 173–175.&lt;/ref&gt; The first series of 21 canvases depicts the life of Marie in largely [[allegory|allegorical]] terms, and was finished by the end of 1624, to coincide with the celebrations surrounding the wedding of her daughter, [[Henrietta Maria]] to [[Charles I of England]] on 11 May 1625.&lt;ref name="belkin175-6"&gt;Belkin, pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle of paintings dedicated to the life of  Henry IV was never completed, although some preliminary sketches survive.&lt;ref name="belkin175-6"/&gt; (See [[#Henry IV Cycle]] below).  The fact that the Henry IV series was not realized can be attributed in part to Marie de' Medici being permanently banned from France by her son in 1631.  She escaped to Brussels, and later died in exile in 1642 in the same house that the Peter Paul Rubens's family had occupied more than fifty years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin pp. 174-175&lt;/ref&gt;

While this cycle was one of Rubens's first great commissions, Marie de' Medici's life proved a difficult one to portray. Rubens had the task of creating twenty-one paintings about a woman whose life could be measured by her marriage to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and the births of her six children, one of which died in infancy.&lt;ref name="belkin178"&gt;Belkin, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, women did not in general receive such laudatory tributes, although Rubens, if anyone, was well equipped for the job, having a great respect for "the virtues of the opposite sex", as seen in his commissions for the [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Archduchess Isabella]].&lt;ref name="belkin178"/&gt;  Furthermore, unlike her husband, Marie's life was neither graced with triumphant victories nor punctuated by vanquished foes.&lt;ref name="belkin178"/&gt;  Rather, implications of political scandal in her life made any literal depiction of the events far too controversial for Rubens to execute without incurring the disapproval from others in government.&lt;ref name="belkin179"&gt;Belkin, p.179&lt;/ref&gt;  Far from failing, Rubens demonstrated his impressive knowledge of [[classical literature]] and artistic traditions,&lt;ref name="belkin170"&gt;Belkin, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; by using allegorical representations to both glorify the mundane aspects and sensitively illustrate the less favorable events in Marie's life. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries iconography of the Christian world, as well as that of the Greek and Roman pantheon was understood by well-educated artists and citizens alike, and a familiar device used in artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens painted extravagant images of the Queen Mother surrounded by ancient gods and at times even deified her using these devices. The ambiguity of the figures was essentially used to depict Marie in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens's Medici commission was an inspiration for other artists as well, particularly the French painters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] (1684–1721) and [[François Boucher]] (1703–1770) who produced copies from the Medici cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rubens ==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens.jpg|Peter Paul Rubens|thumb|upright]]
[[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1577–1640) was a highly influential artist in Northern Europe, widely believed to have played an important role in shaping the style and visual language of his time.  The overseer or creator of more than three thousand woodcuts, engravings and paintings in various mediums, Rubens's works include historical, religious and allegorical paintings, altarpieces, portraits and landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  He is particularly known for his portrayal of human figures, lush and richly colored fabrics and well-developed themes often derived from both Christian and classical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;   Rubens's studies of classical, Greek, and Latin texts influenced his career and set him apart from other painters during his time.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, Rubens studied under Flemish artists such as [[Otto van Veen]],&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; but his most notable influences come from the time he spent in Italy where he studied ancient sculpture and the works of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]], [[Caravaggio]], [[Titian]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. It was during his time in Italy that he began to make copies of [[classical sculpture]], such as the [[Laocoon]], and collect drawings done by other artists.  However, the artist was also an avid collector of both reproductions and original works, not only from the masters of the Italian Renaissance, but more predominantly from his contemporaries.  Rubens owned more prints from his contemporary, [[Adriaen Brouwer]], than any other of his Italian influences or his own contemporaries, although it is suggested that Rubens's compassion and concern for Brouwer's career may have been the influential cause for his collection of Brouwer's work.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;  This record of visual history and the influences of his contemporaries, some who became lifelong friends of Rubens, would make an imprint on his art throughout his entire life.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 41-59&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rubens was commissioned to paint the Marie de' Medici cycle, he was quite possibly the most famous and skilled artist in Northern Europe, and was especially appreciated for his monumental religious works, commissioned by various councils and churches in the area.&lt;ref name="belkin170"/&gt; However, the Medici commission was welcomed by Rubens as an opportunity to apply his skills within a secular scene.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of Marie de' Medici's commission continued throughout the rest of Rubens's career. Not only did he further establish and publicize his skill, but also the similarities that exist in his later works, such as stylistic components and themes, undeniably reflect the Medici series.

==The Paintings==
[[File:Destiny of marie de medici.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|''The Destiny of Maria de' Medici'']]
Originally the paintings were hung clockwise in chronological order, decorating the walls of a waiting room expanding from a royal apartment in Marie de' Medici's [[Luxembourg Palace]].&lt;ref name="smith127"/&gt; The paintings are now displayed in the same order in the Louvre.&lt;ref name="Belkin, p. 181"&gt;Belkin, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an additional claim that Marie had envisioned these paintings to be studied alternately, left to right, so the thoughtful viewer would have had to crisscross down the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge also argues that Marie envisioned the subjects as falling into pairs, and further into groups. Therefore, Marie's visual biography was divided into three main chapters: childhood, life as a married queen, and the regency as a widow.&lt;ref name="Coolidge, 69"&gt;Coolidge, 69.&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the paintings have the same height although they vary in width in order to fit the shape of the room they were intended for. The sixteen paintings that covered the long walls of the gallery measure about four meters tall by three meters wide, the three larger paintings at the end of the room are four meters high by seven meters wide.&lt;ref name="Belkin, p. 181"/&gt;

Originally the viewer would have entered the gallery from the southeast corner. The most visible works from this angle were ''The Coronation in Saint Denis'' and ''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency.'' &lt;ref&gt;Coolidge, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;
The cycle began at the entrance wall, featuring images of Marie's childhood years and her marriage to [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]. Four of the images are devoted to the marriage, possibly because marriage at Marie's relatively advanced age of twenty-seven was quite rare for a woman at the time.&lt;ref name="belkin182"/&gt; This half ends with a depiction of Marie's coronation. The wall opposite the gallery's entrance presents an image of the assassination and assumption of Henry IV, as well as the proclamation of the widowed Marie's regency. From there, the second half of Rubens' cycle begins addressing the more controversial issues from Marie's reign. For example, both the altercation and reconciliation with her son [[Louis XIII]] are subjects Marie de' Medici commissioned Rubens to paint for this gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 181-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical period that encompassed the subject matter for the paintings was a time of political upheaval in which Rubens sought not to offend the reigning French monarch.  Rubens thus turned to mythological allusions, emblematic references, personifications of vices and virtues and religious analogies to veil an often unheroic or ambiguous reality.  Within this context Rubens' approach to 'historical truth' may appear selective or, worse, dishonest, but he was neither a historian in the modern sense, nor a journalist; the Medici cycle is not reportage, but rather poetic transformation.&lt;ref name="Belkin p. 179"&gt;Belkin p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

As a narrative source for the Marie de' Medici cycle Rubens used an ancient genera of writing in which ideal kingship, and good government were explored.  This genera of writing is called the [[Panegyric]].  Panegyric writings were usually written during an important political event, the birth of a prince for example, and were used to exalt the qualities and ancestry of a ruler.  A formal chronological structure is followed in Panegyric writings detailing the ancestry, birth, education and life of the individual.  Rubens followed this structure in his series of paintings about [[Marie de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The price of Marie de' Medici Cycle was roughly 24,000 guilders for the 292 square meters, which calculates to about 82 guilders, or 1,512 dollars, per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Downes, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Destiny of Marie de' Medici''===
The first painting of the narrative cycle, ''The Destiny of Marie de' Medici'', is a twisting composition of the three [[Parcae|Fates]] on clouds beneath the celestial figures of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].

[[Parcae|The Fates]] are depicted as beautiful, nude goddesses spinning the thread of Marie de' Medici's destiny; their presence at Marie's birth assures her prosperity and success as a ruler that is unveiled in the cycle's subsequent panels.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp.22-25&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek and Roman mythology, one Fate spun the thread, another measured its length, and the third cut the thread.  In Rubens' depiction, however, the scissors necessary for this cutting are omitted, stressing the privileged and immortal character of the Queen's life.&lt;ref name="Thuillier, Jacques 1967"&gt;Thuillier, Jacques.  Rubens' Life of Marie de' Medici.  New York:  Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The last panel of the cycle, in accordance with this theme, illustrates Queen Marie rising up to her place as queen of heaven, having achieved her lifelong goal of immortality through eternal fame.&lt;ref name="Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 26-29"&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Early interpretations explained Juno's presence in the scene through her identity as the goddess of childbirth.  Later interpretations suggested, however, that Rubens used [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] to represent Marie de' Medici's alter ego, or avatar, throughout the cycle.  [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] accordingly signifies the allegory of Henry IV, the promiscuous husband.&lt;ref name="Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 26-29"/&gt;

===''The Birth of the Princess''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 045.jpg|''The Birth of the Princess, in Florence on 26 April 1573''|thumb|right|''The Birth of the Princess, in Florence on 26 April 1573''.]]
The cycle's second painting, ''The Birth of the Princess'', represents Medici's April 26, 1573 birth. Symbols and allegory appear throughout the painting. On the left, two [[putti]] play with a shield on which the Medici crest appears, suggesting that Heaven favored the young Medici from the moment of her birth. The river god in the picture's right corner is likely an allusion to the [[Arno River]] that passes through Florence, Marie's city of birth. The cornucopia above the infant's head can be interpreted as a harbinger of Marie's future glory and fortune; the lion may be seen as symbolic of power and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Matilde Battistini, Symbole und Allegorien&lt;/ref&gt; The glowing [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around the infant's head should not be seen as a reference to Christian imagery; rather, it should be read according to imperial iconography which uses the halo as an indication of the Queen's divine nature and of her future reign.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp.32-33&lt;/ref&gt; Though Marie was born under the [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] sign, [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] appears in the painting; it may be seen as a guardian of imperial power.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp. 29-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Education of the Princess''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 039.jpg|''The Education of the Princess''|thumb|left|''The Education of the Princess'']]
''Education of the Princess'' (1622–1625) shows a maturing [[Marie de' Medici]] at study. Her education is given a [[divine grace]] by the presence of three gods [[Apollo]], [[Athena]], and [[Hermes]]. [[Apollo]] being associated with art, [[Athena]] with wisdom, and [[Hermes]] the messenger god for a fluency and understanding of language.&lt;ref name="vandergriff"&gt;Vandergriff, ''The Life of Marie de' Medici''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermes]] dramatically rushes in on the scene and literally brings a gift from the gods, the [[caduceus]]. It is generally thought that Hermes endows the princess with  the gift of eloquence, to go along with the Grace's gift of beauty. However, the caduceus, which is seen in six other paintings in the cycle, has also been associated with peace and harmony. The object may be seen as foretelling of Marie's peaceful reign.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be interpreted that the combined efforts of these divine teachers represent  Marie's idyllic preparedness for the responsibilities she will obtain in the future, and the trials and tribulations she will face as Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suggested that the three gods, more importantly, offer their guidance as a gift that allows the soul to be "freed by reason" and gain the knowledge of what is "good" revealing the divine connection between the gods and the future Queen.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting displays an embellished Baroque collaboration of the spiritual and earthly relationships, which are illustrated in a theatrical environment.&lt;ref name="Smith, p 128"&gt;Smith, p 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as more than just static symbols the figures portrayed take an active role in her education. Also present are [[Charites|the three graces]], Euphrosyne, Aglaea, and Thalia giving her beauty.&lt;ref name="vandergriff"/&gt;

===''The Presentation of Her Portrait to Henry IV''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 048.jpg|thumb|right|''The Presentation of Her Portrait to Henry IV'']]
To fully appreciate and value this particular cycle piece and the collection as a whole, there is one historical principle to take into account.  This painting was created on the cusp of the age of [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] and, as such, one must remember royalty were considered above corporeal existence.  So from birth, Marie would have led a life more ornamental than mortal.  This painting of classical gods, along with allegorical personifications, aptly shows the viewer how fundamental this idea was.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 205"&gt;Held, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as Tamino in ''The Magic Flute'', Henry IV falls in love with a painted image.  With [[Cupid|Amor]] the Cupid as his escort, [[Hymenaios]], the god of marriage, displays the princess Marie on canvas to her future king and husband.  Meanwhile, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] are sitting atop clouds looking down on Henry as they provide the viewer a key example of marital harmony and thus show approval for the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; A personification of France is shown behind Henry in her helmet, her left hand showing support, sharing in his admiration of the future sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 205"/&gt; Rubens had a way of depicting France that was very versatile in gender in many of his paintings in the cycle.  Here France takes on an androgynous role being both woman and man at the same time. Frances's intimate gesture may suggest a closeness between Henry and his country. This gesture would usually be shared among male companions, telling each other's secret. The way France is also dressed shows how female she is on top revealing her breasts and the way the fabric is draped adding notions of classicism.  However her bottom half, most notably her exposed calves and Roman boots hints at a masculinity. A sign of male strength in the history of imagery was their stance and exposed strong legs.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, p.493&lt;/ref&gt; This connection between the two show that not only are the gods in favor of the match, the King also has the well wishes of his people.

In negotiating the marriage between [[Marie de' Medici]] and Henry IV, a number of portraits were exchanged between the two.  The king was pleased with her looks, and upon meeting her was impressed even more by her, than with her portraits.  There was great approval of the match, as the pope and many powerful Florentine nobles had been advocates of the marriage and had worked at convincing the king of the benefits of such a union.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, pp. 49-50&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple were [[proxy marriage|married by proxy]] on October 5, 1600.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubens is able to coalesce these characters together into a single united front. He creates equality between all of the figures in the painting by cleverly balancing corporeal and ethereal space.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 205"/&gt;

===''The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 052.jpg|''the Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV''|thumb|left|''The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV'']] ''The Wedding by Proxy of Marie de' Medici to King Henry IV'' (1622–25), Rubens depicts the [[proxy marriage]] ceremony of the Florentine princess Marie de' Medici to the King of France,  Henry IV  which took place in the cathedral of Florence on October 5, 1600. [[Pietro Aldobrandini|Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandini]] presides over the ritual. As was often the case with royal weddings, the bride's uncle, the [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany]] stood in the King's place and is pictured here slipping a ring on his niece's finger. All the surrounding figures are identifiable, including the artist himself. Although he was present at the actual event twenty years earlier, as a member of the Gonzaga household during his travels in Italy, Rubens appears youthful and stands behind the bride, holding a cross and gazing out at the viewer. It is highly unlikely that Rubens actually had such a pronounced presence in this scene when it took place. Those who attended the ceremony for Marie include [[Christine of Lorraine|Grand Duchess Cristina of Tuscany]] and Marie's sister [[Eleonora de' Medici|Eleonora, Duchess of Mantua]]; and in entourage of Grand Duke are Roger de Bellegarde, Grand Esquire of France, and the Marquis de Sillery, who negotiated the marriage. As in other scenes in the Medici Cycle, Rubens includes a mythological element: the ancient god of marriage, [[Hymenaios]]  wearing a crown of roses, carries the bride's train in one hand and the nuptial torch in the other.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp.182-185&lt;/ref&gt; The scene takes place below a marble statue, which depicts [[God the Father]] mourning over the dead body of Christ, alluding to the Pieta sculpture by [[Bartolommeo Bandinelli|Baccio Bandinelli]] (1493–1560).

===''The Disembarkation at Marseilles''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 035.jpg|''The Disembarkation at Marseilles''|thumb|right|''The Disembarkation at Marseilles'']]
Having never been a particularly graceful event for anyone, disembarking a ship does not pose a problem for Rubens in his depiction of [[Marie de' Medici]] arriving in Marseilles after having been married to  Henry IV  by proxy in [[Florence]]. Rubens has again, turned something ordinary into something of unprecedented magnificence.  He depicts her leaving the ship down a gangplank (she actually walked up, not down, but was illustrated this way by Rubens to create a diagonal element).  She was accompanied by the Grand Duchess of Tuscany and her sister, the [[Duchess of Mantua]], into the welcoming, allegorical open arms of a personified France, wearing a helmet and the royal blue mantle with the golden [[fleur-de-lis]]. Her sister and aunt flank Marie while two trumpets are blown simultaneously by an ethereal Fame, announcing her arrival to the people of France. Below, [[Poseidon (mythology)|Poseidon]], three [[Nereids]], a sea-god and [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] rise from the sea, after having escorted the future Queen on the long voyage to procure her safe arrival in Marseilles.  To the left, the [[coat of arms|arms]] of the Medici can be seen above an arched structure, where a Knight of Malta stands in all of his [[regalia]].  It is melody and song as Rubens combines heaven and Earth, history and allegory into a symphony for the eyes of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, pp. 703-705&lt;/ref&gt;  On a side note, Avermaete discusses an interesting idea that is particularly present in this canvas.&lt;ref name="Avermaete, Roger 1968"&gt;Avermaete, Roger.

{{quote|He [Rubens] surrounded her [Marie de' Medici] with such a wealth of appurtenances that at every moment she was very nearly pushed into the background.

===''The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons''===
[[File:Rubens medici cycle meeting at Lyon.jpg|''The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons''|thumb|left|''The Meeting of Marie de' Medici and Henry IV at Lyons'']]
This painting allegorically depicts the first meeting of Marie and Henry, which took place after their nuptials by proxy. The upper half of the painting shows Marie and Henry as the mythological Roman gods [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. The representations are accompanied by their traditional attributes. Marie is shown as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] (Greek [[Hera]]) identified by the peacocks and chariot. Henry is shown as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Greek [[Zeus]]) identified by the fiery thunderbolts in his hand and the eagle. The joining of the couple's right hands is a traditional symbol of the marriage union. They are dressed in the classical style, which is naturally appropriate to the scene. Above the two stands [[Hymen (mythology)|Hymen]] who unites them. A rainbow extends from the left corner, a symbol of concord and peace. The lower half of the painting is dominated by imagery of Lyons. Reading from left to right, we see the cityscape with its single hill. The lions pull the chariot (which is a pun on the name of the city), and in the chariot we see the allegorical figure of the city herself with a crown of her battlements: Lyons. Rubens needed to be very careful in the representation of the couple's first meeting because allegedly Henry was very much involved with a mistress at the time of the marriage. In fact, due to the king's other engagements their introduction was delayed, and it was not until midnight nearly a week after Marie arrived that Henry finally joined his bride.  By presenting him as Jupiter Rubens implies the promiscuity of the man and the deity. Simultaneously by placing King and Queen together he effectively illustrates the elevated status of the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Birth of the Dauphin at Fontainebleau''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 046.jpg|''The Birth of the Dauphin at Fountainebleau''|thumb|right|''The Birth of the Dauphin at Fountainebleau'']]
This painting depicts the birth of Marie de' Medici's first son, [[Louis XIII]]. Rubens designed the scene around the theme of political peace.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The birth of the first male heir brings a sense of security to the royal family that they will continue to rule. In those times an heir was of the utmost importance, especially if Henry wanted to showcase his masculinity and discontinue with the pattern of the royal reproductive failure.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Katherine B.,''The Politics of Promiscuity: Masculinity and Heroic Representation at the Court of Henry IV''
French Historical Studies, Vol. 26, No. 2, Special Issue: French History in the Visual Sphere. (Spring, 2003), p.230&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''dauphin'' is French for dolphin, a term associated with princely royalty. Henry's promiscuity made difficult the production of a legitimate heir, and rumors circulated to the extent that Henry's court artists began to employ strategies to convince the country otherwise. One of these strategies was to personify Marie as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] or [[Minerva]]. By representing Marie as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], implying Henry as [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the king is seen domesticated by marriage. The queen's personification as Minerva would facilitate Henry's military prowess and her own.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; As a Flemish painter Rubens includes a dog in the painting, alluding to fidelity in marriage. In addition to the idea of political peace Rubens also includes the personification of Justice, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]]. The return of Astraea to earth is symbolic of the embodiment of continuing Justice with the birth of the future king. Louis is nursed by [[Themis]], the goddess of divine order, referring to [[Louis XIII]] birthright to one day become king. The baby is quite close to a serpent, which is a representation of Health.&lt;ref&gt;Wedgwood, C.V., p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubens incorporates the traditional allegory of the cornucopia, which symbolizes abundance, to enhance the meaning of the painting by including the heads of Marie de' Medici's children who have yet to be born among the fruit. While Marie gazes adoringly at her son, Fecundity presses the cornucopia to her arm, representing the complete and bountiful family to come.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Consignment of the Regency''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 051.jpg|''The Consignment of the Regency''|thumb|left|''The Consignment of the Regency'']]
Throughout the depictions of Marie de' Medici's life, Rubens had to be careful not to offend either Marie or the king, [[Louis XIII]], when portraying controversial events. Marie commissioned paintings that truthfully followed the events of her life, and it was the job of Rubens to tactfully convey these images. More than once, the artistic license of the painter was curbed in order to portray Marie in the right light. In ''The Consignment of the Regency'',  Henry IV entrusts Marie with both the regency of France and the care of the dauphin shortly before his war campaigns and eventual death. Set within a grand Italian-style architectural setting, the theme is somewhat sobering. Prudence, the figure to the right of Marie, was stripped of her emblematic snake to lessen the chances any viewer would be reminded of Marie's rumored involvement in the King's assassination. The efficacy of the form is lost in order to ensure Marie's representation in a positive light. Other changes include the removal of the [[Moirai|Three Fates]], originally positioned behind the king calling him to his destiny, war, and death. Rubens was forced to remove these mythical figures and replace them with three generic soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Also worthy of note in this painting is the first appearance of the orb as a symbol of the "all-embracing rule or power of the state".&lt;ref&gt;Winner, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; This particular image appears to carry significant weight in Rubens's iconographic program for the cycle, as it appears in six (one quarter) of the twenty-four paintings of the cycle. This orb functions both as an allusion to the Roman ''orbis terrarum'' (sphere of earth) which signifies the domain and power of the Roman emperor, and as a subtle assertion of the claim of the French monarchy upon the imperial crown.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, pp. 70, 86&lt;/ref&gt; While Rubens was certainly aware of the inherent meaning of the orb and employed it to great effect, it appears that Marie and her counselors instigated its introduction into the cycle to add allegorical and political grandeur to the events surrounding Marie's regency.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, pp. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Coronation in Saint-Denis''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 049.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Coronation in Saint-Denis'']]
''The Coronation in Saint-Denis'' is the last scene on the North End of the West Wall, showing the completion of Marie's divinely assisted preparation.&lt;ref name="Smith, p 128"/&gt; It would be one of two paintings most visually apparent upon entrance into the gallery through the southeast corner. Rubens composes ''The Coronation in Saint-Denis'' for distanced viewing by employing accents of red. For example, the robes of two cardinals near the right edge. These accents also create a sense of unity with the neighboring work, ''Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency''.&lt;ref name="Coolidge, 69"/&gt;

This painting is a representation of an historical event in the life of the Queen where the King and the Queen were crowned at the [[basilica of Saint-Denis]] in [[Paris]]. Considered one of the principal paintings in the series along with the ''Apotheosis of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency'' both scenes also show Marie de’ Medici receiving the orb of state. She is conducted to the altar by the Cardinals Gondi and de Sourdis, who stand with her along with Mesieurs de Souvrt and de Bethune. The ceremony is officiated by Cardinal Joyeuse. The royal entourage includes the [[Louis XIII|Dauphin]], the [[François, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]] with the crown, the Duke of Ventadour with the scepter, and the Chevalier de Vendôme with the hand of Justice. The [[Louise Marguerite of Lorraine|Princess of Conti]] and the [[Henriette Catherine de Joyeuse|Duchess of Montpensier]] (mother of her future [[Marie de Bourbon, Duchess of Montpensier|daughter in law]]) carry the train of the royal mantle. Above in the tribune appears Henry IV, as if to give sanction to the event. The crowd below in the basilica raise their hands in acclamation of the new Queen, and above, the classical personifications of [[Abundantia]] and a winged [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] shower the blessings of peace and prosperity upon the head of Marie by pouring the golden coins of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, her pet dogs are placed in the foreground of the painting.  Rubens inspiration for the blue coronation orb emblazoned with golden lilies was Guillaume Dupres’ presentation medal struck in 1610 at Marie's’ request portraying her as Minerva with Louis XIII as Apollo-Sol .&lt;ref name="ellenius71"&gt;Ellenius, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; The symbolism carried the message that she was charged with the guidance of the young, soon-to-be king.&lt;ref name="ellenius71"/&gt;

===''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 036.jpg|''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency''|thumb|left|upright=1.5|''The Death of Henry IV and the Proclamation of the Regency'']]
Sometimes also referred to as ''The Apotheosis of Henry IV'' and ''The Proclamation of the Regency'', this particular painting within the Medici Cycle as a whole, was placed originally by Rubens as a series of three.&lt;ref name="berger473"&gt;Berger, p. 473&lt;/ref&gt;  The other two having similar design measurements, it was consigned as the middle painting in a pseudo triptych of sorts as it adorned the halls of Marie de’ Medici's Palais du Luxembourg.

The painting is separated into two distinct, but related scenes: the elevation of  Henry IV to the heavens (his assassination on 14 May 1610 resulted in the immediate declaration of Marie as regent&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;) and the assumption of Marie to the crown.

On the left, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] are shown welcoming the assassinated King of France, as he ascends as a personified Roman sovereign, victoriously to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]].&lt;ref name="Vlieghe, p. 49"&gt;Vlieghe, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;   As with all of Ruben's allegorical paintings, these two figures are chosen for a reason. [[Jupiter]] is meant to be the King's celestial counterpart, while [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], who represents finite time, is an indication of the end of Henry's mortal existence.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; This particular theme, within the painting as a whole, has found other great masters receiving inspiration and fascination from Rubens' tormented figure of [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]], the goddess of War, who lays disarmed below.  Post-Impressionist, [[Paul Cézanne]] (1839–1906) registered for permission to copy the goddess as many as ten times.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; It should be kept in mind that Rubens's energetic manner of placing all these allegorical themes is substantially resultant from classical coins as documented through communication with his friend and notable collector of antiquities, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.&lt;ref name="Vlieghe, p. 49"/&gt; The right side of the panel shows the succession of the new Queen, dressed in solemn clothing suited to a widow.  She is framed by a triumphal arch and surrounded by people at the court.
The Queen accepts an orb, a symbol of government, from the personification of France while the people kneel before her and this scene is a great example of the exaggeration of facts in the cycle.  Rubens stresses the idea of the Regency that was offered to the Queen, though she actually claimed it for herself the same day her husband was murdered.&lt;ref name="Thuillier, Jacques 1967"/&gt;

Worthy of note is a possible contemporary inspirational influence on Rubens for the right side of this painting.  Although originally started but may or may not have been finished in Rome, Caravaggio's ''[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]'' may well have been an artistic influence on Rubens for the ''Proclamation of the Regency'' side of this painting, as the two works are highly corresponding in their presentation.  Through a causal nexus, this painting would have been available to Rubens and thereby plausible for its influence to exist within Rubens's own genius on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 475-476&lt;/ref&gt;
As a comparison, there are within each, two women upon a dais classical pillars, swathes of luxuriant cloth, genuflecting personages with arms extended, and allegorical figures present. In Rubens's painting, Minerva, Prudence, Divine Providence and France; in the Caravaggio, St Dominic, St Peter the Martyr, and a pair of Dominican monks.  Also present in each are ''objets importants'': rudder, globe, and rosaries.&lt;ref name="berger476"&gt;Berger, pp.476&lt;/ref&gt;  All these and more, combine to make a persuasive argument and show a certain artistically respectful nod from [[Rubens]] to [[Caravaggio]] as two contemporaries of the time.&lt;ref name="berger476"/&gt;

===''The Council of the Gods''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 042.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''The Council of the Gods'']] This painting commemorates Marie taking over the government as new regent, and promoting long-term plans for peace in Europe by way of marriages between royal houses.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, Wolf p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cupid]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] bind two doves together over a split sphere in the painting as a symbol of peace and love.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Marie hoped for her son, [[Louis XIII]], to marry the Spanish Infanta Anne and for her daughter Elizabeth to marry the future king of Spain, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]], possibly resulting in an alliance between France and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p 80&lt;/ref&gt; To Marie de' Medici these unions were probably the most significant part of her reign, for peace in Europe was Marie's greatest goal.&lt;ref&gt;Winner, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Council of the Gods'' is one of the least understood paintings of ''Marie de' Medici cycle''. It represents the conduct of the Queen and the great care with which she oversees her Kingdom during her Regency.  For example, how she overcomes the rebellions and the disorders of the State. It also suggests that she perpetuated the policies and ideals of the late King in his life and in death.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The painting subjects are placed in a celestial setting which doesn't give way to a particular place, time or event. The scene is painted with a variety of mythological figures. This, along with its setting makes it difficult to figure out the subject matter of the work.  The mythological figures include [[Apollo]] and [[Pallas (Titan)|Pallas]], who combat and overcome vices such as Discord, Hate, Fury, and Envy on the ground and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], [[Hermes]], [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], [[Flora]], [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]], Pomono, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], [[Zeus]], [[Hera]], [[Cupid]], and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] above.&lt;ref&gt;Avermaete, Roger. ''Rubens and his times.''  Cranbury, New Jersey:  A.S. Barnes and Company, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mythological figures and celestial setting act as allegories for Marie's peaceful rule over France.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Regent Militant: The Victory at Jülich''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 043.jpg|thumb|left|''The Victory at Jülich''.]]
''The Victory at Jülich'' shows the only military event that the Queen participated in during her regency: the return of Jülich (or Juliers in French) to the Protestant princes.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"&gt;Saward, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Being a crossing of Ruhr, Juliers was of great strategic importance for France and thus the French victory was chosen to be the glorious subject of Rubens' painting.  The scene is rich with symbolism highlighting her heroism and victory.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"/&gt;  The Queen thrusts her arm high with an assembler's baton in hand.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"&gt;Millen and Wolf 155&lt;/ref&gt; In the upper part of the image [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] appears crowning her with laurel leaves which is a symbol of victory. Also symbolizing victory is the imperial eagle which can be seen in the distance.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"/&gt; The eagle in the sky compels the weaker birds to flee.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"/&gt; The Queen is accompanied by a womanly embodiment of what was once thought to be, Fortitude because of the lion beside her. However, the figure is Magnanimity, also referred to as Generosity, because of the riches held in her palm. One of the pieces in her hand is the Queen's treasured strand of pearls.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"/&gt;     Other figures include Fame and the personification of Austria with her lion.&lt;ref name="Saward, p. 133"/&gt; Fame in the right side of the painting pushes air through the trumpet so powerfully that a burst of smoke comes out.&lt;ref name="Millen and Wolf 155"/&gt; In the painting Marie de’ Medici is highly decorated and triumphant after the collapse of a city, she is depicted across a white stallion to demonstrate that, like the departed King  Henry IV, she could triumph over rivals in warfare.&lt;ref name="wedgwood116"&gt;Wedgwood, C.V., 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Exchange of the Princesses at the Spanish Border''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 037.jpg|"The Exchange of Princesses"|thumb|right|''The Exchange of Princesses'']]
''The Exchange of Princesses'' celebrates the double marriage of the [[Anne of Austria|Anna of Austria]] to [[Louis XIII of France]] and Louis XIII's sister, [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Princess Elisabeth]], to future king of Spain, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]] on 9 November 1615. France and Spain present the young princesses, aided by a youth who is probably Hymen. Above them, two [[putti]] brandish hymeneal torches, a small zephyr blows a warm breeze of spring and scatter roses, and a circle of joyous butterfly-winged putti surround Felicitas Publica with the caduceus, who showers the couple with gold from her cornucopia. Below, the river Andaye is filled with sea deities come to pay homage to the brides: the river-god Andaye rests on his urn, a nereid crowned with pearls offers a strand of pearls and coral as wedding gifts, while a triton blows the conch to herald the event.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, pp.137&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding, which was thought to secure peace between France and Spain, took place on a float midway across the Bidassoa River, along the French-Spanish border. In Ruben's depiction, the princesses stand with their right hands joined between personifications of France and Spain. Spain with a recognizable symbol of a lion on her helmet is on the left, whereas France, with fleur-de-lis decorating her drapery, is on the right.&lt;ref name="belkin186"&gt;Belkin, p.186&lt;/ref&gt; Anna, at age fourteen the older of the two, turns back as if to take leave of Spain, while France gently pulls her by the left arm. In turn, Spain can be seen taking the thirteen-year-old Elisabeth by her left arm.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin, pp. 186-7&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 040.jpg|''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici''|thumb|left|''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici'']]
This particular painting in the Marie de' Medici Cycle is noteworthy for its uniqueness in execution.  While the other paintings were completed at Rubens's studio in Antwerp, ''The Felicity of the Regency of Marie de' Medici'' was designed and painted entirely by Rubens on the spot to replace another, far more controversial depiction of Marie's 1617 expulsion from Paris by her son Louis. Completed in 1625, this is the final painting in the cycle in terms of chronological order of completion.&lt;ref name="belkin187"&gt;Belkin, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Here Marie is shown in allegorical fashion as the personification of Justice itself and flanked by a retinue of some of the primary personifications/gods in the Greek and Roman pantheon. These have been identified as [[Cupid]], [[Minerva]], [[Prudence]], [[Abundantia|Abundance]], [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], and two figures of [[Pheme]], all indicated by their traditional attributes, all bestowing their bounties on the Queen. (Cupid has his arrow; Prudence carries a snake entwined around her arm to indicate serpent-like wisdom; Abundance also appears with her cornucopia, also a reference to the fruits of Marie's regency. Minerva, goddess of wisdom, bears her helmet and shield and stands near Marie's shoulder, signifying her wise rule. Saturn has his sickle and is personified as Time here guiding France forward. Fame carries a trumpet to herald the occasion.&lt;ref name="belkin189"&gt;Belkin, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;) These personifications are accompanied in turn by several allegorical figures in the guise of four putti and three vanquished evil creatures ([[Envy]], [[Ignorance]], and [[Vice]])&lt;ref name="belkin189"/&gt; as well as a number of other symbols that Rubens employed throughout the entire cycle of paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this particular painting is one of the most straightforward in the series, there is still some minor dispute about its significance. Rather than accept this as a depiction of Marie as Justice, some hold that the real subject of the painting is the "return to earth of Astraea, the principle of divine justice, in a golden age."&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; They support this claim with a statement in Rubens's notes which indicates that "this theme holds no special reference to the particular reason of state of the French kingdom."&lt;ref name="winner86"&gt;Winner, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Certain symbolic elements, such as the wreath of oak leaves (a possible ''corona civica''), France being seen as a subjugated province, and the inclusion of Saturn in the scheme might all point to this interpretation and certainly would not have been lost on Rubens.&lt;ref name="winner86"/&gt; Fortunately, and perhaps solely due to the controversy surrounding this painting, Rubens mentioned its significance in a letter to Peiresc dated 13 May 1625.  It reads,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I believe I wrote you that a picture was removed which depicted the Queen's departure from Paris and that, in its place, I did an entirely new one which shows the flowing of the Kingdom of France, with the revival of the sciences and the arts through the liberality and the splendour of Her Majesty, who sits upon a shining throne and holds a scale in her hands, keeping the world in equilibrium by her prudence and equity.''&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Considering the haste with which Rubens completed this painting, his lack of specific reference to a golden age in his letter, and the existence of several contemporary depictions of Marie as a figure of Justice, most historians are content with the simpler [[allegorical interpretation]] which is more consistent both with Rubens's style and the remainder of the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 166-7&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the original painting mentioned in the letter depicting Marie's departure from Paris was rejected in favor of ''The Felicity of the Regency'' due to the more innocuous subject matter of the latter.  Rubens, in the same letter, goes on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"This subject, which does not touch on the particular political considerations ... of this reign, nor have reference to any individual, has been very well received, and I believe that had it been entrusted altogether to me the business of the other subjects would have turned out better, without any of the scandal or murmurings."&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, we can see evidence of the adaptability of Rubens' style which made his career so successful.  His willingness to fit his ideas with those of the patron equipped him with the perfect tools to be in charge of such a delicate and heavily anticipated subject.

===''Louis XIII Comes of Age''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 047.jpg|''Louis XIII Comes of Age''|thumb|right|''Louis XIII Comes of Age'']]
The painting ''Louis XIII Comes of Age'' represents the historical scene of the transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means.&lt;ref name="Millen"&gt;Millen p.170&lt;/ref&gt; Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang on the side of the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet.&lt;ref name="Millen" /&gt; Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying [[force (law)|Force]], [[Religion]], [[Justice]], and [[Concordia (mythology)|Concord]]. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.
The pairing of Marie with the figure of Force gives power to the image of the queen, while Marie's actual pose is more passive, showing very effectively her graceful acknowledgement of her son's authority henceforth.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen pp.490-491&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an interesting painting to examine within the context of the tense relationship between the young king and his mother.  Marie had clung to power past the end of her regency, until Louis seized power in 1617 and exiled her to Blois.  Rubens obviously would have known this and so chose to ignore the tension surrounding Marie's relationship with her son, instead emphasizing her poise in the transfer of power.

===''The Flight from Blois''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 041.jpg|''The Flight from Blois''|thumb|left|''The Flight from Blois'']]
The Flight from Blois is a depiction of Queen Marie escaping from confinement at Blois.  The Queen stands in a dignified manner, suggesting her poise in times of disarray, amongst a chaotic crowd of handmaidens and soldiers.  She is led and protected by a representation of France, and guided by illustrations of [[Night (mythology)|Night]] and [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]]. They are used literally to portray the actual time of the event and shield the queen from spectators as they illuminate her path.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Rubens painted a scene of the event in a more heroic nature rather than showing the accuracy of realistic elements. According to historical records of the Queen's escape, this painting is not truthfully reflecting the moment of the occurrence. Rubens did not include many of the negative aspects of the event, fearing that he would offend the Queen, which resulted in the paintings non-realistic nature.  The Queen Marie is depicted in a humble way, yet the illustration implies her power over the military.  She does not express any hardships she had gone through by the escape.  The male figures in foreground reaching for her are unknown.  The larger figures in the background represent the military, who were added to have a symbolic meaning of the Queen's belief in the command over military.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 178-181&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Negotiations at Angoulême''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 055.jpg|thumb|left|''The Negotiations at Angoulême'']]
In ''The Negotiations at Angoulême'', Marie de' Medici genially takes the olive branch from Mercury, the messenger god, in the presence of both of her priests, as she gives her consent to have discussions with her son concerning her clash to his governmental direction.&lt;ref name="wedgwood116"/&gt;  Rubens uses several methods to portray Queen Marie in precisely the light that she wanted to be seen, as her young son's guardian and wise advisor.  Enthroned on a pedestal with sculptures of Minerva's symbols of wisdom and two putti holding a laurel wreath to represent victory and martyrdom, the representation of Marie de’ Medici is quite clear.  Her humble, yet all-knowing gaze conveys the wisdom that she holds.  She is also placed compositionally in a tight and unified group with the cardinals, signifying a truthful side opposed to Mercury's dishonesty.  Rubens gave Mercury an impression untruthfulness by illustrating his figure hiding a caduceus behind his thigh.  The effect of the two groups of figures is meant to stress the gap between the two sides.  Rubens also added a barking dog, a common reference used to indicate or warn someone of foreigners who came with evil intention.  All of these symbols, Rubens displayed in this ambiguous and enigmatic painting to represent or "misrepresent" Marie de’ Medici in the manner that portrayed her as the prudent, yet caring and humble mother of a young and naïve monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, pp. 182-193&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, this painting is the most problematic or controversial, as well as the least understood out of the entire cycle. This image is of, once again, Marie claiming her of regal authority yet was nonetheless the first step towards peace between mother and son.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Queen Opts for Security''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 044.jpg|''The Queen Opts for Security''|thumb|right|''The Queen Opts for Security'']]
Rubens's ''The Queen Opts for Security'' represents Marie de' Medici's need for security through a depiction of the event when Marie de' Medici was forced to sign a truce in Angers after her forces had been defeated at Ponte-de-Ce. Though the painting shows Marie de' Medici's desire for security with the representation of the Temple of Security, the symbols of evil at bay, and the change of smoky haze to clarity, there is also underlying symbolism of unrest to the acceptance of the truce. The round shape of the temple, like those built by the ancients to represent the world, and has an Ionic order that is associated with Juno and Maria herself. The temple defines itself, by also including a plaque above the niche that says "Securitati Augustae" or For the Security of the empress.&lt;ref name="Millen, p. 197"&gt;Millen, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; She is shown with the snakes of the caduceus emblem having uneasy movement and the forced escorting of the queen by Mercury into the Temple of Peace give the feeling of a strong will not to be defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be debated that the painting is not really about peace or security, but really an unrelenting spirit that does not give into loss.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; As she is a divine power, she is heroically depicted in a classical setting using neoplatonic hierarchy and visual cues of light on her face.  These ultimately imply that this allegory of Marie de' Medici is an apotheosis.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the inclusion of two differently adorned personifications of Peace hints at the fact that Rubens wanted to confuse or excite the viewer to look deeper into this particular painting as a whole.&lt;ref name="Millen, p. 197"/&gt;

===''Reconciliation of the Queen and her Son''===
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 053.jpg|''Reconciliation of the Queen and her son''|thumb|left|''Reconciliation of the Queen and her son'']]
''The Return of the Mother to Her Son'' tenuously held an alternate title ''The Full Reconciliation with the Son after the Death of the High Constable'' until the temperament of the nation was assessed. The many headed hydra struck a fatal blow by [[Divine law|Divine Justice]] as witnessed by [[Divine Providence]], a theme based on a classical seventeenth century metaphor for insurrection. Here the monster is a stand in for the dead [[Louis XIII of France#Ascendancy of Charles de Luynes, 1617-21|Constable de Luynes]] who has met its demise at the hand of a feminine Saint Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The death in 1621 of the falconer turned supreme commander may have improved the tensions between mother and son, but Conde, considered the most dangerous of Marie de’ Medici's foes quickly stepped in to fill the gap. Rubens’ deliberate vagueness would be consistent with his practice of generalizing and allegorizing historical facts especially in a painting about peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;  Marie, desiring vindication for the death of her close personal friend, [[Concino Concini]], would likely have intended a more direct personal allusion to Constable de Luynes, but Rubens preferring to keep to allegory, avoided specifics that could later prove embarrassing.&lt;ref name="mcgrath14"&gt;McGrath, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  The artist chose the high road, relying on Ripa's visual vernacular, to portray a scene where virtues defeat vices and embrace peaceful reconciliation making little more than an allusion to a vague political statement.&lt;ref name="mcgrath14"/&gt;

It is not hard to imagine the much-maligned scapegoat Luyens as the one suffering divine punishment and being thrown into the pits of hell while assuming all the blame for the animosity between Louis XIII and his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;  In this painting, Louis XIII, represented as an adult, is depicted as Apollo. The hydra's death is not at the hand of Apollo as might be expected. Instead it is left to an Amazon-like vision of Providence/Fate.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;  With the removal of the scales she carried in an earlier sketch that would have connected her to Louis XII, we are left with an entity who with no help from Louis, slays the adversary as he appears oblivious and unconcerned.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  Marie de’ Medici however, emerges as a loving mother, ready to forgive all evils and pain endured.

===''The Triumph of Truth''===
[[File:Rubens medici cycle triump of truth.jpg|thumb|right|''The Triumph of Truth]]
The last painting in the cycle, ''The Triumph of Truth'', is a purely allegorical depiction of King [[Louis XIII]] and his mother, the Queen, reconciling before heaven.&lt;ref name="thuillier"&gt;Saward, Susan. "The Golden Age of Marie de' Medici". Ann Arbor. UMI Research Press. 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and [[Louis XIII]] are depicted floating in heaven, connected by the symbol of [[Concordia (mythology)|''concordia'']], which demonstrates her sons’ forgiveness and the peace that was reached between them.  Below, [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] raises [[Veritas]] to heaven which symbolizes truth being, "brought to the light", as well as the reconciliation between the Queen and her son.&lt;ref&gt;Saward, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations of Time and Truth occupy almost 3/4 of the lower canvas. The upper part of the canvas is filled with renderings of Marie and her son. In the composition, Marie is depicted as much larger than her son and occupies much more space.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Her larger, less obscured body is turned frontally on the picture plane, which emphasizes her importance. Her importance is further highlighted by her equal height to her son, the King.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Her son who is obscured in part by the Wing of Time, kneels before the queen and presents her with the token of amity, the clasped hands and flaming heart within a laurel crown.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; Compositionally, Rubens gives the queen greater importance in this panel through the use of gestures and gazes. In the work, Truth gestures toward the Queen while Time looks toward her from below. Both figures ignore the King.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf&lt;/ref&gt; Rubens artfully projected both mother and son into the future, depicting them as more aged and mature than in the preceding panel (Peace is Confirmed in Heaven).&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf pp.220-221. "Heroic Deeds and Mystic Figures". Princeton. Princeton University Press. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this point that the Medici Cycle changes to the subject of the Queen Mother's reign.&lt;ref name="belkin186"/&gt; With the death of son Louis' court favorite, Charles d'Albert de Luynes, mother and son reconcile.  Marie receives ultimate vindication by being re-admitted to the Council of State in January 1622.&lt;ref&gt;Millen &amp; Wolf p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  This picture represents how time thus uncovers the truth in correspondence to the relationship between Marie and her son.&lt;ref name="thuillier"/&gt;

The final painting coincided with Marie's interest in politics after the death of her husband. She believed that diplomacy should be obtained through marriage and it is the marriage of her daughter [[Henrietta Maria]] to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] that rushed the completion of the Medici Cycle.&lt;ref name="belkin186"/&gt;

===''The Portraits of The Queen's Parents''===
The remaining three paintings are portraits of Marie de' Medici, her father Francesco I and her mother [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]]. On either side of the fireplace in the gallery are the portraits of the Queen's parents. The portrait of the Queen's father, Francesco I, is on the right and faces the passageway towards Marie de' Medici's private chambers. Francesco I is depicted wearing an ermine-lined mantle with a cross around his neck which represents the Tuscan order of Saint Stephen which his father founded. The portrait of the Queen's mother, [[Joanna of Austria, Grand Duchess of Tuscany|Johanna of Austria]], is on the left at the place where visitors enter. She is shown wearing a gown of silver cloth with gold embroidery and wears nothing that suggests her esteemed background. The model, or overall design, for this portrait of Johanna of Austria goes back to a painting by Alessandro Allori that was then copied by Giovanni Bizzelli. Rubens must have seen these paintings and therefore influenced his own style for depicting the Queen's mother. Although, surprisingly, Ruben's version is considered even less remarkable than the models. This portrait of Johanna of Austria is overall an inexpressive image of a woman. He excluded the traditional 16th Century hieratic poise for a relaxed interpretation, where she wears regularized drapery and Rubens adorns her in that of the state of always being sick and weak. In contrast, no model for the portrait of the Queen's father is known, although it is questioned if he used ideas from one from Paris that, in which he wanted to convey the authoritative appearance of historical figures. Specifically, the statues of Fracesco and Ferdinando de Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, pp.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The two portraits are stylistically very different, and even out of place, from the rest of the paintings in the gallery. These paintings of her parents in Marie de' Medici's reception hall look bleak in comparison to the portrait of Marie, where she is looking beautiful if not vain.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rubens made great use of allegorical images throughout most of the paintings in the gallery, the two portraits of the Queen's parents are compositionally straightforward and unremarkably executed. Moreover, they are considered to be far from "likenesses" of either sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Millen, pp.23-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Henry IV Cycle==
The original commission for the Marie de' Medici cycle included a corresponding gallery illustrating the life of Henry IV that was never completed, although Rubens began work soon after he completed the Marie de' Medici cycle.  The Henry cycle called for twenty-four monumental scenes of Henry's life depicting "the encounters he was engaged in, his combats, conquests, and sieges of towns with the Triumphs of said victories."&lt;ref name="Held, p. 123"&gt;Held, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Marie and Henry's separate wings were designed to meet in an arcade that would unite the two galleries. The paintings of each gallery would have been exhibited as an integrated pair, unifying all forty-eight scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that Rubens did not make any sketches for the Henry IV cycle while he was engaged with the first gallery. In one of his letters the artist describes the theme as "so large and magnificent that it would suffice for ten galleries". Judging by another statement of his on January 27, 1628, he did not engage much in sketching  before that date.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Of the oil sketches executed later by him, only nine survive, along with five large unfinished canvasses. Most of the sketches represent actual battles in which Henry was involved,&lt;ref name="Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194"&gt;Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''The Capture of Paris.''

It is important to note that the reasons for not completing the Henry IV cycle had to do with the current political events of the time. [[Marie de' Medici]] was banished from Paris in 1631 as [[Armand Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu|Cardinal Richelieu]] gained power over [[Louis XIII]].&lt;ref name="belkin192"&gt;Belkin, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the project was abandoned completely due to approval of the plans for the gallery being repeatedly delayed by the French court.&lt;ref name="Sutton and Weiseman, p. 194"/&gt; Richelieu, who now had full control of the cycle, refused to speak to Rubens about completing the Henry Gallery based on the falsehood that he was tending to affairs of the state.&lt;ref name="belkin192"/&gt; Richelieu's true motivations were most likely political. During this time, Rubens was in Madrid preparing for a diplomatic mission to London, working towards the rapprochement of Spain and England. The commissioned artist being active in an opposing political parties was cause for Richelieu to object.&lt;ref name="Held, p. 123"/&gt; He was thus actively seeking for an Italian artist to replace Rubens, which resulted in Rubens only sporadically continuing his work. After Marie's banishment in 1631, the project was to be completely abandoned,&lt;ref name="belkin192"/&gt; which seems a travesty seeing as Rubens was very optimistic about the project and its effects on his career; "I have now begun the designs of the other gallery which, in my judgment, because of the nature of the subject will prove to be more splendid than the first so that I hope I shall rather gain [in reputation] than decline."&lt;ref name="Held, p. 123"/&gt;
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - The Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre.JPG|''''|thumb|right|''The Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre'']]

An important sketch from the collection is the so-called ''Reconciliation of King Henry III and Henry of Navarre'' – a significant event for Henry IV's ascent to the throne. After the death of the duke of Anjou, brother of the childless King Henry III, the apparent heir was to be  Henry of Navarre (the future King Henry IV). However, when a [[papal bull]] denied him the throne and excommunicated him, Henry of Navarre protested, starting the [[War of the Three Henrys]]. When Henry III was also ostracized from Paris for initiating the murder of the duke of Guise, he met with Henry of Navarre to make peace and recognize him as rightful heir. Although Rubens depicted this reconciliation as taking place in a throne room, contemporary reports recorded that it was actually in a garden full of spectators. The sketch shows Henry of Navarre bowing down in Henry III's presence, which eyewitness accounts confirm was accurate. Rubens represented a putto taking the crown of Henry III, with the intention of placing it on the willing future Henry IV, although the actual transfer of power didn't occur until Henry III's assassination several months later (August 1, 1589). A page stands behind Henry of Navarre holding his personal badge: a white plumed helmet, while the dog at his feet represents fidelity. The two ominous figures behind Henry III most likely represent personifications of Fraud and Discord.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton and Wieseman, pp. 194-195&lt;/ref&gt;

The Henry IV cycle was planned to be composed of scenes from the king's military career.  The violence of these images would contrast nicely with the relative peace and regal quality of the scenes in the Marie de' Medici cycle.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 131"&gt;Smith, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Battle of Ivry'' on the East Wall of the gallery is a scene of Henry's most decisive battle to unify the city of Paris. Primarily gray, the sketch shows the king in crimson velvet to stand out in "the most famous of all the battles of Henry IV." He is shown in the center of the scene raising a flaming sword. His victorious army rushes in chaotically behind him; horses rearing and riders falling.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; This painting corresponds to the ''Coronation'' painting in the Marie de' Medici cycle.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 131"/&gt;

''The Triumphal Entry into Paris'' is the culminating point of the North End of the gallery. Being the king's last major battle fought, this served as an optimal location. Rubens wanted it to be at the end of the gallery as a "large and important" piece with an advanced state of execution.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; The painting shows Henry parading into Paris as a victorious Roman emperor holding an olive branch, the symbol of peace. However, because Henry never actually entered Paris in this fashion, the scene is supposed to represent only a symbolic triumph. Henry's action and setting (the buildings and a triumphal arch) were not really possible in Paris at this time, reassuring that the scene is not based on historical fact, but a classical metaphor and Henry's goal of remaining King of France.&lt;ref&gt;Held, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; This painting coincides with ''Apotheosis and Ascendancy'' in the Marie cycle.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 132"&gt;Smith, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Clemency of Henry in Paris'' corresponds to the Olympian peace scene in the Marie cycle, with Henry's peace as earthly and Marie's as celestial.  Henry's painting, beginning the West Wall of the gallery, depicts the scenes following the capture of Paris.  Henry's army casts the rebels out of Paris by throwing them over a bridge into the river below.  In the left corner, however, the new ruler himself discusses clemency with a few advisers.&lt;ref name="Smith, p. 132"/&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Mikio Sato'''|佐藤 幹夫|Satō Mikio|extra=born April 18, 1928}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[mathematician]], who started the field of [[algebraic analysis]]. He studied at the [[University of Tokyo]] and then did graduate study in [[physics]] as a student of [[Shin'ichiro Tomonaga]]. Since 1970, Sato has been professor at the [[Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences]], of [[Kyoto University]].

He is known for his innovative work in a number of fields, such as [[prehomogeneous vector space]]s and [[Bernstein–Sato polynomial]]s; and particularly for his [[hyperfunction]] [[theory]]. This theory initially appeared as an extension of the ideas of [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] theory; it was soon connected to the [[local cohomology]] theory of [[Grothendieck]], for which it was an independent realization in terms of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory. Further, it led to the theory of [[microfunction]]s and [[microlocal analysis]] in linear [[partial differential equation]]s and [[Harmonic analysis|Fourier theory]], such as for wave fronts, and ultimately to the current developments in [[D-module]] theory. Part of Sato's hyperfunction theory is the modern theory of [[holonomic system]]s: PDEs overdetermined to the point of having finite-dimensional spaces of solutions ([[algebraic analysis]]).

He also contributed basic work to non-linear [[soliton]] theory, with the use of [[Grassmannian]]s of infinite dimension. In [[number theory]], he is known for the [[Sato–Tate conjecture]] on [[L-function]]s.

He has been a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] since 1993.  He also received the [[Schock Prize]] in 1997 and the [[Wolf Prize]] in 2003.

His disciples include [[Masaki Kashiwara]], [[Takahiro Kawai]]&lt;ref&gt;Takahiro Kawai https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahiro_Kawai&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Tetsuji Miwa]]&lt;ref&gt;Tetsuji Miwa https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuji_Miwa&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Michio Jimbo]], who have been called the "Sato School"&lt;ref&gt;''Mikio Sato and Mathematical Physics'', Barry M.

The '''Ministry of Tourism and Arts''' is a [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] in [[Zambia]]. It is headed by the Minister of Tourism and Arts.

In 2002 the Ministry of Tourism was merged with the [[Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Zambia)|Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources]] to form the Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiv.be/zambia/implementation/competent-institutions-and-national-authorities/mtenr Ministry of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources - MTENR] Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tourism was later merged into the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Zambia)|Foreign Affairs ministry]]. In 2011 Tourism was split out from the Foreign ministry and merged with the Art portfolio to form the Ministry of Tourism and Arts.&lt;ref name=MOTA&gt;[http://www.mota.gov.zm/index.php/features About The Ministry] Ministry of Tourism an Arts&lt;/ref&gt;

The ministry oversees several statutory bodies, including the Hotels Board of Management, the Hotels Managers Registration Council, the [[National Arts Council of Zambia|National Arts Council]], the National Heritage Conservation Commission, the National Museum Board, the Zambia Institute for Tourism and Hospitality Studies and the Zambia Tourism Agency.&lt;ref name=MOTA/&gt;

The '''''Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence''''' (also known as '''''The Adoration''''')  is a painting traditionally believed to have been created in 1609 by the Italian Baroque master [[Caravaggio]]. Recent discoveries link the painting to that commissioned by Fabio Nuti in April 1600, and thus sent from Rome to Palermo.

It was stolen on October 18, 1969 from the [[Oratorio di San Lorenzo]] in [[Palermo]], Sicily.

The painting, which hung above the altar, was large, measuring almost six square metres (actual size 268&amp;nbsp;cm x 197&amp;nbsp;cm). Probably because of its size, it was removed from its frame by two thieves&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt; before being taken out of the church. After it was stolen, the Oratory was pillaged of other art, along with choir stalls of carved and gilded wood and benches inlaid with [[precious wood]]s and mother of pearl. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The local [[Sicilian Mafia]] are generally considered to be the prime culprits in the theft although nobody actually knows who committed the crime. The whereabouts of the work remain unknown to this day. Rumours of its destruction during the theft, or subsequently in the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]], have circulated from time to time as has the notion that the masterpiece is now hidden abroad. In 1996, [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], an informant and former member of the Sicilian Mafia, claimed he had stolen the painting as a young man on the orders of a high-ranking mobster, but other sources say it was stolen by amateurs and then sold on to various Mafiosi; at one point it is said to have ended up in the hands of [[Rosario Riccobono]], who was killed in 1982, after which it passed on to [[Gerlando Alberti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/02/05/bacara105.xml Will we ever see it again?], The Daily Telegraph, February 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], a former Mafia figure turned police informer, claimed that he was told in 1999 that the painting was stolen for a private collector but had been destroyed by rats and pigs while hidden in a farm outbuilding and the remains burned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6950256.ece Lost Caravaggio painting 'was burnt by Mafia'] Times Online, December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/28/arts.italy Mafia informer asked to solve mystery of stolen Caravaggio], The Guardian, November 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nativity'' is one of the most famous unrecovered stolen works of art; its theft is on the [[FBI]]'s top ten list of art crimes.&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theft of Caravaggio’s Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco |url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/fbi-top-ten-art-crimes/nativity-with-san-lorenzo-and-san-francesco |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=25 October 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The value, if the work was ever sold, is estimated to be $20 million&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;; though resale value on the black market, especially for an infamous work of art, is nowhere near the actual value.  On the black market, stolen art fetches perhaps a tenth of its estimated value if it can even be sold at all.&lt;ref name="Beast"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dickey|first1=Christopher |last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=Hot Potatoes |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/05/20/hot-potatoes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116210003/https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/05/20/hot-potatoes.html |accessdate=25 October 2018 |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=19 May 2010|archive-date=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a reproduction of the painting was commissioned by [[Sky plc|Sky]] and produced by [[Factum Arte]]. The replica was then permanently installed in the chapel, in the place of the original, with an official ceremony in the presence of the President of the Republic, [[Sergio Mattarella]]. In the same year, Sky produced the international documentary "[[Mystery of the Lost Caravaggio]]" by [[Sky Arts Production Hub]], which tells the story of the Nativity and the life of the artist. Through interviews and archive material, the documentary tells the story of the theft of the work in 1969, the process of reproduction and the technologies used to recreate the Nativity. The documentary debuted on January 27, 2017 on [[Sky Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Caravaggio Masterpiece Stolen in Notorious Mafia Heist Replaced with Replica|journal=Artnet News|date=December 11, 2015|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/stolen-caravaggio-replaced-replica-391166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirchgaessner|first1=Stephanie|title='Restitution of a lost beauty': Caravaggio Nativity replica brought to Palermo|journal=The Guardian|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/10/restitution-lost-beauty-stolen-caravaggio-nativity-replica-brought-palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=The Telegraph|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12044479/How-a-long-lost-Caravaggio-masterpiece-was-recreated-nearly-50-years-after-it-was-stolen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vivarelli|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=Variety|date=December 18, 2015|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/global/murdoch-owned-sky-paybox-mixes-philanthropy-and-production-with-operation-caravaggio-1201662897/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalewski|first1=Daniel|last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=The Factory of Fakes|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 28, 2016|pages=75, 77|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-factory-of-fakes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14845">[[File:Pit-Interior of Teatro La Fenice-Venice.jpg|400px|thumb|The pit of [[La Fenice]]]]  
A '''pit orchestra''' is a type of [[orchestra]] that accompanies performers in [[musicals]], [[operas]], [[ballet]]s, and other shows involving music. The terms was also used for orchestras accompanying [[silent movies]] when more than a piano was used.&lt;ref&gt; Mervyn Cooke, ''A History of Film Music'' Cambridge Univ. Press, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-521-81173-6}}. pp. 18–21&lt;/ref&gt;  In performances of [[opera]]s and [[ballet]]s, the pit orchestra is typically similar in size to a [[symphony orchestra]], though it may contain smaller string and brass sections, depending upon the piece.  Such orchestras may vary in size from approximately 30 musicians (early Baroque and Classical opera) to as many as 90–100 musicians (Wagnerian opera). However, because of financial, space, and volume concerns, the [[musical theatre]] pit orchestra in the 2000s is considerably smaller (at most 20–30 musicians, including not more than ten [[string instruments|string players]]).

==Description==
Typically, pit orchestras play in a lowered area in front of the stage called an [[orchestra pit]]. Inside the pit, the [[conductor (music)|conductor]] stands facing towards the stage with his or her back towards the audience to coordinate the music with the vocals and actions of the [[singing|singers]], [[dancing|dancers]] and [[acting|actors]], while the orchestra sits facing the conductor. The conductor may also sit at one or more keyboards and conduct as well as play, which often means the use of more head and facial gestures rather than hand gestures.  This is often the case when a show only requires a small orchestra, or on national tours, where the instrumentation is often reduced from the original arrangement and one or two keyboard players substitute for several instruments. In some cases, theatres do not have a pit; in this case, the pit orchestra may play in a room near the stage, watching the conductor's gestures using a video monitor.  

Music parts for pit orchestra [[woodwind]] players in musical theatre are normally divided into "reed books". Orchestration varies with each show based on the type of music that will be performed, such as jazz, classical, or blues. For example, a Reed 1 Book may contain music for piccolo, flute, Eb alto saxophone, Bb clarinet, and/or oboe. A musician handed a reed book would be expected to play each part. Because the musician plays so many different instruments, he or she is referred to as a "doubler" (even though the Reed Books may have up to eight instruments each).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bretpimentel.com/doubling/shows/showsfaq.php|title=Woodwind doubling in Broadway musicals FAQ|accessdate=26 December 2008|author=Bret Pimentel}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Musicians who play in pit orchestras are not only required to play multiple instruments at times, but they must also be familiar and able to play in multiple keys, styles, and tempos and make a switch instantaneously. The orchestration for a musical is written in a key best suited to range of the singer. Some keys are more difficult to play in than others because of the increased attention that greater amounts of sharps and flats require. Musicals also tend to have a number of styles which can range from a soulful ballad to a syncopated funk tune to a driving hard rock song. Many musicians have been trained to play in a certain style, such as classical music, but in order to play in pit orchestras, musicians must be able to play a range of different styles. Because musicals are live, many elements can change from show to show;  pit orchestra musicians consequently should be able to play different tempos every night and even skip through their music to a new spot if an actor or singer makes an error.

==Preparation==

As with any orchestra or similar ensemble, a pit orchestra rehearses with the singers and dancers before the public performances commence. The rehearsals are led by the [[conducting|conductor]]/[[music director]], who sets the tempos, starts the songs and musical interludes and indicates pauses and endings of sections.

Although members of a pit orchestra are not required to demonstrate great stage presence, and they may work out of sight from much of the audience, they can generally be seen from the balcony seats and are thus required to adhere to standard rules of dress and appearance (e.g., formal clothes) &lt;ref&gt;Karen A. Hagberg. ''Stage presence from head to toe: a manual for musicians''. 2003 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Preparation by musicians in a pit orchestra consists of much more than attending rehearsals. Before the first rehearsal, ensemble musicians individually practice their parts, particularly difficult sections (rapid passages, very high or low-register sections) and exposed passages (e.g., instrumental solos). Performers often listen to a recording of the show to learn the tempos and playing styles, particularly if there are sections where the pit orchestra has complex parts which depend on the onstage actors or singers' parts (e.g., a big orchestra chord might have to coincide with the firing of a prop gun onstage).

==Size==
Pit orchestras can range from large orchestras to small rock combos (e.g., guitar/keyboards/bass/drums). While a pit orchestra usually plays in the orchestra pit, there are times when they are on stage in the background (this is usually for rock musicals). In some cases, one or more members of the pit orchestra may have to appear in costume on stage with their instrument and play music as part of a scene. Below are pit orchestra examples from five major theatrical license companies: [[Music Theatre International]], [[Tams-Witmark]], [[Samuel French, Inc.]], Rodgers and Hammerstein Theatricals, and Theatrical Rights Worldwide (excluding any conductor scores unless needed). These show the varying sizes of pit orchestras. Note that string parts are often written with the intent of having two musicians play a specific part, especially in older musicals.

In the 2000s, due to budget constraints, some musicals have replaced instruments from musical arrangements with keyboards. For example, instead of hiring a small [[string section]], a musical may hire one or two [[synthesizer]] players to perform the string parts or the horn parts. Some musicals have used prerecorded [[backing track]] music for shows, which has led to controversy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5654">[[File:Jan de bray regenten dolhuys.JPG|{{largethumb}}|The regents of the ''[[Het Dolhuys|Leproos-, Pest- en Dolhuis]]'' in [[Haarlem]], painted by [[Jan de Bray]] in 1667]]
A '''regents group portrait''', '''regentenstuk''' or '''regentessenstuk''' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally "regents' piece", is a [[Portrait painting|group portrait]] of the board of trustees, called regents or regentesses, of a [[charitable organization]] or [[guild]].  This type of group portrait was popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] during the 17th century, and in the 18th century.  They were intended to be hung in the ''regentenkamer'', the regents' meeting room,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franshalsmuseum.nl/media/medialibrary/2013/04/Informatiepakket_Frans_Hals_2013.pdf "Informatiepakket Frans Hals", Frans Hals Museum] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt; or another prominent location in the institution.

The regents of a charitable organization (such as an [[orphanage]], [[poorhouse]], [[hospital]] or ''[[hofje]]'')  or guild were drawn from the ''[[regenten]]'', the upper class of Dutch society. It was a prestigious honorary office, so the regents were keen to have themselves depicted in this role. The leading portraitists of the day were commissioned to make ''regentenstukken'', including [[Rembrandt]] (whose ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table), [[Frans Hals]], [[Ferdinand Bol]], and [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. The commissions proved lucrative, particularly since the regents only served for a few years, to be replaced with a new set of regents that were equally eager to be painted.
[[File:Frans Hals - De regentessen van het oudemannenhuis.jpg|{{largethumb}}|[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]] in [[Haarlem]], [[Frans Hals]], 1664]]

In some institutions the regentesses were all female, and so the portraits were of all-female groups, or there were mixed-gender regents who were painted separately, as in Hals' two portraits of the ''[[Regents of the Old Men's Almshouse|Regents]]'' and ''[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]]''.  Occasionally the painting depicted not just the regents but also others, such as the ''binnenvader'' or ''binnenmoeder'', who was in charge of the day-to-day operations. For instance, [[Abraham de Vries (painter)|Abraham de Vries]] in 1633 painted a ''regentenstuk'' for the ''Burgerweeshuis'' orphanage in [[Amsterdam]] showing not only the regents but also the ''binnenvader'' leading in a young orphan girl.

Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the [[militia group portrait]] or ''schuttersstuk'' showing officers of a city's ''[[schutterij]]'' or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the 17th century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Boards of trustees preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.  Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter. 

The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. 

In Amsterdam most of these paintings ultimately ended up in possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdam Museum]].

'''Robert Cyril Stebbins''' (March 31, 1915 – September 23, 2013) was an American [[Herpetology|herpetologist]] and illustrator known for his field guides and popular books as well as his studies of reptiles and amphibians. His ''Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'', first published in 1966, is still considered the definitive reference of its kind, owing to both the quality of the illustrations and the comprehensiveness of the text. A professor of zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], for over 30 years, he was the first curator of herpetology at the [[Museum of Vertebrate Zoology]], a 1949 [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim fellow]], and author of over 70 scientific articles.  His discovery of the [[ring species]] phenomenon in ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders is now a textbook example of [[speciation]], and he performed extensive research on the [[parietal eye]] of reptiles. He produced nature films, supported science education in primary grades, and organized conservation efforts that aided in the passing of the [[California Desert Protection Act of 1994|1994 California Desert Protection Act]]. After retirement he continued to paint, collect field notes, and write books. Stebbins is commemorated in the scientific names of three species: ''[[Batrachoseps stebbinsi]]'', the Tehachapi slender salamander; ''[[Anniella stebbinsi]]'', a legless lizard; and ''[[Ambystoma tigrinum|Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi]]'', the endangered Sonora tiger salamander.

Robert Stebbins was born on March 31, 1915, in [[Chico, California]], to parents [[Cyril A. Stebbins|Cyril Adelbert]] and Louise Stebbins (''née'' Beck). His father, born in Wisconsin of English descent,&lt;ref name="Mansfield1918"&gt;{{cite book|first=George C.|last= Mansfield|contribution=Cyril A.

The oldest of seven children, young Robert grew up learning about local birds and exploring the wildlife of Northern California.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=563}} His mother, born in Switzerland and educated at the Normal School,&lt;ref name="Mansfield1918" /&gt; instilled a sense of artistry in Robert, painting pictures for Robert and his siblings in her spare time.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=563}} When Stebbins was seven, his family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, where his father worked on agricultural curriculum for children and taught at the University of California, Berkeley.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=563}} Around the age of nine, his family moved to Southern California, living first in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], then in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles]]. Stebbins spent time hiking in the nearby [[Santa Monica Mountains]], exploring the wildlife and amassing a collection of bird and mammal specimens which he prepared and mounted himself. Stebbins attended [[North Hollywood High School]], where his father taught hygiene and agriculture. Robert graduated in 1933.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=35}}{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=565}} He discovered his artistic talents around sixteen years old. His early work consisted of cartoons: he drew illustrations on classmates' clothing and contributed cartoons to youth magazines, winning several awards.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=564}}{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}}

== University and early career (1933–1945) ==
Shortly after graduating high school, Stebbins enrolled in the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He initially majored in [[civil engineering]], thinking it a better career option than biology, but became unhappy with the program. Struggling with poor performance and health issues related to congenital heart problems,{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}} he took a leave for year and a half. During his time in recuperation, he turned his attention back to natural history, and was persuaded to return to UCLA by [[Raymond B. Cowles|Raymond Cowles]], a biology professor there. Stebbins returned with enthusiasm despite the perceived lack of job security, remarking in 1985: "I was cautious because of the Great Depression, but I was determined to pursue biology even if it meant standing on a corner with a tin cup."{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}} He switched his major to zoology and graduated in 1940 with highest honors.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=565}}
[[File:Coachella Valley Fringe-toed Lizard.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Coachella Valley fringe-toed lizard]], subject of much of Stebbins' graduate research]]
After graduating, Stebbins split his time between a summer job as a naturalist at [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]] and pursuing graduate school at UCLA. Over the next few years he also obtained teaching credentials in junior college, high school, and elementary education. Stebbins initially planned to study birds, with an eye towards [[roadrunner]]s, but felt the field of ornithology was too crowded, while herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, offered more opportunities for new research.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}} Cowles became his graduate advisor. The main focus of Stebbins' graduate research was the biology of [[fringe-toed lizard]]s, a group of sand-dwelling lizards of the American Southwest. For his master's degree (completed in 1942) he studied the anatomical structure of the nasal passages of the lizards, documenting in detail the looped, horseshoe-shaped structure of the nasal passages that functions as a [[Trap (plumbing)|u-trap]], preventing sand grains from being inhaled while the lizards lay buried at the sand's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stebbins|first= Robert C.|title= Adaptations in the nasal passages for sand burrowing in the saurian genus ''Uma''|journal=American Naturalist|year=1943|volume=77|number=768| pages= 38–52|jstor=2457379|doi=10.1086/281097}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Ph.D dissertation (completed in 1943) further explored the anatomical, behavioral, and physiological adaptations of the lizards.&lt;ref name="Stebbins 1944 Uma"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stebbins|first1=Robert C.|title=Some Aspects of the Ecology of the Iguanid Genus ''Uma''|journal=Ecological Monographs|date=1944|volume=14|issue=3|pages=311–332|doi=10.2307/1948446|jstor=1948446}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also published on the behavior of the [[Crotalus cerastes|sidewinder rattlesnake]], and, with his father, produced two field guides to birds, providing illustrations to his father's text. Their first book, ''What Bird is That?'', was pressed in the family garage. Stebbins considered his father "a pioneer of sorts in the extensive use of drawings in teaching natural history," a tradition he later strove to continue in his own works.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=35-36}}

On June 8, 1941, Stebbins married Anna-rose Cooper, who would eventually type the text of all of Stebbins' field guides.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Science Illuminate a Naturalist's Path|date=April 4, 2005|first=Louis |last=Sahagun|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/04/local/me-stebbins4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of their honeymoon was spent camping in the [[Owens Valley]] of southeastern California.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=36}}

== Career (1945–1978) ==

In 1945 Stebbins was hired an assistant professor of zoology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and became the first curator of herpetology at the [[Museum of Vertebrate Zoology]], where he would remain throughout his career. The first faculty member to teach herpetology at Berkeley, he wrote new lab manuals, created the herpetology teaching collection, and co-taught a popular course on vertebrate natural history.{{sfn|Rodriguez-Robles ''et al.''|2003|p=6}}{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}}{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=568–569}}

=== Ring species in salamanders ===
[[File:Ensatina eschscholtzii ring species.jpg|thumb|260px|The various forms of ''Ensatina'' constitute a ring around the Central Valley: adjacent forms interbreed throughout the ring except at the southern end, where two forms behave as separate species.]]
Stebbins soon became interested in ''[[Ensatina]]'' salamanders, which occur from British Columbia to Baja California and are present in both the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] of California but absent in the Central Valley. Finding the salamanders in Berkeley much different than the ones he was used to seeing in the mountains of Southern California, he embarked upon a research program examining color differences throughout California. In his resulting monograph, published in 1949, he proposed that the color varieties—many previously regarded as distinct species—were actually various races or [[subspecies]] of a single species that in most locations interbreed where two forms co-occur, creating hybrids that partially resemble both forms. However, at the southern edge of the Central Valley, where the Sierra foothill populations come into contact with those of the Coast Range, the populations do not interbreed, instead acting as distinct species. This phenomenon is known as a [[ring species|ring speciation]], with different populations representing different stages of [[speciation]], the process by which one species becomes two.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}} Zoologist [[Arnold B. Grobman|Arnold Grobman]] called Stebbins' research "without doubt, the most outstanding study of a genus of American salamanders that has yet appeared."&lt;ref name="Grobman 1951"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Arnold|last= Grobman|title=Review: ''Speciation in Salamanders of the Plethodontid Genus Ensatina''| journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume= 26|number=1 |year=1951| pages= 49–50|jstor=2811314|doi=10.1086/397911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ensatina'' complex has been the focus of research ever since, and is a widely used textbook example of evolutionary processes.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}}

=== Reptilian parietal eye ===
Stebbins' early work with lizards in the southern California desert led to a series of papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the [[parietal eye]] of reptiles (also called the "third eye", a tiny light-sensitive organ on the forehead) and the associated [[pineal gland]], both of which are now known to influence [[circadian rhythm]]s.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=40-41}}{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=567–568}} Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior: they became active much earlier in the day, spent more time in the sun, and remained active much later than [[Scientific control|control]] lizards. Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the [[tuatara]], the pineal gland's effects on lizard reproductive behavior, and parietal skull openings in fossil "mammal-like reptiles" such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=567–568}}&lt;ref name="Eakin1973"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard M. |last=Eakin|title=The Third Eye|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkDgJBd4O6oC|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|pages=28–30|isbn=978-0-520-02413-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work had implications beyond reptile biology: Nobel laureate [[Julius Axelrod]], after reading the work of Stebbins and others, began investigating the pineal gland in mammals, with emphasis on the effect of [[melatonin]] on activity cycles. Melatonin has since been found to influence human health.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=40–41}} Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work, calling it "possibly the single piece of research which gives me the most satisfaction."{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=41}}

=== Other research, conservation, and field guides ===
In 1949 Stebbins received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] that allowed him to extend his studies throughout the western United States and to collect enough material to begin preparing his first amphibian field manuals.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=37-40}} The first of these to appear was ''Amphibians of Western North America'' (1951, University of California Press), covering the U.S. and Canada roughly west of the [[102nd meridian west|102nd meridian]]. Praised for its thoroughness as well as its illustrations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Frogs and Salamanders |first=E. R.|last= Dunn|journal= [[The Scientific Monthly]]|volume= 74|number=4|year=1952|page=239|jstor=20419}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogert 1952" /&gt; the book "unquestionably provides more information concerning the 51 species … covered than any preceding it," wrote [[Charles M. Bogert]]: "The maps provided for each species and subspecies are on the whole the most detailed and accurate of any thus far published."&lt;ref name="Bogert 1952"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogert|first1=Charles M.|title=Open Door to the Amphibia of Western North America|journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]|date=1952|volume=33|issue=3|page=435|doi=10.2307/1932844|jstor=1932844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stebbins' second herpetological field guide, ''Amphibians and Reptiles of Western North America'' (1954, [[McGraw-Hill]]), was similarly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= Karl P.|last= Schmidt|title=Review: ''Amphibians and Reptiles of Western North America.''|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|series= New Series|volume= 121|number= 3137|year=1955|page= 201|jstor=1682630|doi=10.1126/science.121.3137.200}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Galápagos Lava Lizard 02 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left| Stebbins studied thyroid and pineal function in [[Galápagos lava lizard]]s]]
In 1964 Stebbins visited the Galápagos Islands on a research expedition and studied the ecology and behavior of [[marine iguana]]s and [[Microlophus|lava lizards]]. Also on the expedition was [[Roger Tory Peterson]], who recalled "While the rest of were enjoying high adventure on the more remote islands and sea-girt rocks, he patiently snared 200 frisky lizards with a noose of thread suspended from a rod. He took their cloacal temperatures, marked them with dye, and then dosed them with radioactive iodine, which enabled him to locate the elusive reptiles later with a Geiger counter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Roger Tory|contribution=Editor's Note|editor-last=Stebbins|editor-first=Robert C.|title=A Field guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians|edition=2nd|date=1985|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0395082110|pages=v–vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|pp=41-42}}&lt;ref&gt;For details, see {{cite journal|last1=Stebbins|first1=Robert C.|last2=Lowenstein|first2=Jerold M.|last3=Cohen|first3=Nathan W.|title=A field study of the lava lizard (''Tropidurus albemarlensis'') in the Galapagos Islands|journal=Ecology|year=1967|volume=48|issue=5|page=839|doi=10.2307/1933742|jstor=1933742}} and {{cite journal|last1=Lowenstein|first1= Jerold M.|last2= Stebbins|first2= Robert C.|year=1969|title= Iodine metabolism and thyroid activity in parietalectomized tropical lizards|journal= [[Copeia]]|pages=664–669|jstor=1441790|volume=1969|issue= 4|doi=10.2307/1441790}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Stebbins produced what became his best-known book, ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'' ([[Peterson Field Guides]]), which Peterson called "a classic... one of the most beautiful as well as scholarly works in the series".{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=35}}

Stebbins was also committed to education and conservation. He made appearances on the TV series ''[[Science in Action (TV series)|Science in Action]]'', traveled to Asia to promote science education, and chaired a U.C. elementary school science project which recommended that science be taught to children as early as six.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Study Science at Six|journal= The Science News-Letter|volume=80|number=1| year=1961|page= 5|publisher=

(1967). Stebbins co-authored revisions of the widely used textbooks ''General Zoology'' (5th ed.,1972; 6th ed., 1979) and ''Elements of Zoology'' (4th ed., 1974), books originally written by [[Tracy Storer]] and [[Robert Usinger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: ''General Zoology'' by Tracy I.

In the late 1960s Stebbins became concerned about the impacts that increasingly popular [[off-road vehicle]] (ORV) driving was having on desert ecosystems of southern California—witnessing environmental degradation in some of the same places he had studied during graduate school—and became actively involved in over a decade of conservation efforts.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}} Stebbins and colleagues studied the diversity of organisms in and around ORV areas, communicated research to [[Bureau of Land Management]] officials, and petitioned President [[Jimmy Carter]] to limit all-terrain vehicle use in deserts.&lt;ref name="Louv1996"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last= Louv|authorlink=Richard Louv|title=The Web of Life: Weaving the Values That Sustain Us|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8aCOjVmtGMC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1996|publisher=Conari Press|isbn=978-1-57324-140-3|pages=137–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=570}} Stebbins faced opposition from ORV riders and their lobbyists: ''[[American Motorcyclist]]'' magazine called him a "staunch abolitionist in the war against motorized vehicles in the desert."&lt;ref name="AM 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|author=|title='Scientific' exhibit blasts desert riders|journal=American Motorcyclist|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|date=July 1991|pages=38–39|issn=0277-9358|author1=Assoc|first1=American Motorcyclist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stebbins' efforts eventually helped secure the passing of the [[California Desert Protection Act of 1994]] which established the [[Mojave National Preserve]] and elevated [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree]] and [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] from national monuments to more protected national parks.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}}&lt;ref name="NY Times obit" /&gt;  In 1998 Stebbins was recognized in the U.S. Congress by Representative [[George Miller (California politician)|George Miller]] and the ''[[Contra Costa Times]]'' as one of 10 environmental leaders deemed "national treasures" for their activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Miller|last=George|contribution=Salute to 10 Bay Area Environmental Leaders|title=[[Congressional Record]] V. 144 part 14: September 9, 1998 to September 21, 1998|contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDRmm0xOEfMC&amp;pg=PA19809|date=September 9, 1998|publisher=Government Printing Office|pages=19809–19810|id=GGKEY:1EU8A396D22|quote=Robert Stebbins, 83.

Other research included field work in Colombia, South Africa, and Australia, and the description of several species: the [[Jemez Mountains salamander]], [[southern torrent salamander]],  [[Ensatina#Subspecies|yellow-eyed ensatina]], and the [[panamint alligator lizard]].{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}} Two salamanders were named in his honor during his time at Berkeley: the [[Tehachapi slender salamander]] (''Batrachoseps stebbinsi'') and the [[Tiger salamander|Sonora tiger salamander]] (''Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi'').{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=567}}  Over his 32 years at Berkeley, Stebbins was the advisor to 29 graduate students, including [[Wade Fox]], [[Richard G. Zweifel]], and [[R. Bruce Bury]].{{sfn|Rodriguez-Robles ''et al.''|2003|pp=77–96}}  Upon his retirement from UC Berkeley in 1978, Stebbins was awarded the highest faculty honor, the Berkeley Citation.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|pp=568–569}}

== Retirement years (1978–2013) ==
After retiring, Stebbins remained active in painting, conservation, and education, and continued to make natural history observations. He revised his well-known and widely used ''Field Guide'' in 1985 and again in 2003. He co-wrote the non-specialist book ''A Natural History of Amphibians'' with former student Nathan Cohen in 1997, and revised his ''Field Guide to California Amphibians and Reptiles'' in 2012, with new contributions by Samuel McGinnis, another former student. In 2009 he produced ''Connecting With Nature: A Naturalist's Perspective'', a book intended to help connect children with nature. He took additional art lessons, broadened his subject matter to include landscapes, African wildlife, portraits, and still lifes, and took up the violin, which he had studied decades earlier.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=43}}  His paintings have been shown and sold in galleries and museums in Berkeley, Palm Springs, and Oregon.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=564}}{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=43}}

Stebbins was a [[fellow]] of the [[California Academy of Sciences]], which awarded him its highest honor, the Fellows Medal, in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/sites/default/files/assets/docs/pdf/fellows_medalists_2014.pdf|title=Fellows Medalists|year=2014|publisher=California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "Stebbins" ==
[[File:Stebbins Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians cover.jpg|thumb|alt= Three illustrations beneath the bold title text: a frog in profile, the underside of a frog, and a snake|Cover of first edition]]
Stebbins' book ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'', first published in 1966 and revised in 1985 and 2003, has widely been considered "the bible of the field" for American herpetologists.&lt;ref name="Louv1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NY Times obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert C. Stebbins, Chronicler of Western Reptiles and Amphibians, Dies at 98|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Paul|last=Virello|date=October 7, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/us/robert-c-stebbins-chronicler-of-western-reptiles-and-amphibians-dies-at-98.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to simply as "Stebbins", the book has educated and inspired generations of naturalists and herpetologists.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=42}} On the impact of the guide, professor Samuel Sweet of [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UC Santa Barbara]] stated "Before that book, if people went out to look for snakes, it was so they could gather them up to sell to pet shops or just show off to their buddies. What [Stebbins] did was help make a transition to a similar situation as bird watching, where it became OK to just look at the animals and leave them alone."&lt;ref name="LA Times obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert C. Stebbins dies at 98; Berkeley reptile, amphibian expert|date=October 5, 2013|first= David|last= Colker|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/05/local/la-me-robert-stebbins-20131006|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the [[Houghton-Mifflin Company]] first published ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'' as part of its [[Peterson Field Guide]] series. While including some illustrations from Stebbins' previous books, the high quality of the artwork was immediately recognized, as was the quality and thoroughness of the writing.&lt;ref name="WakeCopeia1967"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wake|first=David B.|title=Review: ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians''|journal=Copeia|volume=1967|number=2 |year=1967|pages= 500–501|jstor=1442166|doi=10.2307/1442166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[David Wake]], then of the University of Chicago but later to work with Stebbins at Berkeley, considered the only "serious defect" to be absence of any coverage of snake-bite first aid. Wake also noted that the geographic area covered left a gap ranging from 75 miles to over 400 miles wide when paired with the earlier Peterson Guide to eastern reptiles and amphibians by [[Roger Conant (herpetologist)|Roger Conant]].&lt;ref name="WakeCopeia1967" /&gt;

The second edition, published in 1985, included several changes such as 37 new species, 12 new plates of illustrations, the inclusion of endemic species of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], and new common names chosen to enhance clarity. In his 1986 review, Sweet remarked on the frankness of imperfect knowledge: "For the first time we have a field guide that indicates clearly which taxonomic interpretations are tentative and where distributions and life history features remain poorly known."&lt;ref name="Sweet Copeia 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Samuel S.|last= Sweet|title=Review: ''A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians'', 2nd ed.|journal=Copeia|volume= 1986|number=1|year=1986|pages= 262–263|jstor=1444927|doi=10.2307/1444927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about the impact of over-collecting, Stebbins reduced coverage of collecting and keeping animals, and also removed a section on handling venomous snakes.{{Sfn|Luckenbach|1985|p=43}}

The third edition, published in 2003, included 36 new species and several new paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stebbins|first1=Robert C.|title=A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians|date=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-395-98272-3|edition=3rd|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stebbins considered keeping up-to-date with current scientific literature the most daunting task due to the volume of recent publications.{{sfn|Mulcahy|Mahoney|2006|p=565}}

{{nihongo|'''Shōzaburō Watanabe'''|渡辺 庄三郎|Watanabe Shōzaburō|June 2, 1885 – February 14, 1962}} was a Japanese print publisher and the driving force behind the Japanese printmaking movement known as ''[[shin-hanga]]'' ("new prints").

== Biography ==
He started his career working for the export company of {{illm|Kobayashi Bunshichi|ja|小林文七}}, which gave him an opportunity to learn about exporting art prints. In 1908, Watanabe married Chiyo, a daughter of the woodblock carver Chikamatsu.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Richard and Jennifer Saville, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/watanabe_shozaburo.asp Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;

Watanabe employed highly skilled carvers and printers, and commissioned artists to design prints that combined traditional Japanese techniques with elements of contemporary Western painting, such as perspective and shadows. Watanabe coined the term ''shin-hanga'' in 1915 to describe such prints. [[Charles W. Bartlett]], [[Hashiguchi Goyō]], [[Kawase Hasui]], [[Yoshida Hiroshi]], {{illm|Kasamatsu Shirō|ja|笠松紫浪}}, [[Torii Kotondo]], [[Ohara Koson]], {{illm|Terashima Shimei|ja|寺島紫明}}, [[Itō Shinsui]], [[Takahashi Shōtei]] and [[Yamakawa Shūhō]] are among the artists whose works he published.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Richard and Jennifer Saville, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of his company's stockpile of both prints and their original printing-blocks was destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923. In the following years, new versions of many of these prints were created, using re-carved blocks; typically, the re-issued "post-quake" prints included changes and revisions in the designs.

Watanabe exported most of his ''shin-hanga'' prints to the United States and Europe due to a lack of Japanese interest. After the close of [[World War II]], his heirs continued the business, which still operates.

The awards were established in 2004 to promote Thai contemporary artists who are considered to be in their mid-career and who have already made notable contributions to Thai fine arts and culture.&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"&gt;{{cite web | title = Thunska Pansittivorakul received the Silpathorn award 2007  | publisher = ThaiIndie.com  | url = http://thaiindie.com/wizContent.asp?wizConID=460&amp;txtmMenu_ID=7  | accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Education and promotion of fine arts in the Kingdom of Thailand was under the auspices of the [[Department of Fine Arts (Thailand)|Department of Fine Arts]] of the Ministry of Palace Affairs. In 1943, the department's schools became [[Silpakorn University]], founded by [[Silpa Bhirasri]], an [[Italy|Italian]] sculptor who was named Corrado Feroci, but became a Thai citizen during World War II and is considered the father of fine arts in Thailand.&lt;ref name = "AsiaWeek"&gt;{{cite web | last = Gearing | first = Julian | title = Painted into a corner  | publisher = AsiaWeek | date = 1998-10-02 | url = http://www.asiaweek.com/asiaweek/98/1002/feat3.html  | accessdate = 2007-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other offices promoting fine arts included the Office of the National Culture Commission and the Religious Affairs Department.

In 1985, the Office of the National Culture Commission established the [[Thailand National Artist]] designation, which is conferred on notable Thai artists as a [[award|lifetime achievement award]].

The Office of Contemporary Art and Culture (OCAC), under the Ministry of Culture, was formed in 2001 and was tasked with supporting, and promoting [[contemporary art]] and culture. While the National Artist programme has been generally aimed at veteran artists, especially those in the areas of Thai traditional arts, the OCAC recognised that younger artists needed support, promotion and recognition as well.&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"/&gt; In 2004, the Silpathorn Award was created, with honorees in the fields of visual art, literature, music, film and performing arts. In 2008, an award for the field of design was added.&lt;ref name = "National"/&gt;

===Qualifications===
Silpathorn Award honorees must meet the following qualifications:
*Thai nationals.
*Between the ages 30 to 50 years and still alive on the announcement day.
*Their works have continually been exposed to the general public until present.
*Their works have been released in Thailand and have made a great impact on Thai contemporary art and inspired young artists.&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"/&gt;

===Silpathorn Kitikhun award===
In 2008, a Distinguished ("Kitikhun") category was created for senior artists over 50 years of age who, because of controversy or unconventional works, would likely never be considered for the more conservative [[Thailand National Artist]] honor.&lt;ref name = "National"/&gt;  At first this category was known in English as the "Honorary" category, but the translation was changed to "Distinguished" at the time the awards were actually given.  This is because it was felt that in English an "honorary" award might be considered to be less "real" whereas the intent of the committee was to create a senior grade of the award.

===Definition of Silpathorn===
Silpathorn in [[Thai language]] is a combination of two words: "Silpa", meaning "Art", and "Thorn" (or "Torn"), meaning "the Upholder", thus Silpathorn means "Upholder of Art".&lt;ref name = "ThaiIndie"/&gt;

===Silpathorn brooch, cash prize===
The Silpathorn Award is in the form of a [[brooch]], modeled on the emblem of the Office of Contemporary Art and Culture, and made of white and yellow gold and decorated with diamonds and emeralds. There is also a cash prize, which {{As of|2007|lc=on}} was 100,000 [[Thai baht|baht]].&lt;ref name = "Seven"/&gt;

This early example of [[Printing press|printing]] includes many hand-painted illustrations depicting Lady Philosophy and scenes of fifteenth-century [[Ghent]].}}

'''''The Consolation of Philosophy''''' ({{lang-la|De consolatione philosophiae}}) is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] work by [[Boethius]], written around the year 524. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West on [[Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] [[Christianity]], as well as the last great Western work of the Classical Period.&lt;ref&gt;''The Consolation of Philosophy (Oxford World's Classics)'', Introduction (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dante Divine"&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] placed Boethius the “last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics” among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'') (see also below).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{quote|A golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of [[Plato]] or [[Cicero|Tully]] — &lt;small&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Consolation of Philosophy'' was written in AD 523 during a one-year imprisonment Boethius served while awaiting trial – and eventual execution – for the alleged crime of [[treason]] under the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogothic]] King [[Theodoric the Great]]. Boethius was at the very heights of power in [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and was brought down by treachery. This experience inspired the text, which reflects on how evil can exist in a world governed by God (the problem of [[theodicy]]), and how happiness is still attainable amidst fickle fortune, while also considering the nature of happiness and God. It has been described as "by far the most interesting example of [[prison literature]] the world has ever seen."&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia, [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02610b.htm ''Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius'']. The quote is commonly seen in a number of sources, but without attribution; the Catholic Encyclopedia article (by William Turner, 1907) is the oldest “known” citation found. In fact the phrase is originally from [https://archive.org/details/boethiusanessay00stewuoft ''Boethius, an essay''] (1891), by [[H. F. Stewart]], [https://archive.org/stream/boethiusanessay00stewuoft#page/107/mode/1up page 107] (past paragraph).&lt;/ref&gt;

A link to Christianity is often assumed, yet there is no reference made to Jesus Christ or Christianity or any other specific religion other than a few oblique references to Pauline scripture, such as the symmetry between the opening lines of Book 4 Chapter 3 and 1 Corinthians 9:24. God is however represented not only as an eternal and all-knowing being, but as the source of all Good.

Boethius writes the book as a conversation between himself and Lady Philosophy. Lady Philosophy consoles Boethius by discussing the transitory nature of fame and wealth ("no man can ever truly be secure until he has been forsaken by Fortune"), and the ultimate superiority of things of the mind, which she calls the "one true good". She contends that happiness comes from within, and that virtue is all that one truly has, because it is not imperilled by the vicissitudes of fortune.

Boethius engages questions such as the nature of [[predestination]] and [[free will]], why [[Problem of evil|evil men often prosper and good men fall into ruin]], [[human nature]], [[virtue]], and [[justice]]. He speaks about the nature of free will and [[determinism]] when he asks if God knows and sees all, or does man have free will. On human nature, Boethius says that humans are essentially good and only when they give in to “wickedness” do they “sink to the level of being an animal.” On justice, he says criminals are not to be abused, rather treated with sympathy and respect, using the analogy of doctor and patient to illustrate the ideal relationship between prosecutor and criminal.

In the ''Consolation'', Boethius answered religious questions without reference to Christianity, relying solely on natural philosophy and the Classical [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] tradition. He believed in the correspondence between faith and reason. The truths found in Christianity would be no different from the truths found in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Chadwick |first=Henry |editor=Edward Craig |encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |title=Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus (c.480-525/6) |year=1998 |publisher=Routledge |quote=The ''Opuscula sacra'' regard faith and reason as independent but parallel and compatible ways of attaining to higher metaphysical truths, and the independent validity of logical reasoning is also an underlying presupposition throughout ''De consolatione''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Henry Chadwick, "If the ''Consolation'' contains nothing distinctively Christian, it is also relevant that it contains nothing specifically pagan either...[it] is a work written by a Platonist who is also a Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Chadwick, ''Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy'', 1990, {{ISBN|0-19-826549-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
{{quote|To acquire a taste for it is almost to become naturalised in the Middle Ages — &lt;small&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''The Discarded Image: An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature'', 1964, {{ISBN|0-521-47735-2}}, pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
From the [[Carolingian]] epoch to the end of the Middle Ages and beyond it was one of the most popular and influential philosophical works, read by statesmen, poets, and historians, as well as of philosophers and theologians. It is through Boethius that much of the thought of the Classical period was made available to the Western Medieval world. It has often been said Boethius was the “[[last of the Romans]] and the first of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]]”.&lt;ref name="Dante Divine" /&gt;

[[Image:Consolation of philosophy 1385 boethius images.jpg|thumb|200px|From a 1385 Italian manuscript of the ''Consolation'': Miniatures of Boethius teaching and in prison]]

The philosophical message of the book fits well with the religious piety of the Middle Ages. Readers were encouraged not to seek worldly goods such as money and power, but to seek internalized virtues. Evil had a purpose, to provide a lesson to help change for good; while suffering from evil was seen as virtuous. Because God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Ages, with their vivid sense of an overruling fate, found in Boethius an interpretation of life closely akin to the spirit of Christianity. ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the pagan philosophy of [[Seneca the Younger]] and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by [[Thomas á Kempis]].&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', [http://www.bartleby.com/211/0605.html Volume I Ch.6.5: ''De Consolatione Philosophiae''], 1907–1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is heavily influenced by [[Plato]] and his [[Socratic Dialogue|dialogues]] (as was Boethius himself).&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt; Its popularity can in part be explained by its [[Neoplatonic]] and Christian ethical messages, although current scholarly research is still far from clear exactly why and how the work became so vastly popular in the Middle Ages.

[[Image:ForutuneWheel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lady Fortune]] with [[Rota Fortunae|the Wheel of Fortune]] in a medieval manuscript of a work by [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]; ''The Consolation of Philosophy'' was responsible for the popularity of the goddess of Fortune and the wheel of fortune in the Middle Ages]]

Translations into the [[vernacular]] were done by famous notables, including [[King Alfred]] ([[Old English language|Old English]]), [[Jean de Meun]] ([[Old French]]), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[Middle English]]), [[Queen Elizabeth I]] ([[Early Modern English]]), and [[Notker Labeo]] ([[Old High German]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Found within the ''Consolation'' are themes that have echoed throughout the Western canon: the female figure of wisdom that informs Dante, the ascent through the layered universe that is shared with Milton, the reconciliation of opposing forces that find their way into Chaucer in The Knight's Tale, and the Wheel of Fortune so popular throughout the Middle Ages.

Citations from it occur frequently in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divina Commedia]]''. Of Boethius, Dante remarked ''“The blessed soul who exposes the deceptive world to anyone who gives ear to him.”&lt;ref&gt;''Dante ''The Divine Comedy''. “blessed souls” inhabit Dante's Paradise, and appear as flames. (see note above).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethian influence can be found nearly everywhere in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, e.g. in ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'', ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'', ''[[The Franklin's Tale]]'', ''[[The Parson's Tale]]'' and ''[[The Tale of Melibee]]'', in the character of Lady Nature in ''[[The Parliament of Fowls]]'' and some of the shorter poems, such as ''Truth'', ''The Former Age'' and ''Lak of Stedfastnesse''. Chaucer translated the work in his ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''.

The [[Italians|Italian]] composer [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] used some of the text in his choral work ''[[Canti di prigionia]]'' (1938).  The [[Australia]]n composer [[Peter Sculthorpe]] quoted parts of it in his opera or music theatre work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' (1972–73), which was commissioned for the opening of the [[Sydney Opera House]] but was not ready in time.

[[Tom Shippey]] in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' says how “Boethian” much of the treatment of evil is in [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Shippey says that Tolkien knew well the translation of Boethius that was made by King Alfred and he quotes some “Boethian” remarks from [[Frodo]], [[Treebeard]] and [[Elrond]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''The Road to Middle-earth'', pg. 140, {{ISBN|0-395-33973-1}}, (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boethius and ''Consolatio Philosophiae'' are cited frequently by the main character Ignatius J. Reilly in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]'' (1980).

It is a [[prosimetrum|prosimetrical]] text, meaning that it is written in alternating sections of [[prose]] and metered [[Meter (poetry)|verse]]. In the course of the text, Boethius displays a virtuosic command of the forms of [[Latin poetry]]. It is classified as a [[Menippean satire]], a fusion of [[allegory|allegorical]] tale, [[platonic dialogue]], and lyrical poetry.

In the 20th century there were close to four hundred manuscripts still surviving, a testament to its popularity.{{citation needed| date= March 2017}}

==Reconstruction==

In 2016, researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] reconstructed the original melodies to which The Consolation of Philosophy was performed 1,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;University of Cambridge, [http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/first-performance-in-1000-years-lost-songs-from-the-middle-ages-are-brought-back-to-life-0 ''First performance in 1000 years: lost songs are brought back to life by Cambridge researchers'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mill''''' is an [[Aesthetic Movement]], [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]]-inspired [[oil on canvas]] painting completed by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] in 1882. It is a mysterious painting with no particular meaning. The painting's main feature is three women dancing in front of a mill pond on a summer evening, with a vague wooded landscape spanning the background. ''The Mill'' is currently in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].

==Background==
[[Edward Burne-Jones]] took twelve years to complete ''The Mill'', starting work in 1870&lt;ref name=Bade2011/&gt; and completing it in 1882.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web|title=Study of a Dancing Woman for 'The Mill' c.1870–82|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/burne-jones-study-of-a-dancing-woman-for-the-mill-n03981|website=tate.org.uk|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after its completion, the painting was displayed at an exhibition at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Wahl2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimberly Wahl|title=Dressed As in a Painting: Women and British Aestheticism in an Age of Reform|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UK-3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA84|year=2013|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-61168-415-5|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mill'' was inspired by ''[[The Allegory of Good and Bad Government]]'', a [[mural]] painted by [[Italian Renaissance]] artist [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] between 1338 and 1340.&lt;ref name=leicester&gt;{{cite web|title=Portrait of Marie Spartali, Mrs W.

==Painting==
''The Mill'' is an [[oil on canvas]] painting. It is {{convert|91|cm|in}} in height, and {{convert|197|cm|in}} in width.&lt;ref name="Bade2011"/&gt;

''The Mill'' is a vague and mysterious painting with no particular meaning.&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt; It incorporates styles from the [[Aesthetic Movement]] and the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; In the painting, three women wearing simple, Renaissance-style [[aesthetic]] dresses&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt; are dancing in a garden on a summer evening. On the right of the dancing women, a musician of an indiscernible gender is standing under a [[loggia]].&lt;ref name=Bade2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; A [[mill pond]] can be seen behind the women.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; On the other side of the pond, there are several nude men, who are presumably swimming. In the background is an unspecific landscape consisting of various designs and types of architecture.&lt;ref name=Bade2011/&gt;

The dancing women in the painting were modelled upon women known to Burne-Jones personally: from left to right, [[Aglaia Coronio]], [[Marie Spartali Stillman|Marie Stillman]], and [[Maria Zambaco]].&lt;ref name=MacCarthy&gt;{{cite book | title = The Last Pre-Raphaelite: Edward Burne-Jones and the Victorian Imagination | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = Mar 5, 2012 | pages = 203–204 | ISBN = 9780674065796 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YA-_nl_N-a4C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;l}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aglaia was the daughter of [[Alexander Constantine Ionides|Constantine Ionides]], who, like Burne-Jones, was interested in art. Marie was a painter,&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt; and Maria was Ionides' granddaughter.&lt;ref name=vam/&gt; At the time, Maria was Burne-Jones' [[mistress (lover)|mistress]].&lt;ref name=Wahl2013/&gt;

The '''Trinity Altarpiece''', also known as the '''Trinity Altar Panels''', is a set of four paintings in oil on wood thought to have been commissioned for the [[Trinity College Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, in the late fifteenth century.

The work is attributed to the Flemish artist [[Hugo van der Goes]] and probably represents the inner and outer panels of the wings of a [[triptych]]. The presumed central panel is lost.&lt;ref name=royalcollection&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?object=403260&amp;row=53&amp;detail=about The Royal Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting in the church was described as a "burd" on 17 May 1516 when [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany]] made an offering at the high altar on [[Trinity Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;''Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1903), 79 "for offerand to the He Altar and burd".&lt;/ref&gt;

The work represents a rare example of Scots religious art to have survived the [[iconoclasm]] of the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]]. 

The panels are part of the British [[Royal Collection|Royal Art Collection]] and are displayed at the [[National Gallery of Scotland]].&lt;ref name=nationalgalleries&gt;[http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/artists-a-z/G/4944/artistName/Hugo%20van%20der%20Goes/recordId/17481 National Galleries of Scotland]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The four panels depict the following subjects:

*The [[Holy Trinity]].
*A praying cleric, thought to be the contemporary Provost of Trinity College Kirk, Edward Bonkil,&lt;ref name=nationalgalleries /&gt; accompanied by two angels playing an organ.
*King [[James III of Scotland|James III]] of Scotland at prayer attended by [[Saint Andrew]] and a boy who may be the future King [[James IV]].&lt;ref name=royalcollection /&gt; &amp;nbsp;The royal arms of Scotland hang from a wall.
*Queen [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Scotland]] at prayer attended by [[Saint George]]. Her royal arms decorate her lectern.

==Summary==
[[File:Parco del Valentino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Parco del Valentino.]]
[[File:esposizione torino-foto.jpg|thumb|left|Pavilion of the Ottoman Empire]]
The fair opened on 29 April,&lt;ref name="itworldturin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italyworldsfairs.org/WFTable.html|title=A World's Fair in Italy: Turin 1911|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held just nine years after an earlier [[Prima Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna|Turin fair]] which had focused on the decorative arts, and at the same time as another [[International Exhibition of Art (1911)|Italian fair]] in [[Rome]], also with an arts focus. This fair deliberately distinguished itself by focusing on industry and labour.&lt;ref name="itworldturin" /&gt;

The fair was held in the [[Parco del Valentino]] (as were the three previous Turin fairs in 1884, 1885 and 1902 and the subsequent 1924 Turin fair).&lt;ref name="itworldturin" /&gt;

the Siamese pavilion was designed by [[Mario Tamagno]] and [[Annibale Rigotti]] and had a multi-colored roof with a gold dome&lt;ref name="siam1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italyworldsfairs.org/wf_database/mortals/public/57|accessdate=November 29, 2013|title=A World's Fair in Turin 1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ottoman pavilion was designed by [[Léon Gurekian]].

{{about|a book by [[Leo Tolstoy]]|the general topic of defining "art" and determining what counts as art|classificatory disputes about art}}
'''''What is Art?''''' ({{lang-ru|Что такое искусство?}} ''Chto takoye iskusstvo?'') is a book by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. It was completed in Russian in 1897 but first published in English due to difficulties with the Russian censors.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Ernest (1973). ''What is Art?'', in ''Tolstoy''. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy cites the time, effort, public funds, and public respect spent on art and artists&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). ''What is Art?'' (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky). London: Penguin. pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the imprecision of general opinions on art&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt; as reason for writing the book. In his words, "it is difficult to say what is meant by art, and especially what is good, useful art, art for the sake of which we might condone such sacrifices as are being offered at its shrine".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates an "unremitting moralism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jahn|first1=Gary R.|title=The aesthetic theory of Leo Tolstoy's ''What is Art?''|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=1975|volume=34|issue=1|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluating artworks in light of his radical Christian ethics,&lt;ref&gt;Jahn 1975, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; and displaying a willingness to dismiss accepted masters, including [[Wagner]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 101-12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 33-4, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dante]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95, 137.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the bulk of his own writings.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having rejected the use of beauty in definitions of art (see [[#Aesthetic Theory|aesthetic theory]]), Tolstoy conceptualises art as anything that communicates emotion: "Art begins when a man, with the purpose of communicating to other people a feeling he once experienced, calls it up again within himself and expresses it by certain external signs".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

This view of art is inclusive: "jokes", "home decoration", and "church services" may all be considered art as long as they convey feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41, Jahn 1975, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also amoral: "[f]eelings … very bad and very good, if only they infect the reader … constitute the subject of art".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 39"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy also notes that the "sincerity" of the artist—that is, the extent to which the artist "experiences the feeling he conveys"—influences the infection.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 121, 93, 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating the content of art ==

While Tolstoy's basic conception of art is broad&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and amoral,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 39"/&gt; his idea of "good" art is strict and moralistic, based on what he sees as the function of art in the development of humanity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;just as in the evolution of knowledge - that is, the forcing out and supplanting of mistaken and unnecessary knowledge by truer and more necessary knowledge - so the evolution of feelings takes place by means of art, replacing lower feelings, less kind and less needed for the good of humanity, by kinder feelings, more needed for that good. This is the purpose of art.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 123-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Christian art ==
Tolstoy's analysis is influenced by his radical Christian views (see ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''), views which led him to be excommunicated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Pevear, Richard (1995). "Preface" in Tolstoy, Leo (1995 [1897]). ''What is Art?'' (Translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky ed.). London: Penguin. p, xxii. {{ISBN|9780140446425}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He states that Christian art, rooted in "the consciousness of sonship to God and the brotherhood of men":&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 130"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;can evoke reverence for each man's dignity, for every animal’s life, it can evoke the shame of luxury, of violence, of revenge, of using for one’s pleasure objects that are a necessity for other people, it can make people sacrifice themselves to serve others freely and joyfully, without noticing it.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 166"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ultimately, "by calling up the feelings of brotherhood and love in people under imaginary conditions, religious art will accustom people to experiencing the same feelings in reality under the same conditions".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 166"/&gt;

Tolstoy's examples: [[Schiller]]'s ''[[The Robbers]]'', [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'', [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' and ''[[The Chimes]]'', [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|The House of the Dead]]'', [[George Eliot]]'s ''[[Adam Bede]]'',&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 132"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Ge|Ge's]] Judgement, [[Sándor Liezen-Mayer|Liezen-Mayer's]] Signing the Death Sentence, and paintings "portraying the labouring man with respect and love" such as those by [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]], [[Jules Breton|Breton]], [[Léon Augustin Lhermitte|Lhermitte]], and [[Franz Defregger|Defregger]].&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 133"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal art==

"Universal" art&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 132"/&gt; illustrates that people are "already united in the oneness of life's joys and sorrows"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; by communicating "feelings of the simplest, most everyday sort, accessible to all people without exception, such as the feelings of merriment, tenderness, cheerfulness, peacefulness, and so on".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 130"/&gt; Tolstoy contrasts this ideal with art that is partisan in nature, whether it be by class, religion, nation, or style.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 134, 136, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy's examples: he mentions, with many qualifiers, the works of [[Cervantes]], Dickens, [[Moliere]], [[Gogol]], and [[Pushkin]], comparing all of these unfavourably to the story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]].&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 133"/&gt;
In music he commends a violin aria of [[Bach]], the [[Nocturnes, Op. 9 (Chopin)|E-flat major nocturne]] of Chopin, and "selected passages" from [[Schubert]], [[Haydn]], Chopin, and [[Mozart]]. He also speaks briefly of [[genre paintings]] and [[Landscape painting|landscapes]].&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 135"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluating style ==

{{Empty section|date=August 2014}}

== Obscurity versus accessibility ==

Tolstoy notes the susceptibility of his contemporaries to the "charm of obscurity".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Works have become laden with "euphemisms, mythological and historical allusions", and general "vagueness, mysteriousness, obscurity and inaccessibility to the masses".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tolstoy lambastes such works, insisting that art can and should be comprehensible to everyone. Having emphasised that art has a function in the improvement of humanity - capable of expressing man’s best sentiment - he finds it offensive that artists should be so wilfully and arrogantly abstruse.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 43, 47, 63-84, 123-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artificiality==

One criticism Tolstoy levels against art is that at some point it "ceased to be sincere and became artificial and cerebral",&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the creation of millions of works of technical brilliance but few of honourable sentiment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy outlines four common markers of bad art: these are not however considered the canon or ultimate indicators
# Borrowing
# Imitation
# Effectfulness
# Diversion&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 84"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borrowing ===

Involves recycling and concentrating elements from other works,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 84"/&gt; typical examples of which are: "maidens, warriors, shepherds, hermits, angels, devils in all forms, moonlight, thunderstorms, mountains, the sea, precipices, flowers, long hair, lions, the lamb, the dove, the nightingale".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imitation ===

Imitation is highly descriptive realism, where painting becomes photography, or a scene in a book becomes a listing of facial expressions, tone of voice, the setting, and so on.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 86"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Any potential communication of feeling is "disrupted by the superfluity of details".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effectfulness===

Reliance on "strikingness", often involving contrasts of "horrible and tender, beautiful and ugly, loud and soft, dark and light", descriptions of lust,&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 86"/&gt; "crescendo and complication", unexpected changes in rhythm, tempo, etc.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 87"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy contends that works marked by such techniques "do not convey any feeling, but only affect the nerves".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diversion ===

Diversion is "an intellectual interest added to the work of art", such as the melding of documentary and fiction, as well as the writing of novels, poetry, and music "in such a way that they must be puzzled out".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 87"/&gt; All such works do not correspond with Tolstoy's view of art as the infection of others with feelings previously experienced,&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and his exhortation that art be "universal" in appeal.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 135"/&gt;

== The corruption of art ==

{{Empty section|date=August 2014}}

== Causes ==

=== Church Christianity and the Renaissance ===

Tolstoy approves of early Christian art for being inspired by love of Christ and man, as well as its antagonism to pleasure-seeking. He prefers this to the art born of "Church Christianity", which ostensibly evades the "essential theses of true Christianity" (that is, that all men are born of the Father, are equals, and should strive towards mutual love).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897],  p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Art became pagan—worshipping religious figures—and subservient to the dictates of the Church.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The corruption of art was deepened after the [[Crusades]], as the abuse of papal power became more obvious. The rich began to doubt, seeing contradictions between the actions of the Church and the message of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 45, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; But instead of turning back to the early Christian teachings, the upper classes began to appreciate and commission art that was merely pleasing.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 46-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency was facilitated by the [[Renaissance]], with the aggrandisement of ancient Greek art, philosophy, and culture which, Tolstoy alleges, is inclined to pleasure and beauty worship.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 46-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aesthetic theory ===

Tolstoy perceives the roots of [[aesthetics]] in the Renaissance. Art for pleasure was validated in reference to the philosophy of the Greeks&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noyes, George (1918). ''Tolstoy''. London: Duffield, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; and the elevation of “beauty” as a legitimate criterion with which to separate good from bad art.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 53"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy moves to discredit aesthetics by reviewing and reducing previous theories - including those of [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 17, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kant]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 20-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 24-5.&lt;/ref&gt; - to two main “aesthetic definitions of beauty”:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# The "objective" or "mystical" definition of beauty&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; in which beauty is "something absolutely perfect which exists outside us",&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 32"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; whether it be associated with "idea, spirit, will, God"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# The "subjective" definition of beauty, in which "beauty is a certain pleasure we experience, which does not have personal advantage as its aim".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This definition tends to be more inclusive, enabling things like food and fabric to be called art&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Tolstoy then argues that, despite their apparent divergence, there is little substantive difference between the two strands. This is because both schools recognise beauty only by the pleasure it gives: "both notions of beauty come down to a certain sort of pleasure that we receive, meaning that we recognize as beauty that which pleases us without awakening our lust".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 32"/&gt; Therefore, there is no objective definition of art in aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolstoy condemns the focus on beauty/pleasure at length, calling aesthetics a discipline:

&lt;blockquote&gt;according to which the difference between good art, conveying good feelings, and bad art, conveying wicked feelings, was totally obliterated, and one of the lowest manifestations of art, art for mere pleasure - against which all teachers of mankind have warned people - came to be regarded as the highest art. And art became, not the important thing it was intended to be, but the empty amusement of idle people.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 53"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Professionalism ===

Tolstoy sees the developing professionalism of art as hampering the creation of good works. 
 
The professional artist can and must create to prosper, making for art that is insincere and most likely partisan - made to suit the whims of fashion or [[patrons]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 93-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art criticism is a symptom of the obscurity of art, for "[a]n artist, if he is a true artist, has in his work conveyed to others the feelings he has experienced: what is there to explain?".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism, moreover, tends to contribute to the veneration of "authorities"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Shakespeare]] and [[Dante]].&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; By constant unfavourable comparison, the young artist is corralled into imitating the works of the greats, as all of them are said to be true art. In short, new artists imitate the classics, setting their own feelings aside, which, according to Tolstoy, is contrary to the point of art.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 95-6, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art schools teach people how to imitate the method of the masters, but they cannot teach the sincerity of emotion that is the propellant of great works.&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 98"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In Tolstoy's words, "[n]o school can call up feelings in a man, and still less can it teach a man what is the essence of art: the manifestation of feeling in his own particular fashion".&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 98"/&gt;

== Consequences ==

# "[T]he enormous waste of working people's labour",&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 139"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; with individuals spending so much time contemplating and creating bad art that they become "incapable of anything that is really necessary for people"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The volume of art produced provides "the amusement which turns these people's eyes from the meaninglessness of their lives and saves them from the boredom that oppresses them", it enables them "to go on living without noticing the meaninglessness and cruelty of their life"&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The confusion and perversion of values. It becomes normal to worship not great religious figures but people who write incomprehensible poems&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 143"&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The worship of beauty legitimises the disregarding of morality as a criterion for evaluating cultural products&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Modern art "direct corrupts people" by infecting them with feelings of superstition, patriotism, and sensuality&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book Tolstoy demonstrates a willingness to dismiss generally accepted masters, among them [[Liszt]], [[Richard Strauss]],&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 139"/&gt; [[Nietzsche]],&lt;ref name="Tolstoy 1995 1897, p. 143"/&gt; and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also labels his own works as "bad art", excepting only the short stories "[[God Sees the Truth, But Waits|God Sees the Truth]]" and "Prisoner of the Caucasus".&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], pp. 197-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attempts to justify these conclusions by pointing to the ostensible chaos of previous aesthetic analysis. Theories usually involve selecting popular works and constructing principles from these examples. Volkelt, for instance, remarks that art cannot be judged on its moral content because then ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' would not be good art. Such retrospective justification cannot, he stresses, be the basis for theory, as people will tend to create subjective frameworks to justify their own tastes.&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy 1995 [1897], p. 33-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Jahn notes the "often confusing use of categorisation"&lt;ref&gt;Jahn 1975, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lack of definition of the key concept of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Jahn 1975, pp. 61-2&lt;/ref&gt; Bayley writes that "the effectiveness of ''What is Art?'' lies not so much in its positive assertions as in its rejection of much that was taken for granted in the aesthetic theories of the time".&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, John (1986 [1966]). ''What is Art?'' - excerpt from ''Tolstoy and the Novel'' in Bloom, Harold (ed.). ''Leo Tolstoy''. New York: Chelsea House. p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; Noyes criticises Tolstoy's dismissal of beauty,&lt;ref&gt;Noyes 1918, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; but states that, "despite its shortcomings", ''What is Art?'' "may be pronounced the most stimulating critical work of our time".&lt;ref&gt;Noyes 1918, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmons mentions the "occasional brilliant passages" along with the "repetition, awkward language, and loose terminology".&lt;ref&gt;Simmons 1973, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aylmer Maude]], translator of many of Tolstoy's writings, calls it "probably the most masterly of all Tolstoy's works", citing the difficulty of the subject matter and its clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Maude, Aylmer (1901''a''). "''What is Art?'' - An Introduction", in Tolstoy and his problems: essays. London: Grant Richards. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; For a comprehensive review of the reception at the time of publication, see Maude 1901''b''.&lt;ref&gt;Maude, Aylmer (1901''b'').
