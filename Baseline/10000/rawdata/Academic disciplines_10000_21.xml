      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5667">'''Accident-proneness''', also known as '''clumsiness''', is the idea that some people have a greater predisposition than others to suffer [[accident]]s, such as [[car crash]]es and [[industrial injuries]]. It may be used as a reason to deny any [[insurance]] on such individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insurancecompanies.com/insider-information-how-insurance-companies-measure-risk/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, M. and Woods, H.M. (1919) The incidence of industrial accidents upon individuals with special reference to multiple accidents. ''Industrial Fatigue Research Board, Medical Research Committee'', Report No. 4. Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.

== Present study ==

The subject is still being studied actively.  Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in [[safety engineering]], where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.
One of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Statistical evidence ===

Statistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Doubt ===

However, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a ''distinct, persistent and independently verifiable'' physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Nature and causes ===

The exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown.  Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included [[absent-mindedness]], [[wikt:clumsiness|clumsiness]], [[carelessness]], [[impulsivity]], predisposition to [[risk]]-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.
Broad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc |title=創造性ﾃｽﾄ、薬不要の風邪治療(妊婦､ｱｽﾘｰﾄ､NSAID)、適性ﾃｽﾄ |publisher=F6.dion.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=2015-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923000135/http://www.f6.dion.ne.jp/~iccinc/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agonist full and partial.svg|thumb|320px|Agonists activating hypothetical receptors.]]
[[Image:Efficacy spectrum.png|right|thumb|320px|Efficacy spectrum of receptor ligands.]]

An '''agonist''' is a chemical that binds to a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] and activates the receptor to produce a biological response. Whereas an agonist causes an action, an [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]] blocks the action of the agonist, and an [[inverse agonist]] causes an action opposite to that of the agonist.

== {{anchor|Full agonist|Types}}Types of agonists == &lt;!--"Selective agonist" and "Full agonist" redirect here via "Types" and "Full agonist" respectively.--&gt;

[[Receptor (biochemistry)|Receptors]] can be activated by either [[endogenous]] agonists (such as [[hormone]]s and [[neurotransmitter]]s) or [[exogenous]] agonists (such as [[medication|drugs]]), resulting in a biological response. A [[physiological agonism and antagonism|physiological agonist]] is a substance that creates the same bodily responses but does not bind to the same receptor.

* An [[endogenous agonist]] for a particular receptor is a compound naturally produced by the body that binds to and activates that receptor. For example, the endogenous agonist for [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]] is [[serotonin]], and the endogenous agonist for [[dopamine receptor]]s is [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman and Gilman's Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. (11th edition, 2008). p14. {{ISBN|0-07-144343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Full agonists''' bind to and activate a receptor with the maximum response that an agonist can elicit at the receptor. One example of a drug that can act as a full agonist is [[isoproterenol]], which mimics the action of [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] at [[Adrenergic receptor|β adrenoreceptors]]. Another example is [[morphine]], which mimics the actions of [[endorphin]]s at [[μ-opioid receptor]]s throughout the [[central nervous system]]. However, a drug can act as a full agonist in some tissues and as a partial agonist in other tissues, depending upon the relative numbers of receptors and differences in receptor coupling.{{mcn|date=December 2017}}
* A '''co-agonist''' works with other co-agonists to produce the desired effect together. [[NMDA receptor]] activation requires the binding of both [[glutamate]], [[glycine]] and D-serine co-agonists.
* A '''selective agonist''' is selective for a specific type of receptor. E.g. [[buspirone]] is a selective agonist for serotonin 5-HT1A.
* [[Partial agonist]]s (such as [[buspirone]], [[aripiprazole]], [[buprenorphine]], or [[clozapine|norclozapine]]) also bind and activate a given receptor, but have only partial [[Intrinsic activity|efficacy]] at the receptor relative to a full agonist, even at maximal receptor occupancy. Agents like [[buprenorphine]] are used to treat [[opiate]] dependence for this reason, as they produce milder effects on the opioid receptor with lower dependence and abuse potential.
* An [[inverse agonist]] is an agent that binds to the same receptor binding-site as an agonist for that receptor and inhibits the constitutive activity of the receptor. [[Inverse agonist]]s exert the opposite pharmacological effect of a receptor agonist, not merely an absence of the agonist effect as seen with antagonist. An example is the cannabinoid inverse agonist [[rimonabant]].
* A [[superagonist]] is a term used by some to identify a compound that is capable of producing a greater response than the [[endogenous agonist]] for the target receptor. It might be argued that the endogenous agonist is simply a partial agonist in that tissue.
* An [[irreversible agonist]] is a type of agonist that binds permanently to a receptor through the formation of covalent bonds. A few of these have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = ((De Mey JGR)), Compeer MG, Meens MJ |title= Endothelin-1, an Endogenous Irreversible Agonist in Search of an Allosteric Inhibitor |journal= Mol Cell Pharmacol |volume= 1 |issue= 5 |pages= 246–257 |date=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Rosenbaum DM, Zhang C, Lyons JA, Holl R, Aragao D, Arlow DH, Rasmussen SG, Choi HJ, Devree BT, Sunahara RK, Chae PS, Gellman SH, Dror RO, Shaw DE, Weis WI, Caffrey M, Gmeiner P, Kobilka BK |title= Structure and function of an irreversible agonist-β(2) adrenoceptor complex |journal= Nature |volume= 469 |issue= 7329 |pages= 236–40 |date= January 2013 |pmid= 21228876 |doi= 10.1038/nature09665 |pmc=3074335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New findings that broaden the conventional definition of pharmacology demonstrate that [[ligand]]s can concurrently behave as agonist ''and'' antagonists at the same receptor, depending on effector pathways or tissue type. Terms that describe this phenomenon are "[[functional selectivity]]", "protean agonism",&lt;ref name="pmid11259378"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Kenakin T |title= Inverse, protean, and ligand-selective agonism: matters of receptor conformation |journal= FASEB J. |volume= 15 |issue= 3 |pages= 598–611 |date=March 2001 |pmid= 11259378 |doi= 10.1096/fj.00-0438rev }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16803859"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Urban JD, Clarke WP, von Zastrow M, Nichols DE, Kobilka B, Weinstein H |title= Functional selectivity and classical concepts of quantitative pharmacology |journal= J.

== Activity ==

=== Potency ===
Potency is the amount of agonist needed to elicit a desired response. The [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] of an agonist is inversely related to its [[Half maximal effective concentration|EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] value. The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; can be measured for a given agonist by determining the concentration of agonist needed to elicit half of the maximum biological response of the agonist. The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar [[efficacy#Pharmacology|efficacies]] producing physiologically similar effects.  The smaller the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value, the greater the potency of the agonist, the lower the concentration of drug that is required to elicit the maximum biological response.

=== Therapeutic index ===
When a drug is used therapeutically, it is important to understand the margin of safety that exists between the dose needed for the desired effect and the dose that produces unwanted and possibly dangerous side-effects (measured by the TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of individuals). This relationship, termed the [[therapeutic index]], is defined as the ratio [[median toxic dose|TD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]:[[Effective dose (pharmacology)|ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In general, the narrower this margin, the more likely it is that the drug will produce unwanted effects. The therapeutic index emphasizes the importance of the margin of safety, as distinct from the potency, in determining the usefulness of a drug.

== Etymology ==
From the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] '''αγωνιστής''' (agōnistēs), contestant; champion; rival &lt; '''αγων''' (agōn), contest, combat; exertion, struggle &lt; '''αγω''' (agō), I lead, lead towards, conduct; drive

Alpha-GPC rapidly delivers [[choline]] to the brain across the [[blood–brain barrier]] and is a biosynthetic precursor of acetylcholine.&lt;ref name="Parnetti" /&gt; It is a non-prescription drug in most countries.

==Efficacy==
Studies have investigated the efficacy of alpha-GPC for cognitive disorders including stroke and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. An Italian multicentre clinical trial on 2,044 patients suffering from recent stroke were supplied alpha-GPC in doses of 1,000&amp;nbsp;mg/day for 28&amp;nbsp;days and 400&amp;nbsp;mg three times per day for the five ensuing months. The trial confirmed the therapeutic role of alpha-GPC on the cognitive recovery of patients based on four measurement scales, three of which reached statistical significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Alpha-Glycerophosphocholine in the mental recovery of cerebral ischemic attacks.

==Storage==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
Many users report degradation of alpha-GPC when stored openly or for long periods of time. Alpha-GPC is [[hygroscopic]] and will pull moisture in from the surrounding air. This will cause the powder to turn into what appears to be a gel. Alpha-GPC with &gt;99% purity will undergo this process at a visible rate (seconds to minutes) and thus requires minimized exposure to the air. This hygroscopic quality can cause gel capsules not fully packed with alpha-GPC to dissolve. Proper storage methods need to be used with alpha-GPC and include removing all air from the container, double bagging with plastic bags rated for chemicals (less likely to leak air), and storing bulk/excess inside the freezer. Vacuum sealed bags are highly recommended. For people accessing alpha-GPC daily it is advisable to separate a month's supply from excess and storing the excess as best as possible. Vacuum sealing a large supply into many 1 month dividends is a method positively reported by many users. It is important to note that hygroscopy is not degradation and leaves the substance still usable; however, the ability to accurately weigh a dose is no longer possible as the substance being weighed will be a mixture of powder and water. Liquefied or gelled alpha-GPC may also be indicative of poor storage and thus have an increased likelihood of actual degradation.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The '''art of Newfoundland and Labrador''' has followed a unique artistic trajectory when compared to mainland Canada, due to the geographic seclusion and socio-economic history of the province. Labradorian art possesses its own historical lineage.

While the history of craft and folk art in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] is extensive, fine arts practices have developed primarily since 1949, when the province joined Canada. Prior to [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], the majority of fine art was created by visiting and itinerant artists. Newfoundland and Labradorian art developed significantly after joining Canada, with the introduction of government initiatives.  Since the 1960s in particular, waves of artists have established practices on the island, many with strong roots in the province. Others have been introduced by professional opportunities, residency programs, art education programs, and galleries. An established community of artists is now widely recognized, and creates work in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Labrador ==

[[File:Ours nageant (Musée du quai Branly) (3034045389).jpg|thumb|Artifact from Dorset Culture (Collection: Musée du quai Branly)|left]] Labradorian art has its roots in both the aboriginal cultures and the European contact period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The earliest examples of art in the province were produced by aboriginal peoples, with the oldest known object identified with the [[Dorset Culture]], created around 800 A.D.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/visual-arts.php|title=Visual Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During two centuries of European trader and missionary contact with the Inuit, Innu and Settlers of Labrador, there was minor trade in available carvings and crafts. Moravian missionaries arrived in northern Labrador in the 1700s, and [[Wilfred Grenfell|Grenfell]]'s medical mission traveled in the 1800s to southern Labrador and northern Newfoundland. Mission workers helped create a local handicraft industry that allowed residents to sell hooked mats, knitted goods and other items at North American retail shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/grenfell-mission.php|title=Grenfell Mission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, early Grenfell rugs are considered works of art, and many dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s are held in museum collections throughout North America.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labradorvirtualmuseum.ca/home/contemporary_art.htm|title=Contemporary Art : Labrador Virtual Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, contemporary visual arts began to flourish. This trend was bolstered by government initiatives, the introduction of technologies and transportation, and a shift in attitude toward northern and aboriginal art as cultural and artistic collector items. In Labrador, this began with a Provincial Government rural development initiative called [[Labrador Craft Producers Association]] (LCPA), which was headed by [[Garfield Warren]]. [[Nain, Newfoundland and Labrador|Nain]] was also visited around this time by visual artist [[Bill Ritchie (Canadian artist)|Bill Ritchie]], who encouraged sculpture and printmaking among Labrador's Inuit artists and initiated a collective for the development and sale of visual arts by artists like [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]] and [[John Terriak]]. The [[Labrador Inuit Association]] continued Ritchie's work for approximately a decade, with marketing and promotion of north coast Inuit art. Arts and crafts as an industry were developed by the LCPA throughout the rest of Labrador until the initiative dismantled in 1993. Prior to its demise, the LCPA mounted a major exhibition and video project entitled "Visions of Labrador," which took place in 1991.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

The Labrador Arts and Culture Centre opened in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285|title=Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada – Official Tourism Website|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804165348/http://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/PlanYourTrip/Detail/25080285#|archive-date=2016-08-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aided the growth of visual arts in western Labrador. Individual artists and artists' collectives in the Straits, [[Lake Melville]] and [[Labrador West]] began to develop, market and promote themselves in the visual arts. Labrador Handicrafts Inc. and The Birches Gallery stepped in to fill the void left by government and aboriginal associations. In [[Happy Valley – Goose Bay|Goose Bay]], The Birches Gallery mounted a series of exhibitions and promotional events, in Labrador and several sites throughout North America, from 1994 to 2004.&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt; This, combined with a new initiative in Labrador of the St. John's-based [[Newfoundland and Labrador Craft Council]]'s Labrador Craft Marketing Agency in 1996, provided new impetus for a strong arts and crafts industry. A Visual Arts Association has continued in Western Labrador for more than 20 years, headed by artists such as [[Joyce Channing]], [[Sheilagh Harvey]], [[Margorie O'Brien]], and [[Ed Owen (Canadian artist)|Ed Owen]].&lt;ref name="labradorvirtualmuseum.ca"/&gt;

Today, a strong community of visual arts and artists work in Labrador, basing their work in a variety of media. Notable Labradorian artists include [[Boyd Chubbs]], [[Robin Smith Peck]], [[Mike Massie]], [[Billy Gauthier]], [[Gilbert Hay (artist)|Gilbert Hay]], [[John Terriak]], [[William Lucy]], George Flowers, [[Derrick Pottle]], [[George Collins (artist)|George Collins]], [[David Terriak]], [[Georgina Broomfield]], [[Emily Flowers]], [[John Neville (artist)|John Neville]], [[Madeline Michelin]], [[Barry Pardy]], [[Garmel Rich]], and [[Shannon Simms]].

In 2016, the first exhibition of art by Labrador Inuit was held at [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery. Titled "SakKijâjuk: Inuit Fine Art and Craft from Nunatsiavut," the exhibition described the history of post-Confederation artistic production in Nunatsiavut.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sakkijajuk.com/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art in Newfoundland ==

=== Beothuk art ===

[[File:"Sketch IX" by Shawnadithit.gif|thumb|"Emblems of Red Indian Mythology" (sketch IX) by Shawnadithit|left]]
[[Beothuk]] were the indigenous inhabitants of Newfoundland from AD 1500 onward, now believed to be largely extinct due to a contraction in their territories following contact with Europeans. Little documentation exists about their cultural practices. Many Beothuk artifacts were discovered in grave sites during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and include carved bone, antler and ivory pendants intricately decorated with incised patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/aboriginal/beothuk-culture.php|title=Beothuk Culture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notable feature of [[Beothuk culture]] was the use of powdered [[hematite]], or [[red ochre]], which they used to paint their canoes and other artifacts, and their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/beothuk/|title=Beothuk|first=James A.|last=Tuck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1829, ten drawings were obtained by Mr W. E. Cormack during the winter of 1829 from the last known full-blooded Beothuk, [[Shanawdithit]], while she resided in his St. John's house. They present articles of food, utensils, implements and emblems used by the Beothuk, as well as scenes enacted on or near the [[Exploits River]] and [[Red Indian Lake]] between the years 1810 and 1823. "Although rude and truly Indian in character," James P. Howley wrote in 1915 (judging them by European aesthetic standards),"they nevertheless display no small amount of artistic skill, and there is an extraordinary minuteness of topographical detail in those having reference to the Exploits River and adjacent country. These latter bear a striking resemblance to Micmac sketches of a similar character, such as I have frequently seen and made use of, when accompanied by Micmac canoemen on the Geological Survey of the Island. There is one notable omission in either, i.e., the entire absence of anything like a regular scale. As a rule, rivers and lakes are greatly exaggerated, and particular features, which may in nature be situated widely apart, are frequently crowded into a very small space; the reverse being just as frequently the case."&lt;ref&gt;James P. Howley, F.G.S., "Drawings by Shanawdithit", THE BEOTHUCKS OR RED INDIANS: THE ABORIGINAL INHABITANTS OF NEWFOUNDLAND, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1915, Memorial University of Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Website&lt;/ref&gt;

Until about 1900, most art was the work of visiting and itinerant artists. The first known image of the Newfoundland landscape is alleged to have been produced by the itinerant artist [[Gerard Edema]] in the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Russell Harper, Painting in Canada: A History, 2nd ed. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1981), pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; known for "painting landscapes, in which he exhibited a variety of scenes of horror, such as rocks, mountains, precipices, cataracts, and other marks of savage nature."&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole. Anecdotes of Painting in England. (London: Alexander Murray, 1871), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Topographic drawings and watercolours by naval and military officers were the prevalent art form until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as [[William Eagar]] attempted to teach picturesque painting while in Newfoundland, but his efforts to promote the "new" branch of art were met with very little interest.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra E. Carter, William H. Eagar: "Sensibilities of No Common Order" Masters thesis (Concordia University Fine Arts Department, 1979), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the artist [[J.W. Nichols]] composed an instructional article for the public in the Newfoundland Quarterly on "Recreative Art," which provided guidelines for amateurs wishing to explore Nature by painting its beauty.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Nichols, "Recreative Art," The Newfoundland Quarterly, vol 2, 1902-1903, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Newfoundland-born artists such as [[Maurice Galbraith Cullen|Maurice Cullen]] and [[Robert Pilot]] traveled to Europe to study art with prominent ateliers.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 20th century brought visiting artists such as [[Rockwell Kent]], and [[Eliot O'Hara]] to Newfoundland. Members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] came to the island on numerous occasions, drawn to its rocky landscape and northern topography. [[A.Y. Jackson]], [[Arthur Lismer]], and [[Lawren Harris]] created a number of works during their visits, primarily landscape and rural scenes. [[F.H. Varley]] would provide woodcut landscape illustrations for the first commercial release of Newfoundland poet [[E. J. Pratt]], titled "Newfoundland Verse" (1923).&lt;ref&gt;Northrup Frye, Preface to The Bush Garden: Essays on the Canadian Imagination (Toronto: House of Anansi Press, 1971), p. i-iv&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable artists in the 1930s include [[Rhoda Dawson]], who arrived in 1930 to be a design instructor with the Grenfell mission until 1933, returning in 1934 from England to teach at [[Payne's Cove]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Neary, Explanatory material for Rhoda Dawson's "The Wharves of St. John's Newfoundland," Canadian Parliamentary Review, Summer, 1992, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[George Campbell Tinning]] visited Newfoundland as a war artist during the Second World War, returning to paint in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/sgc-cms/histoires_de_chez_nous-community_memories/pm_v2.php?id=story_line&amp;lg=English&amp;fl=0&amp;ex=00000723&amp;sl=7678&amp;pos=1|title=Campbell Tinning - The Newfoundland Paintings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local amateur art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly [[The Art Students Club]], which opened in 1940. Organized by Muriel (Mrs. A.C.) Hunter, with Harold Goodridge as President, the club grew to 40 active members and 100 associates over 10 years, and featured work of artists from overseas and from Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;"Without a Suitable Gallery, Club Tries to Encourage Nfld. Art," The Daily News, (June 23, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; With no official gallery space, exhibitions were held in various locations. Although none were formally trained, notable artists included J.W. Hayward and his son Thomas B. Hayward; Agnes Marian Ayre; and [[Harold B. Goodridge]] (who worked on a number of mural commissions, including one for the lobby of the [[Confederation Building (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Confederation Building]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]).&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1949, [[Robert Ayre]], then editor of [[Canadian Art]], described Newfoundland's artistic environment as one left largely to "outsiders and amateurs" due to its geographic isolation and small population.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ayre, "Art" in W. Stewart Wallace, The Encyclopedia of Canada. Newfoundland and Supplement, vol. 104 (Toronto: University Associates of Canada, 1949) pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After Confederation: A Cultural Renaissance ===

After [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] joined Canada in 1949, government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists. The visual arts of the province developed significantly in the second half of the century, with the return of young Newfoundland artists who had studied abroad. Among the first were [[Rae Perlin]], who studied at the [[Art Students League]] in New York, and [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]] and [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], who both graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; The Shepherds would establish the province's first art school, the Newfoundland Academy of Art, in a house in downtown [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/reginald-shepherd.php|title=Reginald Shepherd|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the [[Memorial University Extension Services]] and [[St. Michael's Printshop]] in the 1960s and 1970s attracted a number of visual artists to the province to teach and create art. Similarly, the school in Hibbs Hole (now [[Hibb's Cove]]), established by painter [[George Noseworthy]], brought professional artists such as [[Anne Meredith Barry]] to the province.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s saw a significant increase in artists based on the island of Newfoundland. Painter [[Christopher Pratt]] returned to the province in 1961 with his wife [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]] to work at the newly established [[Memorial University Art Gallery]] as its first curator, later transitioning to painting full-time in Salmonier. Wesleyville's [[David Blackwood]] graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]] in the early 1960s and has achieved acclaim with his images of Newfoundland culture and history, though he no longer resides in the province. Newfoundland-born artist [[Gerald Squires]] returned in 1969.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt; Other notable artists who developed their practices during this period include [[Marlene Creates]], [[Diana Dabinett]], [[Kathleen Knowling]], [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Heidi Oberheide]], [[Manfred Buchheit]], [[Stewart Montgomerie]], [[Jean Claude Roy]] and [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]].&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/&gt;

In 1975, Peter Bell, who was an art critic in addition to being an artist and gallery administrator, wrote: "There has never been anything remotely resembling an art movement in Newfoundland. There have been successive societies and associations of persons interested in painting, but there has been no group with a coherent style or philosophy, nor has there been any developmental succession from one artist to another. Artists in Newfoundland have been, and still are, isolated phenomena. Distinguished, certainly, but independent and unique."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bell. "Painters of Newfoundland" in Canadian Antiques Collector, vol 10 no 2, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Art in Newfoundland ===

[[File:L'Anse aux Meadows, The Meeting of Two Worlds.jpg|thumb|Luben Boykov. "The Meeting of Two Worlds" at L'Anse aux Meadows|left]] 
From 1980 to present, opportunities for artists continued to develop, as art galleries such as the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] (which later became [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery), the [[Grenfell Art Gallery]], the [[Resource Centre for the Arts]], and [[Eastern Edge]] were established. Fine arts education programs were established at post-secondary institutions such as [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]], the Western Community College (now [[College of the North Atlantic]]) in [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]], and the [[Anna Templeton Centre]] in St. John's.&lt;ref&gt;Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial art galleries such as Bonnie Leyton Gallery of Fine Art, Christina Parker Gallery, Emma Butler Gallery and Red Ochre Gallery, support the work of Newfoundland and Labradorian artists.

In the 1990s, Bulgarian artists came to this province through [[Gander Airport]] as part of a decade-long influx of refugees from the Soviet Block. Notably, [[Luben Boykov]], [[Elena Popova]], [[Vessela Brakalova]] and [[Veselina Tomova]] arrived in 1990. Ellie Yonova would arrive in 1999. Since then, each artist has contributed to the local creative landscape through their personal practices, exhibit design, publications, and public sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubenboykov.com/about/index.html|title=about|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visavisgraphics.com/about.html|title=vis-à-vis graphics - about us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewalrus.ca/notes-from-newfoundland/|title=Notes from Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Federal Government announced an investment of more than $1.5 million to assist the City of St. John's to redevelop the Tucker Premises in historic [[Quidi Vidi]] village. The [[Quidi Vidi Plantation]] was opened in 2012 as a "Craft Incubator," with 10 purpose-built studio spaces for local, emerging artisans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/media-release/grand-opening-held-quidi-vidi-village-plantation|title=Grand Opening Held For Quidi Vidi Village Plantation - City Of St. John's|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sound Symposium]] was started in St John's, Nfld, in 1983. Symposia followed in 1984 and now take place every two years. The event brings together a range of local, national, and international artists working in sound, film, theatre, and dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundsymposium.com/about/|title=About - SOUND SYMPOSIUM - CELEBRATING NEW MUSIC AND PERFORMANCE ARTS SINCE 1983|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newfoundland and Labrador's arts community is now recognized nationally and internationally. [[Fogo Island Arts]], launched in 2008 on [[Fogo Island, Newfoundland|Fogo Island]], supports a residency-based contemporary art program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fogoislandarts.ca/about/fogo-island-arts/|title=About - Fogo Island Arts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2015, the province was represented at the [[Venice Biennale]] as Official Collateral Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/news/newfoundland-officially-accepted-venice-biennale/|title=Newfoundland Accepted by Venice Biennale - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Philippa Jones]] became the first Newfoundland and Labrador artist to be included in the [[National Gallery of Canada]] contemporary art biennial after it was reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/videos/shine-a-light-canadian-biennial-2014-philippa-jones|title=Shine a Light: Canadian Biennial 2014, Philippa Jones|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Newfoundland is a malleable idea, constantly being dreamt and reconfigured," wrote author [[Lisa Moore (writer)|Lisa Moore]] in 2016, "All cultures are in constant flux, of course. But Newfoundland, hyper-aware of being a distinct society, is at the same time riven with a kind of archival anxiety to hold fast to defining myths; the stories we tell to bring ourselves into existence. This anxiety might be a symptom caused by existing on the periphery, subject to constant swings in economic instability and geographical isolation in a sublime but rugged beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadianart.ca/reviews/what-is-the-new-newfoundland-dream/|title=What Is the New Newfoundland Dream? - Canadian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, a study recorded approximately 1,200 artists in Newfoundland and Labrador, representing 0.47% of the province's labour force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillstrategies.com/content/artists-and-cultural-workers-canada%E2%80%99s-provinces-and-territories|title=Artists and Cultural Workers in Canada's Provinces and Territories - Hill Strategies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery exhibits original visual art, conducts research, educates about art, and is responsible for permanent art collections held in trust for the public. The Rooms provides 10,000 square feet of gallery space for temporary exhibits, normally balanced between exhibitions produced by the gallery and those borrowed from elsewhere. Exhibitions are toured to satellite galleries throughout the province: [[Mary March Provincial Museum]] in [[Grand Falls-Windsor]], the [[Provincial Seamen's Museum]] in [[Grand Bank]];  and the [[Labrador Interpretation Centre]] in [[North West River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/exhibits/regional-museums|title=Regional Museums - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Rooms, St John's NL.JPG|thumb|The Rooms, St John's NL]] The gallery manages several collections, known together as the "Permanent Collections": Memorial University of Newfoundland; the J. K. Pratt Memorial Collection; The Rooms Collection; and the Art Procurement Collection of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador (Provincial Art Bank). Altogether, they comprise over 7,000 works of art, primarily post-1960 Canadian art. Emphasis is placed on art from Newfoundland and Labrador, with major holdings of such artists as [[Christopher Pratt]], [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]], [[Gerald Squires]], [[David Blackwood]], [[Reginald Shepherd (artist)|Reginald Shepherd]], [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]], [[Don Wright (artist)|Don Wright]], [[Anne Meredith Barry]], [[Marlene Creates]], [[Helen Gregory]], [[Pam Hall (artist)|Pam Hall]], [[Ned Pratt]], and many others.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/rooms-provincial-art-gallery.php|title=The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therooms.ca/about-us|title=About Us - The Rooms|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gallery began in the university library in 1961. Moving to the St. John's Arts and Culture Centre in 1968, the gallery took on a more active provincial role by organizing regular touring exhibitions to other arts and culture centres. Memorial's Art Gallery became the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1994, and then The Rooms Provincial Art Gallery in 2004. Over the years, its administrators have included [[Peter Bell (artist)|Peter Bell]], [[Frank Lapointe]], [[Edythe Goodridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/curator-edythe-goodridge-was-called-mother-of-newfoundland/article19482353/|title=Art curator Edythe Goodridge was called 'mother' of Newfoundland|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patricia Grattan]], [[Gordon Laurin]], [[Shauna McCabe]], [[Megan Williams (artist)|Megan Williams]], and [[Sheila Perry]]. [[Vicky Chainey Gagnon]] is the current Director and [[Chief Curator]]. [[Bruce Johnson (curator)|Bruce Johnson]] was [[Curator of Contemporary Art]] until 2013, and [[Caroline Stone]] the Curator of Historical Art and Collections until 2014. [[Mireille Eagan]] is the current Curator of Contemporary Art.&lt;ref name="heritage.nf.ca1"/&gt;

[[Filippo Baldinucci]]'s '''''Notizie de' Professori del Disegno, Da Cimabue in qua, Secolo V. dal 1610. al 1670. Distinto in Decennali''''' (or ''Notice of the Professors of Design, from Cimabue to now, from 1610–1670'') was a major art biography of Baroque painters. Written by the erudite [[Florence|Florentine]] professor of the ''[[Accademia della Crusca]]'', it is often verbose and rife with factual errors; however, it is a broad compendium of stories about generally contemporaneous [[Baroque]] painters.

Dozens of Flemish and Dutch painters, including [[Rembrandt]], were judged to merit inclusion. Though Baldinucci may have met some of these Northern painters on their travels to Italy, the majority of the Dutch and Flemish names he included had biographical notes under portraits engraved by [[Jan Meyssens]], whose work was popular, and whose engravings were reused by [[Cornelis de Bie]] for his 1682 book 
''[[Het Gulden Cabinet]]''. Baldinucci included both De Bie (in his father "Adriano de Bie"'s entry) and Meyssens in his book. The posthumous edition (1681) includes (in order of appearance in the text) and expanding list of artists:

{{automobile engineering}}
'''Automotive engineering''', along with [[aerospace engineering]] and [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]], is a branch of [[vehicle engineering]], incorporating elements of [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Software engineering|software]] and [[safety engineering]] as applied to the design, manufacture and operation of [[motorcycles]], [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s and their respective engineering subsystems. It also includes modification of vehicles. Manufacturing domain deals with the creation and assembling the whole parts of automobiles is also included in it.The automotive engineering field is research -intensive and involves direct application of mathematical models and formulas. The study of automotive engineering is to design, develop, fabricate, and testing vehicles or vehicle components from the concept stage to production stage. Production, development, and manufacturing are the three major functions in this field.

==Disciplines==

===Automobile  Engineering===
Automobile Engineering is a branch study of engineering which teaches manufacturing, designing, mechanical mechanisms as well operations of automobiles.
It is an introduction to vehicle engineering which deals with motorcycles, cars, buses, trucks, etc. It includes branch study of mechanical, electronic, software and safety elements.
Some of the engineering attributes and disciplines that are of importance to the automotive engineer and many of the other aspects are included in it:

'''Safety engineering''': [[Safety engineering]] is the assessment of [[Car accident|various crash scenarios]] and their impact on the vehicle occupants.  These are tested against very stringent governmental regulations.  Some of these requirements include: [[seat belt]] and [[air bag]] functionality testing, front and side impact testing, and tests of rollover resistance. Assessments are done with various methods and tools, including [[Computer-aided engineering|Computer]] [[crash simulation]] (typically [[finite element analysis]]), [[crash test dummy]], and partial system sled and full vehicle crashes.
[[Image:FAE visualization.jpg|thumb|250px|Visualization of how a car deforms in an asymmetrical crash using finite element analysis.[http://impact.sourceforge.net]]]
'''Fuel economy/emissions''': [[fuel efficiency|Fuel economy]] is the measured fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon or kilometers per liter. [[Automobile emissions control|Emissions]] testing includes the measurement of vehicle emissions, including hydrocarbons, [[nitrogen oxide]]s (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and evaporative emissions.

'''NVH engineering ([[noise, vibration, and harshness]])''': NVH is the customer's feedback (both tactile [felt] and audible [heard]) from the vehicle.  While sound can be interpreted as a rattle, squeal, or hot, a tactile response can be seat vibration or a buzz in the [[steering wheel]]. This feedback is generated by components either rubbing, vibrating, or rotating. NVH response can be classified in various ways: powertrain NVH, road noise, wind noise, component noise, and squeak and rattle. Note, there are both good and bad NVH qualities. The NVH engineer works to either eliminate bad NVH or change the “bad NVH” to good (i.e., exhaust tones).

'''Vehicle Electronics''': [[Automotive electronics]] is an increasingly important aspect of automotive engineering. Modern vehicles employ dozens of electronic systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvel.clemson.edu/auto/systems/auto-systems.html Automotive Electronic Systems] Clemson Vehicular Electronics Laboratory Website, Retrieved 2/2/2013&lt;/ref&gt; These systems are responsible for operational controls such as the throttle, brake and steering controls; as well as many comfort and convenience systems such as the [[HVAC]], [[infotainment]], and lighting systems. It would not be possible for automobiles to meet modern safety and fuel economy requirements without electronic controls.

'''Performance''': Performance is a measurable and testable value of a vehicle's ability to perform in various conditions. Performance can be considered in a wide variety of tasks, but it's generally associated with how quickly a car can accelerate (e.g. standing start 1/4 mile elapsed time, 0–60&amp;nbsp;mph, etc.), its top speed, how short and quickly a car can come to a complete stop from a set speed (e.g. 70-0&amp;nbsp;mph), how much [[g-force]] a car can generate without losing grip, recorded lap times, cornering speed, brake fade, etc. Performance can also reflect the amount of control in inclement weather (snow, ice, rain).

'''Shift quality''': Shift quality is the driver's perception of the vehicle to an [[automatic transmission]] shift event. This is influenced by the powertrain ([[Internal combustion engine|engine]], [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]), and the vehicle (driveline, [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], engine and powertrain mounts, etc.) Shift feel is both a tactile (felt) and audible (heard) response of the vehicle. Shift quality is experienced as various events: Transmission shifts are felt as an upshift at acceleration (1–2), or a downshift maneuver in passing (4–2). Shift engagements of the vehicle are also evaluated, as in Park to Reverse, etc.

'''Durability / [[corrosion engineering]]''': Durability and [[corrosion]] engineering is the evaluation testing of a vehicle for its useful life. Tests include mileage accumulation, severe driving conditions, and corrosive salt baths.

'''Drivability''': Drivability is the vehicle's response to general driving conditions. Cold starts and stalls, RPM dips, idle response, launch hesitations and stumbles, and performance levels.

'''Cost''': The cost of a vehicle program is typically split into the effect on the [[variable cost]] of the vehicle, and the up-front tooling and [[fixed cost]]s associated with developing the vehicle. There are also costs associated with warranty reductions and marketing.

'''Program timing''': To some extent programs are timed with respect to the market, and also to the production schedules of the assembly plants. Any new part in the design must support the development and manufacturing schedule of the model.

'''Assembly feasibility''': It is easy to design a module that is hard to assemble, either resulting in damaged units or poor tolerances. The skilled [[New product development|product development]] engineer works with the assembly/manufacturing engineers so that the resulting design is easy and cheap to make and assemble, as well as delivering appropriate functionality and appearance.

'''Quality management''': Quality control is an important factor within the production process, as high quality is needed to meet customer requirements and to avoid expensive [[Product recall#Automotive Industry|recall campaigns]]. The complexity of components involved in the production process requires a combination of different tools and techniques for quality control. Therefore, the [[International Automotive Task Force]] (IATF), a group of the world's leading manufacturers and trade organizations, developed the standard [[ISO/TS 16949]]. This standard defines the design, development, production, and when relevant, installation and service requirements. Furthermore, it combines the principles of ISO 9001 with aspects of various regional and national automotive standards such as AVSQ (Italy), EAQF (France), VDA6 (Germany) and QS-9000 (USA). In order to further minimize risks related to product failures and liability claims of automotive electric and electronic systems, the quality discipline [[functional safety]] according to ISO/IEC 17025 is applied.

Since the 1950s, the comprehensive business approach [[total quality management]], TQM, helps to continuously improve the production process of automotive products and components. Some of the companies who have implemented TQM include [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Motorola]] and [[Toyota Motor Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj12%289%29/34.pdf A Study on Total Quality Management and Lean Manufacturing: Through Lean Thinking Approach] World Applied Sciences Journal 12 (9): 1585–1596, 2011, Retrieved 11/16/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job Functions==

===Development Engineer===
A development engineer has the responsibility for coordinating delivery of the engineering attributes of a complete [[automobile]] ([[bus]], [[car]], [[truck]], van, SUV, motorcycle etc.) as dictated by the [[List of automobile manufacturers|automobile manufacturer]], [[governmental]] [[regulation]]s, and the customer who buys the product.

Much like the [[Systems engineering|Systems Engineer]], the development engineer is concerned with the interactions of all systems in the complete automobile.  While there are multiple [[auto part|components]] and [[system]]s in an automobile that have to function as designed, they must also work in harmony with the complete automobile.  As an example, the [[brake]] system's main function is to provide braking functionality to the automobile.  Along with this, it must also provide an acceptable level of:  pedal feel (spongy, stiff), brake system “noise” (squeal, shudder, etc.), and interaction with the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] (anti-lock braking system)

Another aspect of the development engineer's job is a [[trade-off]] process required to deliver all of the automobile attributes at a certain acceptable level.  An example of this is the trade-off between [[Engine tuning|engine performance]] and [[Fuel efficiency|fuel economy]].  While some customers are looking for maximum power from their [[Internal combustion engine|engine]], the automobile is still required to deliver an acceptable level of fuel economy.  From the engine's perspective, these are opposing requirements.  Engine performance is looking for maximum [[Engine displacement|displacement]] (bigger, more power), while fuel economy is looking for a smaller displacement engine (ex:  1.4 L vs. 5.4 L).  The engine size however, is not the only contributing factor to fuel economy and automobile performance. Different values come into play.

Other attributes that involve trade-offs include:  automobile weight, [[Drag coefficient|aerodynamic drag]], [[Automatic transmission|transmission gearing]], [[Automobile emissions control|emission control]] devices, [[Automobile handling|handling/roadholding]], [[ride quality]], and [[tire]]s.

The development engineer is also responsible for organizing automobile level testing, validation, and certification.  Components and systems are designed and tested individually by the Product Engineer.  The final evaluation is to be conducted at the automobile level to evaluate system to system interactions.  As an example, the audio system (radio) needs to be evaluated at the automobile level.  Interaction with other [[electronic component]]s can cause [[Radio frequency interference|interference]].  Heat dissipation of the system and [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] placement of the controls need to be evaluated. [[Sound]] quality in all seating positions needs to be provided at acceptable levels.

===Manufacturing Engineer===
[[Manufacturing engineering|Manufacturing Engineers]] are 
responsible for ensuring proper production of the automotive components or complete vehicles. While the development engineers are responsible for the function of the vehicle, manufacturing engineers are responsible for the safe and effective production of the vehicle. This group of engineers consist of [[List of manufacturing processes|Process Engineers]], [[Logistics|Logisti
 Coordinators]], [[Machine Tools|Tooling Engineers]], Robotics Engineers, and Assembly Planners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.automotiveengineeringhq.com/automotive-manufacturing-engineering/ Automotive Manufacturing Engineering Overview] Published July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[automotive industry]] manufacturers are playing a larger role in the development stages of automotive components to ensure that the products are easy to manufacture. [[Design for Manufacturability]] in the automotive world is crucial to make certain whichever design is developed in the [[Research and Development]] Stage of [[automotive design]]. Once the design is established, the manufacturing engineers take over. They design the machinery and tooling necessary to build the automotive components or vehicle and establish the methods of how to [[Mass Production|mass-produce]] the product. It is the manufacturing engineers job to increase the [[efficiency]] of the [[List of automotive assembly plants in the United States|automotive plant]] and to implement [[lean manufacturing]] techniques such as [[Six Sigma]] and [[Kaizen]]. &lt;!-- Will come back and add a quality engineering section to this as quality engineers play a huge role in automotive --&gt;

===Other automotive engineering roles===
Other automotive engineers include those listed below:
* Aerodynamics engineers will often give guidance to the styling studio so that the shapes they design are aerodynamic, as well as attractive.
* Body engineers will also let the studio know if it is feasible to make the panels for their designs.
* Change control engineers make sure that all of the design and manufacturing changes that occur are organized, managed and implemented...
* [[Noise, vibration and harshness|NVH]] engineers perform sound and vibration testing to prevent loud cabin noises, detectable vibrations, and/or improve the sound quality while the vehicle is on the road.
&lt;!-- probably room for other engineers here. Add some/flesh this section out, and then remove this comment. --&gt;

==The modern automotive product engineering process==
Studies indicate that a substantial part of the modern vehicle's value comes from intelligent systems, and that these represent most of the current automotive innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Auweraer|first1=Herman|last2=Anthonis|first2=Jan|last3=De Bruyne|first3=Stijn|last4=Leuridan|first4=Jan|title=Virtual engineering at work: the challenges for designing mechatronic products|journal=Engineering with computers|date=July 2013|volume=29|issue=3|pages=389–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valsan|first1=A|title=Trends, technology roadmaps and strategic market analysis of vehicle safety systems in europe.|journal=International automotive electronics congress|date=October 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this, the modern automotive engineering process has to handle an increased use of [[mechatronics]]. Configuration and performance optimization, system integration, control, component, subsystem and system-level validation of the intelligent systems must become an intrinsic part of the standard vehicle engineering process, just as this is the case for the structural, vibro-acoustic and kinematic design. This requires a vehicle development process that is typically highly simulation-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costlow|first1=T|title=Managing software growth|journal=Automotive Engineering International|date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The V-approach===
One way to effectively deal with the inherent multi-physics and the [[control system]]s development that is involved when including intelligent systems, is to adopt the [[V-Model]] approach to systems development, as has been widely used in the automotive industry for twenty years or more.  In this V-approach, system-level requirements are propagated down the V via subsystems to component design, and the system performance is validated at increasing integration levels. Engineering of mechatronic systems requires the application of two interconnected “V-cycles”: one focusing on the multi-physics system engineering (like the mechanical and electrical components of an electrically powered steering system, including sensors and actuators); and the other focuses on the controls engineering, the control logic, the software and realization of the control hardware and embedded software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabrera|first1=A.|last2=Foeken|first2=M.J.|last3=Tekin|first3=O.A.|last4=Woestenenk|first4=K.|last5=Erden|first5=M.S.|last6=De Schutter|first6=B.|last7=Van Tooren|first7=M.J.L.|last8=Babuska|first8=R.|last9=van Houten|first9=F.J.|last10=Tomiyama|first10=T.|title=Towards automation of control software: a review of challenges in mechatronic design|journal=Mechatronics|date=2010|volume=20|issue=8|pages=876–886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cabrera|first1=A.|last2=Woestenenk|first2=K.|title=An architectural model to support cooperative design for mechatronic products: a control design case|journal=Mechatronics|volume=21|issue=3|pages=534–547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictive engineering analytics===
An alternative approach is called [[predictive engineering analytics]], and takes the V-approach to the next level. It lets design continue after product delivery. That is important for development of built-in predictive functionality and for creating vehicles that can be optimized while being in use, even based on real use data. This approach is based on the creation of a [[Digital Twins|Digital Twin]], a replica of the real product that remains in-sync. Manufacturers try to achieve this by implementing a set of development tactics and tools. Critical is a strong alignment of 1D systems simulation, [[Computer-aided engineering|3D CAE]] and physical testing to reach more realism in the simulation process. This is combined with intelligent reporting and data analytics for better insight in the vehicle use. By supporting this with a strong data management structure that spans the entire [[product lifecycle]], they bridge the gap between design, manufacturing and product use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/en_us/plm/predictive-engineering-analytics.shtml |title=Predictive Engineering Analytics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Salsola sativa Ypey96.jpg|thumb|right|''Halogeton sativus'' is one of the plants from which '''barilla''' was made. The species was formerly classified as ''Salsola sativa''. Engraving published 1813 (Adolphus Ypey).]]
'''''Barilla''''' refers to several species of salt-tolerant ([[halophyte]]) plants that, until the 19th Century, were the primary source of [[soda ash]] and hence of [[sodium carbonate]]. The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to the soda ash obtained from plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;
Definitions of "barilla" in ''The Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition'' (Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1989). Definitions retrieved from the [http://www.oed.com online edition] on December 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The word is an anglicization of the Spanish word [[:es:barrilla|''barrilla'']] for [[saltwort]] plants (a particular category of halophytes).

A very early reference indicating the value placed upon soda ash in [[Catalonia]] has been given by Glick, who notes that "In 1189 the [[Poblet Monastery|monastery of Poblet]] granted to the glassblower Guillem the right to gather [[glasswort]] in return for tithe and two hundred pounds of sheet glass paid annually (The site of these glassworks, at Narola, was excavated in 1935.)."&lt;ref&gt;Glick, Thomas F. (1979). [https://www.webcitation.org/5W0JzxVnN?url=http://libro.uca.edu/ics/ics7.htm ''Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages: Comparative Perspectives on Social and Cultural Formation''] (Princeton University Press, Princeton), ch. 7. Archived at WebCite from [https://archive.is/20120710141038/http://libro.uca.edu/ics/emspain.htm this original URL] on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th Century, Spain's barilla industry was exporting large quantities of soda ash of exceptional purity; the product was refined from the ashes of barilla plants that were specifically cultivated for this purpose. Presumably the word "barilla" entered English and other languages as a consequence of this export trade. The main Spanish barilla species included (i) ''[[Salsola soda]]'' (the common English term '''barilla plant''' for ''Salsola soda'' reflects this usage), (ii) ''[[Salsola kali]]'', and (iii) ''[[Halogeton]] sativus'' (formerly ''Salsola sativa'').&lt;ref&gt;

''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira described the main species used to make barilla in different places. Thus "[[Canary Islands|Canary]] barilla is procured from ''Salsola Kali''," "[[Alicante (province)|Alicant]] barilla is obtained from ''Salsola sativa'', ''Chenopodium setigerum'', and other species," and "Of the French barillas, two only deserve notice; namely, that of [[Narbonne]], obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and which yields 14-15%, ..." Online version at [https://books.google.com/books?id=KyIb0tE9COAC books.google.com].&lt;/ref&gt; Fairly recently, Pérez&lt;ref name="Perez"/&gt; has concluded that the most prominent species was likely ''Halogeton sativus''; earlier authors have tended to favor ''Salsola soda''.

The word "barilla" was also used directly to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the [[saltwort]]s grown in Spain, but also [[glasswort]]s, [[mangrove]]s, and [[kelp|seaweed]].&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Juliet F. (1978). "The Nineteenth-Century Soap Industry and its Exploitation of Intertidal Vegetation in Eastern Australia ," ''The [[Australian Geographer]], Vol. 14'', pp. 38&amp;ndash;41.&lt;/ref&gt; These types of plant-derived soda ash are impure [[alkali]] substances that contain widely varying amounts of [[sodium carbonate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), some additional [[potassium carbonate]] (also an alkali), and a predominance of non-alkali impurities.&lt;ref name="Clow52"&gt;
Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is "[[wikt:lixiviate|lixiviated]]" (extracted with water) from the ashes of the burned, dried plants. The resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished barilla. A very similar process is used to obtain [[potash]] (mainly [[potassium carbonate]]) from the ashes of hardwood trees. The best Spanish barilla—prepared by master ''barrilleros''—contained about 30% Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In 1877 Kingzett described the importance of the barilla trade to Spain as follows: "So highly was the product valued, and the importance of the trade regarded, that by the laws of Spain the exportation of the seed was an offence punishable by death."&lt;ref&gt;Kingzett, Charles Thomas (1877). ''The History, Products, and Processes of the Alkali Trade, Including the Most Recent Improvements'' (Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., London), p. 69. [https://books.google.com/books?id=haUJAAAAIAAJ Online version] retrieved July 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors indicate that "barilla" was a specific plant used for soda ash production; this usage is erroneous, but presumably corresponds to the common usage of "barilla plant" exclusively for ''Salsola soda''. Perhaps this common usage itself reflects an old error in assuming that a single plant species was used by the Spaniards for their industry. In still earlier times, the sources of soda ash and the methods of processing it were secrets that were zealously guarded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3862">'''Business informatics''' ('''BI''') or '''organizational informatics''' is a discipline combining [[information technology]] (IT), [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and [[management]] concepts. The BI discipline was created in [[Germany]], from the concept of [[Wirtschaftsinformatik]]. It is an established [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] including [[bachelor]], [[Master's degree|master]], [[IB Diploma Programme|diploma]] and [[PhD]] programs in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]] and is establishing in an increasing number of other countries as well as [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Poland]] or [[Mexico]]. BI integrates core elements from the disciplines of [[business administration]], [[information system]]s and [[computer science]] into one field.

==Business informatics as an integrative discipline==
BI shows similarities to [[information systems]] (IS), which is a well established discipline originating from [[North America]]. However, there are a few differences that make business informatics a unique own discipline:
# Business informatics includes [[information technology]], like the relevant portions of applied [[computer science]], to a larger extent than information systems does.
# Business informatics includes significant construction and implementation oriented elements. I.e. one major focus lies in the development of solutions for business problems rather than the [[ex post]] investigation of their impact.

[[Information systems]] (IS) focuses on empirically explaining phenomena of the real world. IS has been said to have an "explanation-oriented" focus in contrast to the "solution-oriented" focus that dominates BI. IS researchers make an effort to explain phenomena of acceptance and influence of IT in organizations and the society applying an empirical approach. In order to do that usually [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and quantitative empirical studies are conducted and evaluated. In contrast to that, BI researchers mainly focus on the creation of IT solutions for challenges they have observed or assumed.

Tight integration between research and teaching following the [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] ideal is another goal in business informatics. Insights gained in actual research projects become part of the curricula quite fast because most researchers are also lecturers at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg-u.de |title=Virtual Global University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303102656/http://www.vg-u.de/ |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of scientific and technological progress in BI is quite rapid, therefore subjects taught are under permanent reconsideration and revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ives, B., J. Valacich, R. Watson, R. Zmud and|title=What Every Business Student Needs to Know About Information Systems|journal=Communications of the Association for Information Systems|volume=9|date=December 2002|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol9/iss1/30/|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its evolution, the BI discipline is fairly young. Therefore, significant hurdles have to be overcome in order to further establish its vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lyytinen, K., R. Baskerville, J. Livari, D. Te'eni|title=Why the old world cannot publish? Overcoming challenges in publishing high-impact IS research|journal=European Journal of Information Systems|volume=16|year=2007|pages=317–326|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''C5a''' is a protein fragment released from cleavage of [[Complement component 5|complement component C5]] by protease [[C5-convertase]] into C5a and C5b fragments. C5b is important in late events of the complement cascade, an orderly series of reactions which coordinates several basic defense mechanisms, including formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), one of the most basic weapons of the innate immune system, formed as an automatic response to intrusions from foreign particles and microbial invaders. It essentially pokes microscopic pinholes in these foreign objects, causing loss of water and sometimes death. C5a, the other cleavage product of C5, acts as a highly inflammatory peptide, encouraging complement activation, formation of the MAC, attraction of innate immune cells, and histamine release involved in allergic responses. The origin of C5 is in the hepatocyte, but its synthesis can also be found in macrophages, where it may cause local increase of C5a. C5a is a chemotactic agent and an anaphylatoxin; it is essential in the innate immunity but it is also linked with the adaptive immunity. The increased production of C5a is connected with a number of inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid19464229"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manthey HD, Woodruff TM, Taylor SM, Monk PN | title=Complement component 5a (C5a) | journal=Int J Biochem Cell Biol | year= 2009 | volume= 41 | issue= 11 | pages= 2114–7 | doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.005 | pmc= | pmid=19464229  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Human polypeptide C5a contains 74 amino acids and has 11kDa. NMR spectroscopy proved that the molecule is composed of four helices and connected by peptide loops with three disulphide bonds between helix IV and II, III.  There is a short 1.5 turn helix on N terminus but all agonist activity take place in the C terminus. C5a is rapidly metabolised by a serum enzyme [[carboxypeptidase B]] to a 72 amino acid form C5a des-Arg without C terminal arginine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andreas Klos |author2=Elisabeth Wende |author3=Kathryn J.

==Functions==
C5a is an [[anaphylatoxin]], causing increased expression of adhesion molecules on endothelium, contraction of smooth muscle, and increased vascular permeability. C5a des-Arg is a much less potent anaphylatoxin. Both C5a and C5a des-Arg can trigger [[mast cell]] degranulation, releasing proinflammatory molecules [[histamine]] and [[TNF-α]]. C5a is also an effective [[Chemotaxis#Chemotactic ligands|chemoattractant]], initiating accumulation of complement and phagocytic cells at sites of infection or recruitment of antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes.
C5a plays a key role in increasing migration and adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to vessel walls. White blood cells are activated by upregulation of [[integrin]] [[avidity]], the [[Prostaglandin#Biosynthesis|lipoxygenase pathway]] and [[arachidonic acid]] metabolism.
C5a also modulates the balance between activating versus inhibitory [[IgG]] [[Fc receptor]]s on leukocytes, thereby enhancing the [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] response.&lt;ref name="pmid19464229"/&gt;

==Binding process==
C5a interact with [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein C5aR ([[CD88]]) on the surface of target cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial cells. C5aR is a member of the [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] superfamily of proteins, predicted to have seven transmembrane helical domains of largely hydrophobic [[amino acid]] residues, forming three intra- and three extra-cellular loops, with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus.

C5a binding to the receptor is a two-stage process: an interaction between basic residues in the helical core of C5a and acidic residues in the extracellular N-terminal domain allows the C-terminus of C5a to bind to residues in the receptor transmembrane domains. The latter interaction leads to receptor activation, and the transduction of the ligand binding signal across the cell [[plasma membrane]] to the cytoplasmic G protein [[Gi alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]] type [[GNAI2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/prow/guide/666919736_g.htm PROW and IWHLDA present the GUIDE on: CD88] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724181852/http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/prow/guide/666919736_g.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensitivity of C5aR to C5a stimulation is enhanced by Lipopolysaccharides exposure, yet this is not due to C5aR upregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raby AC, Holst B, Davies J, Colmont C, Laumonnier Y, Coles B, Shah S, Hall J, Topley N, Khol J, Morgan BP, Labeta MO | title= TLR activation enhances C5a-induced pro-inflammatory responses by negatively modulating the second C5a receptor, C5L2| journal= European Journal of Immunology | year= 2011| volume= 41| pages=2741–2752 | doi= 10.1002/eji.201041350 | pmid= 21630250 | issue= 9 | pmc= 3638321}}&lt;/ref&gt; C5L2 is another C5a receptor that is thought to regulate the C5a-C5aR effects. There is apparently contradictory evidence showing decoy receptor activity conferring anti-inflammatory properties and also signalling activity conferring pro-inflammatory properties.&lt;ref name="pmid= 23383423"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Klos A, Wende E, Wareham KJ, Monk PN |title=International Union of Pharmacology. LXXXVII. Complement peptide C5a, C4a, and C3a receptors |journal=Pharmacol.

==Diseases==
C5a is a powerful inflammatory mediator, and seems to be a key factor in the development of pathology of many inflammatory diseases involving the complement system such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythemotosis, psoriasis. The inhibitor of C5a that can block its effects would be helpful in medical applications. 
Another candidate is PMX53 or PMX205 that is highly specific for CD88 and effectively reduces inflammatory response.&lt;ref name="pmid16816116"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Woodruff TM, Crane JW, Proctor LM, Buller KM, Shek AB, de Vos K | title=Therapeutic activity of C5a receptor antagonists in a rat model of neurodegeneration | journal=FASEB J | year= 2006 | volume= 20 | issue= 9 | pages= 1407–17 | doi=10.1096/fj.05-5814com | pmc= | pmid=16816116  |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22924972"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jain U, Woodruff TM, Stadnyk AW | title=The C5a receptor antagonist PMX205 ameliorates experimentally induced colitis associated with increased IL-4 and IL-10 | journal=Br J Pharmacol | year= 2013 | volume= 168 | issue= 2 | pages= 488–501 | pmid=22924972 | doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2012.02183.x | pmc=3572573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; C5a has been identified as a key mediator of [[neutrophil]] dysfunction in [[sepsis]], with antibody blockade of C5a improving outcomes in experimental models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huber-Lang|first=Markus S.|last2=Younkin|first2=Ellen M.|last3=Sarma|first3=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5461">'''Continuous configuration automation''' ('''CCA''') is the methodology or process of automating the deployment and configuration of settings and software for both physical and virtual [[data center]] equipment.&lt;ref name="CCA" &gt;{{cite report 
  |last= Fletcher | first= Colin | last2= Cosgrove | first2=Terrence

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Continuous configuration automation is marketed for [[data center]] and application [[configuration management]]. CCA tools use a programmable framework for configuration and orchestration through coding, planning, and incrementally adopting policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://info.easydynamics.com/blog/continuous-integration-infrastructure-as-code |title= Continuous Integration: Infrastructure as Code in DevOps | last= Ramos | first= Martin | website= easydynamics.com | date= 4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Infrastructure As Code: Fueling the Fire for Faster Application Delivery |publisher=Forrester |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to DevOps==
CCA tools are used for what is called [[DevOps]], and are often included as part of a [[DevOps toolchain]]. CCA grew out of a push to develop more reliable software faster.&lt;ref name="CCA" /&gt; Gartner describes CCA as “Embodying [[Lean software development|lean]], [[agile software development | agile]] and collaborative concepts core to DevOps initiatives, CCA tools bring a newly found level of precision, efficiency and flexibility to the challenges of infrastructure and application configuration management.”

  | title= Moving from Infrastructure Automation to True DevOps
  | last= Phillips |first=Andrew
  | website= DevOps.com
  | date= 14 May 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
CCA tools support administrators and developers to automate the configuration and Orchestration of physical and virtual infrastructure in a systematic way that give visibility to state of infrastructure within an enterprise. Generally thought of as an extension of [[infrastructure as code]] (IaC) frameworks.&lt;ref name="CCA" /&gt;  CCA tools include [[Ansible (software)|Ansible]], [[Chef software]], [[Otter (software)|Otter]], [[Puppet (software)]], [[Rudder (software)]] and [[SaltStack]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

  | last= Venezia | first=Paul | date= 21 November 2013| website= networkworld.com | publisher= Network World | access-date=14 December 2015 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each tool has a different method of interacting with the system some are agent-based, push or pull, through an interactive UI. Similar to adopting any DevOps tools, there are barriers to bring on CCA tools and factors that hinder and accelerate adoption.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite report

'''Downhill creep''', also known as '''soil creep''' or commonly just '''creep''', is the slow [[Mass wasting|downward progression]] of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[soil]] down a low [[Grade (slope)|grade]] slope; it can also refer to slow deformation of such materials as a result of prolonged pressure and stress. Creep may appear to an observer to be continuous, but it really is the sum of numerous minute, discrete movements of slope material caused by the force of [[gravity]]. Friction, being the primary force to resist gravity, is produced when one body of material slides past another offering a mechanical resistance between the two which acts to hold objects (or slopes) in place. As slope on a hill increases, the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the slope decreases and results in less friction between the material that could cause the slope to slide.

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date = August 2013}}
The rate of soil creep down a slope depends on the steepness (gradient) of the slope, water absorption and content, type of sediment and material, and lastly vegetation. The rate of creep will take into account all of these factors to decide whether or not the hillside will progress downward. Creep is what is responsible for the rounded shape of hillsides.
[[File:Victorian_headstones,_England.JPG|right|thumb|A group of Victorian [[headstone]]s, [[England]]. Soil creep has led to the headstones being tilted at an angle over time.]]
Water is a very important factor when discussing soil deformation and movement. For instance, a sandcastle will only stand up when it is made with damp sand. The water offers cohesion to the sand which binds the sand particles together. However, pouring water over the sandcastle destroys it. This is because the presence of too much water fills the pores between the grains with water creating a slip plane between the particles and offering no cohesion causing them to slip and slide away. This holds true for hillsides and creep as well. The presence of water may help the hillside stay put and give it cohesion, but in a very wet environment or during or after a large amount of precipitation the pores between the grains can become saturated with water and cause the ground to slide along the slip plane it creates.

[[Image:Hillside moving over a sidewalk.jpg|thumb|Creep has caused the soil to spread over this pavement.]]
Creep can also be caused by the expansion of materials such as [[clay]] when they are exposed to water. Clay expands when wet, then contracts after drying. The expansion portion pushes downhill, then the contraction results in consolidation at the new offset.

Objects resting on top of the soil are carried by it as it descends down the slope. This can be seen in churchyards, where older [[headstones]] are often situated at an angle and several metres away from where they were originally erected.

Vegetation plays a role with slope stability and creep. When a hillside contains many trees, ferns, and shrubs their roots create an interlocking network that can strengthen unconsolidated material. They also aid in absorbing the excess water in the soil to help keep the slope stable. However, they do add to the weight of the slope giving gravity that much more of a driving force to act on in pushing the slope downward. In general, though, slopes without vegetation have a greater chance of movement.

Design engineers sometimes need to guard against downhill creep during their planning to prevent building [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] from being undermined. Pilings are planted sufficiently deep into the surface material to guard against this behavior.

==Modeling regolith diffusion==
For shallow to moderate slopes, diffusional sediment flux is modeled linearly as (Culling, 1960; McKean et al., 1993)

&lt;math&gt;q_s = k_d S \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_d\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion constant, and &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is slope.  For steep slopes, diffusional sediment flux is more appropriately modeled as a non-linear function of slope&lt;ref name="Roering1999" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_s = \frac{k_d S}{1 - (S/S_c)^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the critical gradient for sliding of dry soil.

On long timescales, diffusive creep in hillslope soils leads to a characteristic rounding of ridges in the landscape.&lt;ref name="Roering1999"&gt;Roering, Joshua J., James W. Kirchner, and William E. Dietrich. "Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology."

[[File:Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cartoon, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!"]]

'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' (or '''Draw Mohammed Day''') was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing [[Depictions of Muhammad|representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]]. It stemmed from a protest against [[censorship]] of the American television show ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", led by the show's distributor [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing [[Mohammed]] was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.

U.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |title =Q&amp;A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |publisher =BBC News |date =February 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.&lt;ref name="Theo van Gogh murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life of slain Dutch film-maker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamist terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others "taking up the cause".&lt;ref name="erases"/&gt; Facebook had an "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named "Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20).&lt;ref name=figure/&gt; Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.

In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom.

===Background===
''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =James | first = Frank |author2=Mark Memmott | title = Facebook Blocked By Pakistani Court For 'Draw Muhammad' Day | work =[[National Public Radio]]: The two-way | publisher = www.npr.org | date = May 19, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/facebook_blocked_by_pakistani.html | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''South Park'' episode sparked statements from the extremist website [[Revolution Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bates | first = Theunis | title = Pakistan Bans Facebook Over Muhammad Cartoons | work = AOL News | language =  | publisher = www.aolnews.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | accessdate = May 19, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100520033044/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | archivedate = May 20, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Rodriguez | first =Alex | title = Facebook dark in Pakistan amid uproar over Muhammad caricatures|work=Los Angeles Times | publisher = www.latimes.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-facebook-20100520,0,4071401.story | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where ''South Park'' is made.&lt;ref name=jgscl&gt;{{Cite news| last = Griswold | first =Jamie ([[Associated Press]]) | title =Seattle cartoonist launches 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' | work =MyNorthwest.com | publisher = Bonneville International | date = April 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313170# | accessdate =May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy Central]] [[self-censored]] the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word "Muhammad" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the ''South Park'' episode.&lt;ref name=jgscl/&gt;

===Molly Norris cartoon===
Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate [[transliteration]] of "Mohammed" on her poster.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat&gt;Orr, Jimmy, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/creators-of-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-abandon-effort-after-it-becomes-controversial.html "Creators of 'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' drop gag after everybody gets angry"], April 26, 2010, "Top of the Ticket" blog, ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the top of the illustration she wrote: {{quote|text=In light of the recent veiled (ha!) threats aimed at the creators of the television show South Park ... by bloggers on Revolution Muslim's website, we hereby deem May 20, 2010 as the first 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

In late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: "This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!" She also wrote, "I, the cartoonist, NEVER launched a draw Mohammed day. It is, in this FICTIONAL poster sponsored by this FICTIONAL GROUP", referring to the "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor" wording in the cartoon. "SATIRE about a CURRENT EVENT, people!!! (That's what {{sic|cartoonist|'s}} do!)"&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Mollie, Web page titled [http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html "Lighten up!

===Early publicity===
Norris circulated the cartoon to bloggers based in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="gosalvez"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gosalvez | first = Patricia | title =La 'bloguera', el profeta y Facebook – El temor obliga a una dibujante a retirar una campaña para pintar a Mahoma | work =[[El País]] |language=Spanish| publisher =www.elpais.com | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/bloguera/profeta/Facebook/elpepirtv/20100504elpepirtv_4/Tes| accessdate =May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She sent a copy of her illustration to [[Dan Savage]], who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of [[KIRO-FM|KIRO]], a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question "Are you sure you want to do this?", and said "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Perkins| first = Mary | title = Seattle Cartoonist’s "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Goes Viral | work =[[Seattlest]] | location = [[Seattle, Washington]] | publisher =[[Gothamist]] | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://seattlest.com/2010/04/27/seattle_cartoonists_everybody_draw.php | accessdate = May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the ''South Park'' creators, but also to support the right to [[free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Pries | first =Steve | title ='Everyone draw Mohammed day' challenges South Park censorship | work =The Depaulia | publisher =media.www.depauliaonline.com, [[DePaul University]] | date =May 17, 2010 | url =http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | accessdate =May 17, 2010 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100521235514/http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | archivedate =May 21, 2010 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "it's a cartoonist's job to be [[Political correctness|non-PC]]."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;[http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=/kiro/2010/04/04232010140224.mp3 Dave Ross Interviews Molly Norris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428224744/http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=%2Fkiro%2F2010%2F04%2F04232010140224.mp3 |date=April 28, 2010 }}, MyNorthwest.com, April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=mnwco&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Cartoonist overwhelmed by response to "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?sid=313601&amp;nid=11 | work = MyNorthwest.com | accessdate = May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Facebook page was created by Jon Wellington. By the morning of April 26, the page had almost 6,000 confirmed guests.

===Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement===
On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: "I did not intend for my cartoon to go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!"&lt;ref name=mnwco/&gt;&lt;ref name="howardfriedman" /&gt; On April 26, she wrote on her website: "I am NOT involved in "Everybody Draw Mohammd [''[[sic]]'' ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff".&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt; She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, "Because I'm an idiot."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;

Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. "I just want to go back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=mcpspc/&gt; Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement.

Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights."&lt;ref&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/apologetic_draw_muhammad_carto.html "Apologetic 'Draw Muhammad' cartoonist urges 'Draw Al Gore' instead [VIDEO&amp;#93;"], 8:38 a.m. update of a 1 a.m. post, April 30, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed/&gt;

Norris' change in position received varying reactions from commentators.

==Reception==

===Support===
The idea for the May 20 protest received support from [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now."&lt;ref name=kpfos/&gt; The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as [[Michael C. Moynihan]] at ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine's "Hit &amp; Run" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings.&lt;ref name="moynihan423"&gt;Moynihan, Michael C., [http://reason.com/blog/2010/04/23/first-annual-everybody-draw-mo "First Annual Everybody Draw Mohammad Day"], blog post, April 23, 2010, "Hit &amp; Run" blog, ''Reason'' magazine website.

Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?"&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt; Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact [[self-censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;

"Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side," he told the  [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [[Vebjørn Selbekk]], a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons of Mohammed]] in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Vold, Henrik Brattli, [http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/1.7097202 "Alle skal tegne Muhammed"], article, NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting AS—[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]), April 26, 2010, in Norwegian (Selbekk: "og jeg synes kanskje dette er den riktige måten å reagere på – med humor, og også å spre dette på flere, så det ikke bare er noen få som blir sittende med alle truslene "; Rønning: "Jeg mener nok at indignasjonen fra dem som hevder retten til å drive religionskritikk er like viktig som den indignasjonen som kommer fra den muslimske siden.

Franz Kruger, writing for the ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a "silly Facebook initiative" and found "the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'" in it "disturbing", noting that "it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Kruger| first =Franz | title = Why draw the Prophet? | work =  [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] | date =May 28, 2010  | url =http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-28-why-draw-the-prophet | accessdate = May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it "claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sapa | title = M&amp;G regrets cartoon offence over prophet | work = [[The Daily Dispatch]] | date = May 31, 2010 | url = http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | accessdate = June 11, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615142819/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | archivedate = June 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Rifkind]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'', called the Facebook initiative a "grubby project": "... there’s something here that makes me twitch.

In Pakistan, an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," adding that it was "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a "knee-jerk reaction," saying that, "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," and that the block might "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff |title=Facebook furore |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=May 21, 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524012334/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The protest movement and incidents surrounding the [[censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode were discussed on the [[National Public Radio]] program, ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', where commentators including [[Ross Douthat]] analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon.&lt;ref name="douthat"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Douthat  | first = Ross |authorlink=Ross Douthat | title =  You Can't Portray Muhammad On TV| work = [[Talk of the Nation]]  | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date =April 26, 2010  | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126283217  | accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Gutmann of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the [[2010 Times Square car bomb attempt]] was found to be related to the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", "this sort of protest will be more important than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gutmann | first =  Stephanie   | title = Facebook group says make May 20 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100037736/facebook-group-says-make-may-20-everybody-draw-mohammed-day/ | accessdate = May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Faster Times]]'', journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, "was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lederman | first = Noah  | title =South Park, Mohammed, and the First Amendment  | work =[[The Faster Times]] | publisher = thefastertimes.com | date = May 4, 2010 | url =http://www.isisiraq.com/south-park-mohammed-and-the-first-amendment/  | accessdate =May 5, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for ''[[Financial Times]]'', John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement and noted, "Molly Norris proposed a 'let’s everyone draw Mohammed day' – then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away."&lt;ref name="johnlloyd"&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Lloyd| first =John | title = Hard men and high drama: life imitating art? | work =  [[Financial Times]] | date =May 8, 2010  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bbd083d6-595c-11df-99ba-00144feab49a.html  | accessdate = May 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'', Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to [[Martin Luther]], stating, "Forget the ''South Park'' dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent."&lt;ref name="austindacey"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Dacey  | first = Austin  | title =  Satire is Religion – The debate over cartoons and prophets is not just about free of speech; it’s about freedom of religion.| work = Religion Dispatches | publisher =www.religiondispatches.org | date = May 12, 2010 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/2561/satire_is_religion/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey argued, "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between ''conflicting'' religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="austindacey" /&gt;

In an analysis of the protest movement for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking [[jingoistic]], American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manalastas | first = Jordan  | title =Cartoonist criticized for creating ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day’ should have defended her right to First Amendment  | work = [[Daily Bruin]]  |publisher = www.dailybruin.com, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date = May 17, 2010 | url =http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2010/5/17/cartoonist-criticized-creating-everybody-draw-moha/  | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of the protest movement for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] was critical of the concept of "mocking Muhammad," writing, "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the [[flag-burning]], street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = O'Neill | first = Brendan | title =Mocking Muhammad: a shallow Enlightenment  | work =[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]] | publisher = www.spiked-online.com | date =May 19, 2010  | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/8894#.WDk70orQeUk | accessdate = November 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[editorial cartoonist]]s quoted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to.&lt;ref name=Cavna20May&gt;Michael Cavna, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/their_turn_12_top_cartoonists.html THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog ''Comics Riff'' (May 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]] opposed involvement because, "something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;  Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, "childish and needlessly provocative," or demurred because they dislike, "choreographed punditry."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;

He also defended [[The First Amendment|the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]] in the way that it's an important right of all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalexperts.org/comment-analysis/drawing-the-prophet-muhammad-should-not-be-an-issue|title=Drawing the Prophet Muhammad is not the issue|author=Tarek Kahlaoui|date=May 17, 2010|publisher=Global Expert Finder|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threat on Molly Norris's life, forced into hiding==
On July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the [[al-Qaeda]] magazine  ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]],'' Al-Awlaki wrote, "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved," and was quoted as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ...

[[FBI]] officials reportedly notified Norris warning her that they considered it a "very serious threat."&lt;ref name="hitlist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="threat" /&gt;

Norris has since changed her name and gone into hiding.

Food biodiversity can be considered from two main perspectives: production and consumption. From a consumption perspective, food biodiversity describes the diversity of foods in human diets and their contribution to [[dietary diversity]], cultural identity and good [[nutrition]]. Production of food biodiversity looks at the thousands of food products, such as fruits, nuts, vegetables, meat and condiments sourced from agriculture and from the wild (e.g. forests, uncultivated fields, water bodies). Food biodiversity covers the diversity ''between species,'' for example different animal and crop species, including those considered [[Neglected and underutilized crop|neglected and underutilized species]]. Food biodiversity also comprises the diversity ''within species,'' for example different varieties of fruit and vegetables, or different breeds of animals.  

== Consumption of food biodiversity ==

=== Trends in food biodiversity consumption ===
Since 1961, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally.&lt;ref name="Khoury"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Khoury, C.K.|author2=Bjorkman, A.D.|author3=Dempewolf, H.|author4=Ramirez-Villegas, J.|author5=Guarino, L.|author6=Jarvis, A.|author7=Rieseberg, L.H.|author8=Struik, P.C.|date=2014|title=Increasing homogeneity in global food supplies and the implications for food security|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313490111|journal=PNAS|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4001–4006|doi=10.1073/pnas.1313490111|pmc=3964121|pmid=24591623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the foods eaten in different countries were reduced by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern "global standard"&lt;ref name="Khoury" /&gt; diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world's human population, including [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], [[maize]], [[soybean]] (by +284%&lt;ref name="Kinver"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26382067|title=Crop diversity decline 'threatens food security'|last1=Kinver|first1=Mark|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[palm oil]] (by +173%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;), and [[sunflower]] (by +246%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;). Whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important crops, wheat has become a staple in over 97% of countries, with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide. Other crops have declined sharply over the same period, including [[rye]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[sweet potato]] (by -45%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;), [[cassava]] (by -38%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;), [[coconut]], [[sorghum]] (by -52%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;) and [[millet]]s (by -45%&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;).&lt;ref name="Khoury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinver" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diets-around-the-world-are-becoming-more-similar/|title=Diets around the world are becoming more similar|last1=Fischetti|first1=Mark|publisher=Scientific American|page=72|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food biodiversity and nutrition ===
Promoting diversity of foods and species consumed in human diets in particular has potential co-benefits for public health as well as sustainable [[food systems]] perspective.

Food biodiversity provides necessary nutrients for quality diets and is  essential part of local food systems, cultures and [[food security]]. Promoting diversity of foods and species consumed in human diets in particular has potential co-benefits for sustainable food systems. Nutritionally, diversity in food is associated with higher micronutrient adequacy of diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lachat|first=Carl|last2=Raneri|first2=Jessica E.|last3=Walker Smith|first3=Katherine|last4=Kolsteren|first4=Patrick|last5=Van Damme|first5=Patrick|last6=Verzelen|first6=Kaat|last7=Penafiel|first7=Daniela|last8=Vanhove|first8=Wouter|last9=Kennedy|first9=Gina|last10=Hunter|first10=Danny|last11=Oduor Odhiambo|first11=Francis|last12=Ntandou-Bouzitou|first12=Gervais|last13=De Baets|first13=Bernard|last14=Ratnasekera|first14=Disna|last15=The Ky|first15=Hoang|last16=Remans|first16=Roseline|last17=Termote|first17=Celine|date=|year=2017|title=Dietary species richness as a measure of food biodiversity and nutritional quality of diets|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/12/13/1709194115|journal=PNAS|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1073/pnas.1709194115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, per additional species consumed, mean adequacy of [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], [[folate]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[zinc]] increased by 3%. From a conservation point of view, diets based on a wide variety of species place less pressure on single species.

==Production of food biodiversity==

=== Role of biodiversity in production systems ===
Conservation and management of broad-based [[genetic diversity]] within the domesticated species have been improving agricultural production for 10,000 years. However, diverse natural populations have been providing food and other products for much longer. High biodiversity can maximize production levels, which are sustained through beneficial impact of ecosystem services for agricultural, modified and natural ecosystems. Conversely, reliance on a narrow portfolio of crops or crop varieties can jeopardize food production systems. This is illustrated by the Great [[Irish Potato Famine]]. Potatoes were introduced into Ireland from the New World in about 1600 and they became the major food source of most Irish people. The wind-borne Potato blight fungus spread throughout the country In 1845-1847 and caused almost complete failure of the potato crop. It is estimated that 1 million people died of starvation, cholera and typhoid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~sustain/bio65/lec11/b65lec11.htm#Food_Supplies Values Of Biodiversity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120117203030/http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/~sustain/bio65/lec11/b65lec11.htm|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem services ===
A wide range of biologically diverse populations in natural ecosystems and in / near agricultural ecosystems maintain essential ecological functions that are critical for the production of food. Such populations contribute positively to, for example, [[nutrient cycling]], [[decomposition]] of organic matter, crusted or degraded [[soil rehabilitation]], pest and disease regulation, [[water quality]] maintenance, and [[pollination]]. Maintaining species diversity, while building on and enhancing ecosystem functions, reduces external input requirements by increasing [[nutrient availability]], improving water use and [[soil structure]], and controlling pests.

=== Traits ===
Genetic diversity within food species is a source of useful genes with a variety of benefits. For example:

* Wild subspecies of tomatoes (''[[Solanum lycopersicum]] chmielewskii'') were [[crossbred]] with cultivated tomato species. After 10 generations, new tomato strains with larger fruits were produced. There was a marked increase in pigmentation. The content of soluble solid, mainly [[fructose]], [[glucose]] and other sugars increased.&lt;ref name="Ittis"&gt;[[Hugh Iltis|H.H.Iltis]] (1988). "Serendipity in the Exploration of Biodiversity." In: [[E. O. Wilson]], editor. ''Biodiversity''. National Academy Press. 98-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

* A barley plant from [[Ethiopia]] provides a gene that protects the barley crop from the lethal yellow dwarf virus.&lt;ref name="Plotkin"&gt;M.J.Plotkin. 1988. ''The Outlook for New Agricultural and Industrial Products from the Tropics''. In: E.O. Wilson, Editor. Biodiversity. National Academy Press&lt;/ref&gt;

* Host resistance gene, Xa21,from ''[[Oryza longistaminata]]'' is integrated into the genome of ''[[Oryza sativa]]'' for a broad range resistance to rice blight disease caused by ''[[Xanthomonas oryzae|Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae]]'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/rgn/vol20/b38.html Rice Genetics Newsletter, Vol. 20: Evaluation of durable resistance of transgenic hybrid maintainer line IR58025B for bacterial blight disease of rice]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic patterns of biodiversity and food==

In 2016, researchers linked the centers and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that countries are highly interconnected with regard to primary regions of diversity of the crops they cultivate and/or consume. Foreign crops (crops entirely from regions of diversity outside the location of the country) were extensively used in food supplies (68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean were derived from foreign crops) and production systems (69.3% of crops grown were foreign). Foreign crop usage was shown to have increased significantly over the past 50 years, including in countries with high indigenous crop diversity.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Achicanoy, H.A. |author3=Bjorkman, A.D. |author4=Navarro-Racines, C. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Flores-Palacios, X. |author7=Engels, J.M.M. |author8=Wiersema, J.H. |author9=Dempewolf, H. |author10=Sotelo, S. |author11=Ramírez-Villegas, J. |author12=Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P. |author13=Fowler, C. |author14=Jarvis, A. |author15=Rieseberg, L.H. |author16=Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6142">[[File:Frankipilingprocess1.png|thumb|A Franki pile]]
The '''Franki piling system''' (also called [[pressure]]-injected [[foundation (architecture)|footing]]) is a method used to drive expanded [[Base (geometry)|base]] cast-[[in-situ]] [[concrete]] (Franki) [[deep foundation#Drilled piles|piles]].&lt;ref name="Perry1"&gt;[http://www.geoforum.com/info/pileinfo/view.asp?ID=15 Franki Pile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711085120/http://www.geoforum.com/info/pileinfo/view.asp?ID=15 |date=2011-07-11 }} GRV AB, Retrieved November 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by [[Belgian]] [[Engineer]] Edgard Frankignoul in 1909 and has achieved considerable worldwide success since.&lt;ref name="Perry3"&gt;[http://www.franki-geotechnics.be/page.asp?q=history&amp;id=501&amp;title=History History] Franki Foundations Group Belgium, Retrieved December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This method can be applied to different site conditions and is still widely used&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt; due to its high [[ultimate tensile strength|tensile load]] capacity, and relatively low [[noise]] and ground [[vibration]] levels.&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;

==History==
Edgard Frankignoul applied for the production [[patent]] for the Franki pile in July 1909. He then co-founded the [[geotechnical]] company Frankipile (Société des Pieux Armés Frankignoul) with [[Liège]] [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] Edmond Baar with the goal of commercializing the Franki piling system. By 1929, the technique had been implemented by 34 international [[subsidiaries]] and [[license]] holders.&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt;

The Franki pile process has undergone several reformations since it was conceived.  The dry concrete plug was not introduced to the design until 1926.&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt; Before this innovation, the casing had to be top-driven and equipped with a lost bottom plate.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt; The Franki pile with vibrated shaft and [[hydraulic]] vibrating hammer were manufactured starting from 1960 and 1971 respectively.&lt;ref name="Perry3"/&gt;

==Applications==
Franki piles can be used as high-capacity [[deep foundation]] elements without the necessity of excavation or [[dewatering]].&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt; They are useful in conditions where a sufficient [[Bearing capacity|bearing]] [[soil]] can only be reached deeper in the ground,&lt;ref name="Perry2"&gt;[http://www.franki.de/pdf_en/FRANKI_pile.pdf FRANKIPILE] FRANKI Grundbau, Retrieved December 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt; and are best suited to granular soil where bearing is primarily achieved from the densification of the soil around the base.&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt; They are not recommended for use in [[Cohesion (geology)|cohesive]] soils where [[Dynamic compaction|compaction]] of the base is not possible.&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;
The Franki piling system is the quietest of the driven cast-in-place systems, and so is used in conditions where high noise levels could cause [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] problems.&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;

==Installation of a Franki pile==
# A charge of [[Concrete slump test|zero-slump]] concrete is poured into the bottom of a [[steel]] driving [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]] that is placed vertically on the ground. A [[diesel engine|diesel]]-operated [[pile driver|drop hammer]] is then driven on the concrete, forming a [[watertight]] concrete plug.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"&gt;Shamsher Prakash, Hari D. Sharma (1990). ''Pile foundations in Engineering Practice'', p. 60. Wiley-Interscience {{ISBN|0-471-61653-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;
# The concrete plug is driven into the ground by the drop hammer. The pipe is also dragged into the ground due to [[friction]] developed between the steel and the concrete.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;
# When the desired depth is reached, the pipe is held in position by leads—structures which guide and align the pile and hammer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piledrivers.org/files/uploads/272D1300-0887-4849-BDB0-4044B9FF8859.pdf ''piledrivers.org'' PDF, Land Based Rigs]&lt;/ref&gt; The hammer is then applied to the concrete, driving it outwards through the bottom of the pile and forming a [[mushroom]]-shaped base.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;
# At this point, a [[cylindrical]] [[rebar]] cage can be driven into the concrete if supplementary reinforcement is desired.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"&gt;Dr. B.C. Punmia, Ashok Kumar Jain, B.C. Punmia, Arun Kr. Jain (2005). ''Soil Mechanics and Foundations
 '', p. 763. Laxmi Publications (P) Ltd. {{ISBN|81-7008-081-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Additional charges of concrete are added and driven while the steel casing is simultaneously pulled up until the shaft of the pile is formed.&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt;

==Variations==
* Small charges of concrete can be added while the base is being formed&lt;ref name="Perry4"/&gt; to enlarge the base and improve the pile’s settlement performance.&lt;ref name="Perry5"&gt;[http://esvc000701.wic052u.server-web.com/PDF/Frank_Piles.pdf Franki Piles] Frankipile Australia, Retrieved December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Franki piles can be installed raked (or sloped) with a tilt of up to 4:1.&lt;ref name="Perry2"/&gt; Raked Franki piles are always reinforced and are particularly suitable for structures subject to dynamic [[forces]].&lt;ref name="Perry1"/&gt;
* Driving methods such as open-ended coring, rock socketing, and composite shaft construction are occasionally used to overcome unique site problems.&lt;ref name="Perry5"/&gt;

Eventually Saladino went by one name, "Gaspar," which he wrote in his trademark calligraphy.

From 1966 to the 1990s he lettered many of the logos, titles, captions and balloons on [[DC Comics]] covers.&lt;ref name="klein3"&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/Blog/gaspar-saladino-1927-2016/ "Gaspar Saladino 1927-2016"], Kleinletters.com (Aug. 7, 2016). Retrieved August 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; For a period in the 1970s, he was also "page-one letterer" for many [[Marvel Comics]] books.&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Saladino was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, and attended Manhattan's [[School of Industrial Art]].&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; While in school Saladino did some [[comic-book]] [[inker|inking]] for [[Lloyd Jacquet]]'s "[[Funnies, Inc.]]", one of several "packagers" of the time that produced outsourced comics for publishers entering the new medium.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; After graduating from high school, Saladino enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]], which stationed him in Japan in a [[public relations]] capacity.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; He returned home in 1947.

=== Career ===

==== Lettering ====
In 1949, he approached [[DC Comics]], where production chief [[Sol Harrison]] showed Saladino's art samples to editors. One, [[Julius Schwartz]], while unimpressed with the art, offered Saladino regular work as a [[letterer]].&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; Though working in the office, ensconced between letterer [[Ira Schnapp]] and production artist [[Mort Drucker]], Saladino was employed as a freelancer, earning $2 a page and generally earning $90 a week.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; He recalled in a 2007 interview, "DC wanted a full-time letterer and by being present I got first choice of assignments. I also thought it was beneficial to be able to work hand in hand with the artists."&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt;

Saladino recalled in 2007 that his first job for DC was a "cowboy romance" comic.&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt; The title was ''Romance Trail'' #5 (March–April 1950) in which he lettered two stories, "Romance By Mail" with art by Carmine Infantino and Joe Giella, and a one-page poem "Western Serenade" with art by Alex Toth. These were Saladino's first printed works for DC.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; They were followed by more work in ''Romance Trail'' and the western series ''Jimmy Wakely'', starting with issue #5 (June 1950).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/letterer/name/gaspar%20saladino/sort/chrono/ Gaspar Saladino] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He did much of the lettering for the humor strips of [[Henry Boltinoff]] in ''[[Action Comics]]''. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Saladino was a mainstay on DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]]'s books, like ''[[Strange Adventures]]'', ''[[Mystery in Space]]'', ''[[Justice League of America]]'', ''[[The Flash]]'', ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'', and many more.

When [[Carmine Infantino]] came on as DC's art director and then editorial director in 1966/1967, he gradually shifted all of DC's premiere lettering tasks: logos, cover lettering and house ads, from veteran letterer [[Ira Schnapp]] to Saladino. This changed the whole line's look, adding Saladino's bold, dynamic style.,&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt; Saladino continued to letter many interior pages as well.

In the late 1960s, while freelancing for DC, Saladino began freelancing for Marvel as well, using the pseudonym '''L.P. Gregory'''&lt;ref name=bails&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=SALADINO%2c+GASPAR | authorlink = Jerry Bails | last = Bails | first= Jerry | first2=Hames, eds. | last2=Ware | publisher = The Who's Who of American Comic Books | title = Saladino, Gaspar | accessdate= August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lettering titles including ''Iron Man'', ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Tales to Astonish]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; In the mid-to-late 1970s Saladino became the uncredited "page-one letterer" for many [[Marvel Comics]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-66/ Mark Evanier quoted in Brian Cronin's "Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed" #66, Comic Book Resources (Aug. 21, 2006).] Retrieved July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually credited himself as simply either '''Gaspar''' or '''Gaspar S.'''&lt;ref name=bails /&gt;

In 1976, Saladino lettered the historic DC-Marvel crossover comic ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]''. He also lettered the oversize special issue ''[[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali]]''. By 1977, Saladino was lettering most of DC's war comics, in addition to many superhero and mystery stories. From 1976 to 1977, he lettered the [[Los Angeles Times Syndicate]] comic strip ''The Virtue of Vera Valiant'',&lt;ref name=bails /&gt; by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Frank Springer]].

Saladino's output after 2002 was minimal.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Saladino designed the logos for DC's ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'', ''[[Phantom Stranger]]'', ''[[Metal Men]]'', ''[[Adam Strange]]'', ''[[House of Mystery]]'', ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'', and ''[[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="BDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=13-logos&gt;[http://13thdimension.com/13-logos-a-gaspar-saladino-salute/ Images of logos by Saladino for DC and Marvel, confirmed by employees at DC, including Paul Levitz, and by the Grand Comics database]&lt;/ref&gt; He also re-designed established character logos to make them more contemporary and stylish, such as with ''[[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]]''.&lt;ref name=13-logos/&gt; He also did the lettering for cover blurbs for a wide variety of titles and for seasonal house ads that ran in several issues at a time.&lt;ref name=toddklein1&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-saladino/ "All those pieces of art paper with Gaspar's cover lettering were stored in a few bulging folders in a file drawer in the DC production room. When I had time, I went through what was there, mostly from the late 1970s to 1985, and put together these reference pages" -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddklein2&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-2/ "Lots more terrific cover lettering from "The Master," Gaspar Saladino." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddklein3&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-3/ "Here's the third part of the collection of wonderful cover lettering by Gaspar Saladino that I put together in 1985." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddkelin4&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-4-final/ "This last section of my 1985 collection of stellar cover lettering by the great Gaspar Saladino also includes some from house ads." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marvel, Saladino's logos, which he either created or updated, include ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'', ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'', and ''Marvel Triple Action''.&lt;ref name=13-logos/&gt;

In 1974, with the launch of the short-lived publisher [[Seaboard Periodicals|Atlas Comics]], Saladino designed logos for all the company's titles.&lt;ref name=GCD-Seaboard&gt;[http://www.comics.org/publisher/372/ "Gaspar Saladino did all the logos at Atlas" Alan Kupperberg in CBA #16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s he designed logos for [[Neal Adams]]' [[Continuity Comics]] and for some titles published by [[Eclipse Comics]].&lt;ref name="BDS"/&gt;

In the 1990s he designed product logos for the Lucky Mojo Curio Company, a metaphysical supply manufactory founded by [[Catherine Yronwode]], the former editor-in-chief of Eclipse Comics.

== Lettering style ==
[[File:Saladino's lettering sample.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A panel from ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth|Arkham Asylum]]'' (story by Grant Morrison, art by Dave McKean), showing Saladino's distinctive lettering treatment.]]

Saladino's default dialoguing style was curvy and naturally enmeshed with the artwork. When producing house ads or cover blurbs, he sometimes altered the standard letterforms in order to interlock letters.&lt;ref name=toddklein3/&gt; One trademark was his use of big, bold, oversized exclamation points.&lt;ref name="BDS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Stroud | first= Bryan | url = http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/saladino.shtml | title = Gaspar Saladino Interview | date = 2007 | publisher = The Silver Age Sage | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s Saladino lettered the interiors for the then-new title ''[[Swamp Thing]]''. It was in the pages of this series that he created the concept of character-designated fonts, with Swamp Thing's distinctive outlined, "drippy" letters.&lt;ref name=evanier-saladino&gt;[http://www.newsfromme.com/2016/08/04/gaspar-saladino-r-p/ "When Swamp Thing by Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson became both a financial and creative success for DC in the seventies, everyone agreed the comic wouldn't be the same without Gaspar's distinctive and expressive lettering." -- Mark Evanier]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saladino always lettered by hand. Likewise, his word balloons were drawn freehand, never with a template.&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Saladino and his wife Celeste were married in 1957. At first the couple lived in [[Queens Village]], then moved to a home in [[Plainview, New York|Plainview]], [[Long Island]] in 1959, where they lived the rest of Gaspar's life. They had three children, Greg (born in 1960), Lisa (1962) and Peter (1965). At present there are five grandchildren: Jordan, Brea, Jackson, Alyssa and Kaila.&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt; In April 2013, he was named honorary chief of the Plainview Fire Department as a 50-year member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gaspar Saladino, 50-Year-Member, Named 'Honorary Chief' | first = Joe | last = Dowd | date = April 9, 2013 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 | url = http://plainview.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/gaspar-saladino-50-year-member-named-honorary-chief | publisher = Plainview.Patch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is locally known as the site where the bodies of two Christian saints, Epictet and Astion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ro.orthodoxwiki.org/Epictet_%C8%99i_Astion_din_Halmyris |title=Epictet și Astion din Halmyris |accessdate=July 10, 2015 &lt;!-- 12:59 pm --&gt;  |publisher=OrthodoxWiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; were uncovered between 2001 and 2004.
 
==History of the Site==

Despite the creation of several Greek colonies along the Romanian Black Sea coast during the 7th century BC, no corresponding Greek structural remains have been found nearby Halmyris. The region was inhabited during the Second [[Iron Age]] by the [[Getae]] or [[Dacians]] as is evident by the discovery of several cremation burials within a possible [[Necropolis|necropolis]] that dates to the 4th-2nd centuries BC. 
While the first Roman occupation of the site seems to have been in the form of a turf-and-timber fort constructed during the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] period, the first stone [[Castra|castrum]] at Halmyris was built during the reign of the emperor [[Trajan]].  Although the original layout of the Trajanic fort is largely covered by later reconstructive phases, the plan seems to have been indicative of the 'typical' 2nd century layout of a Roman fort, composed of a rectangular defensive wall, rectangular towers and a gate in the middle of each of the walls.  The placement of the fort was strategically deliberate as it lay not only along the course of the [[Danube River]] but also at the very mouth of the Black Sea.  Early connections to the Roman fleet and its maritime activities at Halmyris are confirmed from epigraphic evidence mentioning the existence of a 'mariner's village' or ''vicus classicorum'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Zahariade and Alexandrescu, 2012, 37)}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
However, a significant alteration of the defenses took place during the [[Tetrarchy]] period.  The new layout of the fort walls consisted of an irregular polygon bolstered by 15 towers and at least two well-defended gateways in the north and the west. Structures found within the fort include numerous [[barracks]], a private [[thermae]] or bathhouse and  a [[basilica]].  However, in the winter of 384/5, the Danube froze, allowing the foreign tribes to the north to cross and sack Halmyris.  A series of earthquakes in the 4th century and later that altered the course of the Danube led to the silting up of Halmyris' harbor and decreased its economic and strategic importance.  The final period of occupation seems to correspond with the reconstruction of the fort by the emperor [[Justinian]] which included the building of a monumental entrance way in the northeast wall of the fort.  Additionally, Halmyris became the site of one of the major bishoprics in the province as well as being named as one of the fifteen most important towns in the province of Scythia. 

Halmyris was the most easterly point of the Danubian border in Roman times and probably served as a supply centre for the fleet; early Roman inscriptions inform us of the existence of a "mariner's village"—''vicus classicorum''. During the late Roman period two units of the military fleet—''Classis in Plateypegiis'' and ''Musculi Schytici'' (which had little ships, suited for the Danube Delta) may have been hosted by this city.

As for religious life, we know that in 290 AD, during the persecutions ordered by [[Diocletian]], [[July 7 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|Saint Epictetus]] and Astion suffered martyrdom at Halmyris.

* Halmyris served as a depot for supplies, colonization and cultural exchange in the region for 1,100 years. It was occupied from the Iron Age to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]].
* The original fort was made of timber and turf, but as the fort gained importance and a regular garrison was established along the Danube, the fort was rebuilt in stone.
* Early in the fort's history, the Goths and Huns from the North crossed the Danube and conquered the fort. It was later re-captured by the Romans.
* In the early 4th century, the Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]] added a basilica.
* A series of earthquakes altered the course of the Danube and the fort became more removed from the river. Halmyris gradually lost its importance and was abandoned.

==Current activities==
* The fort is being excavated by Dr. Mihail Zahariade and Dr. John Karavas.
* Current areas of excavation include the military barracks, northwestern towers and harbor installations.

'''''Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible''''' was a five-volume Biblical encyclopaedia published 1898–1904.

==First edition==
The full title was ''A Dictionary of the Bible, dealing with the Language, Literature and Contents, including the Biblical Theology''. It was edited by [[James Hastings]], with the assistance of [[John A. Selbie]]. Additional assistance with revision of the proofs was provided by [[Andrew B. Davidson|A. B. Davidson]], [[Samuel Rolles Driver|S. R. Driver]] and [[Henry Barclay Swete|H. B. Swete]]. Four volumes (1898&amp;mdash;1902) divided up the alphabetic entries, with a fifth volume (1904) devoted to some extra articles, indexes and maps. Publication was by [[T. &amp; T. Clark]] in Edinburgh and [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] in New York.

Although described as a “dictionary”, the work is better described as an encyclopaedia, with signed articles sometimes several pages in length. It is a substantial work, with five [[Book size|quarto]] volumes each of about 900 pages. The 194 authors of articles were established scholars of the day, generally Protestant Christians, from many countries, but mostly from the UK and the USA in that order.

The subject matter was "the Old and New Testaments, together with the Old Testament Apocrypha, according to the [[Authorized Version|Authorized]] and [[Revised Version|Revised English Version]]s." Articles were written "on names of all Persons and Places, on the Antiquities and Archaeology of the Bible, on its Ethnology, Geology and Natural History, on Biblical Theology and Ethic ..."

It remains a good source of Biblical information as understood around 1900.

==1909 edition==
A one-volume dictionary with the same name was issued by the same publishers in 1909. It was described as "not a condensation of the five-volume set, but new and independent work". The editor was James Hastings, with the co-operation of John A. Selbie, and with the assistance of [[John C. Lambert]] and [[Shailer Mathews]].
992 pages + xvi + 4 maps.

==1963 edition==
A completely up-dated and revised one-volume edition was written by 148 scholars, edited by [[Frederick C. Grant]] and [[H. H. Rowley]] and issued by the same publishers in 1963. 1059 pages + maps.

'''I.A.Recordings''' was founded in 1982 by a small group of volunteers, to record past and present [[industries]] on film and video, as a resource for [[industrial archaeology]] (I.A.).

When possible, they capture the processes and activities of an industry while it is still working; but moving pictures also add an extra dimension to the recording of industrial remains.

All the footage they shoot is kept in a storage archive for posterity}.&lt;ref name="BUFVC"&gt;Ballantyne, James (ed.): "Researchers Guide to British film &amp; television collections", page 142. British Universities Film &amp; Video Council 1993. {{ISBN|0-901299-64-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time to time, they produce edited programmes from some of the material, to make it available to the public on [[DVD]].&lt;ref name="IAR_Home"&gt;[http://www.iarecordings.org], "I.A.Recordings home page" retrieved 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Their first project in 1982 was to work with the historian W.K.V.Gale to record the famous John Bradley Rolling Mill in the [[English Midlands]], as it was due to close within a week and was the last of its kind in the area.

Since then they have recorded many industries, several of which have since closed.&lt;ref name="BUFVC" /&gt; They have also produced several documentary history programmes, particularly about inland waterways ([[canals]]) and [[mining]].&lt;ref name="NAMHO"&gt;Vernon, R.W. (ed.): "National Association of Mining History Organisations Mining Heritage Guide", page 98. National Association of Mining History Organisations 2006. {{ISBN|0-9517437-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I.A.Recordings started in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] but have since recorded sites in Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, [[Poland]], Spain and the United States.&lt;ref name="IAR_AZ"&gt;[http://www.iarecordings.org/subjidx.html], "I.A.Recordings A-Z Subject Index" retrieved 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;

They have developed their own specialist [[video]] technology such as helmet-mounted cameras for use underground and [[MineCam]], a remote-controlled camera for mine shaft exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Bedford, Mike (ed.): "Cave Radio &amp; Electronics Group Journal Number 22", pages 3 - 6. British Cave Research Association 1995. ISSN 1361-4800&lt;/ref&gt;

I.A.Recordings use [[broadcast]] equipment and techniques and since 2005, [[High Definition Video]].&lt;ref name="NAMHO" /&gt;

By 2008, they had over 38,000 minutes of original footage in the archive, but as they are voluntary they have only had time to edit a relatively small amount for release on DVD.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

The English word is on the left, with its current French equivalent in brackets, then comes its Old French origin in bold and the century of its introduction on the right.

==Biographical summary of works ==

Ostoga flourished between 1940 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;As recounted to Beverley Cranwell, 1991 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''1940-1945'''

Ostoja studied drawing under Olgierd Vetesco in [[Przasnysz]] ([[Poland]]).

'''1945–1949'''

Ostoja completed studies at the [[Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts]] in Germany after winning a scholarship, and migrated to Australia.

Arriving in Melbourne, he enrolled at the Victorian School of Fine Arts National Gallery School under A. Summer and [[William Dargie]] and studied while he was working as a manual labourer.

'''1950-1955'''

Ostoja introduced the new abstract expression of Europe both to lecturers and students at the Victorian School of Art, Melbourne.

Settling in Stirling, in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia, he had his first one-man Exhibition at the Royal Society of Arts in Adelaide.

'''1956 - 1957'''

Ostoja collaborated with [http://www.adelaide.edu.au/library/special/mss/davidson/ Ian Davidson] in the production of the short film ''Five South Australian Artists'', and became involved in stage and theatre set design.

He co-produced several experimental films again with Ian Davidson, including ''The Quest of Time'' in 1957

Ostoja's work in abstract expression began to receive accolades. He won the Cornell Prize for the canvas "Form in Landscape", and designed the set for the play '[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' by [[Luigi Pirandello]]

'''1958'''

The artist designed the set for the South Australian production of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]''. He began to work with the [[Elder Conservatorium]] of [[University of Adelaide]], designing sets for [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore|Elixir of Love]]'', employing startlingly new modified light settings and modulations.

'''1959'''

Ostoja won the [[Cornell Prize]] Exhibition of the Contemporary Arts Society of South Australia. He designed the set for ''The Egg'' and a new, light/colour abstract presentation for two performances of the South Australian Ballet Theatre. His innovative new techniques were then used by the [[Elder Conservatorium]] in their Opera Workshops.

'''1960'''

This year he designed sets for a new opera group which would eventually grow into the South Australian Opera Company. Among other theatrical events, he designed and executed the scenery for ''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl'' by Errol John, and ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (play)|The Teahouse of the August Moon]]'' by [[John Patrick (dramatist)|John Patrick]], (an Adelaide University Theatre Guild Production). He received artistic satisfaction but little financial reward for these efforts. In this year also, he staged a visual production on the theme of [[Orpheus]], using dance, music and voice with several projectors.

This was the first attempt at quadraphonic sound in Australia, and also the first demonstration of "Chromasonics" - the science of translating sound into visual images. Ostoja then designed innovative "abstracted" scenery for a production of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]''.

'''1961'''

Ostoja designed the sets for the controversial South Australian production of [[Patrick White]]'s ''Ham Funeral'' - also [[Alan Seymour]]'s ''Swamp Creatures'', both performed by the Adelaide University Theatre Guild. He designed and constructed six stained glass windows for the Refectory at Adelaide University, South Australia. In this period Ostoja designed special lights and gauzes for difficult effects required in an ambitious production of the opera ''[[Don Carlos]]'' by the Opera Workshop, for the Elder Conservatorium.

'''1962'''

Ostoja designed and built sets for the production of"J.S", by [[Archibald MacLeish]], for the second [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]]. He exhibited vitreous enamel works in Melbourne's Argus Gallery. [[Max Harris (poet)|Max Harris]], in ''[[The Bulletin]]'' of 20 October 1962, praised Ostoja's sets for ''My Cousin from Fiji'' in Union Theatre, Adelaide, and his technique of rear screen projections as later adopted throughout Australia.

'''1963'''

Ostoja continued to develop Multi-Image projections, demonstrating for the first time in Australia the concept later to be known as 'audio-visuals!'. Ostoja gave Sir Herbert Reed, the art critic, a personal viewing of one of his visual presentations. At Christmas, in the Elder Conservatorium, Ostoja gave what was probably the world's first "visual concert", using special projectors and incorporating music, colours and shapes.

'''1964'''

Ostoja co-designed a dance and stage production in Adelaide. For the Adelaide Festival of Arts of that year, he designed the largest light mosaic ever staged up to that time, upon the facade of an 11-storey building. Ostoja was invited to New Zealand, and exhibited the first electronically generated images in Australia in Melbourne, at the Argus Gallery. His extremely innovative design for the {{convert|60|ft|m|sing=on}} bass relif mural on the new B.P. building in Melbourne was the subject of a film which won the "Blue Ribbon" Award in the American Film Festival in New York.

'''1965'''

Ostoja designed and made the first light kinetic mural in Australia, and continued to evolve theatrical works using multi-screen and Multi-projector techniques. The Production of [[Jean Genet]]'s ''[[The Balcony]]'' was very controversial. with Elizabeth Dalman, Ostoja produced new dance forms for Melbourne Television. He introduced [[Op Art]] to Australia, both at South Yarra Gallery in Melbourne, and Gallery A in Sydney.

'''1966'''

With John Dallwitz, Ostoja was invited to present more "Sound and Image" experimental theatre. he incorporated Australian poetry into the sound, music, and visual images. The architect [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] commissioned Ostoja to design two large Op murals for the Australian Pavilion entrance at the [[Expo 67]]. Ostoja was awarded a [[Churchill Fellowship]], which enabled him to have extensive world travel, comparing art and technology in many countries. He began to work with language, contemporary poetry and prose, and computers.

'''1967'''

In Berne, Switzerland, Ostoja received the "[http://www.fiap.net/ Excellence F.I.A.P." Award] for innovative photography.

'''1968'''

At the Adelaide Festival of Arts, Ostoja staged the first combined 'Sound and Image" production in the world using a laser beam. This included the first science fiction play (by [[Ray Bradbury]]) performed in Australia. Ostoja's theatre methods were increasingly attracting the attention of critics to how plays were staged. "Chromasonics", developed and introduced by Ostoja, was now being used extensively in the entertainment industry.

'''1969'''

Ostoja staged [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Krzysztof Penderecki's ]] [[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]], a controversial, contemporary religious work. The South Australian ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' wrote an extensive critique of Ostoja's work. [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] commissioned Ostoja to build a 'chromasonic" exhibit for the [[Expo '70]] in Osaka.

'''1970'''

Ostoja presented an Australian Aboriginal [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]] theme in his "Sound and Image" theatre, working with leading contemporary figures in poetry, music and dance. This was the first production of its kind in Australia, and appeared after the Festival in Melbourne, Sydney, Canberra and Perth. Ostoja's "Space Scape" mural, sixty feet long by ten feet high, won the Australia wide competition for a mural for Adelaide Airport. His {{convert|120|ft|m}} high 'light and sound' structure for the Adelaide Festival was the first of its kind in the world.

'''1971'''

Ostoja awarded a Creative Arts Fellowship at the Australian National University [[Australian National University]], [[Canberra]]. His 18-month stay resulted in the design and building of a "Chromasonics unit-laser", a {{convert|100|ft|m}} Chromasonic tower, and a world premiere of a "Synchronos" concert.

'''1972'''

With [[Don Burrows]] and [[Don Banks]], Ostoja presented "Synchronos 72", where one could "hear the colours and see the sounds". Ostoja added "Cymatics" developed during the Fellowship to his workshop repertoire. He was invited to exhibit his photography in the National Gallery, Melbourne.

'''1973'''

Ostoja received a Fellowship from the Australian American Education Association to study art and technology in the U.S.A. He studied laser art and technology, using a newly developed material in his optical collages.

'''1974'''

Using several lasers, Ostoja designed sets and a special curtain for the complex work ''[[The Excursions of Mr. Brouček to the Moon and to the 15th Century|The Excursions of Mr. Brouček]]'' by [[Leoš Janáček|Janáček]], the first opera produced at the new Adelaide Festival Theatre complex.

Ostoja created a new Laser Chromasonic Tower, which produced kinetic laser images and incandescent lights, for the Royal Adelaide International Expo 78. Ostoja's experiments with an [[krypton laser|argon]] laser gave rise to a new organic image in his work laser images, including "Astroid" and "Harmonics".

'''1980'''

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] produced a half-hour documentary on Ostoja's work, the program screening on 13 April 1980.

The Governor-General and his wife visited the artist's studio in Stirling. Christopher Hunt, Artistic Director of the 1980 Adelaide Festival of Arts, invited Ostoja to exhibit his laser kinetics in conjunction with a holographic exhibit from the New York Museum.

The show, "Futuresight", in the Melville Hall, Adelaide, was opened by Sir [[Mark Oliphant]].

The magazine ''[[Scientific Australian (1977)|Scientific Australian]]'' published an article on this exhibition in the No.4, Volume 4 Edition.

'''1981–1982'''

Ostoja prepared for an exhibition in Sydney, and became interested artistically in Australian jade. Commissioned by Dr Nina Christensen of Melbourne University to construct a jade window.

Ostoja was involved in part of the 1994 Adelaide Festivals "Technilusions".  He displayed some of his Fractals and Mandelbrots and was displayed with "current" and "state of the art" technologies Animation, Virtual Reality and CD-ROM.

He died at home on 2 April 1994, in the cottage "Arbroath" on the Booth estate at Stirling South Australia, where he had lived under the patronage of the Booth family for over 40 years. His studio was on the same property.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">This is a '''list of musicology topics'''. [[Musicology]] is the scholarly study of [[music]]. A person who studies music is a musicologist. The word is used in narrow, intermediate and broad senses. In the narrow sense, musicology is confined to the music history of [[Western culture]]. In the intermediate sense, it includes all relevant cultures and a range of musical forms, styles, genres and traditions, but tends to be confined to the [[humanities]] - a combination of historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and the humanities of systematic musicology ([[philosophy]], [[Sociological theory|theoretical sociology]], [[aesthetics]]). In the broad sense, it includes all musically relevant [[Discipline (specialism)|disciplines]] (both humanities and [[science]]s) and all manifestations of music in all [[culture]]s, so it also includes all of systematic musicology (including [[psychology]], [[biology]], and [[computing]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The main components of automobile exhaust are [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and  water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Carbon dioxide is the most important [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) and the most significant [[Greenhouse Gas]] emitted in the U.S. (with 82-84% of all U.S. emissions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html July 1999 SBC Newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427125401/http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html |date=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to [[fossil fuel]] use and [[land-use]] change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], ''{{cite web|url= http://www.20minutos.es/data/adj/2007/02/02/456.pdf |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.20&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}}'' .&lt;/ref&gt;

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission standards can be referred to the [[fuel]] or to the [[vehicle]] :

*The [[European Union]] is moving towards fuel mandatory CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; standards and USA has reflected it in the [[Greenhouse Gas Score]].
*There are information, but no mandatory, standards for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; limits in vehicle (engine) emissions, excepting some state regulations (i.e. California). See [[hybrid vehicles]].

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass emission in vehicles is measured in '''g/km''' (g/[[mile|mi]] * 0.621371192 = g/km).

'''Monoicous''' plants are those species that bear both sperm and eggs on the same [[gametophyte]]. '''Dioicous''' plants are those that have gametophytes that produce only sperm or eggs but never both.&lt;ref name=Crandall-Stotler&gt;Crandall-Stotler, B.J. &amp; Bartholomew-Began, S.E. (2007). ''Morphology of Mosses (Phylum Bryophyta)''. In: Flora of North America Editorial Committee, eds. (1993+).  ''Flora of North America North of Mexico''.  16+  vols.  New York and Oxford. Volume 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BellHelmsley&gt;Bell, P.R. &amp; Helmsley, A.R. (2000). ''Green plants, their origin and diversity'' (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are used largely but not exclusively in the context of [[bryophyte]]s. Both monoicous and dioicous gametophytes produce gametes in gametangia by [[mitosis]] rather than [[meiosis]], so that sperm and eggs are genetically identical with their parent gametophyte. The states of being monoicous or dioicous are called '''monoicy''' and '''dioicy''' respectively.

==Etymology and history==
The word '''monoicous''' and the related forms '''mon(o)ecious''' are derived from the Greek mόνος (''mónos''), ''single'', and οἶκος (''oîkos'') or οἰκία (''oikía''), ''house''.  The words '''dioicous''' and '''di(o)ecious''' are derived from οἶκος or οἰκία and δι- (di-), twice, double. (''(o)e'' is [[Iotacism|the Latin way of transliterating Greek οι]], whereas ''oi'' is a more straightforward modern way.) Generally, the terms "monoicous" and "dioicous" have been restricted to description of haploid sexuality ([[gametophytic]] sexuality), and are thus used primarily to describe [[bryophytes]] in which the gametophyte is the dominant generation.  Meanwhile, "monoecious" and "dioecious" are used to describe diploid sexuality ([[sporophytic]] sexuality), and thus are used to describe [[tracheophytes]] (vascular plants) in which the [[sporophyte]] is the dominant generation.&lt;ref name=Shaw&amp;Goffinet&gt;Shaw, A. Jonathan &amp; Goffinet, Bernard eds. (2000). ''Bryophyte Biology''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this usage, although precise, is not universal, and "monoecious" and "dioecious" are still used by some bryologists for the gametophyte.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{Harvnb|Taylor|Eppley|Jesson|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bryophyte sexuality==

[[Bryophyte]]s have life cycles that are [[gametophyte]] dominated. The longer lived, more prominent [[autotrophic]] plant is the gametophyte. The sporophyte in mosses and liverworts consists of an unbranched stalk (a seta) bearing a single [[sporangium]] or spore-producing capsule. Even when capable of photosynthesis, as in mosses and hornworts, bryophyte sporophytes require additional photosynthate from the gametophyte to sustain growth and spore development and are dependent on the gametophyte for their supplies of water, mineral nutrients and nitrogen.&lt;ref name=Thomas1978&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Stanton | first2 = D.S. | last3 = Longendorfer | first3 = D.H. | last4 = Farr | first4 = M.E. | year = 1978 | title = Physiological evaluation of the nutritional autonomy of a hornwort sporophyte | url = | journal = Botanical Gazette | volume = 139 | issue = 3| pages = 306–311 | doi=10.1086/337006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glime2007&gt;Glime, J.M. (2007). ''Bryophyte Ecology''. Vol. 1.  ''Physiological Ecology''. Ebook sponsored by Michigan Technological University and the International Association of Bryologists. Accessed on 4 March 2013 at http://www.bryoecol.mtu.edu/chapters/5-9Sporophyte.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antheridia]] and [[archegonia]] are often clustered. A cluster of antheridia is called an androecium while a cluster of archegonia is called a gynoecium. (Note these terms have a different meaning when used to refer to flower structures.)

Bryophytes have the most elaborate gametophytes of all living land plants, and thus have a wide variety of gametangium positions and developmental patterns.

Gametangia are typically borne on the tips of shoots, but may also be found in the axils of leaves, under thalli or on elaborate structures called gametangiophores.

Bryophyte species may be:

* '''Autoicous''' meaning that androecia and gynoecia are found on the same individual (monoicous) but in distinctly separate locations. If these are on separate branches, the term '''cladautoicous''' can be applied.
* '''Synoicous''' (also called '''androgynous''') bryophytes produce antheridia and archegonia interspersed in the same cluster.
*'''Paroicous''' bryophytes produce antheridia and archegonia in separate clusters in different leaf axils.
* '''Heteroicous''' bryophyte species may be either monoicous or sequentially dioicous depending on environmental conditions.  This condition is also called '''polygamous''' or '''polyoicous'''.

==Role in survival==
There can be both selective advantages and selective disadvantages for organisms that are monoicous or dioicous.  Monoicous bryophytes can easily reproduce sexually, since both sexes can be found on the same organism.  On the other hand, this can lead to inbreeding and reduce genetic variation within populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Taylor |first=P.J. |last2=Eppley |first2=S.M. |last3=Jesson |first3=L.K. |year=2007 |title=Sporophytic inbreeding depression in mosses occurs in a species with separate sexes but not in a species with combined sexes |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=94 |issue=11 |pages=1853–9 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/94/11/1853 |lastauthoramp=yes | doi = 10.3732/ajb.94.11.1853 |pmid=21636380}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dioicous organisms necessarily exchange [[genes]] with other organisms of the species during sexual reproduction, increasing [[zygosity|heterozygosity]] and variability (given a sufficiently large variable mating population).  If isolated, however, organisms may only reproduce asexually, which could present a severe selective disadvantage over time.  Bryophyte sperm dispersal can therefore be key to species longevity, particularly in dioicous species.  While sperm dispersal is typically passive, with sperm dispersing through water, certain species exhibit very active dispersal mechanisms, such as aerial dispersal recently described in the liverwort ''Conocephalum conicum''.&lt;ref name=Shimamuraetal&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shimamura | first1 = Masaki | last2 = Yamaguchi | first2 = Tomio | last3 = Deguchi | first3 = Hironori | year = 2007 | title = Airborne sperm of ''Conocephalum conicum'' (Conocephalaceae)" | url = | journal = Journal of Plant Research | volume = 121 | issue = 1| pages = 69–71 | doi=10.1007/s10265-007-0128-6| pmid = 18058191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|[[Bisphenol A]] found in food and beverage packaging is an obesogen showing up in the bodies of about 95% of the human population.&lt;ref name = "Calafat_2005" /&gt;]]
'''Obesogens''' are foreign [[chemical compound]]s that disrupt normal [[human development (biology)|development]] and balance of [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], which in some cases, can lead to [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="Grün_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16690801"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Begley_2009"/&gt; Obesogens may be functionally defined as chemicals that inappropriately alter lipid [[Homeostasis#Biological|homeostasis]] and fat storage, change metabolic setpoints, disrupt energy balance or modify the regulation of [[appetite]] and [[satiety]] to promote fat accumulation and [[obesity]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner_2010"/&gt;

There are many different proposed mechanisms through which obesogens can interfere with the body's [[adipose tissue]] biology. These mechanisms include alterations in the action of metabolic sensors; dysregulation of [[sex steroid]] synthesis, action or breakdown; changes in the central integration of energy balance including the regulation of appetite and satiety; and reprogramming of metabolic setpoints.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Some of these proposed pathways include inappropriate modulation of [[nuclear receptor]] function which therefore allows the compounds to be classified as [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting chemicals]] that act to mimic hormones in the body, altering the normal homeostasis maintained by the endocrine system.&lt;ref name="Diamanti-Kandarakis_2009"/&gt;

Obesogens have been detected in the body both as a result of intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of [[pharmaceutical drugs]] such as [[diethylstilbestrol]], [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]], and [[thiazolidinedione]] and as a result of unintentional exposure to environmental obesogens such as [[tributyltin]], [[bisphenol A]], [[Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate|diethylhexylphthalate]], and [[perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]].&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The term obesogen was coined in 2006 by Felix Grün and Bruce Blumberg of the [[University of California, Irvine]].&lt;ref name="pmid16690801"/&gt; The topic of this proposed class of chemical compounds and how to counteract their effects is explored at length in the book ''[[The New American Diet]]''. Paula Baillie-Hamilton,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/new-obesity Down To Earth: The new obesity]&lt;/ref&gt; a naturopath in the UK, hypothesized that obesogens make it difficult to [[weight loss|lose weight]] in the ''Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine'' in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibarguchi.ca/teaching-CHEO/Baillie-Hamilton-Chems%20and%20obesity.pdf Chemical Toxins: A Hypothesis to Explain the Global Obesity Epidemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanisms of action ==

There are many ways in which obesogenic drugs and chemicals can disrupt the body's adipose tissue biology. The three main mechanisms of action include
* alterations in the action of metabolic sensors in which obesogens mimic metabolic [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] acting to either block or upregulate [[hormone receptors]]
* dysregulation of sex steroid synthesis, in which they alter the ratio of sex hormones leading to changes in their control of lipid balance
* changes in the central integration of [[energy balance (biology)|energy balance]] including the regulation of appetite and satiety in the brain and the reprogramming of metabolic setpoints.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

=== Metabolic sensors ===

Obesogenic drugs and chemicals have been shown to target transcription regulators found in gene networks that function to control [[intracellular]] lipid homeostasis and proliferation and differentiation on adipocytes. The major group of regulators that is targeted is a group of nuclear hormone receptors known as [[peroxisome proliferator activated receptors]] (PPARα, δ, and γ). These hormone receptors sense a variety of metabolic ligands including lipophilic hormones, dietary fatty acids and their metabolites, and, depending on the varying levels of these ligands, control transcription of genes involved in balancing the changes in lipid balance in the body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; To become active and properly function as metabolic sensors and transcription regulators, the PPAR receptors must [[heterodimerize]] with another receptor known as the 9-cis [[retinoic acid receptor]] (RXR). The RXR receptor itself is the second major target of obesogens next to the PPAR receptors.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The PPARα receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of a lipid, promotes [[peroxisome]] proliferation leading to increased fatty acid β-oxidation.&lt;ref name="Ferré_2004"/&gt; Substances, such a [[xenobiotics]] that target and act as agonists of PPARα, typically act to reduce overall serum concentrations of lipids. In contrast, the PPARγ receptor, when complexed with RXR and activated by the binding of fatty acids or their derivatives, promotes lipid biosynthesis and storage of lipids is favored over fatty acid oxidation. In addition, activation promotes differentiation of [[preadipocytes]] and the conversion of mesenchymal [[progenitor cells]] to preadipocytes in adipose tissues. Substances that target and act as agonists of PPARγ/RXR complex typically act to increase overall serum concentrations of lipids.&lt;ref name="Rosen_1999"/&gt;

Obesogens that target the PPARγ/RXR complex mimic the metabolic ligands and activate the receptor leading to upregulation of lipid accumulation which explains their obesogenic effects. However, in the case of obesogens that target the PPARα/RXR complex, which when stimulated reduces adipose mass and body weight, there are a few explanations as to how they promote obesity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

The ligand binding pockets of PPARs are very large and unspecified, allowing for different [[isoforms]] of the receptor (PPARα, δ, and γ) to be activated by the same agonist ligands or their metabolites. In addition, fatty acid oxidation stimulated by [[PPARα]] requires continuous stimulation while only a single activation event of [[PPARγ]] is required to permanently increase adipocyte differentiation and number.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Therefore, it may be the case that metabolites of PPARα targeting obesogens are also activating PPARγ, providing the single activation event needed to potentially lead to a pro-adipogenic response.&lt;ref name="Hurst_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige_2007"/&gt;

A second explanation points to specific PPARα targeters that have been shown to additionally cause abnormal transcriptional regulation of testicular [[steroidogenesis]] when introduced during fetal development. This abnormal regulation leads to a decreased level of [[androgen]] in the body which, itself, is obesogenic.&lt;ref name="Parks_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarfelt_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Braga-Basaria_2006"/&gt;

Finally, if PPARα activation occurs during critical periods of development, the resulting decrease in lipid concentration in the developing fetus is recognized by the fetal brain as undernourishment. In this case, the developing brain makes what will become permanent changes to the body's metabolic control, leading to long-term upregulation of lipid storage and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Levin_2006"/&gt;

=== Sex steroid dysregulation ===

Sex steroids normally play a significant role in lipid balance in the body. Aided by other peptide hormones such as [[growth hormone]], they act against the lipid accumulation mediated by insulin and cortisol by mobilizing lipid stores that are present. Exposure to obesogens often leads to a deficiency or change in the ratio between androgen and estrogen sex steroid levels, which modifies this method of lipid balance resulting in lowered growth hormone secretion, hypocortisolemia (low levels of circulating cortisol), and increased resistance to insulin effects.&lt;ref name="Bjorntorp_1997"/&gt;

This alteration in sex steroid levels due to obesogens can vary enormously according to both the sex of the exposed individual as well as the timing of the exposure.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; If the chemicals are introduced at critical windows of development, the vulnerability of an individual to their effects is much higher than if exposure occurs later in adulthood. It has been shown that obesogenic effects are apparent in female mice exposed to both phytoestrogens and DES during their neonatal periods of development, as they, though born with a lower birth weight, almost always developed obesity, high leptin levels, and altered glucose response pathways.&lt;ref name="Ruhlen_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt; Both phytoestrogen and DES exposed male mice did not develop obesity and, rather, showed decreased body weights with increased exposure confirming the role of gender differences in exposure response.&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Penza_2006"/&gt; Further studies have shown positive correlations for serum BPA levels with obese females in the human population, along with other xenoestrogen compounds suggesting the parallel roles that these effects may be having on humans.&lt;ref name="Takeuchi_2004"/&gt;

=== Central balance of energy ===

While hormone receptors tend to be the most obvious candidates for targets of obesogens, central mechanisms that balance and regulate the body's nutritional changes on a day-to-day basis as a whole cannot be overlooked. The [[HPA axis]] (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) is involved in controlling appetite and energy homeostasis circuits which are mediated by a large number of monoaminoergic, peptidergic (use of hormones as neurotransmitters), and [[endocannabinoid]] signals that come from the digestive tract, adipose tissues, and from within the brain. It is these types of signals that provide a likely target for obesogens that have shown to have weight altering effects:&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

==== Neuroendocrine effects ====

Neurological disorders may enhance the susceptibility to develop the [[metabolic syndrome]] that includes obesity.&lt;ref name="Casey_2005"/&gt; Many neuropharmaceuticals used to alter behavioral pathways in patients with neurological disorders have shown to have metabolic altering side-effects leading to obesogenic phenotypes as well. These findings give evidence to conclude that an increase in lipid accumulation can result from the targeting of neurotransmitter receptors by foreign chemicals.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; (''See also:'' [[#Central integration of energy balance|section "Central integration of energy balance"]].)

==== Peptidergic hormones ====

Several peptidergic hormone pathways controlling appetite and energy balance —such as those involving [[ghrelin]], [[neuropeptide Y]], and [[agouti-related peptide]] — are particularly sensitive to changes in nuclear receptor signaling pathways and can therefore be easily altered by the introduction of [[endocrine disruptor]]s. Such an alteration can lead to induced feelings of hunger and decreased feelings of fullness causing an increase in food intake and inability to feel satisfied, both characteristic of obesity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Some xenoestrogens such as [[Bisphenol A|BPA]], [[nonylphenol]], and [[DEHP]] have all shown to act is this way, altering [[NPY]] expression and significantly shifting the feeding behaviors of exposed mice.&lt;ref name="Masuo_2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masuo_2004b"/&gt; In addition, [[organotin]]s such as trimethyltin (TMT) triethyltin (TET), and [[tributyltin]] (TBT) compounds can exert their effects through similar pathways. TBT can locally disrupt [[aromatase]] regulation in the [[hypothalamus]] causing the responses of the HPA axis to hormones to become abnormal. TMT works in a similar but unique way, inducing [[NPY]] and NPY2 receptor expression initially which later is counteracted by neuronal degeneration in lesions causing decrease in signaling ability.&lt;ref name="Ishikura_2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sadamatsu_1998"/&gt;

While an increase in food intake is often the case after exposure, weight gain involves the body's maintenance of its metabolic setpoint as well. Given this information, it is particularly important to note that exposure during development and initial programming of these setpoints can be extremely significant throughout the remainder of life.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

==== Endocannabinoid signaling ====

A wide range of environmental organotins that mimic petidergic hormones in the HPA axis as mentioned before, additionally mimic lipid activators of the [[cannabinoid]] system and inhibit [[AMP-activated protein kinase|AMPK]] activity.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Endocannaboid levels are high in those suffering from obesity due to hyperactivity of cannaboid signalling pathways. It is these high levels that have been found to be closely associated with increased fat stores linking the lipid activator mimics to the actual disease.&lt;ref name="Engeli_2005"/&gt;

==== Programming of metabolic set points ====

Regions in the [[hypothalamus]] control the responses that establish an individuals metabolic setpoint and metabolic efficiency. These responses are adaptive in that they vary according to the individual's needs, always working to restore the metabolic setpoint through the increase or decrease of metabolic functions depending on varying energy needs. Since it is adapted, it is expected that it would be able to achieve equilibrium if the lipid balance was altered by hormones via the mechanisms mentioned above. However, since obesogenic phenotypes persist, it can be concluded that adaptive response components of the hypothalamus may be a target of obesogens as well.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

A person's body composition is very much predetermined before birth and changes rarely occur in adulthood. Adipocyte numbers increase during development and come to a plateau over time. After the plateau adipocytes become restricted to mostly [[hypertrophic]] growth and don't seem to change much in terms of cell number. This is demonstrated by the difficulty in altering [[somatotypes]] or more simply by the difficulty that goes along with trying to lose weight past a certain point.&lt;ref name="Janesick_2011"/&gt;

A particular study on [[PBDEs]], a commonly used chemical in flame retardants, made its role in altering the functions of the [[thyroid]] hormone axis apparent.&lt;ref name="Ellis-Hutchings_2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuriyama_2007"/&gt; This finding leads to increased concern as neonatal thyroid status plays a large role in the integration of maternal environmental signals during development in the womb that is used for long-term body weight programming.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

== Pharmaceutical obesogens ==

Obesogens detection in the body and resulting obesogenic effects can result as side effects from intentional administration of obesogenic chemicals in the form of pharmaceutical drugs. These pharmaceutical obesogens can show their effects through a variety of targets.

=== Metabolic sensors ===

[[Thiazolidinediones]] (TZD), [[rosiglitazone]], and [[pioglitazone]] are all used to treat [[diabetes]]. These drugs act as agonists of the PPAR-γ receptor leading to [[insulin]] sensitizing effects that can improve [[glycemic]] control and serum [[triglyceride]] levels.&lt;ref name="Goldberg_2007"/&gt; Despite the positive effects these chemicals can have in treating diabetes patients, administration also lead to unwanted PPAR-γ mediated side effects such as peripheral [[edema]] which can be followed by persistent weight gain if the drug is used over a long period of time. These side effects are particularly prominent in diabetes 2 patients, a disease that tends to result from an overabundance of adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="Larsen_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubenstrunk_2007"/&gt;

=== Sex steroid dysregulation ===

[[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]] is a synthetic estrogen that was once prescribed to women to decrease the risk of miscarriage until it was found to be causing abnormalities in exposed offspring. This same chemical has been shown to cause weight gain in female mice when exposed during neonatal development. While exposure didn't lead to an abnormal birth weight, significant weight gain occurred much later in adulthood.&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newbold_2007b"/&gt;

=== Central integration of energy balance ===

[[SSRI]] (e.g. [[paroxetine]]), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (e.g. [[amitriptyline]]), [[tetracyclic antidepressants]] (e.g. [[mirtazapine]]) and atypical [[antipsychotics]] (e.g. [[clozapine]]) are all neuropharmaceuticals that target neurotransmitter receptors that are involved with brain circuits that regulate behavior. Often the function of these receptors overlaps with metabolism regulation, such as that of the [[Histamine H1 receptor|H1 receptor]] which when activated decreases AMPK activity.&lt;ref name="Kim_2007"/&gt; As a result, the administration of these drugs can have side effects including increased lipid accumulation that can result in obesity.

=== Metabolic setpoints ===

The mechanisms behind SSRI, tricyclic antidepressants, and atypical antipsychotics function allow them all to have potential roles in the alteration of metabolic setpoints. TZD, in particular has been linked to regulatory function in the HPT axis, however, no conclusive evidence has been determined thus far and further research is required to confirm these hypotheses.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

== Environmental obesogens ==

While obesogens can be introduced to the body intentionally via administration of obesogenic pharmaceuticals, exposure can also occur through chemical exposure to obesogens found in the environment such as organotins and xenobiotics.

=== Organotins ===

Particular members of the organotin class of [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs), namely [[tributyltin]] (TBT) and [[Triphenyltin compounds|triphenyltin]] (TPT) are highly selective and act as very potent agonists of both the retinoid X receptors (RXR α,β, and γ) and PPARγ.&lt;ref name="Kanayama_2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2006b"/&gt; This ability to target both receptors at the same time, is more effective than single receptor activation, as  adopogenic signaling can be mediated through both components of the heterodimer complex. This highly effective activation mechanism can pose detrimental, long-term adipogenic effects especially if exposure occurs during development and early life.

[[Organotin chemistry|Organotins]] (tin-based chemicals), used in marine anti-fouling paints, wood catalysts, plasticizers, slimicides, in industrial water systems, and fungicides on food have recently been linked to obesogenic properties when introduced in the body.&lt;ref name="Nath_2008"/&gt; Human exposure to these major environmental sources most commonly occurs through ingestion of contaminated seafood, agricultural products, and drinking water as well as from exposure to leaching from plastics.&lt;ref name="Tsuda_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerin_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ohno_2002"/&gt;

Although studies that have directly measured organotin levels in human tissue and blood are limited, it has been determined that vulnerability of a portion of the general population to organotin exposure at levels high enough to activate RXRs and PPARγ receptors is very probable. The high usage of organotins in both plastics and agricultural maintenance as well as the high affinity of the chemicals further confirms this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Liver samples from the late 1990s in Europe and Asia contained on average 6 and 84&amp;nbsp;ng/g wet wt respectively for total organotin levels, while later studies found levels of total organotins in US blood samples averaged around 21&amp;nbsp;ng/mL with TBT comprising around 8&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (~ 27 nM).&lt;ref name="Kanaan_1999"/&gt; Even more recent analyses of European blood samples found the predominant species to be TPT rather than TBT at 0.09 and 0.67&amp;nbsp;ng/mL (~0.5-2 nM). Only occasional trace amounts of TBT were found.&lt;ref name="Rantakokko_2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lo_2003"/&gt; These results indicate that organtin exposure to humans, while found to be present among many different populations, can vary in terms of type of organatin and level of exposure from region to region.

=== Other xenobiotics ===

Other common [[xenobiotics]] found in the environment have been shown to have PPAR activity, posing even further threats to dysregulated metabolic balance. [[Bisphenol A|BPA]] from [[polycarbonate]] plastics, [[phthalate]] plasticizers used to soften PVC plastics, and various perfluoroalkyll compounds (PFCs) that are widely used surfactants and surface repellents in consumer products are all potentially obesogenic when introduced in the body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt; Phthalates and PFCs in particular have been found to function as agonists for one or more of the PPARs &lt;ref name="Bell_1982"/&gt; Additionally, metabolites of DHEP such as MEHP also activate PPARγ leading to a proadipogenic response.&lt;ref name="Hurst_2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feige_2007"/&gt;

==Public health implications==

Although research on endocrine disruptors or "obesogens" is still emerging, the public health implications so far have mainly surrounded obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Obesity has [[Epidemiology of obesity|become a global epidemic]], increasing for all population groups. From 1980 to 2008, the rates of obesity have doubled for adults and [[Epidemiology of childhood obesity|tripled for children]].&lt;ref name="urlObesity and Overweight for Professionals: Data and Statistics: Facts - DNPAO - CDC"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/facts.html | title = Obesity and Overweight for Professionals: Data and Statistics: Facts - DNPAO - CDC | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date =  | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. alone, it has been estimated that almost 100 million individuals in are obese&lt;ref name="pmid9813653"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults--The Evidence Report. National Institutes of Health | journal = Obesity Research | volume = 6 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 51S–209S | date = Sep 1998 | pmid = 9813653 | doi =  | url = http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/obesity/ob_gdlns.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional thinking suggested that diet and exercise alone were the main contributors to obesity; however, current experimental evidence shows that obesogens might be part of the cause.

The chronic burden of obesity doesn't stop with weight gain. It can also lead to potentially debilitating chronic diseases such as diabetes, and certain environmental exposures, or obesogens, have been directly linked to Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM).&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt; An estimated 25.8 million people, or 8.3% of the population in the US, have diabetes, and the crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased by 176%, from 1980 through 2010.&lt;ref name="urlCDC - 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet - Publications - Diabetes DDT"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/factsheet11.htm | title = CDC - 2011 National Diabetes Fact Sheet - Publications - Diabetes DDT | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease and economic burden of diabetes, which is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States costing approximately $174 billion annually, is being addressed by organizations such as Healthy People 2020 which has diabetes listed as one of their 42 objectives.&lt;ref name="urlwww.cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/statistics/prev/national/figage.htm | title = Crude and Age-Adjusted Percentage of Civilian, Noninstitutionalized Population with Diagnosed Diabetes, United States, 1980–2010 | author = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date =  | work = | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, diabetes is a major obstacle to overcome especially when obesogens might be the uncontrolled, unsuspected cause.

=== Potential obesogens in everyday life ===
Obesogens can be found everywhere, from water bottles to microwaveable popcorn, and from nonstick pans to shower curtains. People interact with them on a daily basis, both intentionally and unintentionally, at work, school and home. They are an unnecessary and mostly preventable potential hazard to health, which can have a large impact on how individuals gain and lose weight.

[[Bisphenol-A]] (BPA) is an industrial chemical and organic compound that has been used in the production of plastics and resins for over a half-century. It is used in products such as toys, medical devices, plastic food and beverage containers, shower curtains, dental sealants and compounds, and register receipts.&lt;ref name="pmid20517192"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zeratsky K | title = What are the health concerns about BPA? | journal = Mayo Clinic Women's Healthsource | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 8 | date = Jul 2010 | pmid = 20517192 | doi =  | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bpa/AN01955 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  BPA has been shown to seep into food sources from containers or into the body just by handling products made from it. Certain researchers suggest that BPA actually decreases the fat cell count in the body, but at the same time increasing the size of the ones remaining; therefore, no difference in weight is shown, and an individual is even likely to gain more.&lt;ref name="pmid22249005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vom Saal FS, Nagel SC, Coe BL, Angle BM, Taylor JA | title = The estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) and obesity | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 354 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 74–84 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22249005 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2012.01.001 | pmc=3306519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS) is found in many food products on grocery store shelves: by 2004, for example, it accounted for 40% of caloric sweeteners added to foods and beverages sold in the United States, and was the only caloric sweetener used in soft drinks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Bray | first = GA |author2=Nielsen SJ |author3=Popkin BM | title = Consumption of high-fructose corn syrup in beverages may play a role in the epidemic of obesity | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 537–543 |  url = http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/79/4/537 | pmid = 15051594 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a food and drink sweetener and is an obesogen. Acting on insulin and leptin in the body, HFCS potentially increases appetite and fat production.&lt;ref name="pmid22034869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stanhope KL | title = Role of fructose-containing sugars in the epidemics of obesity and metabolic syndrome | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 63 | issue =  | pages = 329–43 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22034869 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-042010-113026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicotine]] is the chemical found in tobacco products and certain insecticides. As an obesogen, nicotine mostly acts on prenatal development after [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal smoking]] occurs. A strong association has been made between maternal smoking and childhood overweight/obesity, with nicotine as the single causal agent.&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt;

[[Arsenic]] is a [[metalloid]] (''i.e.'', an element with some metallic properties) found in and on most naturally occurring substances on Earth. It can be found in the soil, ground water, air, and in small concentrations in food. Arsenic has many applications such as in the production of insecticides, herbicides, pesticides and electronic devices.&lt;ref name="epa_arsenic"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.epa.gov/teach/chem_summ/Arsenic_summary.pdf | title = Inorganic Arsenic | author = | date = 2007-08-01 | format = pdf | work = TEACH Chemical Summary | publisher = United States Environmental Protection Agency | pages = 20  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21864395"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Del Razo LM, García-Vargas GG, Valenzuela OL, Castellanos EH, Sánchez-Peña LC, Currier JM, Drobná Z, Loomis D, Stýblo M | title = Exposure to arsenic in drinking water is associated with increased prevalence of diabetes: a cross-sectional study in the Zimapán and Lagunera regions in Mexico | journal = Environmental Health | volume = 10 | issue =  | pages = 73 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21864395 | pmc = 3169452 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-10-73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of diabetes has been linked to arsenic exposure from drinking water and occupational contact.

[[Pesticides]] are substances used to prevent, destroy, repel or mitigate pests, and they have been used throughout all of recorded history. Some pesticides persist for short periods of time and some for long periods of time which are considered [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs). Several cross-sectional studies have shown pesticides as obesogens, linking them to obesity, diabetes and other morbidities.&lt;ref name="Thayer_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22372998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lind L, Lind PM | title = Can persistent organic pollutants and plastic-associated chemicals cause cardiovascular disease? | journal = Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 271 | issue = 6 | pages = 537–53 | date = Jun 2012 | pmid = 22372998 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2012.02536.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical drugs are also potentially obesogens. From 2005-2008, 11% of Americans aged 12 and over took antidepressant medications.&lt;ref name="pmid22617183"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pratt LA, Brody DJ, Gu Q | title = Antidepressant use in persons aged 12 and over: United States, 2005-2008 | journal = NCHS Data Brief | volume =  | issue = 76 | pages = 1–8 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 22617183 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain antidepressants, known as [[SSRI|selectively serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), are potentially adding to the almost 100 million obese individuals in the U.S.&lt;ref name="pmid9813653"/&gt; A key function of SSRI antidepressants is to regulate serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) which can affect food intake and lipid accumulation leading to obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid22412882"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen X, Margolis KJ, Gershon MD, Schwartz GJ, Sze JY | title = Reduced serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) function causes insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis independent of food intake | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e32511 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22412882 | pmc = 3297606 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0032511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Organotins]] such as [[tributyltin]] (TBT) and [[triphenyltin]] (TPT) are [[endocrine disruptors]] that have been shown to increase triglyceride storage in [[adipocytes]]. Although they have been widely used in the marine industry since the 1960s, other common sources of human exposure include contaminated seafood and shellfish, fungicides on crops and as antifungal agents used in wood treatments, industrial water systems and textiles. Organotins are also being used in the manufacture of PVC plastics and have been identified in drinking water and food supplies.&lt;ref name="pmid16690801" /&gt;
	
[[Perfluorooctanoic acid|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)]] is a surfactant used for reduction of friction, and it is also used in nonstick cookware. PFOA has been detected in the blood of more than 98% of the general US population.&lt;ref name="pmid22003309"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shankar A, Xiao J, Ducatman A | title = Perfluoroalkyl chemicals and elevated serum uric acid in US adults | journal = Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 3 | issue =  | pages = 251–8 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22003309 | pmc = 3191115 | doi = 10.2147/CLEP.S21677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a potential endocrine disruptor.&lt;ref name="pmid21397692"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White SS, Fenton SE, Hines EP | title = Endocrine disrupting properties of perfluorooctanoic acid | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 127 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 16–26 | date = Oct 2011 | pmid = 21397692 | pmc = 3335904 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.03.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal studies have shown that prenatal exposure to PFOA is linked to obesity when reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="pmid19433254"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hines EP, White SS, Stanko JP, Gibbs-Flournoy EA, Lau C, Fenton SE | title = Phenotypic dichotomy following developmental exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in female CD-1 mice: Low doses induce elevated serum leptin and insulin, and overweight in mid-life | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 304 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 97–105 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19433254 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2009.02.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future research==

Most of the environmental obesogens currently identified are either classified into the category of chemical mimics of metabolic hormones throughout the body or of neurotransmitters within the brain. Because they fall into these two categories, extensive opportunities for complex interactions and varied sites of action as well as multiple molecular targets are open for consideration. Changing dose ranges tend to result in varying phenotypes and timing of exposure, gender, and gender predisposition introduce even more levels of complexity in how these substances effect the human body.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

Because the mechanisms behind the different effects of obesogens are so complex and not well understood, the extent to which they play in the current obesity epidemic may be greater than once thought. [[Epigenetic]] changes due to obesogen exposure must also be considered as a possibility, as they open up the potential for misregulated metabolic functions to be passed on from generation to generation. Epigenetic processes via [[hypermethylation]] of regulatory regions could lead to overexpression of different proteins, and therefore, amplification of acquired environmental effects. Research will be required in order to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of action these chemicals are involved in before the extent of the risk of exposure can be determined and methods of prevention and removal from the environment can be established.&lt;ref name="Grün_2009a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grün_2009b"/&gt;

'''Patient education''' is the process by which [[health professional]]s and others impart information to patients and their caregivers that will alter their health behaviors or improve their health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|title=iv. Patient Education and Counseling for Prevention|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140421064558/http://odphp.osophs.dhhs.gov/pubs/GUIDECPS/text/iv_edu.txt|archivedate=April 21, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Education may be provided by any healthcare professional who has undertaken appropriate training education, education on patient communication and education is usually included in the healthcare professional's training.

[[Health education]] is also a tool used by [[managed care]] plans, and may include both general [[Preventive medicine|preventive]] education or [[health promotion]] and disease or condition specific education.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R. Koongstvedt, "The Managed Health Care Handbook," Fourth Edition, Aspen Publishers, Inc., 2001, page 788 {{ISBN|0-8342-1726-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of patient education are skill building and responsibility: patients need to know when, how, and why they need to make a lifestyle change. Group effort is equally important: each member of the patient’s health care team needs to be involved.It can also help the patients by a better lifestyle, it give them the ability to learn new information. 

The value of patient education can be summarized as follows:
*Improved understanding of medical condition, diagnosis, disease, or disability.
*Improved understanding of methods and means to manage multiple aspects of medical condition.
*Improved self-advocacy in deciding to act both independently from medical providers and in interdependence with them.
*Increased Compliance – Effective communication and patient education increases patient motivation to comply.
*Patient Outcomes – Patients more likely to respond well to their treatment plan – fewer complications.
*Informed Consent – Patients feel you've provided the information they need.
*Utilization – More effective use of medical services – fewer unnecessary phone calls and visits.
*Satisfaction and referrals – Patients more likely to stay with your practice and refer other patients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krames.com Krames Patient Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Risk Management – Lower risk of malpractice when patients have realistic expectations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patient-education.com/?p=editorial&amp;s=xplainresearch&amp;ver=~2 Patient Education Institute, Research evidence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The competencies of a [[health educator]] include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bastable|first=Susan B.|title=Health Professionals as Educator|year=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Barlett Learning, LLC|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Incorporate a personal ethic in regards to social responsibilities and services towards others.
*Provide accurate, competent, and evidence-based care.
*Practice preventative health care.
*Focus on relationship-centered care with individuals and their families.
*Incorporate the multiple determinants of health when providing care.
*Be culturally sensitive and be open to a diverse society.
*Use technology appropriately and effectively.
*Be current in the field and continue to advance education.
There are many areas where patient education can improve the outcomes of treatment.
* For example, in patients with amputations, patient education has been shown to be effective when approached from all angles by the healthcare team (nurse, primary care physician, prosthetist, physical therapist, occupational therapist etc.). Support groups have been shown to be a helpful method for dealing with depression in this population. Preoperative patient education helped patients with their decision making process by informing them of factors related to pain, limb loss, and functional restriction faced after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pantera|first=E.|last2=Pourtier-Piotte|first2=C.|last3=Bensoussan|first3=L.|last4=Coudeyre|first4=E.|title=Patient education after amputation: Systematic review and experts’ opinions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877065714000165|journal=Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=57|issue=3|pages=143–158|doi=10.1016/j.rehab.2014.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the case of arthritis, patient education was found to be administered through three methods, including individual face to face meetings with healthcare professionals, patient groups, online support programs. Category I evidence was found for individual, face to face counseling. Meeting with rheumatologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, nurses, and other healthcare providers was found to be effective in creating adherence to treatment, medication, and for improving  overall patient health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zangi|first=Heidi A.|last2=Ndosi|first2=Mwidimi|last3=Adams|first3=Jo|last4=Andersen|first4=Lena|last5=Bode|first5=Christina|last6=Boström|first6=Carina|last7=Eijk-Hustings|first7=Yvonne van|last8=Gossec|first8=Laure|last9=Korandová|first9=Jana|date=2015-06-01|title=EULAR recommendations for patient education for people with inflammatory arthritis|url=http://ard.bmj.com/content/74/6/954|journal=Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases|language=en|volume=74|issue=6|pages=954–962|doi=10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-206807|issn=1468-2060|pmid=25735643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic bags cause many minor and major ecological and environmental issues. The most general issue with plastic bags is the amount of waste produced. Many plastic bags end up on streets and subsequently pollute major water sources, rivers, and streams.

Even when disposed of properly, they take many years to [[decompose]] and break down, generating large amounts of [[garbage]] over long periods of time. If not disposed of properly the bags can pollute [[waterways]], clog [[Sewerage|sewers]] and have been found in oceans affecting the [[habitat]] of [[animals]] and [[marine creatures]].&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt;

Two primary kinds of direct damage to wildlife are entanglement and ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/marinelitter/publications/docs/trash_that_kills.pdf|title=Marine litter – trash that kills|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildlife animals or birds can become entangled. When the animals or birds are entangled they drown or cannot fly due to entanglement.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plasticwastesolutions.com/plastic-litter/#Plastic%20Waste%20and%20Wildlife|title=Plastic Waste and Wildlife|website=Plastic Waste Solutions|accessdate=1 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic bags are often [[ingested]] by animals because they cannot distinguish whether it is food or not. As a result, it clogs their intestines which results in death by starvation.&lt;ref name="Plastic Waste and Wildlife"/&gt; Plastic bags can block drains, trap birds and kill livestock. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] has estimated that over 100,000 whales, seals, and turtles die every year{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} as a result of eating or being trapped by plastic bags. In India, an estimated number of 20 cows die per day as a result of ingesting plastic bags and having their digestive systems clogged by the bags. It is also very common across Africa to have sewers and drain systems clogged by bags which cause severe cases of malaria due to the increased population of mosquitoes that live on the flooded sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.google.de/search?client=opera&amp;q="Getting+Friendly+Environment"+"The+Dell+Challenge"&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8|title=Getting Friendly Environment|publisher=The Dell Challenge|accessdate=28 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "white pollution" has been coined in China to describe the local and global effects of discarded plastic bags upon the environment.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Watts|first1=Jonathan|title=China's biggest plastic bag maker closes after ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/27/china.plasticbags|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=12 October 2015|date=27 February 2008|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lightweight plastic bags are also blown into trees and other plants and can be mistaken for flowers by animals affecting their diet. Plastic bags break down, but they never biodegrade. As a result, any toxic additives they contain—including flame retardants, antimicrobials, and plasticizers—will be released into the environment. Many of those toxins directly affect the endocrine systems of organisms, which control almost every cell in the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kiener|first=Robert|title=Plastic Pollution|journal=CQ Global Researcher|date=1 July 2010|pages=157–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Research shows the average operating "lifespan" of a plastic bag to be approximately 20 minutes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Plastic bags can last in landfill – an anaerobic environment – for up to 1000 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The plastic bags that get dumped in the Pacific Ocean would all eventually end up in the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]. 80% of the plastic waste comes from land while the rest of the 20% comes from oil platforms and ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts|url=http://garbagepatch.net/greatpacificoceangarbagepatchfacts/|website=Garbage Patch – The Great Pacific Garbage Patch and other pollution issues|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large amount of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean could be eaten up by marine animals, and this will end up blocking up their breathing passages and digestive systems. Plastic bags not only stay in the Great Pacific garbage patch, they can be washed back up to shore in beaches around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garces|first1=Diego|title=A staggering amount of waste – much of which has only existed for the past 60 years or so – enters the oceans each year.|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/problems/pollution/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Somalia ====

Plastic bags were banned in the self-declared Republic of Somaliland on 1 March 2005 after a 120-day grace period that the government had given to the public to get rid of their stocks. The Ministry of Trade and Industries announced the cabinet decision in a decree titled: "Banning importation, production and use of plastic bags in the country". The bags had been nicknamed "the Hargeysa flower", as many of them ended up being blown around and getting stuck in trees and shrubs, posing a danger to livestock because the animals that feed on the leaves often ingest the bags accidentally. In 2015 the ban was repeated by Presidential Decree No. #JSL/M/XERM/249-3178/042015, again providing for a 120 days grace period to get rid of stocks. To ensure the implementation of the ban, the government constituted enforcement teams in 2016 to conduct special drives which launch probes into business stalls. At least 1000 men and women in uniform deployed into the main markets and shopping malls. The government announced fines against violators who continue selling plastic bags in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report/53210/somalia-somaliland-bans-use-plastic-bags Somaliland bans use of plastic bags], IRIN News, 1 March 2005.

==== South Africa ====
Plastic bags were a major concern in [[South Africa]] before the bag levy was introduced in 2004. The bags were never banned, but a levy was introduced, payable by the plastic bag manufacturer. The thicker plastic bags are levied and although this move initially caused outrage with consumers and an initial decline in volumes, consumers use has continually increased to several billion plastic shopping bags every year. http://www.econrsa.org/papers/p_papers/pp18.pdf  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080404-plastic-bags.html|title=

==== Bangladesh ====
A strict ban was introduced in Bangladesh in 2002 after floods caused by [[littered]] plastic bags submerged two-thirds of the country in water between 1988 and 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltvedmonton.com/top+5/6442656206/story.html|title=Top 5 places with plastic bag bans|date=7 June 2012|author=Nicole Bogart|publisher=Global News|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Plastic bags remain a big problem for sewerage system and waterways.

==== China ====
A total plastic bag ban on ultra thin plastic bags and a fee on plastic bags was introduced in [[China]] on 1 June 2008. This came into effect because of the problems with sewerage and general waste. One 2009 survey suggests that plastic bag use fell between 60 and 80% in Chinese supermarkets, and 40 billion fewer bags were used. However, first hand accounts clearly indicate, the ban has seen limited success, and that the use of plastic bags remains prevalent. Street vendors and smaller stores, which make up a significant portion of retail in China, do not abide by the policy in part due to difficulties of enforcing the ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/3158| title=China's bag ban, one year later| date=10 July 2009| author=Shi Jierui| publisher=China Dialogue| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hong Kong ====
[[Hong Kong]] forbids retailers from giving plastic bags under a certain thickness and for free.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt; A 50 cent plastic bag levy was implemented on 1 April 2015 across Hong Kong. The use of plastic bags dropped 90% after the introduction of the levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://english.cntv.cn/program/newshour/20110601/107359.shtml| title=Plastic bag ban abroad| date=6 January 2011|publisher=China Network Television|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs show that Hong Kong is phasing out the use of plastic bags at a dramatic rate.

==== India ====
In 2002, [[India]] banned the production of plastic bags below 20&amp;nbsp;µm in thickness to prevent plastic bags from clogging of the municipal drainage systems and to prevent the cows of India ingesting plastic bags as they confuse it for food.&lt;ref name="worldbag reduction" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=plastic pollution: cow eating a plastic bag, near the Ganges River, Allahabad, India, 2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/media/136513/A-cow-eating-a-plastic-bag-discarded-by-Hindu-devotees|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, enforcement remains a problem.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has also passed regulation to ban all polythene bags less than 50 microns on 18 March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Thickness of Plastic Carry Bags Increased from 40 to 50 Microns|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=138144|publisher=Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to poor implementation of this regulation, regional authorities(states and municipal corporations), have had to implement their own regulation.

In 2016, the two largest chains of supermarkets in Switzerland, the [[Federation of Migros Cooperatives]] and [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]], announced that they will progressively stop to distribute free plastic bags (at the check-out).&lt;ref name=Guillaume&gt;{{fr}} Michel Guillaume, "L'économie suisse promet de verdir", ''[[Le temps]]'', Monday 26 September 2016, page 4.

[[Migros]] previously tested the measure in the [[Canton of Vaud]] since 2013: they reduced the number of plastic bags distributed by ninety percent (and saved 100,000 [[Swiss francs|francs]] per year).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{fr}} Michael West, "Environnement. « Petits prix pour grands effets »", ''Migros magazine'', number 39, 29 September 2016, page 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Migros will be the first to introduce the measure across the country, on 1 November 2016 (the bags will be made with recycled plastic and cost 0.05 [[Swiss francs]] each).&lt;ref name=Guillaume/&gt;&lt;ref name=West/&gt; [[Coop (Switzerland)|Coop]] plans to introduce this in 2017.&lt;ref name=RTS&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.rts.ch/info/economie/8036213-chez-coop-et-migros-les-sacs-jetables-vont-desormais-couter-5-centimes.html "Chez Coop et Migros, les sacs jetables vont désormais coûter 5 centimes"], [[Radio télévision suisse]], 22 September 2016 (page visited on 25 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Climate Change Act 2008]] served as the legislative framework for the regulation of plastic bags in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Everett|first=Michael|last2=Priestley|first2=Sara|title=The 5p Plastic Bag Charge|url=http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7241#fullreport|date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Wales=====
Wales introduced a legal minimum charge of 5 pence for almost all single use bags in October 2011. Paper and biodegradable bags are included in the charge as well as plastic bags, with only a few specific exemptions – such as for unpackaged food or medicine supplied on an [[NHS Wales|NHS]] prescription.
[[Value added tax|VAT]] raised from the charge is collected by the government. Retailers are asked to pass the rest of the proceeds on to charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retailers|url=http://www.carrierbagchargewales.gov.uk/retailers/?lang=en|work=Carrier bag charge Wales|publisher=Crown|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; July 2012 statistics released by the Welsh Government suggested that carrier bag use in Wales had reduced 96% since the introduction of the charge.&lt;ref name="bigfatbags.co.uk"/&gt;

=====Northern Ireland=====
[[Northern Ireland]] introduced a 5 pence levy on almost all single use bags on 8 April 2013. The levy will be extended to reusable carrier bags with a retail price of less than 20 pence from 19 January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Direct Bag Levy|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/baglevy|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland|publisher=NI Direct|date=2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; as data from a number of retailers indicate that reusable bag sales have increased by 800% since the introduction of the levy on single use bags.
The proceeds of the levy (£4.17m in 2013/14) are paid to the Department of the Environment
and used to fund local environmental projects and enforce the levy.
Official statistics for the Northern Ireland levy show that the number of single use bags dispensed fell from around 300 million in 2012/13 to 84.5 million in 2013/14 – a reduction of 72%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NI Bag Levy Annual Statistics 2013/14|url=http://www.doeni.gov.uk/carrier_bag_levy_-_annual_statistics_2013-14.pdf|website=Carrier bag Levy Northern Ireland Statistics|publisher=DOE NI|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the rest of the UK, the English charge does not apply to paper bags or bags made from other natural materials.

'''Notes'''
*{{Smallsup|1}} The City of Fort Collins, Colorado passed a 5¢ fee on single-use bags on 19 August 2014, and repealed it on 21 October 2014.
*{{Smallsup|2}} Although the state of Hawaii does not ban plastic bags, all of its local jurisdictions do, effectively banning them statewide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens Group Pushes City Council to Repeal Disposable Shopping Bag Fee|url=http://fighttheplasticbagban.com/2014/10/23/citizens-group-pushes-city-council-to-repeal-disposable-shopping-bag-fee/#more-2535|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 3, 2018, the City of Austin announced that it would end enforcement of its bag ban. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Austin to end its bag ban after Texas Supreme Court ruling|url=https://www.texastribune.org/2018/07/03/report-austin-end-its-bag-ban-after-texas-supreme-court-ruling/|accessdate=9 August 2018|date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Californians voted in November 2016 to approve state legislation banning plastic bags statewide in Propositions [[California Proposition 67 (2016)|67]] and [[California Proposition 65 (2016)|65]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13551320/science-issues-election-2016-measures-climate-energy-health-marijuana|title=10 science issues at stake in the 2016 election|first=Alessandra|last=Potenza|date=7 November 2016|publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 local laws with similar or tougher regulations will remain and supersede the statewide legislation.

{{main|Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags in Australia}}
Although the nation does not ban lightweight bags, the states of [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], and the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[Northern Territory]], along with some cities have independently banned the bag.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Coles Bay, Tasmania]] was the first location in Australia to ban the bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2003-04-29-tasmania-carries-ecofight-bans-plastic-bags| title=Tasmania carries eco-fight, bans plastic bags| date=29 April 2003| publisher= Mail &amp; Guardian| accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the "Zero Waste" program in South Australia led to its lightweight bag ban in October 2008. It is estimated that 400 million bags are saved each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerowaste.sa.gov.au/plastic|title=Plastic Bag Ban|date=28 February 2011|publisher=Zero Waste South Australia|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western Australia and Queensland banned them on 1 July 2018 and Victoria has announced it will introduce a ban in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/costs/new-laws-and-changes-that-will-affect-australia-from-january-1-2018-and-beyond/news-story/85825f4092834190a292a828aacb7c3d|title=New laws that will affect Australia|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-06/plastic-bags-banned-in-queensland-cash-for-cans-and-bottles/8876620|title=Plastic bag ban gets green light in Queensland|date=6 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/news/victoria-set-to-ban-plastic-bags-next-year|title=Victoria set to ban plastic bags next year|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], 6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] HDPE bags were used in 2002.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt; Usage reduced to 5.6 billion in 2004,&lt;ref name="bag problems" /&gt; and 3.9 billion in 2007.&lt;ref name="plastic bags AU" /&gt;

In 2018, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour government]] pledged to phase out single-use plastic bags within a year's time. New Zealand is one of the highest producers of urban waste in the developed world, per capita, according to OECD data. Prime Minister [[Jacinda Ardern]] and Associate Environment Minister [[Eugenie Sage]] made the announcement on 10 August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/363798/government-pledges-mandatory-phase-out-of-plastic-bags|title=Government pledges mandatory phase-out of plastic bags|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2018|date=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===

==== Argentina ====

In 2012, the [[Buenos Aires]] [[Buenos Aires City Legislature|city government]] allowed [[supermarkets]] to charge for plastic bags in order to discourage their use, which is said to have reduced their use by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El gobierno porteño anunció que desde 2017 se prohibirán bolsas plásticas en los súper|url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201609/161475-bolsas-plasticas-supermercados-ciudad-gobierno-porteno.html|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the city announced a full ban on the distribution of plastic bags in supermarkets and hypermarkets, commencing 1 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adiós a un clásico: desde 2017, no habrá más bolsas de plástico en los súper porteños|url=http://www.clarin.com/ciudades/Adios-clasico-bolsas-plastico-portenos_0_1643235849.html|website=Clarin|accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polémica por la prohibición de bolsas en los comercios porteños|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1934273-polemica-por-la-prohibicion-de-bolsas-en-los-comercios-portenos|website=La Nacion|accessdate=22 December 2016|date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Colombia ====
[[Colombia]] plans to reduce the use of plastic bags by 80% by the year 2020, and completely eliminate their use by the year 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/colombia-apunta-eliminacion-completa-del-uso-de-bolsas-articulo-601904|title=Colombia apunta a la eliminación completa del uso de bolsas plásticas en 2025|publisher=|date=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 April 2016, the [[Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial Development (Colombia)|Ministry of Environment]] passed a resolution banning plastic bags under 30&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/economia/sectores/desapareceran-las-bolsas-plasticas-en-colombia/16562134|title=Las bolsas plásticas pequeñas tienen los días contados en Colombia – Sectores – El Tiempo|first=Casa Editorial El|last=Tiempo|publisher=|date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 July 2017, the Colombian Government applies a tax of 20 [[Colombian peso|pesos]] per plastic bag, with a planned annual increase of 10 pesos per bag until 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/vida/conozca-los-detalles-sobre-el-impuesto-que-cobrara-las-bolsas-plasticas-en-colombia-104296|title=Abecé de lo que tiene que saber sobre el impuesto a bolsas plásticas|publisher=ElTiempo.com|date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uruguay ====
Legislation banning non-biodegradable bags and applying a charge to biodegradable bags has been passed by the government of Uruguay but is yet to enter into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/senado-aprobo-ley-bolsas-plasticas-trata.html|title=Senado aprobó la ley sobre el uso de bolsas plásticas, ¿de qué se trata?|first=|last=ElPais|publisher=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Different methods of phase-out ==
Two of the most popular methods of phasing out lightweight plastic bags have been outlined above, including both fees and bans. The fee strategy is said to have all of the same results in plastic bag reduction as a plastic bag ban, with the additional benefit of creating a new revenue source.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Lisa |last1=Skumatz |first2=Dana |last2=D'Souza |date=November 2016 |title=Bag ban basics |journal=Plastics Recycling Update |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=16–19 |url=https://resource-recycling.com/plastics/2016/12/08/bag-ban-basics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plastic bag fee method also protects consumer choice, which the ban does not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Recycling of plastic bags can be another method of phase-out. However, a big issue with recycling is that only 5% of plastic bags make it to recycling facilities to begin with.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even when bags are brought to these recycling bins and facilities, they often fly out of these bins or recycling trucks and end up as litter on the streets.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Momentum for Plastic Bag Bans Spreading; Recycling Programs Earn Mixed Reviews |journal=Solid Waste Report |volume=45 |issue=8 |date=April 25, 2014 |pages=5–6 |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/95763387/momentum-plastic-bag-bans-spreading-recycling-programs-earn-mixed-reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue with recycling is that different bags are made from different yet aesthetically similar types of plastics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bags can be either made of bioplastics or biodegradable plastics, and if accidentally combined in a compost, the bioplastics could contaminate the biodegradable composting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These bags can also jam recycling equipment when mixed with other types of plastic, which can be costly to repair.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Costs of repairs rounded out to be about $1 million per year in San Jose, California.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Individuals can also engage in advocacy local officials and local merchants. With the rise in eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;https://travel.usnews.com/features/why-ecotourism-is-booming&lt;/ref&gt; and green travel, there are many opportunities to say no to plastic &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://theluckystraw.com/blogs/news/9-popular-languages-say-no-thank-you-to-single-use-plastics | title=Say "No to Plastic" in 9 Languages}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Physical geography''' (also known as '''geosystems''' or '''physiography''') is one of the two major sub-fields of [[geography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/1b.html Fundamentals of Physical Geography, 2nd Edition, by M. Pidwirny, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Geography|first1=Michael |last1=Pidwirny |first2=Scott |last2=Jones|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net|year=1999–2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Physical Geography: Great Systems and Global Environments |first1=William M. |last1=Marsh |first2=Martin M.|last2=Kaufman |publisher=Cambridege University Press |year=2013 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uF3aJSC20yMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=physical+geography+system#v=onepage&amp;q=physical%20geography%20system&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521764285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical geography is that branch of [[natural science]] which deals with the study of processes and patterns in the [[natural environment]] like the [[atmosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], [[biosphere]], and [[geosphere]], as opposed to the cultural or [[built environment]], the domain of [[human geography]].

==Sub-branches==
[[Image:Delicate Arch LaSalle.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A [[natural arch]].]]
Physical Geography can be divided into several sub-fields, as follows:

* '''[[Geomorphology]]''' is the field concerned with understanding the [[lithosphere|surface]] of the Earth and the processes by which it is shaped, both at the present as well as in the past. Geomorphology as a field has several sub-fields that deal with the specific landforms of various environments e.g. [[desert]] geomorphology and [[fluvial]] geomorphology; however, these sub-fields are united by the core processes which cause them, mainly tectonic or climatic processes. Geomorphology seeks to understand [[landform]] history and dynamics, and predict future changes through a combination of field observation, physical experiment, and numerical modeling ([[Geomorphometry]]). Early studies in geomorphology are the foundation for pedology, one of two main branches of [[soil science]]

[[Image:Meander-en.svg|thumb|right|100px|[[Meander]] formation.]]

* '''[[Hydrology]]''' is predominantly concerned with the amounts and quality of water moving and accumulating on the land surface and in the soils and rocks near the surface and is typified by the [[hydrological cycle]]. Thus the field encompasses water in [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, [[aquifer]]s and to an extent [[glacier]]s, in which the field examines the process and dynamics involved in these bodies of water. Hydrology has historically had an important connection with [[engineering]] and has thus developed a largely quantitative method in its research; however, it does have an [[earth science]] side that embraces the systems approach. Similar to most fields of physical geography it has sub-fields that examine the specific bodies of water or their interaction with other  spheres e.g. [[limnology]] and [[ecohydrology]].
*'''[[Glaciology]]''' is the study of [[glacier]]s and [[ice sheets]], or more commonly the [[cryosphere]] or [[ice]] and phenomena that involve ice. Glaciology groups the latter (ice sheets) as continental glaciers and the former (glaciers) as alpine glaciers. Although  research in the areas are similar with research undertaken into both the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers, the former tends to be concerned with the interaction of ice sheets with the present climate and the latter with the impact of glaciers on the landscape. Glaciology also has a vast array of sub-fields examining the factors and processes involved in ice sheets and glaciers e.g. [[snow]] hydrology and [[glacial geology]].
* '''[[Biogeography]]''' is the science which deals with geographic patterns of species distribution and the processes that result in these patterns. Biogeography emerged as a field of study as a result of the work of [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], although the field prior to the late twentieth century had largely been viewed as historic in its outlook and descriptive in its approach. The main stimulus for the field since its founding has been that of [[evolution]], [[plate tectonics]] and the theory of island biogeography. The field can largely be divided into five sub-fields: [[island biogeography]], paleobiogeography, [[phylogeography]], [[zoogeography]] and [[phytogeography]]
* '''[[Climatology]]''' is the study of the [[climate]], scientifically defined as weather conditions averaged over a long period of time. Climatology examines both the nature of micro (local) and macro (global) climates and the natural and [[wiktionary:anthropogenic|anthropogenic]] influences on them. The field is also sub-divided largely into the climates of various regions and the study of specific phenomena or time periods e.g. [[tropical cyclone rainfall climatology]] and [[paleoclimatology]].
* '''[[Meteorology]]''' is the interdisciplinary scientific study of the atmosphere that focuses on weather processes and short term forecasting (in contrast with climatology). Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the eighteenth century. Meteorological phenomena are observable weather events which illuminate and are explained by the science of meteorology.
* '''[[Pedology (soil study)|Pedology]]''' is the study of soils in their natural environment. It is one of two main branches of [[soil science]], the other being [[edaphology]]. Pedology mainly deals with [[pedogenesis]], [[soil morphology]], [[soil classification]]. In physical geography pedology is largely studied due to the numerous interactions between climate (water, air, temperature), soil life (micro-organisms, plants, animals), the mineral materials within soils ([[biogeochemical cycles]]) and its position and effects on the landscape such as [[Tropical rainforest#Characteristics|lateralization]].
* '''[[Palaeogeography]]''' is a cross-disciplinary study that examines the preserved material in the stratigraphic record to determine the distribution of the continents through geologic time.  Almost all the evidence for the positions of the continents comes from [[geology]] in the form of [[fossil]]s or [[paleomagnetism]].  The use of this data has resulted in evidence for [[continental drift]], [[plate tectonics]], and [[supercontinents]].  This, in turn, has supported palaeogeographic theories such as the [[Wilson cycle]].
* '''[[Coastal geography]]''' is the study of the dynamic interface between the ocean and the land, incorporating both the physical geography (i.e. coastal geomorphology, geology, and oceanography) and the human geography of the coast. It involves an understanding of coastal [[weathering]] processes, particularly wave action, sediment movement and weathering, and also the ways in which humans interact with the coast. Coastal geography, although predominantly geomorphological in its research, is not just concerned with coastal landforms, but also the causes and influences of [[sea level change]].
* '''[[Oceanography]]''' is the branch of physical geography that studies the Earth's oceans and seas. It covers a wide range of topics, including marine organisms and ecosystem dynamics ([[biological oceanography]]); ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics ([[physical oceanography]]); plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor ([[geological oceanography]]); and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries ([[chemical oceanography]]). These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it.
* '''[[Quaternary science]]''' is an inter-disciplinary field of study focusing on the [[Quaternary]] period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years. The field studies the last ice age and the recent [[interstadial]] the [[Holocene]] and uses proxy evidence to reconstruct the past environments during this period to infer the climatic and environmental changes that have occurred.
* '''[[Landscape ecology]]''' is a sub-discipline of [[ecology]] and geography that address how spatial variation in the landscape affects ecological processes such as the distribution and flow of energy, materials and individuals in the environment (which, in turn, may influence the distribution of landscape "elements" themselves such as hedgerows). The field was largely founded by the German geographer [[Carl Troll]]. Landscape ecology typically deals with problems in an applied and holistic context. The main difference between biogeography and landscape ecology is that the latter is concerned with how flows or energy and material are changed and their impacts on the landscape whereas the former is concerned with the spatial patterns of species and chemical cycles.
* '''[[Geomatics]]''' is the field of gathering, storing, processing, and delivering geographic information, or spatially referenced information.  Geomatics includes geodesy (scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth, its gravitational field, and other geodynamic phenomena, such as crustal motion, oceanic tides, and polar motion), [[Geographic information science|geographical information science (GIS)]] and [[remote sensing]] (the short or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing devices that are not in physical or intimate contact with the object).
* '''[[Environmental geography]]''' is a branch of geography that analyzes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world. The branch bridges the divide between human and physical geography and thus requires an understanding of the dynamics of geology, meteorology, hydrology, biogeography, and geomorphology, as well as the ways in which human societies conceptualize the environment. Although the branch was previously more visible in research than at present with theories such as [[environmental determinism]] linking society with the environment. It has largely become the domain of the study of environmental management or anthropogenic influences.

==Journals and literature==
Physical geography and earth science journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions. Most journals cover a specific field and publish the research within that field, however unlike human geographers, physical geographers tend to publish in inter-disciplinary journals rather than predominantly geography journal; the research is normally expressed in the form of a [[scientific paper]]. Additionally, textbooks, books, and magazines on geography communicate research to laypeople, although these tend to focus on [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]] or cultural dilemmas. Examples of journals that publish articles from physical geographers are:

==Historical evolution of the discipline==
{{cleanup|section|date=November 2009}}
From the birth of geography as a science during the Greek classical period and until the late nineteenth century with the birth of [[anthropogeography]] (human geography), geography was almost exclusively a natural science: the study of location and descriptive gazetteer of all places of the known world. Several works among the best known during this long period could be cited as an example, from [[Strabo]] (''Geography''), [[Eratosthenes]] (''Geographika'') or Dionisio Periegetes (''Periegesis Oiceumene'') in the Ancient Age to the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (''Kosmos'') in the nineteenth century, in which geography is regarded as a physical and natural science, of course, through the work ''Summa de Geografía'' of [[Martín Fernández de Enciso]] from the early sixteenth century, which indicated for the first time the New World.

During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a controversy exported from geology, between supporters of [[James Hutton]] (uniformitarianism thesis) and [[Georges Cuvier]] (catastrophism) strongly influenced the field of geography, because geography at this time was a natural science since Human Geography or Anthropogeography had just developed as a discipline in the late nineteenth century.

Two historical events during the nineteenth century had a great effect in the further development of physical geography. The first was the European colonial expansion in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Australia]] and even [[United States|America]] in search of raw materials required by industries during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This fostered the creation of geography departments in the universities of the colonial powers and the birth and development of national geographical societies, thus giving rise to the process identified by Horacio Capel as the institutionalization of geography.

One of the most prolific empires in this regard was Russia. In the mid-eighteenth century many geographers were sent by the Russian altamirazgo different opportunities to perform geographical surveys in the area of Arctic [[Siberia]]. Among these is who is considered the patriarch of Russian geography, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. In the mid-1750s Lomonosov began working in the Department of Geography, Academy of Sciences to conduct research in Siberia, their contributions are notable in this regard, showing the soil organic origin and developing a comprehensive law on the movement of the ice that still governs the basics, thereby founding a new branch of geography: glaciology. In 1755 his initiative was founded [[Moscow University]] where he promotes the study of geography and the training of geographers. In 1758 he was appointed director of the Department of Geography, Academy of Sciences, a post from which would develop a working methodology for geographical survey guided by the most important long expeditions and geographical studies in Russia. Thus followed the line of Lomonosov and the contributions of the Russian school became more frequent through his disciples, and in the nineteenth century we have great geographers as [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] who performed works of great importance as a "principle of comprehensive analysis of the territory" and "Russian Chernozem" latter being the most important where introduces the geographical concept of soil, as distinct from a simple geological strata, and thus founding a new geographic area of study: pedology. Climatology also receive a strong boost from the Russian school by [[Wladimir Köppen]] whose main contribution, climate classification, is still valid today. However, this great geographer also contributed to the paleogeography through his work "The climates of the geological past" which is considered the father of [[paleoclimatology]]. Russian geographers who made great contributions to the discipline in this period were: [[NM Sibirtsev]], [[Pyotr Semyonov]], [[Konstantin Glinka|K.D. Glinka]], [[Neustrayev]], among others.

The second important process is the theory of evolution by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] in mid-century (which decisively influenced the work of [[Ratzel]], who had academic training as a zoologist and was a follower of Darwin's ideas) which meant an important impetus in the development of Biogeography.

Another major event in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries will give a major boost to development of geography and will take place in the [[United States]]. It is the work of the famous geographer [[William Morris Davis]] who not only made important contributions to the establishment of discipline in his country, but revolutionized the field to develop [[geographical cycle]] theory which he proposed as a paradigm for geography in general, although in actually served as a paradigm for physical geography. His theory explained that mountains and other landforms are shaped by the influence of a number of factors that are manifested in the geographical cycle. He explained that the cycle begins with the lifting of the relief by geological processes (faults, volcanism, tectonic upheaval, etc.). Geographical factors such as rivers and runoff begins to create the V-shaped valleys between the mountains (the stage called "youth"). During this first stage, the terrain is steeper and more irregular. Over time, the currents can carve wider valleys ("maturity") and then start to wind, towering hills only ("senescence"). Finally, everything comes to what is a plain flat plain at the lowest elevation possible (called "baseline") This plain was called by Davis' "peneplain" meaning "almost plain" Then the rejuvenation occurs and there is another mountain lift and the cycle continues. Although Davis's theory is not entirely accurate, it was absolutely revolutionary and unique in its time and helped to modernize and create geography subfield of geomorphology. Its implications prompted a myriad of research in various branches of physical geography. In the case of the Paleogeography this theory provided a model for understanding the evolution of the landscape. For hydrology, glaciology, and climatology as a boost investigated as studying geographic factors shape the landscape and affect the cycle. The bulk of the work of William Morris Davis led to the development of a new branch of physical geography: Geomorphology whose contents until then did not differ from the rest of geography. Shortly after this branch would present a major development. Some of his disciples made significant contributions to various branches of physical geography such as [[Curtis Marbut]] and his invaluable legacy for Pedology, [[Mark Jefferson (geographer)|Mark Jefferson]], [[Isaiah Bowman]], among others.

The '''President's Medal''' is awarded annually by the [[British Academy]] to up to five individuals or organisations. It is awarded for "outstanding service to the cause of the humanities and social sciences". It cannot be awarded to [[Fellows of the British Academy]] and was created to reward "academic-related activity rather than academic achievement alone". The medals were first awarded in 2010.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Academy President's Medal|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/british-academy-presidents-medal|website=British Academy|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS)''' is a green building certification system developed for the State of [[Qatar]]. The primary objective of Qatar Sustainability Assessment System [QSAS] is to create a sustainable built environment that minimizes ecological impact while addressing the specific regional needs and environment of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taylorwessing.com/sustainability/indices-region.php Hitting the Green Wall | Taylor Wessing LLP]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
QSAS was developed by the [[T.C. Chan Center for Building Simulation and Energy Studies]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in collaboration with and on behalf of the Gulf Organization for Research and Development [GORD].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emirates247.com/eb247/companies-markets/construction/barwa-qatari-diar-tc-chan-sign-deal-2009-04-09-1.96653 Barwa, Qatari Diar, TC Chan sign deal - Emirates 24/7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story/ZAWYA20090408093740/ BARWA and Qatari Diar Develops the first Performance-Based Sustainability Rating System in the Middle East - Zawya]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qatarisbooming.com/2011/04/27/gord-to-establish-qatar-as-middle-east-%E2%80%98capital-of-green-building%E2%80%99/ GORD to establish Qatar as Middle East ‘Capital of Green building’ | Qatar Business &amp; Corporate News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325181837/http://www.qatarisbooming.com/2011/04/27/gord-to-establish-qatar-as-middle-east-%E2%80%98capital-of-green-building%E2%80%99/ |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its deployment in 2009, over 128 buildings in Qatar have been certified through QSAS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-16524-hill-international-mep-expert-calls-qsas-a-success/1/print/ Hill International MEP expert calls QSAS a success]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, QSAS was adopted into the curriculum of the environmental design faculty at King Fahd University and [[Qatar University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emiratesweek.com/2010/12/5520 QSAS to be adopted in the curriculum of the Environment Design Faculty at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals | Emirates Week] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103185024/http://www.emiratesweek.com/2010/12/5520 |date=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, 2011 the State of Qatar integrated QSAS into the Qatar Construction Specifications [QCS] making the implementation of certain criteria mandatory for buildings developed in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-11256-qatar-to-impose-strict-green-standards-from-april/ Qatar to impose strict green standards from April | ConstructionWeekOnline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the rating system took advantage of a comprehensive review of combined best practices employed by a mix of established international and regional rating systems. This review has been performed while taking into consideration the needs that are specific to Qatar’s local environment, culture, and policies. This has led to adaptations and additions to sustainability criteria. Measurements for the rating system are designed to be performance-based and quantifiable. The result is a performance-based sustainable building rating system customized to the unique conditions and requirements of the State of Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emiratesweek.com/2011/05/10560 Gulf Organisation for Research and Development and Qatar Olympic Committee Ink MOU | Emirates Week] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103185027/http://www.emiratesweek.com/2011/05/10560 |date=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating System==
QSAS consists of a series of sustainable categories and criteria, each with a direct impact on environmental stress mitigation. Each category measures a different aspect of the project’s environmental impact. The categories define these broad impacts and address ways in which a project can mitigate the negative environmental effects. These categories are then broken down into specific criteria that measure and define individual issues. These issues range from a thorough review of water consumption to an assessment of light quality. Each criterion specifies a process for measuring individual aspects of environmental impact and for documenting the degree to which the requirements have been met. A score is then awarded to each criterion based on the degree of compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=7&amp;cntnt01returnid=30 Privacy Policy | Green Building Solutions Doha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325181830/http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?mact=News,cntnt01,detail,0&amp;cntnt01articleid=7&amp;cntnt01returnid=30 |date=March 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight categories of QSAS are the following:

'''Urban Connectivity [UC]'''

The Urban Connectivity category consists of factors associated with the urban environment such as zoning, transportation networks and loadings. Loadings on the urban environment include traffic congestion and pollution.

'''Site [S]'''

The Site category consists of factors associated with land use such as land conservation or remediation and site selection, planning and development.

'''Energy [E]'''

The Energy category consists of factors associated with energy demand of buildings, the efficiency of energy delivery, and the use of fossil energy sources that result in harmful emissions.

'''Water [W]'''

The Water category consists of factors associated with water consumption and its associated burden on municipal supply and treatment systems.

'''Materials [M]'''

The Materials category consists of factors associated with material extraction, processing, manufacturing, distribution, use/re-use, and disposal.

'''Indoor Environment [IE]'''

The Indoor Environment category consists of factors associated with indoor environmental quality such as thermal comfort, air quality, acoustic quality, and light quality.

'''Cultural &amp; Economic Value [CE]'''

The Cultural and Economic Value category consists of factors associated with cultural conservation and support of the national economy.

'''Management &amp; Operations [MO]'''

The Management and Operations category consists of factors associated with building design management and operations.

==Rating System Resources==
QSAS consists of several resources used to facilitate the assessment of sustainability performance for buildings in Qatar. Target users for the resources are building planners, developers, owners, designers, engineers and environmentalists. The major resources available to QSAS members include the following:

*	RFP Preparation: A guide to facilitate the preparation of an RFP and Project Brief in the pre-design stages of development
*	Assessment Manuals: Outline the specific measurements, submittals, and scores for each criterion that is assessed for each building type.
*	Design Guidelines: Consist of recommendations to be used as guidance for realizing sustainable buildings in Qatar.
*	Training Manual: Covers the detailed instructions and examples for completing each criterion.
*	Energy Manuals: Documents the application and implementation of the CEN/ISO energy performance standard and all its related standards to all buildings in Qatar.
*	Toolkits: Computational systems provided to facilitate the evaluation of a project's performance under the assessment system. The toolkits compute the final project score and certification level for the project using each criterion score entered by the user.
*	Calculators: Normative measures provided for many criteria to evaluate the project's performance and compute a final criterion score.
*	Project Management System (PMS): Online tool used by project teams to document, upload, and certify their projects in the assessment system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bqdri.org/doc/QSAS%20presentation%20june6%202010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911031926/http://www.bqdri.org/doc/QSAS%20presentation%20june6%202010.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==QSAS Schemes==
QSAS has been developed to rate different building types as well as projects on the Neighborhood scale for each phase of a building’s lifespan. The building schemes that can be rated with QSAS include:

*	Commercial
*	Core &amp; Shell
*	Schools
*	Residential
*	Mosques
*	Hotels
*	Light Industry
*	Sports
*	Neighborhoods

Phases that can be rated using QSAS include:

* Design
* Construction
*Operations: New/Existing Buildings

The various schemes use similar categories and criteria across each system to facilitate use. The measurements, calculations, simulations, scoring ranges, and weights change accordingly for each building type and project phase.

==QSAS Certification==
The aim for all QSAS criteria and their associated measurements is to be performance-based and quantifiable on the scoring scale of -1 to 3 (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3) or 0 to 3, depending on the criterion’s level of impact. Each category and criterion has an associated weight based on its relative environmental, social, and economic impact. Once a score is assigned to each criterion in the assessment system, the values are multiplied by the weight and a cumulative final score is determined. 

QSAS consists of six certification levels to measure the project’s impact. A building that obtains a cumulative final score below 0 does not meet the baseline and will be denied certification. Certification can only be achieved when the final score is greater than or equal to 0, earning a rating of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stars. The highest score a building can achieve is 3.0 and the highest certification level is 6 stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?page=sustainability-award Sustainability Award | Green Building Solutions Doha] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006142005/http://www.greenbuildingsolutionsdoha.com/index.php?page=sustainability-award |date=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional Accreditation==
Professional Accreditation is granted to those qualified individuals who demonstrate in‐depth knowledge of the Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS) and sustainable building practices. The role of the accredited professional or QSAS Certified Green Professional (CGP) is to facilitate the submittal of projects for assessment under QSAS. The candidate must meet the following requirements to receive a QSAS CGP certificate:

* Be a licensed or certified professional
* Attend a QSAS Training Workshop
* Meet or exceed the passing requirement for the QSAS CGP Exam &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menafn.com/menafn/1093258373/Barwa-Qatari-Diar-organise-workshop Barwa, Qatari Diar organise workshop - MENAFN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20090716005494/en QSAS – CERTIFIED GREEN PROFESSIONAL® 3days Training Workshop Ends]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabcommunications.com/pictures/magazine/f4a6c8ab-6e90-43fd-8eeb-ca7e5fb273ba.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411152806/http://www.arabcommunications.com/pictures/magazine/f4a6c8ab-6e90-43fd-8eeb-ca7e5fb273ba.pdf |archivedate=April 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future Development==
The T.C. Chan Center and GORD are currently working on further developing and expanding QSAS to other regions in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/06/qatar-green-rating-qsas/ Qatar’s GSAS Turns Other Rating Systems Green | Green Prophet]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quasi-empirical methods''' are [[methodology|methods]] applied in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] to achieve [[epistemology]] similar to that of [[empiricism]] (thus ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]] + empirical'') when [[experience]] cannot [[falsifiability|falsify]] the ideas involved. [[Empirical research]] relies on [[empirical evidence]], and its empirical methods involve [[experiment]]ation and disclosure of apparatus for [[reproducibility]], by which scientific findings are [[verification and validation|validated]] by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the [[philosophy of science]], but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[ideology]]). Because of such [[empirical limits in science]], the [[scientific method]] must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]]'' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.

It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; [[Bayesian inference]] simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.

One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both [[science]] and [[mathematics]], and do not include experimental method.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s discovery of the [[general relativity]] theory relied upon [[thought experiments]] and [[mathematics]]. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in [[philosophy]], where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  [[Logical positivism]] was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Post-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] is mostly concerned with [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical mathematical methods]], especially as reflected in the actual [[mathematical practice]] of working mathematicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18084">{{Software development process}}
The '''Rational Unified Process''' ('''RUP''') is an [[Iterative and incremental development|iterative]] [[software development process]] framework created by the [[Rational Software]] Corporation, a division of [[IBM]] since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/IBM-Acquires-Rational/ IBM Acquires Rational]&lt;/ref&gt; RUP is not a single concrete prescriptive process, but rather an adaptable process [[Software framework|framework]], intended to be tailored by the development organizations and software project teams that will select the elements of the process that are appropriate for their needs. RUP is a specific implementation of the [[Unified Process]].

== History ==
Rational Software originally developed the rational unified process as a software process product. The product includes a hyperlinked knowledge-base with sample [[Artifact (software development)|artifacts]] and detailed descriptions for many different types of activities. RUP is included in the [[IBM Rational Method Composer]] (RMC) product which allows customization of the process.

[[Philippe Kruchten]], an experienced Rational technical representative was tasked with heading up the original RUP team. This journey began with the creation of the Rational Objectory Process (ROP) in 1996, when Rational acquired the Objectory Process that had been written by [[Ivar Jacobson]] and company. This was renamed Rational Unified Process (RUP) in subsequent releases, in part to align the name with that of the Unified Modeling Language.

These initial versions combined the Rational Software organisation's extensive field experience building object-oriented systems (referred to by Rational field staff as the Rational Approach) with Objectory's guidance on practices such as use cases, and incorporated extensive content from Jim Rumbaugh's [[Object-modeling technique|Object Modeling Technology]] (OMT) approach to modeling, Grady Booch's [[Booch method]], and the newly released [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] 0.8.&lt;ref name='rop-overview'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscn.at/select_newspaper/object/rational.html |title=The Rational Objectory Process - A UML-based Software Engineering Process |accessdate=2014-12-17 |last=Jacobson |first=Sten |date=2002-07-19 |publisher=[[Rational Software Scandinavia AB]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='rup-introduction-history'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=RYCMx6o47pMC&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Rational Unified Process: An Introduction
|pages=33
|accessdate=2014-12-17 |last=Kruchten |first=Philippe |date=2004-05-01 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help make this growing knowledge base more accessible, [[Philippe Kruchten]] was tasked with the assembly of an explicit process framework for modern software engineering. This effort employed the [[HTML]]-based process delivery mechanism developed by Objectory. The resulting "Rational Unified Process" (RUP) completed a strategic tripod for Rational:

* ''tools'' that automated the application of that process
* ''services'' that accelerated adoption of both the process and the tools.

This guidance was augmented in subsequent versions with knowledge based on the experience of companies that Rational had acquired.

In 1997, a requirements and test discipline were added to the approach, much of the additional material sourced from the Requirements College method developed by Dean Leffingwell et al. at Requisite, Inc., and the SQA Process method developed at SQA Inc., both companies having been acquired by Rational Software.

In 1998 Rational Software added two new disciplines:
# business modeling, much of this content had already been in the Objectory Process
# a Configuration and Change Management discipline, sourced through the acquisition of Pure Atria  Corporation.

These additions lead to an overarching set of principles that were defined by Rational and articulated within RUP as the six ''best practices'' for modern software engineering:
# Develop iteratively, with risk as the primary iteration driver&lt;ref name='rup-in-brief'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/1826.html#N100E4 |title=RUP in brief |accessdate=2011-07-12 |last=Aked |first=Mark |date=2003-11-25 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Manage requirements
# Employ a component-based architecture
# Model software visually
# Continuously verify quality
# Control changes

These best practices were tightly aligned with Rational's product line, and both drove the ongoing development of Rational's products, as well as being used by Rational's field teams to help customers improve the quality and predictability of their software development efforts.

Additional techniques including performance testing, UI Design, data engineering were included, and an update to reflect changes in UML 1.1.

In 1999, a project management discipline was introduced, as well as techniques to support real-time software development and updates to reflect UML 1.3. Besides, the first book to describe the process, The Unified Software Development Process ({{ISBN|0-201-57169-2}}), was published in the same year.

Between 2000 and 2003, a number of changes introduced guidance from ongoing Rational field experience with iterative development, in addition to tool support for enacting RUP instances and for customization of the RUP framework. These changes included:
# the introduction of concepts and techniques from approaches such as eXtreme Programming (XP), that would later come to be known collectively as agile methods. This included techniques such as pair programming, test-first design, and papers that explained how RUP enabled XP to scale for use on larger projects.
# a complete overhaul of the testing discipline to better reflect how testing work was conducted in different iterative development contexts.
# the introduction of supporting guidance - known as "tool mentors" - for enacting the RUP practices in various tools. These essentially provided step-by-step method support to Rational tool users.
# automating the customization of RUP in a way that would allow customers to select parts from the RUP process framework, customize their selection with their own additions, and still incorporate improvements in subsequent releases from Rational.

IBM acquired Rational Software in February 2003.

In 2006, IBM created a subset of RUP tailored for the delivery of [[Agile software development|Agile]] projects - released as an OpenSource method called [[OpenUP]] through the [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] web-site.&lt;ref&gt;

== Rational unified process topics ==

=== RUP building blocks ===
RUP is based on a set of building blocks and content elements, describing what is to be produced, the necessary skills required and the step-by-step explanation describing how specific development goals are to be achieved. The main building blocks, or content elements, are the following:
* Roles (who) – A role defines a set of related skills, competencies and responsibilities.
* Work products (what) – A work product represents something resulting from a task, including all the documents and models produced while working through the process.
* Tasks (how) – A task describes a unit of work assigned to a Role that provides a meaningful result.

Within each iteration, the tasks are categorized into nine disciplines:
* Six "engineering disciplines"
** Business modelling
** Requirements
** Analysis and design
** Implementation
** Test
** Deployment
* Three supporting disciplines
** [[Software configuration management|Configuration and change management]]
** [[Software project management|Project management]]
** [[Environment discipline|Environment]]

=== Four project life-cycle phases ===
[[Image:Development-iterative.png|thumb|320px|RUP phases and disciplines.]]
The RUP has determined a project life-cycle consisting of four phases. These phases allow the process to be presented at a high level in a similar way to how a 'waterfall'-styled project might be presented, although in essence the key to the process lies in the iterations of development that lie within all of the phases. Also, each phase has one key objective and milestone at the end that denotes the objective being accomplished. The visualization of RUP phases and disciplines over time is referred to as the [[RUP hump]] chart.

==== Inception phase ====
The primary objective is to scope the system adequately as a basis for validating initial costing and budgets.
In this phase the business case which includes business context, success factors (expected revenue, market recognition, etc.), and financial forecast is established. To complement the business case, a basic use case model, project plan, initial risk assessment and project description (the core project requirements, constraints and key features) are generated.
After these are completed, the project is checked against the following criteria:
* [[Stakeholder (corporate)#In management|Stakeholder]] concurrence on scope definition and cost/schedule estimates.
* Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases.
* Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process.
* Depth and breadth of any architectural prototype that was developed.
* Establishing a baseline by which to compare actual expenditures versus planned expenditures.

If the project does not pass this milestone, called the life cycle objective milestone, it either can be cancelled or repeated after being redesigned to better meet the criteria.

==== Elaboration phase (Ortner) ====
The primary objective is to mitigate the key risk items identified by analysis up to the end of this phase.
The elaboration phase is where the project starts to take shape. In this phase the problem domain analysis is made and the architecture of the project gets its basic form.

The outcome of the elaboration phase is:
* A use-case model in which the use-cases and the actors have been identified and most of the use-case descriptions are developed. The use-case model should be 80% complete.
* A description of the software architecture in a software system development process.
* An [[Executable Architecture|executable architecture]] that realizes architecturally significant use cases.
* Business case and risk list which are revised.
* A development plan for the overall project.
* Prototypes that demonstrably mitigate each identified technical risk.
* A preliminary user manual (optional)

This phase must pass the lifecycle architecture milestone criteria answering the following questions:
* Is the vision of the product stable?
* Is the architecture stable?
* Does the executable demonstration indicate that major risk elements are addressed and resolved?
* Is the construction phase plan sufficiently detailed and accurate?
* Do all stakeholders agree that the current vision can be achieved using current plan in the context of the current architecture?
* Is the actual vs. planned resource expenditure acceptable?

If the project cannot pass this milestone, there is still time for it to be canceled or redesigned. However, after leaving this phase, the project transitions into a high-risk operation where changes are much more difficult and detrimental when made.

The key domain analysis for the elaboration is the system architecture.

==== Construction phase ====
The primary objective is to build the software system.
In this phase, the main focus is on the development of components and other features of the system. This is the phase when the bulk of the coding takes place. In larger projects, several construction iterations may be developed in an effort to divide the use cases into manageable segments produce demonstrable prototypes.

==== Transition phase ====
The primary objective is to 'transit' the system from development into production, making it available to and understood by the end user.
The activities of this phase include training the end users and maintainers and beta testing the system to validate it against the end users' expectations. The system also goes through an evaluation phase, any developer which is not producing the required work is replaced or removed. The product is also checked against the quality level set in the Inception phase.

If all objectives are met, the product release milestone is reached and the development cycle is finished.

=== The IBM Rational Method Composer product ===
The IBM Rational Method Composer product is a tool for authoring, configuring, viewing, and publishing processes. See [[IBM Rational Method Composer]] and an open source version [[Eclipse Process Framework]] (EPF) project for more details.

=== Certification ===
In January 2007 the new RUP certification examination for ''IBM Certified Solution Designer - Rational Unified Process 7.0'' was released which replaces the previous version of the course called ''IBM Rational Certified Specialist - Rational Unified Process''.&lt;ref name='rupcert'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/jan07/krebs/ |title=The value of RUP certification |accessdate=2014-05-05 |last=Krebs |first=Jochen |date=2007-01-15 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new examination will not only test knowledge related to the RUP content but also to the process structure elements.&lt;ref name='rup7'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/certify/certs/38008003.shtml |title=Spacer IBM Certified Solution Designer - IBM Rational Unified Process V7.0 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To pass the new RUP certification examination, a person must take IBM's ''Test 839: Rational Unified Process v7.0''. You are given 75 minutes to take the 52 question exam. The passing score is 62%.&lt;ref name='test389'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.bm.com/certify/tests/ovr839.shtml |title=Test 839: Rational Unified Process v7.0 |accessdate=2008-05-13 |publisher=[[IBM]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Six best practices ===
Six best practices as described in the rational unified process is a paradigm in [[software engineering]] that lists six ideas to follow when designing any software project to minimize faults and increase productivity. These practices are:&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Schach (2004). ''Classical and Object-Oriented Software Engineering''. 6/e, WCB McGraw Hill, New York, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.augustana.ab.ca/~mohrj/courses/2000.winter/csc220/papers/rup_best_practices/rup_bestpractices.html Rational Unified Process white paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501034302/http://www.augustana.ab.ca/~mohrj/courses/2000.winter/csc220/papers/rup_best_practices/rup_bestpractices.html |date=2009-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Develop iteratively: It is best to know all requirements in advance; however, often this is not the case. Several software development processes exist that deal with providing solution on how to minimize cost in terms of development phases.
; Manage requirements: Always keep in mind the requirements set by users.
; Use components: Breaking down an advanced project is not only suggested but in fact unavoidable. This promotes ability to test individual components before they are integrated into a larger system. Also, code reuse is a big plus and can be accomplished more easily through the use of [[object-oriented programming]].
; Model visually: Use diagrams to represent all major components, users, and their interaction. "UML", short for [[Unified Modeling Language]], is one tool that can be used to make this task more feasible.
; Verify quality: Always make testing a major part of the project at any point of time. Testing becomes heavier as the project progresses but should be a constant factor in any software product creation.
; Control changes: Many projects are created by many teams, sometimes in various locations, different platforms may be used, etc. As a result, it is essential to make sure that changes made to a system are synchronized and verified constantly. (See [[Continuous integration]]).

[[File:1931 Act ed.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Architects Act 1997]] imposes restrictions on the use of the name, style or title "architect" in connection with a business or a professional practice, and for that purpose requires a statutory [[Register of Architects]] to be maintained. The [[Architects Registration Board]] constituted under the Act is responsible for '''Architects Registration in the United Kingdom''' and is required to publish the current version of the Register annually. Every person who is entitled to be registered under the Act has the right to be entered in the Register. The Act consolidated previous enactments originating with the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931 as amended by the Architects Registration Act 1938]]. It applies to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Section 2 of the Act prescribes that the Board shall appoint and regulate the functions ascribed to the '''Registrar'''. The Act refers to the Registrar by the masculine [[pronoun]] in the singular, but by the usual rules of [[statutory interpretation]],&lt;ref&gt;Interpretation Act 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; this is not limited to an individual male person.

An [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment]] under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]] came into force on 20 June 2008.

The recurring controversy about whether statutory protection of title serves useful purposes has been intensified by the legislative impact of the [[EU Directive]] on [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|Unfair Commercial Practices]] implemented in May 2008 by two [[Statutory Instrument]]s under the European Communities Act 1972, namely No 1276 ([[Trade Descriptions Act 1968|Trade Descriptions]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081276_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1276]&lt;/ref&gt; and No 1277 ([[Consumer Protection]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2008/pdf/uksi_20081277_en.pdf S.I. 2008 1277]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purposes of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006], "regulatory function" is defined in subsection 32(2).

==Use of the title "architect"==

Under subsection 20(1) of the [[Architects Act 1997]], a person in the [[United Kingdom]] may only practise or carry on business under any name, style or title containing the word "[[architect]]" if registered. There is no restriction on its use in any other circumstance. The words in the current Act follow those of the 1938 Architects Registration Act under which it was decided that the use of the suffix "FRIBA" in business notepaper constituted an infringement.

By subsection 20(3) corporate bodies, firms or partnerships can carry on business under a name, style or title containing the word "architect" provided that (in broad terms) the architectural business is run by a registered person. However the statutory registration Board may (by rules made under subsection 20(4) – see General Rules, Rule 25) effectively limit the application of subsection 20(3) to those corporate bodies firms or partnerships who have supplied information necessary for determining whether the architectural business is run by a registered person.

The rule-making power under subsection 20(4) appears to be limited to prescribing particular information to be provided to the Board viz. "such information necessary for statutory registration determining whether [subsection 20(3)] applies". The subsection makes no provision for levying any fee.

==Background to legislation==

===Up to the 1990s===

Opinions had been divided for well over a century about the merits of statutory registration of architects in the United Kingdom. The result was that Parliament, as the legislator and guided by the government of the day, has had to maintain a state of benevolent neutrality among the holders of these contending views, consistent with more general public policies for business competition, employment, professional education and so on. In relation to statutory protection of title, three aspects of the field in which architects practise invite examination. In summary:

* ''The design quality of the built environment'': this is essentially a cultural concern which was and remains one of the principal reasons for the formation and continuance of the Royal Institute of British Architects as a chartered body. It has connotations not only for the United Kingdom but world wide. It is beyond the ambit of statutory protection of title.
* ''The technical sufficiency of buildings'': the public interest is secured in the United Kingdom under Building Regulations and other enactments. This too is beyond the statutory protection of the title "architect".
* ''The business of architectural practice'': contracts of engagement for professional services are always between a business entity (whether individual, firm, partnership, or company) and the client, and are governed by the general law, including consumer protection legislation where applicable. Protection of the title ‘architect’ for business entities is of no practical relevance for securing the performance of architectural services.

In the light of experience since the inception of the Register under the 1931 Act, and more particularly under the Architects Registration Board’s regime from 1997, the recurring question has been whether protection of title serves useful purposes in respect of the three aspects mentioned above. The question of obsolescence has been further intensified by the [[Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive|EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive]], effective from 2007.

Statutory registration had its origin within the architectural profession in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was then (as now) a matter of controversy. However, by 1905 the [[RIBA]] had established a policy to secure satisfactory training of architects by statutory means.

The basis of the policy (on registration) had always been that the profession was governed by voluntary associations of practising architects and that the profession would retain control of registration. This was reflected in the composition of the registration body (the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] - [[ARCUK]]) established by the 1931 Act. Shortly after, in the book published on occasion of the Institute's centenary celebration in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;''The Growth and Work of the Royal Institute of British Architects'' edited by J. A. Gotch PPRIBA [[John Alfred Gotch]]

.&lt;/ref&gt; in the concluding paragraphs of the chapter on statutory registration.,&lt;ref&gt;In this chapter the author includes an informative account of the history of registration quoting extensively an article published in the ''RIBA Journal'' of 8 August 1931 by Charles MacArthur Butler, Secretary of the RIBA Registration Committee and first Registrar to ARCUK.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Barnes FRIBA., Chairman of the Registration Committee, wrote -

:''" ... I do not conceive the purpose of the Registration Act to be that of protecting the Architectural profession. The interests of the Profession are of course legitimate but are best served by the Architectural Associations in which some 80 per cent of those practising architecture are to be found.''

:''"The object of the Registration Act is to ensure to the public that the architects they employ possess capacity and character.''

:''"Under the purview of the [[Board of Architectural Education]] no one will enjoy the title of '[[Registered Architect]]' without giving evidence of his capacity, and under that of the Discipline Committee no one will retain the title whose character has been weighed in the balance and found wanting.''

:''"The [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] can never, therefore, on this view be a rival of any Architectural Association and least of all of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].''

:''"The Architects' Registration Council stands at the gateway of the realm of Architectural practice, but within that realm the affairs of the Architect are best administered by those voluntary Associations to which he has allied himself and over the actions of which he has complete control."''

After more than half a century times have changed and a regime of quite another kind has been installed under the 1997 Act.

===From the 1990s===

By the 1990s it was almost universally accepted that the time had come to bring the statutory Architects' Registration Council as it then was to an end. Opinion within the profession was divided among those who held that statutory registration should be discontinued altogether and those who held that the registration body should be reconstituted.

In the event the body was reconstituted as the Architects Registration Board (1996/1997 Acts). But it was only after the event that many in the profession came to appreciate the effect of the new requirement that the majority of the Board should be non-architects and appointed by the government, as the following quotation shows:

:"''Crucially, professional control of the Register was taken away by the government's decision which was realised in the 1996/97 Act. This had not been generally expected by those of the membership who before then had been in favour of continuing protection of the title '[[architect]]'. The significance and effect of the change is now becoming more widely understood.''" (Report of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] Council's Task Group on the [[Architects Registration Board]], September 2004.)

===Statutory Registration – chronology of key events===

'''''1834''''' - The body which was to become the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (originally known as the Institute of British Architects in London) was formed by [[Thomas de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey]] and several prominent architects. (After the grant of the charter it had become known as the Royal Institute of British Architects in London, eventually dropping the reference to London in 1892.)&lt;ref&gt;about the RIBA Charter and Byelaws {{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426122320/http://www.architecture.com/TheRIBA/AboutUs/Ourstructure/Constitution/CharterandByelaws.aspx |archivedate=26 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} |Text of the Charter and Byelaws

'''''1837''''' - It was granted its [[Royal Charter]] under [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]].

'''''1884''''' - [[Society of Architects]] formed, after a campaign by a group of ARIBA to be allowed to vote on RIBA affairs had been resisted by FRIBA.

'''''1887''''' - Architects and Engineers Registration Act Committee formed as an independent committee to promote a bill for registration of architects, engineers and surveyors. The bill was withdrawn after chief bodies representing engineers petitioned against it.

'''''1889 &amp; 1891''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee put forward bills for registration of architects, which were strongly supported by the [[Society of Architects]] but opposed by an independent group of prominent architects and artists.

'''''1892''''' - Papers published, defining the profession of architecture:
:[[Norman Shaw]] and [[T. G. Jackson|T G Jackson]] (eds.) "Architecture, A Profession or an Art".
:[[William H. White (architect)|William H White]] "''The Architect and his artists, an essay to assist the public in considering the question is architecture a profession or an art''".

'''''1902''''' - Architects Registration Bill Committee amalgamated with the Society of Architects as a joint Registration Committee.

'''''1905''''' - RIBA Education Policy was adopted for statutory powers to secure satisfactory training for architects by way of registration of title, by and through the RIBA.

'''''1908''''' - RIBA Licentiate Class formed, for architects who could show evidence of competence, without exams. On closure in 1913, over 2000 had been accepted.

'''1924-1959''' - RIBA Standing Registration Committee.

'''''1925''''' - Amalgamation of [[RIBA]] and [[Society of Architects]]: most of the [[Society of Architects]] members transferred to Licentiate class, which was reopened.

'''''1927''''' - RIBA Registration Committee has draft bill introduced in Parliament, but opposed by the [[Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors]] and the [[Faculty of Architects and Surveyors]].

'''''1931''''' - Bill recast and enacted as the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, enabling the [[Register of Architects]] to be established under a statutory body called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK). The Council was to be made up of representatives of all architectural bodies in the [[United Kingdom]] in proportion to the numbers of their memberships on the Register, and representatives from government departments and related professional bodies. Under ARCUK, the RIBA system of exams etc. was accepted for registration. (The provisions of the Act constituting the [[Board of Architectural Education]] were repealed when ARCUK was reconstituted as ARB in 1996/7.)

'''''1937''''' - A letter is sent by "the president of the council" [sic] to the Institute of Chartered Surveyors recognizing the fact that there was nothing in the Bill which the council was then promoting (and which subsequently became the Architects Registration Act, 1938) to interfere with the activities of registered architects. The letter is mentioned by
[[Lord Goddard]],Lord Chief Justice, in the course of his judgment in the Queen's Bench Divisional Court in 1957 allowing the appeal of an architect (Hughes) against a professional miscondct decision of the Discipline Committee of ARCUK (later renamed [[Architects Registration Board]]), a case which becomes cited in later cases and in legal text-books as a judicial precedent.&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1938''''' - The Architects Registration Act, 1938 changed the protected title from "Registered Architect" to "Architect".

'''''1957''''' - Resulting from the 1938 legislation, an appeal by an architect against ARCUK is allowed by the High Court in a case which becomes a judicial precedent, ''Hughes v. Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom'': "It is not of itself disgraceful to disagree with a majority view and to act accordingly. It is only if a man has bound himself in honour to accept that view and to act according to the code that a deliberate breach of the code for his own profit can be called disgraceful."—Devlin J. ([[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin]])&lt;ref&gt;''Hughes v [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom|Architects’ Registration Council'']][1957] 2 Q.B. 550, cited in Hudson's Building and Engineering Contracts, 11th ed., para 2.015, and 12th ed., para 2.007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''1992''''' - Government, in response to a request from ARCUK, commissioned review of the Architects Registration Acts by an independent assessor (John Warne).

'''''1993''''' - [[Warne Report]] published - principal recommendation: abolition of protection of title "architect" and disbanding of ARCUK. RIBA Council initially supported this recommendation, but this was resisted by the RIBA membership. As a result RIBA campaigned for the retention of protection of title with a "stream-lined" registration board.

'''''1996''''' - Part III of [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]], among other things, reconstituted the registration body as the Architects Registration Board (ARB).

'''''1997''''' - Architects Act 1997, a consolidating act, brought together the provisions of Part III of the 1996 Act and previous registration legislation. The Architects Registration Board then established with a majority of appointed lay members and a minority of elected Architect members.

'''''2008''''' - [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==The present legislation==

===Summary of legislative history===

The following analysis of the operative and other parts of the Architects Act 1997 as it was before the [[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|amendment of June 2008]] pays attention to details which sometimes go unnoticed.

The Act is fairly short. That is partly due to its conciseness, but this quality makes it all the more necessary to remember that the Act must be read as a whole to ascertain the meaning and effect of its various parts. Care is needed not to read into it what is not there (whatever conventional wisdom may have supposed or desired), and not to fail to notice what actually is there. In particular, like many such Acts, it can be better understood by looking at its beginning (Arrangement of Sections and long title) and its end (derivations), as well as the operative part in between.

Its long title is "An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects". The Table of Derivations printed at the end lists the enactments which it consolidated; and Schedule 3 lists the originating and two amending Acts which it repealed, namely: the Architects (Registration) Act 1931, the Architects Registration Act 1938 and parts of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996.

The unbroken continuity of these enactments is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2:

:''"the Council" means the Architects Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''

The changes made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act as amended can be deduced from the Table of Derivations. This also shows that, for the purpose of the consolidation, certain definitions were inserted in the "Interpretation" section. These included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not vice versa). In subsection 14(1) the phrase is expanded as: "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

===The "burdens" and "choices"===

The scheme of the consolidation Act of 1997 is identical with that of the originating Act of 1931, as amended. It is as follows:

:It operates by imposing (under Part IV) one kind of burden, backed by threat of penal sanction, on persons carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]] generally, but at the same time giving to one particular group of persons a statutory right to choose instead to submit to another kind of burden, and to another group of persons the statutory right to choose to submit to a third kind of burden.&lt;ref&gt;For the statutory meaning of "burden" see: s.1(5)(b) of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1994/Ukpga_19940040_en_1.htm Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994]; s.2 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/20010006.htm Regulatory Reform Act 2001], and s.1 of the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the first is described as the "general burden"; the other two as the "voluntary burdens"; and the freedom to choose the "statutory choices".

The general burden is a prohibition imposed on all persons, firms, partnerships and bodies corporate carrying on business in the [[United Kingdom]], including architects and [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architects]]. The prohibition is against practising or carrying on business under the title of "[[architect]]", with two exceptions, viz.:

:*In the case of an individual, s/he has opted for one of the voluntary burdens and is registered or enrolled under the Act.

:*In the case of a business entity (body corporate, firm or partnership) it has opted for the other of the voluntary burdens, in that its business so far as it relates to architecture satisfies the statutory requirement to be under the control, management and supervision of a registered person.

Here, the first of these is described as a "practice volunteer", and the second as a "business volunteer".

The statutory choice is exercisable:

:*In the case of a practice volunteer, by applying for registration in the [[Register of Architects]] and paying the annual retention fee (under sections 4 to 11), or by enrolling in the statutory list of visiting EEA architects (under section 12).

:*In the case of a business volunteer, by complying with the control, management and supervision requirements (of subsection 20(3)).

The voluntary burdens which result from the exercise of the statutory choice are as follows:

:*In the case of a registered person, to submit to the regime imposed on registered persons under sections 4 to 11 of Part II (payment of fees and satisfying requirements about qualifications and competence) and Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a person enrolled in the list of visiting EEA architects, to submit to the regime of section 12 and of Part III – Discipline.

:*In the case of a business volunteer, to submit to the regime for control, management and supervision imposed by subsection 20(3) and be liable to supply the Board with information showing compliance.

In consequence:

:*any person or business entity is free to supply services of the same kind as a registered person, but may only use the title "[[architect]]" in this connection subject to one of the voluntary burdens; and

:*a [[Chartered architect|Chartered Architect]] may only use this title in the course of professional practice if s/he has opted to submit to one of the voluntary burdens, normally as a registered person.

===Side effects===

A side effect of the Act is the imposition of burdens on third parties under Part II, namely, [[Schools of Architecture, Architects (Registration) Act, 1931|Schools of Architecture]], but the effect of the changes made by the 1996 Act is that Schools of Architecture have disappeared from the legislation without trace. The result has been a certain amount of wrangling between the Schools, the ARB and the RIBA which is the principal professional body, whose concerns inevitably include architectural education.

Another side effect has been a claim by the ARB to be able to impose on registered persons certain requirements about Professional Indemnity Insurance.

===The Board and its duties===

The membership of the Board is the result of one of the changes made by the 1996 Act to the registration body's previous constitution when its name had been the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom. The Act abolished the [[Board of Architectural Education]], renamed the Council as the Board, and made this Board consist predominantly of persons appointed by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].

Subsection 3(4) states "The Board shall publish the current version of the Register annually...". Provisions of Part II of the Act prescribe how the Register shall be kept up to date, and who shall be entitled to be registered; other provisions of Parts II and III prescribe for the Board the circumstances, events or conditions when a person's name shall be removed from the Register; and other provisions prescribe for the Board certain ancillary, or derivative and secondary, duties in connection with the Board's primary responsibility for the maintenance and regular publication of the [[Register of Architects]].

Apart from officers, employees and agents of the Board, the Act creates no duties or obligations towards the Board which fall on any one else at all; and nothing in the Act itself creates any obligation which an architect owes to the Board.

===Not delegated===

Section 20 of the Architects Act 1997 mentions "architecture" (subsection (3)(b)) and the "services" of a person enrolled under the Act (subsection (5)). These are not defined by the Act, and it is quite obvious that [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] has not delegated to the Board the power to define them. In practice, as technology and the building process continue to evolve new specialisms, the concept of architecture can be seen as becoming ever more fluid, extensive and comprehensive, and at the same time becoming narrower while ever more ancillary specialities are identified.

==The Board's Professional Conduct Committee==

Sanctions are available to the Board under Part III of the Act against any person on the register who is found guilty under section 15 of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence, or else has been convicted with a criminal offence which has relevance to fitness to practise.

Although a criminal conviction is an objective criterion, no statutory definition is given that defines the level of professional conduct or incompetence that will attract a sanction, judgment in the matter being given to the Board's Professional Conduct Committee, subject to commonsense, reason and judicial review.

The PCC is constituted under the Act, Schedule 1 Part II, as amended. The Committee includes members of the Board, both elected and appointed, as well as persons appointed by the Board and nominees of the President of the Law Society. A bare quorum of the Committee meets for a disciplinary hearing, comprising a nominee of the President of the Law Society (invariably a [[solicitor]]), a person from the Register and another not on the Register. PCC members are paid for their service.

==Categorisation==
The [[Architects Registration Board]] is admittedly not a professional body or society in the sense explained in Wikipedia article "[[British Professional Bodies]]". The question whether or not it is a "[[regulatory agency]]" was publicly considered in 2003. The June 2003 issue of the ''[[RIBA Journal]]'' included the following:

:''"The words 'regulator' and 'regulation' are not used in the Act and that status is not conferred upon the Board. It could be argued that the Board's assumption of this role is adverse to the public interest... A contrary proposition to the Board's claim is that an essential characteristic of a regulatory body in this context is to have jurisdiction or control over particular functions or activities in the supply of goods or services... whether or not the regulatory method is in conjunction with a system of certificating or licensing (such as applies to solicitors or places of entertainment)... The Board's claim to regulatory status appears to be the result of want of understanding how it can usefully go about fulfilling the services that have been assigned to it by statute for the public benefit..."''&lt;ref&gt;''RIBA Journal'', June 2003, referred to on page 1 of ''The Status of the Architects Registration Board.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2003 the [[Architects Registration Board]] published a summary of a barrister's opinion which included the following:

:''"The Board as 'Regulator'. It has been suggested that the Board is not a 'regulator' of the architects’ profession... The precise generic description that any individual chooses to give to the collection of statutory duties imposed upon, and the powers available to, the Board under the 1997 Act is in any event irrelevant for the purposes of the questions asked,"'' [by the Board when obtaining this information for its own use] ''"for they largely involve issues of statutory interpretation which require the legislation to be construed and not given epithets."''&lt;ref&gt;For curbs on regulatory functions, see the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2006/20060051.htm Legislative &amp; Regulatory Reform Act 2006 and its Explanatory Note].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of "Chartered Practice"==

The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], which is a professional body (see Wikipedia category list [[British Professional Bodies]]), operates a voluntary "Chartered Practice" scheme. The use of the title "Chartered Practice" is authorised under Article 4.7 of the RIBA Charter (see reference below). The Institute's website explains that the scheme requires all architectural work of a Chartered Practice to be under the supervision of a Chartered Architect. A directory listing Chartered Practices has been published annually by the Institute from 2007.

==Qualification for registration==

The standard of qualification is not equal for all persons applying to be included in the [[Register of Architects]].

The Registrar is bound, under section 4 of the Architects Act, to register any person who applies for registration if that person has "such qualifications and has gained such practical experience as may be prescribed".

An alternative route to registration is to satisfy the Board that an equivalent standard of competence has been achieved. A matrix can be applied as follows:

{| border="1"
! Qualifications !! Practical experience !! RIBA Part III
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in UK
| ''Required''
|-
| Obtained in UK
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in UK
| ''Not required''
|-
| Obtained in other EU
| Obtained in other EU
| ''Not required''
|}

The disparity arises from the [[European Directive]] on Mutual Recognition of Qualifications in Architecture 85/384/EC. (Go to Article 4 of the main text for the required duration of training. The original Directive has been updated.) It is clearly stated in that Directive that "the total length of education and training shall consist of a minimum of either four years of full-time studies at a university or comparable educational establishment or at least six years of study at a university or comparable educational establishment of which at least three must be full time".

As this is a minimum requirement there is nothing to stop a country applying higher standards to those obtaining qualifications and experience within its own jurisdiction. However it is widely held (and expressed in the report of Michael Highton to the RIBA Council) that any challenge to this disparity is likely to succeed on the grounds of irrationality. The report stated:

:''"In our view it is only a matter of time before a UK student, who has been denied registration on the grounds that he or she has not passed the Part 3 examination, yet who has been educated in the UK and achieved two years practical experience in the UK, successfully challenges such a decision on the basis that it is irrational to require a UK based student to possess a higher level of qualification and experience than is required of a non-UK based student or architect."''

If the Architects Registration Board reduced the registration requirement to four years full-time study, there is no reason why the RIBA should lower its entry standard.

==Break in annually produced copies of the Register==
At a time when there had occurred a hiatus in production under the legislation of printed copies of the Register in the annual series from 1933, the [[Architects Registration Board]] made a new departure and in 2012 announced an online version of the Register which registered persons were invited to use for demonstrating their professionalism to members of the public and to non-registered competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architects-register.org.uk/ The Register of Architects] and as explained in ARB ebulletin of May 2012 {{cite web |url=http://www2.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120604184515/http%3A//www.arb.org.uk/publications/ebulletin/arbebulletin_05_12.pdf |archivedate=4 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Retailtainment''' is [[retail]] marketing as [[entertainment]]. In his book, ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption'' (1999), author [[George Ritzer]] describes "retailtainment" as the "use of ambience, emotion, sound and activity to get customers interested in the merchandise and in a mood to buy."&lt;ref&gt;Ritzer, George, ''Enchanting a Disenchanted World: Revolutionizing the Means of Consumption''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes called "inspirational retailing" or "entertailing,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babsoninsight.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/703 Babson Insight: Fun is Serious Business—Particularly for Mature “Neutral” Service Firms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; it has also been defined as "the modern trend of combining shopping and entertainment opportunities as an anchor for customers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skoupy.net/pdf/research_on_retailing.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Codeluppi described it as a way for marketers to "offer the consumer physical and emotional sensations during the shopping experience." And, in an article entitled "Using sonic branding in the retail environment" in the 2003 issue of the ''Journal of Consumer Behavior'', Fulberg described it as a way for retailers to entertain the consumer with a dramatization of their values."

According to Michael Morrison at the Australian Centre for Retail Studies:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“There is a move towards the concept of 'retailtainment.' This phenomenon, which brings together retailing, entertainment, music and leisure ... Retailers need to look further than the traditional retail store elements such as colour, lighting and visual merchandising to influence buying decisions. The specific atmosphere the retailer creates can, in some cases, be more influential in the decision-making process than the product itself. As goods and services become more of a commodity, it is what a shopper experiences and what atmosphere retailers create that really matters. Brand building is a combination of physical, functional, operational and psychological elements. Consumers will be willing to pay more for a brand if there is a perceived or actual added value from their experience of using the product or service.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandt.com.au/news/12/0c01e712.asp A touch of the theatre to add the ‘wow’ factor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shopper marketing expert Simon Temperley of Los Angeles agency [[The Marketing Arm]], formerly U.S. Marketing &amp; Promotions (Usmp), describes "retailtainment" as a "live brand experience" that frequently includes the use of "brand ambassadors" who "converse with the consumer."&lt;ref&gt;[http://promomagazine.com/mag/marketing_hired_fans/ Hired Fans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics''' ('''SINP''') is an institution of basic research and training in physical and biophysical sciences located in [[Salt Lake City (Bidhan Nagar), Kolkata|Bidhannagar]], [[Kolkata]], India. The institute is named after the famous Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]].

==History==
The Palit Research Laboratory used to be a laboratory under the Department of [[Physics]] in the [[University of Calcutta]]. Meghnad Saha became the Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta in 1938. Realizing the ensuing importance of  [[nuclear physics]], he reorganized the curriculum to include nuclear physics and commissioned some necessary instruments. Soon the necessity of a small-scale cyclotron was felt. Thanks to the help of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and patronage of [[J. R. D. Tata|J.R.D.Tata]], the foundation stone of the Institute of Nuclear Physics was laid at Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Calcutta in 1949. The building was inaugurated in 1950 by [[Irène Joliot-Curie]]. The institute shifted to its new building in  [[Bidhannagar]] in the late 1980s.

==Administration==
SINP is an autonomous research institute under the administrative control of the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India .The institute is governed by a governing council headed by the chairman of the atomic energy commission of India, in accordance with a tripartite agreement signed by the [[Government of India]], [[Government of West Bengal]] and the [[University of Calcutta]] in August 1992. The institute is known as a centre for conducting research for doctoral degrees and providing facilities for teaching and research in physical and biological sciences. The chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, India (and Secretary, DAE, government of India) chairs the governing council with members comprising three scientists nominated by the DAE, two representatives of the DAE, two nominees of CU, one nominee of Govt. of West Bengal and the Director of the Institute.

'''Sasanian Glass''' is the glassware produced between the 3rd and the 7th centuries AD within the limits of the [[Sasanian Empire]], namely Northern Iraq, Iran and Central Asia. This is a silica-soda-lime glass production characterized by thick glass-blown vessels relatively sober in decoration, avoiding plain colours in favour of transparency and with vessels worked in one piece without over- elaborate amendments. Thus the decoration usually consists of solid and visual motifs from the mould (reliefs), with ribbed and deeply cut facets, although other techniques like trailing and applied motifs were practised (See Figure 1).

== Some considerations about the definition of Sasanian Glass ==

Despite there being a general agreement concerning what Sasanian Glass is, there are no clear criteria to describe it. Therefore, before continuing with a further explanation is necessary to clarify it. Usually it is defined by means of Period, Territory and Style.
 
Sasanian glass is frequently referred to with the ambiguous term [[Pre-Islamic Glass]]. But some scholars (e.g. Goldstein 2005) consider the [[Achaemenid]] (550-330BC), [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (247BC-226AD) and Sasanian(224-642AD) productions as Pre-[[Islamic]] whereas others (e.g. Meyer 1995) consider only the 7th–8th centuries AD immediately before the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and the first [[Abbasid caliphate]]. Sasanian Glass is also named [[Persian Glass]], incorporating all the assemblage manufactured in Persia from the 3rd to the 19th centuries AD (Newman 1977).

The Sasanian Empire spanned a vast area from the [[Fertile Crescent]] to the Central Asian steppe, but with periods of expansion and contraction, reaching Damascus, Jerusalem, Egypt, Yemen or Pakistan. Some of the works were produced in the peripheral regions bordering the Empire and others came from beyond but following Sasanian designs. This creates "uncertainties about the precise place of manufacture of many Sasanian creations" (Demange 2007, 9) and confusion among terms since [[Mesopotamia]], for instance, can be at the same time [[Seleucia]] (Achaemenid), [[Ctesiphon]] (Sasanian) or [[Baghdad]] (Islamic).

Finally, the stylistic criteria can be very tricky due to several reasons. First, there is a considerable difficulty in discerning between the Parthian and Sasanian tradition (Negro Ponzi 1968-69), [[Byzantine]] and Sasanian (Goldstein 2005) and Sasanian and Islamic (Whitehouse 2005) to the extent that ‘Sasanian’ glassware, if carefully analysed, becomes Parthian (Negro Ponzi 1972, 216); that Byzantine pieces have many possibilities of being Sasanian (Saldern 1967), or that the same author examining the same specimen can conclude the piece is Sasanian in a first paper and Islamic in a second report (Erdmann 1950 and 1953).&lt;ref&gt;The references of Saldern and Erdmann have been taken from Whitehouse 2005,  pages 10 and 30 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the most characteristic method of decoration utilized by Sasanian artisans, the [[wheel-cut technique]] (See Figure 2) was not originated at all by them.  There are splendid examples of wheel-cut vessels at least from the 5th century BC among the Achaemenians that are known both in East and West (Goldstein 1980). "Everything wheel-cut is not Sasanian." (Rogers 2005, 24).

== Origins of Sasanian Glass ==

See [[Roman glass]] or [[Anglo-Saxon Glass]] entries for the differences between [[glassmaking]] and [[glassworking]]

The Sasanian craftsmen smoothly continued the tradition of glassworking, inherited from the Romans and Parthians, transmitting it to the Islamic artisans when their Empire collapsed (Goldstein 1982 and 2005). Although they began from plain and [[mould-blown]] vessels close to the Parthian taste (Negro Ponzi 1984, See Figure 3), they soon generated their own genuine style especially recognizable in the ''’typical hemispherical bowls with round or hexagonal deep incised facets’'' (Negro Ponzi 1987, 272) and widely expanded it throughout all the Sasanian territory and even beyond their borders.

However, there is no such continuity in [[glassmaking]]. Recent studies have demonstrated that there are clear differences between the composition of Roman, Sasanian and Syro-Palestinian - contemporary to the latest- productions (Freestone 2006) and also between Sasanian, Parthian and Islamic manufactures (Mirti et al. 2008 and 2009; Brill 2005).

== The recipe of Sasanian glassmakers ==
[[File:Tabriz Museum Sasanid Glass 1.jpg|thumb|Sassanid glass bowls.]]

Sasanian glass is a silica-soda-lime composition with high levels of K and Mg: this means the use of plant-ash as a source of soda. The Roman and the Parthian glass, on the other hand, employed mineral salts for this purpose (Freestone 2006, Mirti et al. 2009). Consequently, there is no continuation of the formula.

Moreover, Sasanian glasses also show differences when compared with other plant-ash soda glasses.  Freestone analysis revealed that Syro-Palestinian productions were lower in Mg than Sasanian ones, and Brill (2005, 75) concluded that there is a general ''‘overlapping but no close agreement’'' between the Sasanian and the later [[Islamic glass]] and that the former ''‘do not bear a close enough chemical resemblance to any of the particular groups of Islamic glasses’''.
 
In fact, the Sasanian glass is different even within itself. Three recipes have been identified for the glassmaking (Mirti et al. 2008). The first one (minoritarian) is a silica-soda-lime glass with one evaporite as a flux that mainly appears in the earliest stages of the Empire (3rd century). The second group is divided into two other subgroups, both using sodic ash but exploiting different plants. One of them is present from the beginning of the Dynasty and the other from the 4th century onwards. A crucial difference between them, apart from the one mentioned, is that the second subgroup always utilised a purer source of silica. Since this third recipe produced more transparent glass, found in more sophisticated objects than the ones worked with the other recipes (Mirti et al. 2009) this has been interpreted as an argument for the existence of diverse formulas to satisfy the demand of different qualities of glass. It is significant that, in the quest for the transparency meeting the taste of the Sasanians, purer silica was also occasionally utilised in the first subgroup.

== The techniques of Sasanian glassworkers ==

The only technological innovation attributed to Sasanian glassworkers is ''‘the casting of a [[glass blank]] that could be carved as if it were a hard-stone’'' (Rogers 2005, 23). The rest of the arts were acquired from previous artisans. Thus [[wheel-cutting]] from Achaemenians (at least the 5th century BC if not earlier, Saldern 1963; Goldstein 1980); applied ornaments like trails and blobs of glass were introduced around the 3rd–2nd centuries BC and [[glassblowing]] appeared in the 1st century BC. Sasanian glass craftsmen did not invent anything revolutionary but rather developed the available arts to a degree of mastery. In fact, their expertise in glassworking settled the ''‘foundation for virtually all the methods used to produce glass in the Islamic world’'' (Goldstein 2005, 11).

Although it is possible to find some [[core-form]] objects produced by the Sasanians, these are rarities (Goldstein 2005, 28-62). The whole of the Sasanian assemblage is glassblowing. The most frequent technique among the Sasanians was to blow the object giving it a basic shape and then finishing it with the help of paddles, pincers and shears. Other techniques frequently used were [[mould-blowing]] and the [[mould-pressing]]. These two use the mould as the essential part of the process (See Figure 4). In the former the object is blown inside a mould, acquiring the shape and decoration of the final object.  In the second stage the mould is removed and the object is blown to the appropriate size. Mould-pressing consists of pressing the glass against an open mould, obtaining a positive of the final object.

These methods produced slightly asymmetrical objects but have the advantage of permitting a huge versatility in shapes and obtaining articles practically finished since shapes (and patterns) are given with any of the techniques and by means of non-complicate solutions, pinching, cutting, polishing, and applying, the final object is obtained (Negro Ponzi 1968; Goldstein 2005; Whitehouse 2005). These techniques agreed with the Sasanian taste for plainly decorated vessels; thus they do not use the cameo or the scratching solutions that were extremely popular during the Islamic times. Instead they prefer to work the glass cold, polishing and [[panel-and-face-cutting]], creating ‘''a contrast of highlights and shadows, while at the same time providing a better grip’'' (Goldstein 2005, 30).

== The creations of Sasanian glassworkers ==

''‘Best known Sasanian glasses are those decorated with overall patterns of ground, cut and polished hollow facets’'' (Whitehouse 2005, 41, See Figure 5), but this appears around the 5th century AD. Before it,  the ''‘commonest type, spread in all the proto and middle Sasanian levels’'' is a bowl or tumbler with ''‘straight or slightly rounded walls’'' (Negro Ponzi, 1984, 34).

The repertory of forms and functions is, nonetheless, markedly wider: lamps, jars, flasks, tumblers, decanting siphons, dishes, bottles, scrolls or pen cases, jugs, beakers, cups, goblets, sprinklers, balsamaria, chalices, spoons, etc., in all kind of sizes and shapes; round, square, cylindrical, tubular, tronco-conic, etc. and with multiple combinations of them: round bottles with long/short/cylindrical/square necks, tripod-footed bowls, hexagonal, elongated or spherical flasks, square bottles with tronco-conical necks, etc. both plain and decorated and both for ordinary and luxury uses. It is worth mentioning that there is solid evidence (Meyer 1995, Mirti et al. 2008) pointing out that Sasanian glass production was not only for goods of luxury items for a selected elite but also concerned with the manufacture of quotidian goods.

A constant within all the Sasanian production is the search for transparency in the glasses. As has been mentioned, for transparent objects they utilised a specific recipe but it is also true that they did not usually achieve pure transparency but very close results: transparent glasses with green, blue or grey-blue hues. The majority of the Sasanian glass is colourless (with transparent unintended colours caused by impurities in the silica).  There are generally yellowish-green or yellowish-brown tinges and a characteristic smoky-brown tinge frequently associated with the [[face-cut bowls]]. Whole vessels in plain colours are far less common among the Sasanians to the extent that many of the full-coloured examples are believed to be imported. They nevertheless utilised plain colour for decorative motifs.  But again according to their taste, thus trails or pads tend to be delicate (See Figure 8), thin and small, (though during the early Sasanian era are usually thick) setting off the reflective and sparkling surfaces obtained by polishing or cutting, or adding spiral or vertical ribs. It is very common to find that the applications - the application of prunts of glass was especially ''‘popular’'' among the Sasanians (Goldstein 2005, 14)- are equally colourless, applied and pinched, giving to the vessel a spiky aspect, appropriately described by Goldstein (2005) as ''‘sputnik’''. (See Figures 6-7)

== Significance of Sasanian glass ==

The Sasanian Empire ''‘enjoyed a reputation for luxury in Byzantine and Arab written accounts’'' (St. John Simpson 2000, 62). Not for nothing was this the setting of the [[Arabian Nights]]. Glass also reflects this situation: for example during the contraction of the production during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period (400-616AD) ''‘luxury wares were little in demand, with the exception of chip-cut vessels of the Sasanian type’'' (Rogers 2005, 23, See Figure 9).

To the East, Sasanian glass was equally recognised. China named the [[Silk Road]] as the Horse Road or the Glass Road, as Sasanian glass was ''‘highly appreciated’'' there (Gyselen 2007, 17).  Similarly in Japan, it appeared in the tombs (''Shoshoin, Okinoshima, Kamigamo'', etc.) of high-status nobility related to the Emperor (Roger 2005; Whitehouse 2005).

Sasanian glass had a rapid growth and distribution both within and without the borders of the Empire and was not only used in luxury items; glass objects destined for utilitarian uses spread all over the Empire (Meyer 1995) and, most important, over certain social classes that did not have access to it till that moment. The secrets of this success remain surely in the fabrication of different qualities of glass and in its style, simultaneously simple and sophisticated, creating ''‘unusual products based on definite designs that differed from the East Roman patterns’'' (Negro Ponzi 1968-69, 384) and in fact from all other productions manufactured at that date.

== Archaeological Record ==

Till now, there have been no clear examples of glass workshops or of glassmaking factories.  In fact excavated settlements with Sasanian glass are rather scarce: [[Seleucia]], Tell Baruda, [[Ctesiphon]], [[Veh Ardashir]], Choche, [[Nippur]], [[Samarra]] and a few more (Whitehouse 2005). A high number of the pieces have been found in funerary contexts, Tell Mahuz, Ghalekuti, Hassani Mahale, Abu Skhair, etc. A small paradox is that, although the Iranian Plateau is the core of the territory controlled by Sasanians, the archaeological record of glass production is rather meagre there, with the best examples of workshops concentrated on the borders of the empire, namely Northern Iraq (Saldern 1963 and 1966; St. John Simpson 2000; Whitehouse 2005).

This lack of archaeological finds means that most of the provenances of Sasanian glass are unknown; there are just vague notes on them like: "Eastern Roman Empire or Iran", "North-western Iraq", "Mesopotamia", "Iran or Iraq" with a large number of the vessels appearing in antiquities markets. Incidentally, this also causes the wideness of concepts among the different scholars mentioned above about what can be considered as Sasanian.

"We are a long way from a definitive picture of Islamic production through the ages". (Rogers 2005, 25)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5308">'''Secondary orality''' is a concept in the work of scholar [[Walter J. Ong]], as first described in his book ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'', published in 1982 (2nd ed. 2002), [[Walter J. Ong]] and discussing the differences between oral and literate cultures. 

In this book, Ong used the phrase ‘secondary orality’, describing it as “essentially a more deliberate and self-conscious orality, based permanently on the use of writing and print” (Ong, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;133).&lt;ref&gt;Ong, W. J. (1982). ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing the Word''. New York: Methuen.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his way of thinking, secondary orality is not primary orality, the [[orality]] of pre-literate cultures. Oral societies operated on [[polychronic time]], with many things happening at once—socialization played a great role in the operation of these cultures, memory and memorization were of greater importance, increasing the amount of copiousness and redundancy. Oral cultures were additive rather than subordinate, closer to the human life world, and more situational and participatory than the more abstract qualities of literate cultures. 

Secondary orality is orality that is dependent on literate culture and the existence of writing, such as a television anchor reading the news or radio. While it exists in sound, it does not have the features of primary orality because it presumes and rests upon literate thought and expression, and may even be people reading written material. Thus, secondary orality is usually not as repetitive, redundant, agonistic, etc. the way primary orality is, and cultures that have a lot of secondary orality are not necessarily similar to primarily oral cultures. Secondary orality should not be confused with "oral residue" in which a culture has not fully transitioned to literate / written culture and retains many of the characteristics of primary oral cultures. Secondary orality is a phenomenon of post-literacy era, whereas oral residue is a stage in the transition from pre-literate to literate.

==The Gutenberg Parenthesis==
Ong notes that human communication has been dominated by oral culture, and the first signs of literacy date only 6 000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Ong, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Pettitt, Associate Professor of English at the University of Southern Denmark, agrees with Ong, ''et al.'', by considering literate learning more the anomaly than the rule.  He considers this to be a post-Gutenberg era where knowledge is formed through digital media, delivered over the internet.  Calling the previous 500 years a "Gutenberg Parenthesis", he explains that before Gutenberg, knowledge was formed orally and, now, in this post-Gutenberg era, knowledge is formed—increasingly—through "secondary orality" on the Internet. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, Tom ''Before the Gutenberg Parenthesis: Elizabethan-American Compatibilties'' https://www.academia.edu/2946207/Before_the_Gutenberg_Parenthesis_Elizabethan-American_Compatibilities&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by Professor Lars Ole Sauerberg. &lt;ref&gt;Pettitt, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 

==McLuhan's Global Village==
In [[The Gutenberg Galaxy]], [[Marshall McLuhan]] discussed his notion of the "[[Global Village (term)|global village]]", a concept that can be related to Ong's account of secondary orality.  Liliana Bounegru notes the emergence of social media (e.g. [[Facebook]]) and microblogging (i.e.[[Twitter]]) are re-[[Tribalism|tribalizing]] our cultures.  Conversations in these social spaces are written, but are more conversational in tone than written communications; they are "rapid communication with large groups of people in a speed that would resemble oral storytelling, without having to share the same physical space with your audience." &lt;ref&gt;Bounegru, Liliana 'Secondary Orality in Microblogging' at Masters of Media. [http://mastersofmedia.hum.uva.nl/2008/10/13/secondary-orality-in-microblogging/]  Bounegru is Project Coordinator at the European Journalism Centre, Maastricht, NL and a MA candidate in Media Studies, University of Amsterdam.

'''Speech-Language Pathology''' is a field of expertise practiced by a [[clinician]] known as a '''speech-language pathologist''' ('''SLP'''), also sometimes referred to as a '''speech and language therapist'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Marian C.|last2=Kelly|first2=Helen|last3=Godwin|first3=Jon|last4=Enderby|first4=Pam|last5=Campbell|first5=Pauline|date=2016-06-01|title=Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD000425|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=27245310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''speech therapist'''. SLP is considered a "related health profession" along with [[audiology]], optometry, [[occupational therapy]], [[Psychologist|clinical psychology]], [[physical therapy]], and others. The field of SLP is distinguished from other "related health professions" SLPs are legally permitted to conclude to certain disorders which fall within their scope of practice. SLPs specialize in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of [[communication disorders]] ([[Speech disorder|speech disorders]] and [[Language disorder|language disorders]]), cognitive-communication disorders, [[voice disorders]], and [[dysphagia|swallowing disorders]]. SLPs also play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of [[autism spectrum disorder]] (often in a team with pediatricians and psychologists).

A common misconception is that speech-language pathology is restricted to adjusting a speaker's speech sound articulation to meet the expected normal pronunciation, such as helping English speaking individuals enunciate the traditionally difficult "r". SLPs can also often help people who stutter to speak more fluently. Articulation and fluency are only two facets of the work of an SLP, however. In fact, speech-language pathology is concerned with a broad scope of speech, language, swallowing, and voice issues involved in communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/policy/SP2016-00343/#Service_Delivery_Areas|title=Scope of practice in speech-language pathology [Service Delivery Areas]|last=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|first=|date=2016|website=www.asha.org/policy|publisher=|access-date=September 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which include:

* Word-finding and other semantic issues, either as a result of a specific language impairment (SLI) such as a language delay or as a secondary characteristic of a more general issue such as dementia.
* Social communication difficulties involving how people communicate or interact with others (pragmatics).
* Structural language impairments, including difficulties creating sentences that are grammatical (syntax) and modifying word meaning (morphology).
* Literacy impairments (reading and writing) related to the letter-to-sound relationship (phonics), the word-to-meaning relationship (semantics), and understanding the ideas presented in a text (reading comprehension).
* Voice difficulties, such as a raspy voice, a voice that is too soft, or other voice difficulties that negatively impact a person's social or professional performance.
* Cognitive impairments (''e.g.'', attention, memory, executive function) to the extent that they interfere with communication.

The components of [[speech communication|speech]] production include:
* [[phonation]] (producing sound)
* [[resonance]]
* [[fluency]]
* [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]]
* [[pitch (music)|Pitch]] variance;
* [[Human voice|Voice]] (including [[aeromechanics|aeromechanical]] components of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]])
The components of [[language]] include:
* [[Phonology]] (manipulating sound according to the rules of a language);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] (understanding components of words and how they can modify meaning);
* [[Syntax]] (constructing sentences according to the [[grammar|grammatical]] rules of a target language);
* [[Semantics]] (interpreting signs or symbols of communication such as words or signs to construct meaning);
* [[Pragmatics]] (social aspects of communication).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Frances K. | last = Block | author2 = Amie Amiot|author3= Cheryl Deconde Johnson|author4= Gina E.

Swallowing disorders include difficulties in any system of the swallowing process (''i.e.'' oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional [[dysphagia]] and [[feeding disorder]]s.

==The profession==
Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide a wide range of services, mainly on an individual basis, but also as support for individuals, families, support groups, and providing information for the general public. SLPs work to prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social communication, cognitive-communication, and swallowing disorders in children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech-Language Pathologists|url=http://www.asha.org/Students/Speech-Language-Pathologists/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speech services begin with initial screening for communication and swallowing disorders and continue with assessment and diagnosis, consultation for the provision of advice regarding management, intervention, and treatment, and providing counseling and other follow up services for these disorders. Services are provided in the following areas:
* cognitive aspects of communication (''e.g.'', attention, memory, problem-solving, executive functions).
* speech ([[phonation]], [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], fluency, resonance, and [[human voice|voice]] including aeromechanical components of respiration);
* language ([[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and pragmatic/social aspects of communication) including comprehension and expression in oral, written, graphic, and manual modalities; [[language processing]]; preliteracy and language-based literacy skills, phonological awareness.
* swallowing or other upper aerodigestive functions such as infant feeding and aeromechanical events (evaluation of esophageal function is for the purpose of referral to medical professionals);
* voice (hoarseness (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), abnormal (''e.g.'' rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality.

===Multi-discipline collaboration===

SLPs collaborate with other health care professionals, often working as part of a multidisciplinary team. They can provide information and referrals to [[audiologist]]s, [[physician]]s, neonatal specialists &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Mathisen, B. A., Carey, L.

For example, the treatment for patients with [[cleft lip and palate]], often requires multidisciplinary collaboration. Speech-language pathologists can be very beneficial to help resolve speech problems associated with cleft lip and palate. Research has indicated that children who receive early language intervention are less likely to develop compensatory error patterns later in life, although speech therapy outcomes are usually better when surgical treatment is performed earlier.&lt;ref name="revistaOMF"&gt;

===Working environments===

SLPs work in a variety of clinical and [http://www.txsource.com educational settings]. SLPs work in public and private [[hospital]]s, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities, [[hospice]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pollens R |title=Role of the speech-language pathologist in palliative hospice care |journal=J Palliat Med |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=694–702 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15588361 |doi= 10.1089/jpm.2004.7.694|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and home healthcare. SLPs may also work as part of the support structure in the education system, working in both public and private [[school]]s, [[college]]s, and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/details/default.aspx?id=288 |title=Speech and language therapist - NHS Careers |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SLPs also work in community health, providing services at prisons and [[youth detention center|young offenders' institutions]] or providing expert testimony in applicable court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcslt.org/speech_and_language_therapy/what_is_an_slt |title=What is speech and language therapy? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association's (ASHA's) 2005 approval of the delivery of speech/language services via video conference or telepractice, SLPs in the United States have begun to use this service model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asha.org/telepractice/ |title=ASHA Telepractice Position Statement |publisher=Asha.org |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
SLPs conduct research related to communication sciences and disorders, swallowing disorders, or other upper aerodigestive functions.

===Education and training===
====United States====
In the United States, speech-language pathology is a Master's entry-level [[professional degree]] field. [[Clinicians]] must hold a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that is from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]] and from a communication sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA), the profession's national governing body as well as individual state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's [[College of education]], but offer the same education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (''e.g.'' CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (''e.g.'', Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds [[regional accreditation]], but only the master's degree is accredited by the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA).

All clinicians are required to complete 400 clinical hours (25 observation hours often completed during the undergraduate degree and 375 hours of graduate Clinical Practicum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/Accreditation-Standards-Graduate-Programs.pdf | title=Standards for Accreditation of Graduate Education Programs in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology | publisher=CAA | date=January 1, 2008 | accessdate=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They must pass multiple [[comprehensive exams]] also called Knowledge and Skills Acquisition (KASA) exams.

After all the above requirements have been met during the SLP's path to earning the graduate degree, SLPs must state licensure and national certification by:
* Passing the National Speech-Language Pathology board exam (Praxis).
* Successfully complete a clinical fellowship year (CFY) as a clinical fellow (CF) under the mentorship of a fully licensed mentor clinician. The CFY is no less than 36 weeks of full-time experience, totaling a minimum of 1260 hours. During the CFY, the CF cannot earn CFY hours unless they work more than 5 hours in a week and cannot earn any CFY hours beyond 35 hours in a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/certification/Clinical-Fellowship.htm|title=Speech-Language Pathology Clinical Fellowship|website=www.asha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receive [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] (ASHA) Certificate of Clinical Competence (CCC) and full state licensure to practice, following successful completion of clinical fellowship year(CFY).
* States are responsible for licensure of clinicians and other professionals and, as far as the new SLP, these requirements are often similar to that of the CFY. Following the state licensure procedures and national certification requirements are usually done simultaneously.

Maintaining licensure through continuing education:
* To maintain licensure, SLPs are required to participate in periodic earning of Continuing Educational Units (CEU).

Continuing education and training obligations:
* Educate, supervise, and mentor future SLPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cplol.eu/eng/profil_professionnel.html |title=Professional Profile of the Speech and Language Therapist |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Participate in continuing education.
* Educate and provide in-service training to families, caregivers, and other professionals.
* Train, supervise, and manage speech-language pathology assistants (SLPA) and other support personnel.
* Educating and counseling individuals, families, co-workers, educators, and other persons in the community regarding acceptance, adaptation, and decisions about communication and swallowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asha.org/docs/html/PI2010-00317.html |title=Roles and Responsibilities of Speech-Language Pathologists in Schools |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional suffix:
* Credentials of a clinical fellow typically read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CF-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CF-SLP).
* Credentials of a fully licensed SLP commonly read as: MA, MS, or M.Ed, CCC-SLP (''e.g.'', Jane Doe, MA, CCC-SLP), indicating a practitioner's graduate degree and successful completion of the fellowship year/board exams to obtain the "three Cs" the Certification of Clinical Competence, in speech-language pathology.

===Salary information===
Salaries of SLPs depend on a variety of factors including educational background, work experience, and location. The ASHA 2016 Schools Survey revealed that SLPs received a median academic year salary of 62,000, which is a 2% increase from the latest Schools Survey done in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2016-Schools-Survey-SLP-Salary-Trends.pdf|title= Schools Survey Report: SLP Annual Salary and Hourly Wage Trends 2004–2016 |website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ASHA released results for the 2015 SLP Health Care Survey which placed the median salary for SLPs working within the health care industry at $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/2015-SLP-Health-Care-Survey-Annual-Salaries.pdf|title=SLP Health Care Survey 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, salaries can range from $47,000–116,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/speech-language-pathologist/salary |title= Speech-Language Pathologist Salary |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= www.usnews.com |publisher= U.S. News |access-date= 8 March 2018 |quote=Speech-language pathologists have seen a spike in pay the past few years. The median salary for pathologists jumped from $66,920 in 2010 to $74,680 in 2016, according to the BLS. The best-paid speech-language pathologists earned more than $116,810 in 2016, while the lowest-paid earned less than $47,070.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the basic salary that a Graduate SLP would earn is estimated at $59,500 Australian dollars rising to $120,000 for Private SLP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.payscale.com/research/AU/Job=Speech_Pathologist/Salary|title=Speech Pathologist Salary (Australia)|website=www.payscale.com|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of assessment==
For many parents, the decision of whether or not to enroll students into school-based speech therapy or privately practiced therapy is challenging. Speech Pathologists work as part of a team alongside teachers, counselors, social workers and parents when in a school setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/speech-language-hearing/speech-language-pathologist/|title=Speech-Language Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because school-based speech therapy is run under state guidelines and funds, the process of assessment and qualification is more strict. To qualify for in-school speech therapy, students must meet the state's criteria on language testing and speech standardization. Due to such requirements, some students may not be assessed in an efficient time frame or their needs may be undermined by criteria. For a private clinic, students are more likely to qualify for therapy because it is a paid service with more availability.  {{details|Speech and language assessment}}

==Clients and patients==
Speech-language pathologists work with clients and patients who may present with a wide range of issues.

In the US, some children are eligible to receive speech therapy services, including assessment and lessons through [[speech and language pathology in school settings|the public school system]]. If not, private therapy is readily available through personal lessons with a qualified Speech-Language Pathologist or the growing field of telepractice.&lt;ref&gt;http://asha.org/telepractice/&lt;/ref&gt; Teleconferencing tools such as Skype are being used more commonly as a means to access remote locations in private therapy practice, such as in the geographically diverse south island of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://vocalsaints.co.nz/&lt;/ref&gt; More at-home or combination treatments have become readily available to address specific types of articulation disorders. The use of mobile applications in speech therapy is also growing as an avenue to bring treatment into the home.

In the UK, children are entitled to an assessment by local NHS Speech and Language Therapy teams, usually after referral by health visitors or education settings, but parents are also entitled to request an assessment directly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/helping-your-childs-speech.aspx#close&lt;/ref&gt; If treatment is appropriate, an educational plan will be drawn up. Speech therapists often play a role in multi-disciplinary teams where a child has speech delay or disorder as part of a wider health condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26253">The '''Supporting Healthy Marriage Project''' ('''SHM''') is part of the Healthy Marriage Initiative funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], that was launched in 2003 as "the first large-scale, multisite, multiyear, rigorous test of marriage education programs for low-income married couples". The project is motivated by research that "indicates that married adults and children raised by both parents in stable, low-conflict households do better on a host of outcomes". The evaluation is led by [[MDRC]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org MDRC website]&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with [[Abt Associates]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abtassociates.com/ Abt Associates website]&lt;/ref&gt; and other partners.&lt;ref name=mdrc&gt;[http://www.mdrc.org/project/supporting-healthy-marriage Manpower Development Research Corporation (MDRC), New York, NY]&lt;/ref&gt; USASpending.gov reports payments of more than $30 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services  to MDRC for work on the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project from 2009 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaspending.gov/search?form_fields=%7B%22search_term%22%3A%22mdrc%22%7D USAspending.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

Major study questions of the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project include:&lt;ref name=opre&gt;Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/research/project/supporting-healthy-marriages-2003-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 
# What are the experiences, issues and challenges in designing, implementing and operating healthy marriage education and related services for lower-income couples with children? 
# What are the net impacts of the programs on: marital stability and relationship quality; attitudes and expectations regarding their marriage; parenting attitudes and behaviors; measures of adult well-being and child well-being and development (e.g., cognitive, social, emotional, health), and economic outcomes for families?

Limited federal funding for a Healthy Marriage Initiative began in 2001 to "help couples who choose to get married gain greater access to [[relationship education|marriage education]] services that will enable them to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to form and sustain a healthy marriage."&lt;ref name=acf&gt;Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. [http://publications.usa.gov/epublications/childenf/marriage.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Wade Horn]], Assistant Secretary for the Administration for Children and Families, highlighted plans for a significant expansion of funding in testimony before the Subcommittee on 21st Century Competitiveness, House Committee on Education and the Workforce:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although I have focused on the areas of primary interest to your committee, I would be remiss if I did not briefly highlight other key areas of our proposal that play a critical role in the well-being of children, teenagers, and families. Indeed, we establish improving the well-being of children as the overarching purpose of [[Temporary Assistance for Needy Families|TANF]].... In support of that overarching purpose, our proposal seeks to improve child well-being through programs aimed at encouraging responsible fatherhood and healthy marriages. By discontinuing the Out of Wedlock Birth Reduction Bonus and redirecting part of the High Performance Bonus Funding, we provide $200 million for programs aimed at promoting family formation and healthy marriages. We also provide $40 million in funding for the support of responsible fatherhood and healthy marriage programs to reverse the rise in father absence and its subsequent impact on children."&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Wade F. Horn on Welfare Reform Reauthorization, March 15, 2005.[https://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/t050315.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Rationale==

When the program was launched, [[Heritage Foundation]] explained: "The erosion of marriage during the past four decades has had large-scale negative effects on both children and adults: It lies at the heart of many of the social problems with which the government currently grapples. The beneficial effects of marriage on individuals and society are beyond reasonable dispute, and there is a broad and growing consensus that government policy should promote rather than discourage healthy marriage. In response to these trends, President [[George W. Bush]] has proposed--as part of [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program#1996 Welfare Reform and subsequent amendments|welfare reform reauthorization]]--the creation of a pilot program to promote healthy and stable marriage. Participation in the program would be strictly voluntary. Funding for the program would be small-scale: $300 million per year. This sum represents one penny to promote healthy marriage for every five dollars government currently spends to subsidize single parenthood. Moreover, this small investment today could result in potentially great savings in the future by reducing dependence on welfare and other social services."&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;Rector, Robert and Pardue, Melissa. The Heritage Foundation, "Understanding the President's Healthy Marriage Initiative," May 26, 2004. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/03/understanding-the-presidents-healthy-marriage-initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocs&gt;Office of Community Services, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ocs/resource/im-no-89-healthy-marriage-initiative-under-csbg]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==

The [[Heritage Foundation]] and [[Brookings Institution]] were early proponents.

"By fostering better life decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence. Yet opponents make it sound as if the government would be forcing people into unhappy unions. It's nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;The Heritage Foundation, "Senators, Experts to Speak Out for "Healthy Marriage Initiative," March 26, 2004. [http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/03/senators-experts-to-speak-out-for-healthy-marriage-initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; 

"Federal and state legislation enacted over the past decade clearly reflects a growing national interest in reducing the number of children growing up without both parents.... The central policy question is whether it is possible to implement programs that can increase the number of children who are raised by both parents in healthy and stable marriages, especially within disadvantaged populations known to be at higher risk for family instability."&lt;ref&gt;Dion, M. Robin. "The Future of Children," Princeton-Brookings, Marriage and Child Wellbeing, Volume 15, Number 2, Fall 2005.[http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=37&amp;articleid=110&amp;sectionid=712]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 testimony to a House Appropriations Subcommittee, [[Wade Horn]] further highlighted the program's goals in a request for increased funding:&lt;ref name=horn&gt;Horn, Wade. "The Marriage Calculator," Testimony Before Subcommittee on Appropriations, April 2006.{{cite web |url=http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/olab/resource/testimony-on-marriage-calucator |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231085737/http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/olab/resource/testimony-on-marriage-calucator |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As you know, research shows that healthy and stable marriages support children and limit the need for government programs.  Whether the problem is abuse, neglect, or poverty, the evidence is clear that the best chance a child has of avoiding these problems is to grow up with their mother and father in a stable, healthy marriage. Research also shows that adults in healthy marriages are happier and healthier.  A report from the [[Institute for American Values]] suggests that communities with high rates of healthy marriages evidence fewer social problems such as crime and welfare dependency, compared to those with low rates of healthy marriages.... The new funding will support a variety of activities that will provide interested individuals and couples with the skills and knowledge necessary to form and sustain healthy marriages. For example, it will allow us to fund programs to: help high school students learn to develop healthy relationships and gain knowledge about the value and benefits of healthy marriage for themselves and their future children, if they desire to marry and have children; offer pre-marital services to help engaged couples focus on topics critical to the long-term health of their relationship and marriage; offer help to married couples who are struggling, to gain skills to revitalize and strengthen their marriage; work with non-married pregnant women and expectant fathers interested in marriage to gain the skills that are necessary to form and sustain healthy marriages and help them with parenting and financial management skills as well as with finding employment or advancing to higher wage jobs; and reduce the disincentives to marriage in means-tested aid if offered in conjunction with any of the above mentioned activities. In addition, to expand the initiative provided in the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|Deficit Reduction Act]], the Administration’s FY 2007 budget proposes to establish a competitive matching grant program for family formation and marriage. One hundred million dollars in competitive grants would be targeted to innovative approaches to promoting healthy marriage and reducing out-of-wedlock births."&lt;ref name="horn"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Early concerns==

"Although promoting marriage is undeniably a laudable aim, whether government programs can effectively promote marriage is far from certain. Government has virtually no track record on this issue. Moreover, before Congress commits to making significant investments in an unproven arena, policy makers must address an even more fundamental question:  Can marriage really be a panacea that helps poor women and their children lead better lives or are supporters of marriage promotion overpromising the benefits of their agenda?  Answering this question isn’t easy. Although the empirical evidence in support of marriage is incontrovertible, there is still a great deal we need to know before state [TANF] programs move too rapidly into uncharted territory.  Studies on the  'retreat from marriage' in the United States abound, but we have surprisingly little information about the marital behavior of those women about whom policy makers are most concerned: low-income and welfare-dependent unwed mothers."&lt;ref&gt;Lichter, Daniel. "Marriage as Public Policy," Progressive Policy Institute, Cornell University, September 2001.[http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/upload/marriage_lichter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
"Marriage promotion represents a cornerstone of social conservatives' domestic policy agenda, and proposals designed to promote and strengthen marriage are gaining currency at all levels of government. Since taking office, President Bush has promised to invest in marriage promotion on an unprecedented scale through his proposal to reauthorize the nation's welfare reform law, and legislation pending before Congress would allocate substantial funding toward that end. Yet even as the president waits for Congress to act, his administration is finding ways to devote significant funding to marriage promotion activities through existing programs and funding streams.&lt;ref&gt;Dailard, Cynthia. The Guttmacher Report on Public Policy
February 2005, Volume 8, Number 1.[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/tgr/08/1/gr080101.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

"A variety of new federal and state initiatives are attempting to promote family formation and healthy marriage among interested couples, including poor and minority couples who have had babies outside marriage. Careful evaluations of these programs should identify which are most effective.&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Ron; Donahue, Elisabeth; McLanahan, Sara. "The Decline in Marriage: What To Do," Brookings Institution, September 2005.[http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2005/09/fall-childrenfamilies-haskins]&lt;/ref&gt;

"A marriage movement is underway, as efforts to promote marriage, strengthen two-parent families and reduce divorce gain momentum around the country.  And yet, no one can say with certainty how the government should effectively put marriage education and promotion programs into place, or if those programs will achieve their desired goals."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Claire. "Marriage Promotion:  Will It Work?" Rockefeller Institute of Government, The Roundtable on Religion and Social Welfare Policy, June 2004.{{cite web |url=http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/faith-based_social_services/2004-06-marriage_promotion_will_it_work.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522175946/http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/faith-based_social_services/2004-06-marriage_promotion_will_it_work.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Some states are poised to develop and provide programs to support healthy marriages, as called for by the Bush administration.... If political support for these programs is to grow, evidence that they work for the right populations will be critical."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urban.org/toolkit/issues/marriage.cfm The Urban Institute, "Making Marriage Work," 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926132257/http://www.urban.org/toolkit/issues/marriage.cfm |date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

"With congressional Republicans beating the drum about [[Spendthrift|profligate]] and wasteful government spending, they may want to take a hard look at a federal program pushed by a host of top GOPers during the Bush-era and reauthorized in late 2010, as the Republican deficit craze took hold. Originally championed by Republican lawmakers including Iowa Sen. [[Chuck Grassley]], former Pennsylvania Sen. [[Rick Santorum]], and current Kansas Gov. [[Sam Brownback]], a federal initiative to promote marriage as a cure for poverty dumped hundreds of millions of dollars into programs that either had no impact or a negative effect on the relationships of the couples who took part."&lt;ref&gt;Mencimer, Stephanie. "The GOP's Dead-End Marriage Program," Mother Jones, June 25, 2012.[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/gops-dead-end-marriage-program]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Alternatives to Marriage Project opposes marriage promotion because it stigmatizes unmarried people and institutionalizes discrimination against singles and diverse family forms. We believe that policies designed to help children should focus on supporting all the types of families in which children really live. We believe that people who care for one another should be supported in their efforts to build healthy, happy relationships ... There is no evidence that it is an effective way to help people escape poverty. It diverts funds from poverty-fighting programs that have been proven to work."&lt;ref&gt;"Government Mandated Marriage Promotion," Alternatives to Marriage Project, Seattle, Washington.{{cite web |url=http://www.unmarried.org/welfare.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110702114934/http://www.unmarried.org/welfare.html |archivedate=2011-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial findings==

===Program impact===
[[File:SHM PAIRS Couple.jpg|thumb|Couple practices communication skills during [[PAIRS Foundation]] [[relationship education]] class in Florida.]]
In an early impact study on the effectiveness of "skills-based [[relationship education]] programs designed to help low-income married couples strengthen their relationships and, in turn, to support more stable and more nurturing home environments and more positive outcomes for parents and their children," MDRC reported:&lt;ref name=impact&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Early Impacts from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, New York, NY, March 2012.[http://www.mdrc.org/early-impacts-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The SHM program produced a consistent pattern of small positive effects on multiple aspects of couples’ relationships. Relative to the control group, the program group showed higher levels of marital happiness, lower levels of marital distress, greater warmth and support, more positive communication, and fewer negative behaviors and emotions in their interactions with their spouses. The consistency of results across outcomes and data sources (surveys and independent observations of couple interactions) is noteworthy.
* Compared with individuals in the control group, program group members reported experiencing slightly less psychological and physical abuse from their spouses. Men and women in the program group reported less psychological abuse in their relationships, and men in the program group reported that their spouses physically assaulted them less often, compared with their control group counterparts.
* Men and women in the program group reported slightly lower levels of adult psychological distress (such as feelings of sadness or anxiety) than their control group counterparts.
* The program did not significantly affect whether couples stayed married at the 12-month follow-up point.

The initial impact report is based on 12-month follow-up with 4,989 program participants and control groups at sites in Florida (Orlando), Kansas (Wichita), Pennsylvania (Reading and Bethlehem), Texas (El Paso and San Antonio), New York (Bronx), Oklahoma (Oklahoma City), and Washington (Shoreline and Seattle).&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

===Program implementation===
A separate study on program implementation reported:&lt;ref name=implementation&gt;Knox, Virginia, et al. "Final Implementation Findings from the Supporting Healthy Marriage Evaluation," MDRC, August 2012. [http://www.mdrc.org/final-implementation-findings-supporting-healthy-marriage-evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henthorn, Robert. "National Study Shows Strong Consumer Satisfaction with Marriage and Relationship Education Classes," Fatherhood Channel, October 17, 2012. [http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117/]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Local programs implemented the SHM model in  adherence with established guidelines. Program designers and evaluators consider the implemented programs a fair field test of the SHM model. The core marriage education workshops were implemented consistently across program locations, but there was more variation in implementation of the other two program components. 
[[File:Supporting-Healthy-Marriage-Research-Graph-X32.1.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]

[[File:SHM Time with Spouse.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]
[[File:SHM Reasons for Not Attending.jpg|thumb|SHM Implementation Data]]
* Couples engaged in SHM services and  continued participating over time.  Ninety-one percent of couples participated in at least one program service. On average, couples completed 27 hours of services across the three components, and those who initiated attendance remained engaged for approximately eight months.  
* Multiple strategies supported the implementation process. Written curricula, protocols, and performance benchmarks established expectations for the content, frequency, and quality of SHM services. Technical assistance teams held programs accountable for working toward their goals, and they offered assistance to improve programs’ performance over time.   
* Couples who enrolled are a diverse and relatively disadvantaged group. Most couples who enrolled in SHM had low or modest income; many are Hispanic; and more than half reported thinking that their marriage was in trouble in the past year.  
* SHM services were implemented in diverse agency settings. Host agencies include community-based organizations, private for-profit entities, a hospital, and a university. Within the broad parameters of the program model, these agencies played an important role in shaping implementation.

==Curricula evaluated==

===Within Our Reach===

* Curriculum Length: 28 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: PREP, Inc.

“WOR addresses factors that are associated with relationship quality or stability in longitudinal studies with middle-class couples. WOR takes a cognitive-behavioral approach to relationship and marriage education, with the goal of helping couples modify their behavior and thoughts about their relationship to reduce, and better manage, negative moods and emotions. Also central to WOR’s approach is its focus on different types of safety characterized as essential to maintaining healthy relationships: safety in interaction (can talk openly about issues), personal safety (freedom from fear of harm), and safety in commitment (mutual support, teamwork, and a clear future together).”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

===Becoming Parents Program===

* Curriculum Length: 30 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: PREP, Inc.

“BPP is intended for couples who are expecting or have recently had a child together. BPP is based on the PREP curriculum, which contributes much of the curriculum’s material on strengthening couple relationships. BPP’s primary focus is on helping participants prepare their relationships for the challenges of parenthood, thereby building protective factors and reducing adverse experiences for their children. BPP includes empirically based information on child development and parenting, and it teaches skills for reducing common relationship and personal stressors following the addition of a new baby, with particular emphasis on relationship skill-building, self-care, information about infants, and building support networks to reduce isolation.”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

===For Our Future, For Our Family===

* Curriculum Length: 30 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: [[PAIRS Foundation]] 

“Objectives of FOF are to help couples deepen intimacy on a foundation of emotional literacy, including skills for recognizing, navigating, and expressing a range of emotions; enhancing interpersonal communication; and constructively addressing differences and conflicts on behalf of a shared relationship vision. The curriculum helps each spouse know and nurture oneself and one’s partner, enjoy differences rather than see them as a threat, and learn to create a relationship that is an ongoing source of pleasure for both partners. FOF emphasizes bonding (emotional openness and physical closeness) in the relationship as a central theme.”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

===Loving Couples, Loving Children===

* Curriculum Length: 24 Hours
* Languages: English and Spanish
* Publisher: LCLC, Inc.

“LCLC is organized around the concept that the underpinning of a healthy relationship is a strong friendship, as indicated by positive emotions shared in nonconflict interactions. In addition, LCLC proposes a four-part process for problem-solving that includes gentle start-up of challenging conversations, accepting the validity of multiple perspectives, becoming skilled at repair-and-recovery conversations and at compromise. In LCLC workshops, couples are encouraged to share their hopes for themselves and their marriage and to explore the personal experiences that shape their beliefs and expectations. By discovering and validating each spouse’s values and dreams, the couple can reduce damaging interactions related to recurring problems and can build a sense of shared meaning and identity as a couple.”&lt;ref name="implementation"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6245">{{short description|a water quality parameter}}
'''Total suspended solids (TSS)''' is the [[Dry matter|dry-weight]] of suspended particles, that are not dissolved, in a sample of water that can be trapped by a [[filter (chemistry)|filter]] that is analyzed using a filtration apparatus. It is a [[water quality]] parameter used to assess the quality of a specimen of any type of water or water body, ocean water for example, or [[wastewater]] after treatment in a [[wastewater treatment plant]]. It is listed as a [[conventional pollutant]] in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 304(a)(4), {{USCSub|33|1314|a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total dissolved solids]] is another parameter acquired through a separate analysis which is also used to determine water quality based on the total substances that are fully dissolved within the water, rather than undissolved suspended particles.

TSS was previously called non-filterable residue ('''NFR'''), but was changed to TSS because of ambiguity in other scientific disciplines.

== Measurement ==
TSS of a water or [[wastewater]] sample is determined by pouring a carefully measured volume of water (typically one [[litre]]; but less if the particulate density is high, or as much as two or three litres for very clean water) through a pre-weighed filter of a specified pore size, then weighing the filter again after the drying process that removes all water on the filter. Filters for TSS measurements are typically composed of [[glass fibre]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Joy P. (1994). [http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/joysmanual/4tss.html "Measuring Total Suspended Solids and Turbidity in lakes and streams."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730171415/http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/wq/plants/management/joysmanual/4tss.html |date=2010-07-30 }} ''A Citizen's Guide to Understanding and Monitoring Lakes and Streams.'' State of Washington, Department of Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; The gain in weight is a dry weight measure of the particulates present in the water sample expressed in units derived or calculated from the volume of water filtered (typically milligrams per litre or mg/L).

If the water contains an appreciable amount of dissolved substances (as certainly would be the case when measuring TSS in [[seawater]]), these will add to the weight of the filter as it is dried.  Therefore it is necessary to "wash" the filter and sample with [[deionized water]] after filtering the sample and before drying the filter.  Failure to add this step is a fairly common mistake made by inexperienced laboratory technicians working with sea water samples, and will completely invalidate the results as the weight of salts left on the filter during drying can easily exceed that of the suspended particulate matter.

Although [[turbidity]] purports to measure approximately the same water quality property as TSS, the latter is more useful because it provides an actual weight of the particulate material present in the sample. In water quality monitoring situations, a series of more labor-intensive TSS measurements will be paired with relatively quick and easy turbidity measurements to develop a site-specific correlation.  Once satisfactorily established, the correlation can be used to estimate TSS from more frequently made turbidity measurements, saving time and effort. Because turbidity readings are somewhat dependent on particle size, shape, and color, this approach requires calculating a correlation equation for each location.  Further, situations or conditions that tend to suspend larger particles through water motion (e.g., increase in a [[current (stream)|stream current]] or wave action) can produce higher values of TSS not necessarily accompanied by a corresponding increase in turbidity. This is because particles above a certain size (essentially anything larger than silt) are not measured by a bench turbidity meter (they settle out before the reading is taken), but contribute substantially to the TSS value.

== Definition problems ==
Although TSS appears to be a straightforward measure of particulate weight obtained by separating particles from a water sample using a filter, it suffers as a defined quantity from the fact that particles occur in nature in essentially a continuum of sizes. At the lower end, TSS relies on a cut-off established by properties of the filter being used. At the upper end, the cut-off should be the exclusion of all particulates too large to be "[[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]]" in water.  However, this is not a fixed particle size but is dependent upon the energetics of the situation at the time of sampling: moving water suspends larger particles than does still water. Usually it is the case that the additional suspended material caused by the movement of the water is of interest.

These problems in no way invalidate the use of TSS; consistency in method and technique can overcome short-comings in most cases.  But comparisons between studies may require a careful review of the methodologies used to establish that the studies are in fact measuring the same thing.

TSS in mg/L can be calculated as:
: (dry weight of residue and filter - dry weight of filter alone, in grams)/ mL of sample * 1,000,000

'''Toxicology testing''', also known as '''safety assessment''', or '''toxicity testing''', is conducted to determine the degree to which a substance can damage a living or non-living organisms.  It is often conducted by researchers using standard test procedures to comply with governing regulations, for example for medicines and pesticides. Much toxicology is considered to be part of the field of [[preclinical development]]. Stages of ''in vitro'' and ''in vivo'' research are conducted to determine safe doses of exposure in humans before a [[first-in-man study]]. Toxicology testing may be conducted by the [[pharmaceutical industry]], [[biotechnology]] companies or [[contract research organizations]].

== History ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}

=== Europe ===

Around one million animals, primate and non–primate, are used every year in Europe in toxicology tests.&lt;ref name=Abbott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbott |first=A |url=http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf |title=Animal testing: More than a cosmetic change |journal=Nature |volume=438 |issue=7065 |pages=144–146 |date=November 10, 2005 |pmid=16281001 |doi=10.1038/438144a |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227041442/http://ethics.ucsd.edu/journal/2006/readings/Animal_Testing_More_than_a_cosmetic_change.pdf |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, one-fifth of animal experiments are toxicology tests.&lt;ref name=Lords3&gt; [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldanimal/150/15006.htm Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures Report], House of Lords, Chapter 3: The purpose and nature of animal experiments.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal testing for cosmetic purposes is currently banned all across the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/cosmetics/animal-testing_en|title=Ban on Animal Testing - Growth - European Commission|author=|date=|website=Growth|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

Toxicity tests examine finished products such as [[pesticide]]s, [[medication]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[food additives]] such as [[artificial sweetener]]s, packing materials,  and [[air freshener]], or their chemical ingredients.  The substances are applied to the skin or eyes; injected [[intravenous]]ly, [[intramuscular]]ly, or [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly; inhaled either by placing a mask over the animals and restraining them, or by placing them in an inhalation chamber; or administered orally, through a tube into the stomach, or placing them in the animals' food. Doses may be given once, repeated regularly for many months, or for the lifespan of the animal.  Toxicity tests can also be conducted on materials need to be disposed such as sediment to be disposed in marine environment.

== Contract research organizations ==
{{Main|Contract research organization}}

A contract research organization (CRO) is an organization that provides support to the  [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[biotechnology]], chemical, and medical device industries in the form of research services [[Outsourcing|outsourced]] on a contract basis.  A CRO may provide toxicity testing services, along with others such as assay development, [[Pre-clinical development|preclinical research]], [[clinical research]], clinical trials management, and [[pharmacovigilance]]. CROs also support foundations, research institutions, and universities, in addition to governmental organizations (such as the [[NIH]], [[European Medicines Agency|EMEA]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100311082536/http://www.acrohealth.org/cro-market.php "The CRO Market"], Association of Clinical Research Organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regulation ==
=== United States ===
In the United States, toxicology tests are subject to [[Good Laboratory Practice]] guidelines and other [[Food and Drug Administration]] laws.

'''''War and Peace in the Global Village''''' by [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Quentin Fiore]] is a collage of images and text that illustrates the effects of electronic media and new technology on man.  Marshall McLuhan used [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' as a major inspiration for this study of war throughout history as an indicator as to how war may be conducted in the future. (1st Ed.: Bantam, NY; reissued by [[Gingko Press]], 2001  {{ISBN|1-58423-074-6}}),

Joyce's ''Wake'' is claimed to be a gigantic cryptogram which reveals a cyclic pattern for the whole history of man through its '''Ten Thunders'''. Each "thunder" below is a 100-character portmanteau of other words to create a statement he likens to an effect that each technology has on the society into which it is introduced. In order to glean the most understanding out of each, the reader must break the portmanteau into separate words (and many of these are themselves portmanteaus of words taken from multiple languages other than English) and speak them aloud for the spoken effect of each word. There is much dispute over what each portmanteau truly denotes.

McLuhan claims that the ten thunders in ''Wake'' represent different stages in the history of man:&lt;ref&gt;''War and Peace in the Global Village'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Thunder 1: Paleolithic to Neolithic.'' Speech. Split of East/West. From herding to harnessing animals.
*''Thunder 2: Clothing as weaponry.'' Enclosure of private parts. First social aggression.
*''Thunder 3: Specialism.'' Centralism via wheel, transport, cities: civil life.
*''Thunder 4: Markets and truck gardens.'' Patterns of nature submitted to greed and power.
*''Thunder 5: Printing.'' Distortion and translation of human patterns and postures and pastors.
*''Thunder 6: Industrial Revolution.'' Extreme development of print process and individualism.
*''Thunder 7: Tribal man again.'' All choractors end up separate, private man. Return of choric.
*''Thunder 8: Movies.'' Pop art, pop Kulch via tribal radio. Wedding of sight and sound.
*''Thunder 9: Car and Plane.'' Both centralizing and decentralizing at once create cities in crisis. Speed and death.
*''Thunder 10: Television.'' Back to tribal involvement in tribal mood-mud. The last thunder is a turbulent, muddy wake, and murk of non-visual, tactile man.

Throckmorton has come out strongly against the [[Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill]]. In turn, former endorsers of his work, such as [[Scott Lively]], have denounced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2012/08/13/47584|title = Scott Lively: Moral Relativist|author = Rob Tisinai|date = August 13, 2012|publisher = Box Turtle Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throckmorton has been involved in controversy over the origins and treatment of variations in gender identity. The February 2008 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'' carried an article discussing how Throckmorton has advised people who are in agony over being transgender that their desires are not in accord with the Bible.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kennedy, John W. |date=February 2008 |title=The transgender moment; Evangelicals hope to respond with both moral authority and biblical compassion to gender identity disorder |work=[[Christianity Today]] |pages=54–58 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=53605}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Even if science does determine differentiation in the brain at birth," Throckmorton says, "even if there are prenatal influences, we can't set aside teachings of the Bible, because of research findings."&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2008"/&gt; Throckmorton subsequently argued that these comments were quoted "out of context". On his blog, he stated that people should consult physicians, specialists, and spiritual advisors in resolving their feelings. If someone decides that sexual reassignment violates faith, then this feeling may guide their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wthrockmorton.com/2008/02/14/christianity-today-on-the-transgender-moment/ Christianity Today on “The Transgender Moment” — Warren Throckmorton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Jeff Sharlet said that Throckmorton has allowed data and evidence to shape his views "in a way very few people of any ideological or political stripe would."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/evangelical-professor-turned-reparative-therapy-gays-174326663.html|title=The evangelical professor who turned against 'reparative therapy' for gays|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; That article goes on to trace Throckmorton's on-going development of his views on human sexuality and the Bible, which he still believes is divinely inspired. To say it more clearly, Throckmorton has blogged: "After working with LGBT people for two decades, I believe some people are inherently gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2017/11/15/wishful-thinking-and-nashville-statement/|title=Wishful Thinking, Forced Intimacy, and The Nashville Statement|last=Throckmorton|first=Warren|date=2017-11-15|work=Warren Throckmorton|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blogging controversies ==
In addition to his writings on sexuality, he has also blogged on various Christian religious organizations involved in controversy, such as:

{{For|medical water treatment|Water cure (therapy)}}
[[File:Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant.jpg|thumb|Dalecarlia Water Treatment Plant, Washington, D.C.]]
'''Water treatment''' is any process that improves the [[Water quality|quality]] of [[water]] to make it more acceptable for a specific end-use. The end use may be [[drinking water|drinking]], industrial water supply, [[irrigation]], river flow maintenance, water recreation or many other uses, including being safely returned to the environment.  Water treatment removes [[contaminant]]s and undesirable components, or reduces their concentration so that the water becomes fit for its desired end-use.

==Treatment for drinking water production==
{{main|Water purification}}
Treatment for [[drinking water]] production involves the removal of contaminants from raw water to produce water that is [[wiktionary:Purity|pure]] enough for human consumption without any short term or long term risk of any adverse health effect. Substances that are removed during the process of drinking water treatment include [[suspended solids]], [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[virus]]es, [[fungi]], and [[mineral]]s such as [[iron]] and [[manganese]].

The processes involved in removing the contaminants include physical processes such as [[settling]] and [[filtration]],  [[chemical process]]es such as [[disinfection]] and [[flocculation|coagulation]] and biological processes such as [[slow sand filter|slow sand filtration]].

Measures taken to ensure water quality not only relate to the treatment of the water, but to its conveyance and distribution after treatment. It is therefore common practice to keep residual disinfectants in the treated water to kill bacteriological contamination during distribution.

[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) guidelines are a general set of standards intended to apply where better local standards are not implemented. More rigorous standards apply across Europe, the USA and in most other developed countries. followed throughout the world for drinking water quality requirements.

===Processes===
[[File:Prázdná aerační místnost, ÚV Káraný.jpg|thumb|upright|Empty aeration tank for iron precipitation]]
[[File:Pískové rychlofiltry odželezovny v Káraném v klidu.jpg|thumb|Tanks with sand filters to remove precipitated iron (not working at the time)]]

A combination selected from the following processes is used for municipal drinking water treatment worldwide:
* Pre-[[Water chlorination|chlorination]] for algae control and arresting biological growth
* [[Aeration]] along with pre-chlorination for removal of dissolved iron when present with small amounts relatively of manganese
* Coagulation for [[flocculation]] or slow-sand filtration
* Coagulant aids, also known as [[polyelectrolyte]]s – to improve coagulation and for more robust floc formation
* [[Sedimentation]] for solids separation  that is the removal of suspended solids trapped in the floc
* [[Filtration]] to remove particles from water either by passage through a sand bed that can be washed and reused or by passage through a purpose designed filter that may be washable.
* Disinfection for killing bacteria viruses and other pathogens.

Technologies for potable water and other uses are well developed, and generalized designs are available from which treatment processes can be selected for pilot testing on the specific source water. In addition, a number of private companies provide patented technological solutions for the treatment of specific contaminants. Automation of water and waste-water treatment is common in the developed world. Source water quality through the seasons, scale, and environmental impact can dictate capital costs and operating costs. End use of the treated water dictates the necessary quality monitoring technologies, and locally available skills typically dictate the level of automation adopted.

==Polluted water handling==
{{main article|Wastewater treatment}}
[[File:Bragança43.jpg|thumb|A sewage treatment plant in northern [[Portugal]].]]
Wastewater treatment is the process that removes the majority of the [[contaminant]]s from wastewater or [[sewage]] and produces both a liquid effluent suitable for disposal to the [[natural environment]] and a [[sludge]]. Biological processes can be employed in the treatment of wastewater and these processes may include, for example, [[aerated lagoon]]s, [[activated sludge]] or [[slow sand filter]]s. To be effective, sewage must be conveyed to a treatment plant by appropriate [[Sewage collection and disposal|pipes and infrastructure]] and the process itself must be subject to regulation and controls. Some wastewaters require different and sometimes specialized treatment methods. At the simplest level, treatment of sewage and most wastewaters is carried out through separation of [[solid]]s from [[liquid]]s, usually by [[Sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]]. By progressively converting dissolved material into solids, usually a biological floc, which is then settled out, an effluent stream of increasing purity is produced.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;{{cite report |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC |year=2004 |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-resources |title=Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems|id=EPA 832-R-04-001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. | title=Wastewater Engineering | year=1972 |publisher=McGraw-Hill | pages= | isbn=0-07-041675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial water and wastewater treatment===
{{main article|Industrial water treatment|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
Two of the main processes of industrial water treatment are ''boiler water treatment'' and ''cooling water treatment''. A large amount of proper water treatment can lead to the reaction of solids and bacteria within pipe work and boiler housing. Steam boilers can suffer from scale or [[corrosion]] when left untreated. Scale deposits can lead to weak and dangerous machinery, while additional fuel is required to heat the same level of water because of the rise in thermal resistance. Poor quality dirty water can become a breeding ground for bacteria such as ''[[Legionella]]'' causing a risk to public health.

With the proper treatment, a significant proportion of industrial on-site wastewater might be reusable. This can save money in three ways: lower charges for lower water consumption, lower charges for the smaller volume of effluent water discharged and lower energy costs due to the recovery of heat in recycled wastewater.

Corrosion in low pressure boilers can be caused by dissolved oxygen, acidity and excessive alkalinity. Water treatment therefore should remove the dissolved oxygen and maintain the boiler water with the appropriate pH and alkalinity levels.
Without effective water treatment, a cooling water system can suffer from scale formation, corrosion and fouling and may become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria. This reduces efficiency, shortens plant life and makes operations unreliable and unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cicek, V. |year=2013 |contribution=Corrosion and corrosion prevention in boilers |title=Cathodic protection: industrial solutions for protecting against corrosion | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons  |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=9781118737880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic water treatment==
Water supplied to domestic properties may be further treated before use, often using an in-line treatment process. Such treatments can include [[water softening]] or ion exchange. Many proprietary systems also claim to remove residual disinfectants and [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metal]] ions.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Desalination==
{{main article|Desalination}}
Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, [[reverse osmosis]] or [[distillation]].&lt;ref name=WarsingerEntropy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warsinger|first1=David M.|last2=Mistry|first2= Karan H.|last3=Nayar|first3=Kishor G.|last4=Chung|first4=Hyung Won|last5=Lienhard V|first5=John H.|title=Entropy Generation of Desalination Powered by Variable Temperature Waste Heat|website=Entropy|pages=7530-7566|doi=10.3390/e17117530|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both methods require more energy than water treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas or where water such as groundwater has high salinity.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Field processes==
{{main article|Portable water purification}}
Living away from drinking water supplies often requires some form of portable water treatment process. These can vary in complexity from the simple addition of a disinfectant tablet in a hiker's water bottle through to complex multi-stage processes carried by boat or plane to disaster areas.

==Ultra pure water production==
Some industries such as the production of [[silicon wafer]]s, space technology and many high quality [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] process require [[ultrapure water]]. The production of such water typically involves many stages, and can include reverse osmosis, ion exchange and several distillation stages using solid [[tin]] apparatus.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Early water treatment methods still used included sand filtration and chlorination. The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huisman |first1=L. |last2=Wood |first2=W.E. |date=1974 |chapter=Chapter 2. Filtration of Water Supplies |title=Slow Sand Filtration |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organization |page= |isbn=92-4-154037-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchan |first=James |date=2003 |title=Crowded with genius: the Scottish enlightenment: Edinburgh's moment of the mind |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780060558888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="Chelsea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html |title=History of the Chelsea Waterworks |last1=Frerichs |first1=Ralph R. |date= |website=John Snow |publisher=Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles |access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christman |first=Keith |date=September 1998 |title=The history of chlorine |url= |journal=WaterWorld |publisher=PennWell |location=Tulsa, OK |volume=14 |issue=8 |pages=66–67 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Developing countries===
{{Further|Self-supply of water and sanitation}}
[[Appropriate technology]] options in water treatment include both community-scale and household-scale [[Portable water purification|point-of-use]] (POU) or [[Self-supply of water and sanitation|self-supply]] designs.&lt;ref name=cawstHWT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs |title=Household Water Treatment Guide |publisher=Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology, Canada |date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such designs may employ [[SODIS|solar water disinfection]] methods, using solar irradiation to inactivate harmful waterborne microorganisms directly, mainly by the UV-A component of the solar spectrum, or indirectly through the presence of an oxide  [[photocatalysis|photocatalyst]], typically supported [[titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in its [[anatase]] or [[rutile]] phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sand as a low-cost support for titanium dioxide photocatalysts |url=http://www.materialsviews.com/sand-as-a-low-cost-support-for-titanium-dioxide-photocatalysts/ |work=Materials Views |publisher=Wiley VCH }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite progress in [[SODIS]] technology, military surplus water treatment units like the [[ERDLator]] are still frequently used in developing countries. Newer military style [[Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit]]s (ROWPU) are portable, self-contained water treatment plants are becoming more available for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lindsten, Don C. |title=Technology transfer: Water purification, U.S. Army to the civilian community |journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=September 1984 |pages=57–59 |doi=10.1007/BF02189057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For waterborne disease reduction to last, water treatment programs that research and development groups start in [[developing countries]] must be sustainable by the citizens of those countries. This can ensure the efficiency of such programs after the departure of the research team, as monitoring is difficult because of the remoteness of many locations.

== Energy consumption ==
Water treatment plants can be significant consumers of energy. In California, more than 4% of the  state's electricity consumption goes towards transporting moderate quality water over long distances, treating that water and treating sewage to a high standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph240/spearrin1/|title=Energy Costs of Water in California|website=large.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with high quality water sources which flow by gravity to the point of consumption, and where sewage flow and treatment can be undertaken using gravity systems, costs will be much lower.
Much of the energy requirements are in pumping. Processes that avoid the need for pumping tend to have overall low energy demands. Those water treatment technologies that have very low energy requirements including [[trickling filters]], [[slow sand filters]], gravity [[Aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]].

== Notable examples ==
A notable example that combines both wastewater treatment and drinking water treatment is [[NEWater]] in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/fournationaltaps|title=PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency|last=PUB|website=PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency|language=en|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEWater is a technology practised in Singapore that converts wastewater to potable water. More specifically, it is treated [[wastewater]] (sewage) that has been purified using [[Membrane technology|dual-membrane]] (via [[microfiltration]] and [[reverse osmosis]]) and ultraviolet technologies, in addition to conventional water treatment processes. The water is potable and is consumed by humans, but is mostly used by industries requiring high purity water. The total capacity of the plants is about 75,700 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/day. Some 6% of this is used for [[indirect potable use]], equal to about 1% of Singapore's potable water requirement of  14 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. The rest is used at [[wafer fabrication]] plants and other non-[[potable]] applications in industries in [[Woodlands, Singapore|Woodlands]], [[Tampines]], [[Pasir Ris]], and [[Ang Mo Kio]].

== Regulation by the US government ==

===Drinking water ===
The [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] requires the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to set standards for drinking water quality in [[public water system]]s (entities that provide water for human consumption to at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Safe Drinking Water Act. {{USPL|93|523}}; {{USStat|88|1660}}; {{USC|42|300f}} ''et seq.'' 1974-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcement of the standards is mostly carried out by state health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/primacy-enforcement-responsibility-public-water-systems |title=Primacy Enforcement Responsibility for Public Water Systems |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-09 |website=Drinking Water Requirements for States and Public Water Systems |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; States may set standards that are more stringent than the federal standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=June 2004 |title=Understanding the Safe Drinking Water Act |url=https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/overview-safe-drinking-water-act |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 816-F-04-030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants organized into six groups: microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic chemicals, organic chemicals and radionuclides.&lt;ref name="EPA DW contaminants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/your-drinking-water/table-regulated-drinking-water-contaminants |title=Table of Regulated Drinking Water Contaminants |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017-03-21 |website=Your Drinking Water |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA also identifies and lists unregulated contaminants which may require regulation. The ''[[Safe Drinking Water Act#Unregulated contaminants|Contaminant Candidate List]]'' is published every five years, and EPA is required to decide whether to regulate at least five or more listed contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/ccl/basic-information-ccl-and-regulatory-determination |title=Basic Information on the CCL and Regulatory Determination |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2017-04-26 |website=Contaminant Candidate List |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local drinking water utilities may apply for low interest loans, to make facility improvements, through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/drinkingwatersrf |title=Drinking Water State Revolving Fund |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-02 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wastewater ===
EPA and state environmental agencies set wastewater standards under the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. {{uspl|92|500}} Approved October 18, 1972. Amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, {{uspl|95|217}}, December 27, 1977; and the Water Quality Act of 1987, {{uspl|100|4}}, February 4, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Point source]]s must obtain surface water discharge permits through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Point sources include industrial facilities, municipal governments ([[sewage treatment]] plants and [[storm sewer]] systems), other government facilities such as [[List of United States military bases|military bases]], and some [[agricultural]] facilities, such as animal [[feedlot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes |title=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-15 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA sets basic national wastewater standards:
* The "Secondary Treatment Regulation" applies to municipal [[sewage treatment]] plants,&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "Secondary Treatment Regulation." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|133}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* [[Effluent guidelines]] are regulations for categories of industrial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-effluent-guidelines |title=Industrial Effluent Guidelines |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-05-04 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These standards are incorporated into the permits, which may include additional treatment requirements developed on a case-by-case basis. NPDES permits must be renewed every five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-basics |title=NPDES Permit Basics |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-23 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has authorized 46 state agencies to issue and enforce NPDES permits. EPA regional offices issues permits for the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information#tab-2 |title=NPDES State Program Information—State Program Authority |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-02-06 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater discharges to [[groundwater]] are regulated by the [[Safe Drinking Water Act#Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program|Underground Injection Control Program]] under the Safe Drinking Water Act.&lt;ref name="EPA-UIC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic |title=Protecting Underground Sources of Drinking Water from Underground Injection |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-01-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial assistance for improvements to sewage treatment facilities is available to state and local governments through the [[Clean Water State Revolving Fund]], a low interest loan program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/cwsrf |title=Clean Water State Revolving Fund |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-17 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
