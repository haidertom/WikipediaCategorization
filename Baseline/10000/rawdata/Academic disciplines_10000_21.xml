'''Academic art''', or '''academicism''' or '''academism''', is a style of [[painting]], [[sculpture]], and [[architecture]] produced under the influence of European [[academies of art]].  Specifically, academic art is the art and artists influenced by the standards of the French [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]], which was practiced under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Romanticism]], and the art that followed these two movements in the attempt to synthesize both of their styles, and which is best reflected by the paintings of [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Thomas Couture]], and [[Hans Makart]]. In this context it is often called "academism", "academicism", "[[L'art pompier|art pompier]]" (pejoratively), and "eclecticism", and sometimes linked with "[[historicism (art)|historicism]]" and "[[syncretism]]".

== The academies in history ==
The first academy of art was founded in [[Florence]] in Italy by [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], on 13 January 1563, under the influence of the architect [[Giorgio Vasari]] who called it the [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']] (Academy and Company for the Arts of Drawing) as it was divided in two different operative branches. While the Company was a kind of corporation which every working artist in Tuscany could join, the Academy comprised only the most eminent artistic personalities of Cosimo's court, and had the task of supervising the whole artistic production of the medicean state. In this medicean institution students learned the "arti del disegno" (a term coined by Vasari) and heard lectures on [[anatomy]] and [[geometry]]. Another academy, the [[Accademia di San Luca]] (named after the patron saint of painters, [[St. Luke]]), was founded about a decade later in [[Rome]]. The Accademia di San Luca served an educational function and was more concerned with [[art theory]] than the Florentine one. In 1582 [[Annibale Carracci]] opened his very influential ''Academy of Desiderosi'' in [[Bologna]] without official support; in some ways this was more like a traditional artist's workshop, but that he felt the need to label it as an "academy" demonstrates the attraction of the idea at the time.

Accademia di San Luca later served as the model for the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] founded in [[France]] in 1648, and which later became the [[Académie des beaux-arts]]. The Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was founded in an effort to distinguish artists "who were gentlemen practicing a liberal art" from craftsmen, who were engaged in manual labor. This emphasis on the intellectual component of artmaking had a considerable impact on the subjects and styles of academic art.

After the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture was reorganized in 1661 by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] whose aim was to control all the artistic activity in France, a controversy occurred among the members that dominated artistic attitudes for the rest of the century. This "battle of styles" was a conflict over whether [[Peter Paul Rubens]] or [[Nicolas Poussin]] was a suitable model to follow. Followers of Poussin, called "poussinistes", argued that line (disegno) should dominate art, because of its appeal to the intellect, while followers of Rubens, called "rubenistes", argued that color (colore) should dominate art, because of its appeal to emotion.

The debate was revived in the early 19th century, under the movements of [[Neoclassicism]] typified by the artwork of [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and [[Romanticism]] typified by the artwork of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. Debates also occurred over whether it was better to learn art by looking at nature, or to learn by looking at the artistic masters of the past.

Academies using the French model formed throughout Europe, and imitated the teachings and styles of the French Académie. In [[England]], this was the [[Royal Academy]]. The [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] founded in 1754, may be taken as a successful example in a smaller country, which achieved its aim of producing a national school and reducing the reliance on imported artists. The painters of the [[Danish Golden Age]] of roughly 1800-1850 were nearly all trained there, and many returned to teach and the history of the [[art of Denmark]] is much less marked by tension between academic art and other styles than is the case in other countries.

One effect of the move to academies was to make training more difficult for [[women artists]], who were excluded from most academies until the last half of the 19th century (1861 for the Royal Academy). This was partly because of concerns over the impropriety presented by nudity. Special arrangements were often made for female students until the 20th century.

== Development of the academic style ==
Since the onset of the poussiniste-rubeniste debate, many artists worked between the two styles. In the 19th century, in the revived form of the debate, the attention and the aims of the art world became to synthesize the line of [[Neoclassicism]] with the color of [[Romanticism]]. One artist after another was claimed by critics to have achieved the synthesis, among them [[Théodore Chassériau]], [[Ary Scheffer]], [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps]], and [[Thomas Couture]]. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], a later academic artist, commented that the trick to being a good painter is seeing "color and line as the same thing".
Thomas Couture promoted the same idea in a book he authored on art method &amp;mdash; arguing that whenever one said a painting had better color or better line it was nonsense, because whenever color appeared brilliant it depended on line to convey it, and vice versa; and that color was really a way to talk about the "value" of form.

Another development during this period included adopting historical styles in order to show the era in history that the painting depicted, called [[historicism (art)|historicism]]. This is best seen in the work of Baron [[Jan August Hendrik Leys]], a later influence on [[James Tissot]]. It's also seen in the development of the [[Neo-Grec]] style. Historicism is also meant to refer to the belief and practice associated with academic art that one should incorporate and conciliate the innovations of different traditions of art from the past.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dusk (Bouguereau).jpg|thumb|left|''Evening''. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1863.]]  --&gt;
The art world also grew to give increasing focus on [[allegory]] in art. Theories of the importance of both line and color asserted that through these elements an artist exerts control over the medium to create psychological effects, in which themes, emotions, and ideas can be represented. As artists attempted to synthesize these theories in practice, the attention on the artwork as an allegorical or figurative vehicle was emphasized. It was held that the representations in painting and sculpture should evoke [[Platonic form]]s, or ideals, where behind ordinary depictions one would glimpse something abstract, some eternal truth. Hence, [[John Keats|Keats']] famous musing "Beauty is truth, truth beauty". The paintings were desired to be an "idée", a full and complete idea. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau|Bouguereau]] is known to have said that he wouldn't paint "a war", but would paint "War". Many paintings by academic artists are simple nature allegories with titles like ''Dawn'', ''Dusk'', ''Seeing'', and ''Tasting'', where these ideas are personified by a single nude figure, composed in such a way as to bring out the essence of the idea.

The trend in art was also towards greater [[idealism (arts)|idealism]], which is contrary to [[realism (arts)|realism]], in that the figures depicted were made simpler and more abstract—idealized—in order to be able to represent the ideals they stood in for. This would involve both generalizing forms seen in nature, and subordinating them to the unity and theme of the artwork.

Because history and mythology were considered as plays or [[dialectic]]s of ideas, a fertile ground for important allegory, using themes from these subjects was considered the most serious form of painting. A [[hierarchy of genres]], originally created in the 17th century, was valued, where [[history painting]]—classical, religious, mythological, literary, and allegorical subjects—was placed at the top, next [[Genre works|genre painting]], then [[portrait]]ure, [[still-life]], and [[Landscape art|landscape]]. History painting was also known as the "grande genre". Paintings of [[Hans Makart]] are often larger than life historical dramas, and he combined this with a [[historicism (art)|historicism]] in decoration to dominate the style of 19th century [[Vienna]] culture. [[Paul Delaroche]] is a typifying example of French history painting.

All of these trends were influenced by the theories of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], who held that history was a dialectic of competing ideas, which eventually resolved in synthesis.

Towards the end of the 19th century, academic art had saturated European society. Exhibitions were held often, and the most popular exhibition was the [[Paris Salon]] and beginning in 1903, the [[Salon d'Automne]]. These [[Salon (gathering)#Public salons|salons]] were sensational events that attracted crowds of visitors, both native and foreign. As much a social affair as an artistic one, 50,000 people might visit on a single Sunday, and as many as 500,000 could see the exhibition during its two-month run. Thousands of pictures were displayed, hung from just below eye level all the way up to the ceiling in a manner now known as "Salon style". A successful showing at the salon was a seal of approval for an artist, making his work saleable to the growing ranks of private collectors. [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]], [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] were leading figures of this art world.

During the reign of academic art, the paintings of the [[Rococo]] era, previously held in low favor, were revived to popularity, and themes often used in Rococo art such as [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]] were popular again. The academic art world also idolized [[Raffaello Santi|Raphael]], for the [[idealism (art)|ideality]] of his work, in fact preferring him over [[Michelangelo]].

Academic [[Art in Poland]] flourished under [[Jan Matejko]], who established the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|Kraków Academy of Fine Arts]]. Many of these works can be seen in the
[[Sukiennice Museum|Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice]] in [[Kraków]].

Academic art not only held influence in Europe and the United States, but also extended its influence to other Western countries. This was especially true for [[Latin America]]n nations, which, because their revolutions were modeled on the [[French Revolution]], sought to emulate French culture. An example of a Latin American academic artist is [[Ángel Zárraga]] of [[Mexico]].

== Academic training ==
[[File:École des beaux-arts (from the live).jpg|thumb|315px|''Students painting "from life" at the École''. Photographed late 1800s.]]

Young artists spent four years in rigorous training. In France, only students who passed an exam and carried a letter of reference from a noted professor of art were accepted at the academy's school, the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Drawings and paintings of the nude, called "académies", were the basic building blocks of academic art and the procedure for learning to make them was clearly defined. First, students copied prints after classical sculptures, becoming familiar with the principles of contour, light, and shade. The copy was believed crucial to the academic education; from copying works of past artists one would assimilate their methods of art making. To advance to the next step, and every successive one, students presented drawings for evaluation.
[[File:Sykes-demos.JPG|thumb|left|150px|''Demosthenes at the Seashore'', a Royal Academy prize winning drawing, 1888.]]
If approved, they would then draw from plaster casts of famous classical sculptures. Only after acquiring these skills were artists permitted entrance to classes in which a live model posed. Painting was not taught at the École des Beaux-Arts until after 1863. To learn to paint with a brush, the student first had to demonstrate proficiency in drawing, which was considered the foundation of academic painting. Only then could the pupil join the studio of an academician and learn how to paint. Throughout the entire process, competitions with a predetermined subject and a specific allotted period of time measured each students' progress.

The most famous art competition for students was the [[Prix de Rome]]. The winner of the Prix de Rome was awarded a fellowship to study at the Académie française's [[French Academy in Rome|school at the Villa Medici]] in [[Rome]] for up to five years. To compete, an artist had to be of French nationality, male, under 30 years of age, and single. He had to have met the entrance requirements of the École and have the support of a well-known art teacher. The competition was grueling, involving several stages before the final one, in which 10 competitors were sequestered in studios for 72 days to paint their final history paintings. The winner was essentially assured a successful professional career.

As noted, a successful showing at the Salon was a seal of approval for an artist. Artists petitioned the hanging committee for optimal placement "on the line," or at eye level. After the exhibition opened, artists complained if their works were "skyed," or hung too high. The ultimate achievement for the professional artist was election to membership in the Académie française and the right to be known as an academician.

== Criticism and legacy ==
[[File:This Year Venuses Again (Daumier).jpg|thumb|241px|[[Caricature]] (French [[bourgeoisie]]): ''This Year Venuses Again… Always Venuses!''. [[Honoré Daumier]], No. 2 from series in ''Le Charivati'', 1864.]]

Academic art was first criticized for its use of [[idealism (art)|idealism]], by [[realism (arts)|Realist]] artists such as [[Gustave Courbet]], as being based on idealistic clichés and representing mythical and legendary motives while contemporary social concerns were being ignored. Another criticism by Realists was the "[[Licked finish|false surface]]" of paintings—the objects depicted looked smooth, slick, and idealized—showing no real texture. The Realist [[Théodule Ribot]] worked against this by experimenting with rough, unfinished textures in his painting.

Stylistically, the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], who advocated quickly [[plein air|painting outdoors]] exactly what the eye sees and the hand puts down, criticized the finished and idealized painting style. Although academic painters began a painting by first making drawings and then painting [[oil paint|oil sketches]] of their subject, the high polish they gave to their drawings seemed to the Impressionists tantamount to a lie. After the oil sketch, the artist would produce the final painting with the academic "fini," changing the painting to meet stylistic standards and attempting to idealize the images and add perfect detail. Similarly, [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] is constructed geometrically on a flat surface and is not really the product of sight, Impressionists disavowed the devotion to mechanical techniques.

Realists and Impressionists also defied the placement of still-life and landscape at the bottom of the hierarchy of genres. It is important to note that most Realists and Impressionists and others among the early avant-garde who rebelled against academism were originally students in academic [[wikt:atelier|ateliers]]. [[Claude Monet]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Édouard Manet]], and even [[Henri Matisse]] were students under academic artists.

As [[modern art]] and its avant-garde gained more power, academic art was further denigrated, and seen as sentimental, clichéd, conservative, non-innovative, [[bourgeois]], and "styleless". The French referred derisively to the style of academic art as ''[[L'art Pompier]]'' (''pompier'' means "fireman") alluding to the paintings of [[Jacques-Louis David]] (who was held in esteem by the academy) which often depicted soldiers wearing fireman-like helmets. The paintings were called "grandes machines" which were said to have manufactured false emotion through contrivances and tricks.

This denigration of academic art reached its peak through the writings of art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] who stated that all academic art is "[[kitsch]]". Other artists, such as the [[Symbolist painters]] and some of the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], were kinder to the tradition{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}. As painters who sought to bring imaginary vistas to life, these artists were more willing to learn from a strongly representational tradition. Once the tradition had come to be looked on as old-fashioned, the [[allegory|allegorical]] nudes and theatrically posed figures struck some viewers as bizarre and dreamlike.

With the goals of [[Postmodernism]] in giving a fuller, more sociological and pluralistic account of history, academic art has been brought back into history books and discussion. Nevertheless, since the early 1990s, academic art has experienced a limited resurgence through the [[Classical Realism|Classical Realist]] [[Atelier Method|atelier]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Panero, James: "The New Old School", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, September 2006, page 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the art is gaining a broader appreciation by the public at large, and whereas academic paintings once would only fetch a few hundreds of dollars in auctions, some now fetch millions.

'''Accent reduction''', also known as&amp;nbsp;'''accent modification''' or '''accent neutralization''', is a systematic approach for learning or adopting a new&amp;nbsp;speech [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]. It is the process of learning the sound system (or&amp;nbsp;[[phonology]]) and melodic intonation of a language so the non-native speaker can communicate with clarity to be understood by the general public of this second language. &amp;nbsp;

Accent reduction training is not the same as [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] (English as a Second Language) classes. Accent reduction classes go beyond learning vocabulary and grammar and focus upon clarity of speech and fine tuning a specific accent or dialect. Foreign accent reduction training is typically appropriate for adult learners who have at least a moderate level of conversational proficiency in the second language. Non-native speakers from any background or profession can benefit from accent reduction training. That is not to say that every non-native speaker needs to modify their accent, however. The goal of accent reduction training is to improve speaking clarity so the non-native speaker is understood in the workplace as well as within their community; not necessarily to totally eliminate the accent. Business professionals, physicians, professors, researchers, telemarketers, etc. oftentimes request accent reduction training be provided by their employers so they can communicate more effectively with their colleagues, clients, and customers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://accentfreedom.com/what-is-accent-reduction/|title=What Is Accent Reduction?|last=Christensen|first=Barbara|date=September 13, 2017|website=Accent Freedom|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Foreign born students and professionals can benefit from accent modification training to improve their English intelligibility to be more competitive when interviewing for jobs. &amp;nbsp;Under U.S. labor law, employers can make job decisions based on accent if it interferes with work. The federal&amp;nbsp;[[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]&amp;nbsp;does receive a small number of complaints every year from individuals who believe they are victims of accent-related job discrimination.[[Accent reduction#cite note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Two distinct types of accent reduction training are available: self-study and instructor-led. &amp;nbsp;There are many types of self-study books, apps, cds, and software systems on the market. &amp;nbsp;Some of these products offer materials that are unique to individuals from specific language backgrounds. &amp;nbsp;The self-study learning methods can be helpful especially if audios are included so the user can hear the correct pronunciations. &amp;nbsp;Instructor-led training, although significantly more expensive than the self-study option, allows students to receive personalized instruction, obtain immediate feedback from the trainer, and typically make more timely progress. &amp;nbsp;Instructor-led training is available in a variety of ways: &amp;nbsp;1:1 with an instructor, small group training, seminars, or workshops. &amp;nbsp;Delivery can occur in person, web-based using webcams, or via telephone.

==Training==
Accent modification is offered by various certified speech-language trainers, linguists, and specialists in&amp;nbsp;[[English as a second language|ESL]]. In the&amp;nbsp;[[United States]], they are promoted by various organizations including the&amp;nbsp;[http://accentfreedom.com/ Accent Freedom], the&amp;nbsp;[[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association]]&amp;nbsp;(ASHA), the&amp;nbsp;[http://speak-well.org/ Accent Reduction Training Association] (ARTA), [http://www.corspan.org/ Corporate Speech Pathology Network] (CORSPAN), &amp;nbsp;[https://www.vasta.org/ Voice, Speech Trainers Association] (VASTA).

Instructor-led courses typically start with a speech assessment to determine a student’s unique needs. &amp;nbsp;[[Speech production]] is a very complicated process involving coordinating movements of the lips, tongue, jaw, vocal cords, and respiratory system. &amp;nbsp;Speakers from different language backgrounds have different speech patterns when speaking English as they are attempting to implement their own language’s pronunciation rules while speaking English. &amp;nbsp;Even people from the same language background can have differing speech patterns based upon the age at which they learned English, the characteristics of their teacher’s speech, and influences of other languages they may speak.

Areas of focus may include teaching students clear [[Articulation (phonetics)|articulation]] of vowels and consonants as well as the intonation patterns that are unique to each language. &amp;nbsp;The learning sequence is typically broken down into progressive learning segments until they cumulate into using the newly learned skills in conversation. Additional areas might include linking, rate, or voice projection. &amp;nbsp;Instructor-led accent training will also frequently include conversational practice to help the student transfer these newly learned skills into everyday conversations. &amp;nbsp;

Training timelines can vary from a few days to several months depending upon the chosen model of instruction. &amp;nbsp;Outside practice time is essential for the participant to see significant changes in their speech.

&amp;nbsp;Although accents can be minimized through training, actually eliminating an accent is extremely difficult to master and could take years to accomplish. &amp;nbsp;It is unrealistic to expect total accent elimination in a short period of time. &amp;nbsp;

Accent improvement focuses on teaching students how to pronounce difficult sounds such as {{IPA|/θ/}}, {{IPA|/ð/}}, {{IPA|/ɹ/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, and {{IPA|/w/}}; intonation, stress, and rhythm. Spanish and Portuguese speakers might add an {{IPA|/h/}} before the vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, as in "his" for "is". Therefore, vowel sounds are also covered in accent reduction training. Practicing of the vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} most commonly spelled "i" is done by reciting a few of the following differences: his versus is, hit versus it, hill versus ill. By not letting the back of their tongue touch the palate, native speakers of Asian languages (Chinese, etc.) can avoid adding a {{IPA|/j/}} before the {{IPA|/ɪ/}} for example in speaking "yin" instead of "in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Although the accents can be reduced through training, some [[linguists]] warn against giving students a false hope that they will lose their [[Accent (dialect)|accents]]. According to [[Dennis Baron]], a [[linguistics]] professor at the [[University of Illinois]] at Urbana-Champaign, eliminating an accent is difficult. Calming an accent, he said, takes years of interaction with native English speakers. Even so, under U.S. labor law, employers can make job decisions based on accent if it interferes with work. The federal [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] does receive a small number of complaints every year from individuals who believe they are victims of accent-related job discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19580">'''Acoustical engineering''' (also known as '''acoustic engineering''') is the branch of [[engineering]] dealing with [[sound]] and [[oscillation|vibration]]. It is the application of [[acoustics]], the science of sound and vibration, in technology. Acoustical engineers are typically concerned with the design, analysis and control of sound.

One goal of acoustical engineering can be the reduction of unwanted noise, which is referred to as [[noise control]]. Unwanted noise can have significant impacts on animal and human health and well-being, reduce attainment by pupils in schools, and cause hearing loss.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=World Health Organisation|title=Burden of disease from  environmental noise|year=2011|publisher=WHO|isbn=978 92 890 0229 5|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/136466/e94888.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noise control]] principles are implemented into technology and design in a variety of ways, including control by redesigning sound sources, the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers, suppressors, and buffer zones, and the use of hearing protection ([[earmuffs]] or [[earplug]]s).

[[Image:Hamer Hall equipment detail.jpg|right|thumb|The transparent [[sound baffle|baffle]]s inside this auditorium were installed to optimise sound projection and reproduction, key factors in acoustical engineering.]]

But acoustical engineering is not just about [[noise control]]; it also covers positive uses of sound, from the use of [[ultrasound]] in medicine to the programming of digital sound [[synthesizer]]s, and from designing a concert hall to enhance the sound of an orchestra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barron|first=Michael|title=Auditorium Acoustics and Architectural Design|year=2009|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0419245100}}&lt;/ref&gt; to specifying a railway station's sound system so announcements are [[Intelligibility (communication)|intelligible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ahnert|first=Wolfgang|title=Sound Reinforcement Engineering: Fundamentals and Practice|year=2000|isbn=978-0415238700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustic engineer (professional) {{anchor|acoustic engineer}} ==

Acoustic engineers usually possess a [[bachelor's degree]] or higher qualification in [[acoustics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Education in acoustics |title= MSc Engineering Acoustics, DTU |url=http://www.dtu.dk/english/Education/msc/Programmes/engineering_acoustics|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[physics]] or another [[engineering]] discipline. Practicing as an acoustic engineer usually requires a [[bachelor's degree]] with significant scientific and mathematical content. Acoustic engineers might work in acoustic consultancy, specializing in particular fields, such as [[architectural acoustics]], [[environmental noise]] or [[vibration control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Careers Service|title=Job profiles: Acoustics consultant|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/acousticsconsultant.aspx|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other industries, acoustic engineers might: design [[automobile]] sound systems; investigate human response to sounds, such as urban soundscapes and domestic appliances; develop audio signal processing software for mixing desks, and design loudspeakers and microphones for mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Graduate Jobs in Acoustics|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/careers/index.php?content=roles|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=Acoustics and You|url=http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|accessdate=13 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308225726/http://acousticalsociety.org/education_outreach/careers_in_acoustics|archive-date=2017-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acousticians are also involved in researching and understanding sound scientifically. Some positions, such as [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]] require a [[Doctor of Philosophy]].

In most countries, a degree in [[acoustics]] can represent the first step towards [[professional certification]] and the degree program may be certified by a [[professional body]]. After completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated the title of [[Chartered Engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth]] countries).

==Subdisciplines==

The listed subdisciplines are loosely based on the PACS ([[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]]) coding used by the [[Acoustical Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Acoustical Society of America|title=PACS 2010 Regular Edition—Acoustics Appendix|url=http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111126/http://www.aip.org/pacs/pacs2010/individuals/pacs2010_regular_edition/reg_acoustics_appendix.htm|archive-date=2013-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aeroacoustics===
{{main|Aeroacoustics}}

[[Aeroacoustics]] is concerned with how noise is generated by the movement of air, for instance via turbulence, and how sound propagates through the fluid air. Aeroacoustics plays an important role in understanding how noise is generated by [[aircraft]] and [[wind turbine]]s, as well as exploring how [[wind instrument|wind]] [[musical instrument]]s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=da Silva|first=Andrey Ricardo|title=Aeroacoustics of Wind Instruments: Investigations and Numerical Methods|year=2009|publisher=VDM Verlag|isbn=978-3639210644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio signal processing===
{{main|Audio signal processing}}

[[Audio signal processing]] is the electronic manipulation of audio signals using [[Analog signal processing|analog]] and [[digital signal processing]].

[[Audio signal processing]] is done for a variety of reasons such as:
* to enhance a sound, for instance by applying an audio effect such as [[reverberation]];
* to remove unwanted noises from a signal, for instance [[echo cancellation]] on [[Skype]];
* to compress an audio signal to allow efficient transmission, e.g. perceptual coding in [[MP3]] and [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]], and 
* to understand the content of the signal, e.g. [[music information retrieval]] to allow the identification of music tracks via [[Shazam (service)]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pohlmann|first=Ken|title=Principles of Digital Audio, Sixth Edition|year=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=9780071663472|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Audio engineers]] develop and use [[audio signal processing]] algorithms.

===Bioacoustics===
{{main|Bioacoustics}}

Bioacoustics usually concerns the scientific study of sound production and hearing in animals. It can include: acoustic communication and associated animal behaviour and evolution of species; how sound is produced by animals; the auditory mechanisms and neurophysiology of animals; the use of sound to monitor animal populations, and the effect of man-made noise on animals.&lt;ref name= "bioacoustics"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ASA|url=http://www.animalbioacoustics.org/bioacoustics.html |title= Acoustical Society of America Animal Bioacoustics Technical Committee.

[[Image:Woodstock 2007.jpg|right|thumb|At outdoor concerts like [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock]], acoustic analysis is critical to creating the best experience for the audience and the performers.]]
Environmental acoustics is concerned with the control of noise and vibrations caused by traffic, aircraft, industrial equipment, recreational activities and anything else that might be considered a nuisance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Acoustical engineers concerned with environmental acoustics face the challenge of measuring or predicting likely noise levels, determining an acceptable level for that noise, and determining how the noise can be controlled. Environmental acoustics work is usually done by acoustic consultants or those working in [[environmental health]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Recent research work has put a strong emphasis on [[soundscape]]s, the positive use of sound (e.g. fountains, bird song), and the preservation of [[tranquility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kang|first=Jian|title=Urban Sound Environment|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0415358576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical acoustics===
{{main|Musical acoustics}}

Musical acoustics is concerned with researching and describing the physics of music and its perception – how [[sound]]s employed as [[music]] work. This includes: the function and design of [[musical instrument]]s including electronic [[synthesizers]]; the human voice (the [[physics]] and [[neurophysiology]] of [[singing]]); computer analysis of music and composition; the clinical use of music in music therapy, and the perception and cognition of [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Technical Committee on Musical Acoustics (TCMU) of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA)|url=http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/|title=ASA TCMU Home Page|accessdate=22 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010613120620/http://www.public.coe.edu/~jcotting/tcmu/|archive-date=2001-06-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise control===
{{main|Noise control}}

Noise control is a set of strategies to reduce [[noise pollution]] by reducing noise at its source, by inhibiting sound propagation using [[noise barrier]]s or similar, or by the use of ear protection ([[earmuffs]] or [[earplug]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bies|first=David|title=Engineering Noise Control: Theory and Practice|year=2009|isbn=978-0415487078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control at the source is the most cost-effective way of providing noise control. Noise control engineering applied to cars and trucks is known as [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] (NVH). Other techniques to reduce product noise include [[vibration isolation]], application of acoustic absorbent and acoustic enclosures. Acoustical engineering can go beyond noise control to look at what is the best sound for a product,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University of Salford|title=Making products sound better|url=http://www.acoustics.salford.ac.uk/res/cox/sound_quality/}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, manipulating the sound of door closures on [[automobile]]s.

===Psychoacoustics===
{{main|Psychoacoustics}}

[[Psychoacoustics]] tries to explain how humans respond to what they hear, whether that is an annoying noise or beautiful music. In many branches of acoustic engineering, a human listener is a final arbitrator as to whether a design is successful, for instance, whether [[sound localisation]] works in a [[surround sound]] system. "Psychoacoustics seeks to reconcile acoustical stimuli and all the scientific, objective, and physical properties that surround them, with the physiological and psychological responses evoked by them."&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Speech===
{{main|Speech}}

Speech is a major area of study for acoustical engineering, including the production, processing and perception of speech. This can include [[physics]], [[physiology]], [[psychology]], [[audio signal processing]] and [[linguistics]]. [[Speech recognition]] and [[speech synthesis]] are two important aspects of the machine processing of speech. Ensuring [[speech transmission index|speech is transmitted intelligibly]], efficiently and with high quality; in rooms, through public address systems and through telephone systems are other important areas of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Speech Communication Technical Committee|title=Speech Communication|url=http://acosoc.org/TechComm/SCTC/|publisher=Acoustical Society of America|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Ultrasound}}
[[File:CRL Crown rump lengh 12 weeks ecografia Dr. Wolfgang Moroder.jpg|thumb|right|Ultrasound image of a fetus in the womb, viewed at 12 weeks of pregnancy (bidimensional-scan)]]Ultrasonics deals with sound waves in solids, liquids and gases at frequencies too high to be heard by the average person. Specialists areas include medical ultrasonics (including [[medical ultrasonography]]), [[sonochemistry]], [[nondestructive testing]], material characterisation and [[underwater acoustics]] ([[sonar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ensminger|first=Dale|title=Ultrasonics: Fundamentals, Technologies, and Applications|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underwater acoustics===
{{main|Underwater acoustics}}

Underwater acoustics is the scientific study of sound in water. It is concerned with both natural and man-made sound and its generation underwater; how it propagates, and the perception of the sound by animals. Applications include [[sonar]] to locate submerged objects such as [[submarines]], underwater communication by animals, observation of sea temperatures for climate change monitoring, and marine biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ASA Underwater Acoustics Technical Committee |title=Underwater Acoustics |url=http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/ASA-UATC/index.php |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730104616/http://www.apl.washington.edu/projects/ASA-UATC/index.php |archivedate=30 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibration and dynamics===
{{main|Vibration}}

Acoustic engineers working on [[vibration]] study the motions and interactions of mechanical systems with their environments, including measurement, analysis and control. This might include: [[ground vibrations]] from railways and construction; [[vibration isolation]] to reduce noise getting into recording studios; studying the effects of vibration on humans ([[vibration white finger]]); [[vibration control]] to protect a bridge from [[earthquakes]], or modelling the propagation of structure-borne sound through buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Structural Acoustics &amp; Vibration Technical Committee |title=Structural Acoustics &amp; Vibration Technical Committee |url=http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~bbard/savtc.html |accessdate=22 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103180745/http://fubini.swarthmore.edu/~bbard/savtc.html |archivedate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamental science==

Although the way in which sound interacts with its surroundings is often extremely complex, there are a few ideal sound wave behaviours that are fundamental to understanding acoustical design.  Complex sound wave behaviors include [[Absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], [[reverberation]], [[diffraction]], and [[refraction]]. Absorption is the loss of energy that occurs when a sound wave reflects off of a surface. Just as light waves reflect off of surfaces, sound waves also reflect off of surfaces, and every reflection results in a loss of energy.  Absorption refers both to the sound that transmits through and the energy that is dissipated by a material.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 2002, ch. 7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reverberation is the persistence of sound that is caused by repeated boundary reflections after the source of the sound stops. This principle is particularly important in enclosed spaces.  In addition to reflecting off of surfaces, sound waves also bend around surfaces in the path of the waves.  This bending is known as diffraction.  Refraction is another kind of sound wave bending.  This type of bending, however, is caused by changes in the medium through which the wave is passing and not the presence of obstacles in the path of a sound wave.  Temperature gradients, for example, cause bending in sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Hemond, 1983, pp. 24–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustical engineers apply these fundamental concepts, along with complex mathematical analysis, to control sound for a variety of applications.

'''Analytics''' is the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in [[data]] and applying those patterns towards effective decision making. In other words, analytics can be understood as the connective tissue between data and effective decision making, within an organization. Especially valuable in areas rich with recorded information, analytics relies on the simultaneous application of [[statistics]], [[computer programming]] and [[operations research]] to quantify performance. 

Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include [[predictive analytics]], [[prescriptive analytics]], [[enterprise decision management]], descriptive analytics, cognitive analytics, Big Data Analytics, retail analytics, supply chain analytics, store assortment and [[stock-keeping unit]] optimization, marketing optimization and [[marketing mix modeling]], [[web analytics]], call analytics, [[speech analytics]], sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive science, credit [[risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]], and [[fraud detection|fraud analytics]]. Since analytics can require extensive computation (see [[big data]]), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohavi, Rothleder and Simoudis|title=Emerging Trends in Business Analytics|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=2002|volume=45|issue=8|pages=45–48|doi=10.1145/545151.545177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis is focused on understanding the past; what happened.  Analytics focuses on why it happened and what will happen next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1332172|title=Analysis vs. Analytics: Past vs. Future|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analytics is a [[academic discipline|multidisciplinary]] field. There is extensive use of computer skills, mathematics and statistics, the use of descriptive techniques and predictive models to gain valuable knowledge from data.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The insights from data are used to recommend action or to guide decision making rooted in business context. Thus, analytics is not so much concerned with individual analyses or analysis steps, but with the entire [[methodology]]{{according to whom|date=March 2018}}. There is a pronounced tendency to use the term ''analytics'' in business settings e.g. [[text analytics]] vs. the more generic [[text mining]] to emphasize this broader perspective. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} There is an increasing use of the term ''advanced analytics'',{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} typically used to describe the technical aspects of analytics, especially in the emerging fields such as the use of [[machine learning]] techniques like [[neural networks]], Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, linear to multiple regression analysis, Classification to do [[predictive modeling]]. It also includes Unsupervised Machine learning techniques like cluster analysis, Principal Component Analysis, segmentation profile analysis and association analysis.

== Application of analytics ==

=== Marketing optimization ===
Marketing has evolved from a creative process into a highly data-driven process. Marketing organizations use analytics to determine the outcomes of campaigns or efforts and to guide decisions for investment and consumer targeting. Demographic studies, customer segmentation, conjoint analysis and other techniques allow marketers to use large amounts of consumer purchase, survey and panel data to understand and communicate marketing strategy.

[[Web analytics]] allows marketers to collect session-level information about interactions on a website using an operation called [[sessionization]]. [[Google Analytics]] is an example of a popular free analytics tool that marketers use for this purpose. Those interactions provide web analytics information systems with the information necessary to track the referrer, search keywords, identify IP address, and track activities of the visitor. With this information, a marketer can improve marketing campaigns, website creative content, and information architecture.

Analysis techniques frequently used in marketing include marketing mix modeling, pricing and promotion analyses, sales force optimization and customer analytics e.g.: segmentation. Web analytics and optimization of web sites and online campaigns now frequently work hand in hand with the more traditional marketing analysis techniques. A focus on digital media has slightly changed the vocabulary so that ''marketing mix modeling'' is commonly referred to as ''attribution modeling'' in the digital or [[marketing mix modeling]] context.

These tools and techniques support both strategic marketing decisions (such as how much overall to spend on marketing, how to allocate budgets across a portfolio of brands and the marketing mix) and more tactical campaign support, in terms of targeting the best potential customer with the optimal message in the most cost effective medium at the ideal time.

=== People analytics ===
People Analytics is using behavioral data to understand how people work and change how companies are managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://professional.mit.edu/programs/short-programs/people-analytics|title=People Analytics: Transforming Management with Behavioral Data|last=lukem|date=2016-11-04|work=Programs for Professionals {{!}} MIT Professional Education|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People analytics is also known as workforce analytics, HR analytics, talent analytics, people insights, talent insights, colleague insights, human capital analytics, and HRIS analytics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.analyticsinhr.com/blog/difference-between-people-analytics-and-hr-analytics/|title=[VIDEO] The Difference Between People Analytics and HR Analytics|date=2018-03-08|work=Analytics in HR|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; HR analytics is the application of analytics to help companies manage [[human resources]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} The aim is to discern which employees to hire, which to reward or promote, what responsibilities to assign, and similar human resource problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/wharton-people-analytics|title=People analytics - University of Pennsylvania|publisher=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; HR analytics is becoming increasingly important to understand what kind of behavioral profiles would succeed and fail. For example, an analysis may find that individuals that fit a certain type of profile are those most likely to succeed at a particular role, making them the best employees to hire.

However, there are key differences between people analytics and HR analytics. “People Analytics solves business problems. HR Analytics solves HR problems. People Analytics looks at the work and its social organization. HR Analytics measures and integrates data about HR administrative processes,” says Ben Waber, [[MIT Media Lab]] Ph.D. and CEO of [[Humanyze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrexaminer.com/people-analytics-mit-july-24-2017/|title=People Analytics: MIT July 24, 2017|date=2017-08-02|work=HR Examiner|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Bersin, founder and principal at Bersin by [[Deloitte]] agrees that people analytics is a larger industry than HR Analytics, explaining, “'''…''' over time, I believe it doesn't even belong within HR. While it may reside in HR to begin with, over time this team takes responsible for analysis of sales productivity, turnover, retention, accidents, fraud, and even the people-issues that drive customer retention and customer satisfaction… These are all real-world business problems''',''' ''not HR problems'''''.'''”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2015/02/01/geeks-arrive-in-hr-people-analytics-is-here/#339ceb1673b4|title=The Geeks Arrive In HR:  People Analytics Is Here|last=Bersin|first=Josh|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Portfolio analytics ===
A common application of business analytics is [[portfolio analysis]]. In this, a [[bank]] or lending agency has a collection of accounts of varying [[Value (economics)|value]] and [[risk]]. The accounts may differ by the social status (wealthy, middle-class, poor, etc.) of the holder, the geographical location, its net value, and many other factors. The lender must balance the return on the [[loan]] with the risk of default for each loan. The question is then how to evaluate the portfolio as a whole.

The least risk loan may be to the very wealthy, but there are a very limited number of wealthy people. On the other hand, there are many poor that can be lent to, but at greater risk. Some balance must be struck that maximizes return and minimizes risk. The analytics solution may combine [[time series]] analysis with many other issues in order to make decisions on when to lend money to these different borrower segments, or decisions on the interest rate charged to members of a portfolio segment to cover any losses among members in that segment.

=== Risk analytics ===

Predictive models in the banking industry are developed to bring certainty across the risk scores for individual customers. Credit scores are built to predict individual’s delinquency behavior and widely used to evaluate the credit worthiness of each applicant. Furthermore, risk analyses are carried out in the scientific world and the insurance industry. It is also extensively used in financial institutions like Online Payment Gateway companies to analyse if a transaction was genuine or fraud. For this purpose they use the transaction history of the customer. This is more commonly used in Credit Card purchase, when there is a sudden spike in the customer transaction volume the customer gets a call of confirmation if the transaction was initiated by him/her. This helps in reducing loss due to such circumstances.

=== Digital analytics ===
Digital analytics is a set of business and technical activities that define, create, collect, verify or transform digital data into reporting, research, analyses, recommendations, optimizations, predictions, and automations.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Judah "Building a Digital Analytics Organization" Financial Times Press, 2013, pp 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; This also includes the SEO ([[search engine optimization]]) where the keyword search is tracked and that data is used for marketing purposes. Even banner ads and clicks come under digital analytics. A growing number of brands and marketing firms rely on digital analytics for their digital marketing assignments, where MROI (Marketing Return on Investment) is an important key performance indicator (KPI).

=== Security analytics ===
Security analytics refers to information technology (IT) to gather and analyze security events to understand and analyze events that pose the greatest risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security analytics shores up hope for breach detection |url=http://enterpriseinnovation.net/article/security-analytics-shores-hope-breach-detection-192448485|publisher=Enterprise Innovation|accessdate=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products in this area include [[security information and event management]] and user behavior analytics.

=== Software analytics ===
{{main|Software analytics}}
Software analytics is the process of collecting information about the way a piece of [[software]] is used and produced.

== Challenges ==
In the industry of commercial analytics software, an emphasis has emerged on solving the challenges of analyzing massive, complex data sets, often when such data is in a constant state of change. Such data sets are commonly referred to as [[big data]]. Whereas once the problems posed by big data were only found in the scientific community, today big data is a problem for many businesses that operate transactional systems online and, as a result, amass large volumes of data quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Naone|first=Erica|title=The New Big Data|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/38397/|publisher=Technology Review, MIT|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of [[unstructured data]] types is another challenge getting attention in the industry. Unstructured data differs from [[structured data]] in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inmon|first1=Bill|last2=Nesavich|first2=Anthony|title=Tapping Into Unstructured Data|year=2007|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-236029-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of unstructured data, such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of [[business intelligence]] for businesses, governments and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wise|first=Lyndsay|title=Data Analysis and Unstructured Data|url=http://www.dashboardinsight.com/articles/business-performance-management/data-analysis-and-unstructured-data.aspx|publisher=Dashboard Insight|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling fraudulent doctor's notes in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fake doctors' sick notes for Sale for £25, NHS fraud squad warns|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2626120/Fake-doctors-sick-notes-for-sale-on-web-for-25-NHS-fraud-squad-warns.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=26 August 2008|accessdate=16 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an opportunity for insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their unstructured data analysis. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that big data analysis could save the American health care system $300 billion per year and the European public sector €250 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Data: The next frontier for innovation, competition and productivity as reported in Building with Big Data|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18741392|accessdate=May 26, 2011 | work=The Economist|date=May 26, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110603031738/http://www.economist.com/node/18741392| archivedate= 3 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These challenges are the current inspiration for much of the innovation in modern analytics information systems, giving birth to relatively new machine analysis concepts such as [[complex event processing]], full text search and analysis, and even new ideas in presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ortega|first=Dan|title=Mobililty: Fueling a Brainier Business Intelligence|url=http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/guestopinions/blog/mobility-fueling-a-brainier-business-intelligence/?cs=47491|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705061921/http://www.itbusinessedge.com/cm/community/features/guestopinions/blog/mobility-fueling-a-brainier-business-intelligence/?cs=47491|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 5, 2011|publisher=IT Business Edge|accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such innovation is the introduction of grid-like architecture in machine analysis, allowing increases in the speed of massively parallel processing by distributing the workload to many computers all with equal access to the complete data set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khambadkone |first=Krish |title=Are You Ready for Big Data? |url=http://www.infogain.com/company/perspective-big-data.jsp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314031712/http://www.infogain.com/company/perspective-big-data.jsp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 14, 2011 |publisher=InfoGain |accessdate=February 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analytics is increasingly used in [[education]], particularly at the district and government office levels. However, the complexity of student performance measures presents challenges when educators try to understand and use analytics to discern patterns in student performance, predict graduation likelihood, improve chances of student success, etc. For example, in a study involving districts known for strong data use, 48% of teachers had difficulty posing questions prompted by data, 36% did not comprehend given data, and 52% incorrectly interpreted data.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (2009). ''Implementing data-informed decision making in schools: Teacher access, supports and use.'' United States Department of Education (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED504191)&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this, some analytics tools for educators adhere to an [[over-the-counter data]] format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system, and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve educators’ understanding and use of the analytics being displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28). [https://sas.elluminate.com/site/external/recording/playback/link/table/dropin?sid=2008350&amp;suid=D.4DF60C7117D5A77FE3AED546909ED2 How data Systems &amp; reports can either fight or propagate the data analysis error epidemic, and how educator leaders can help.] ''Presentation conducted from Technology Information Center for Administrative Leadership (TICAL) School Leadership Summit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

One more emerging challenge is dynamic regulatory needs. For example, in the banking industry, Basel III and future capital adequacy needs are likely to make even smaller banks adopt internal risk models. In such cases, cloud computing and open source programming language [[R (programming language)|R]] can help smaller banks to adopt risk analytics and support branch level monitoring by applying predictive analytics.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

== Risks ==
{{original research|date=March 2015}}
The main risk for the people is discrimination like [[price discrimination]] or [[statistical discrimination (economics)|statistical discrimination]].  [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/ See Scientific American book review of "Weapons of math destruction"]

There is also the risk that a developer could profit from the ideas or work done by users, like this example:
Users could write new ideas in a note taking app, which could then be sent as a custom event, and the developers could profit from those ideas. This can happen because the ownership of content is usually unclear in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-reasons-why-i-avoid-social-networking-services/|title=10 reasons why I avoid social networking services|author=Alan Norton|date=9 July 2012|work=TechRepublic|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a user's identity is not protected, there are more risks; for example, the risk that private information about users is made public on the internet.

In the extreme, there is the risk that governments could gather too much private information, now that the governments are giving themselves more powers to access citizens' information. {{Further|Telecommunications data retention}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''aphanisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφάνισις ''aphanisis'', "disappearance") is the disappearance of [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-860761-X | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was later applied to the disappearance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

==Jones==
According to the theories of [[Ernest Jones]], who coined the term in 1927,&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt; aphanisis is the foundation of all [[neurosis|neuroses]]. Jones suggested that fear of aphanisis was in both sexes more fundamental than [[castration anxiety]], an argument he used against [[Sigmund Freud]] in their debate over [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Jones considered that the [[Oedipus complex]] confronted each sex with the threat of aphanisis, and the choice of giving up "either their sex or their incest".&lt;ref&gt;E. Schuker/N. A. Levinson, ''Female Psychology'' (1991) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones subsequently linked aphanisis to Freud's concept of the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] of separation, a point taken up by [[John Bowlby]] in the context of his own theory of [[Anxiety|separation anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''Separation'' (2010) pp. 431–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] adapted Jones's term to a new meaning: "''aphanisis'' is to be situated in a more radical way at the level at which the subject manifests himself in this movement of disappearance...the ''fading'' of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lacanian theory, aphanisis describes the process through which a subject is partially eclipsed behind any signifier used to conceive of him/her: "when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as 'fading', as disappearance...''aphanisis''".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The subject as such is, accordingly, barred and riven by the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] (of language), a subject has no choice but to conceive of themself ''vis-a-vis'' something other than their self, something 'outside' or radically separated from them. 

Because the Other is the sole means through which a 'subject' can be rendered thinkable, aphanisis, the disappearance or the fading of the subject behind any signifier used to conceive of it, is an essential concept for understanding subjectivity and the peril of the subject's fundamental emptiness.

[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] developed the concept of aphanisis in terms of the dialectic of presence and absence—the gap between the core of the personality and the symbolic narrative in which the individual lives.&lt;ref&gt;R/ Maule/J. Beaulieu, ''In the Dark Room'' (2009), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
[[Montaigne]] has been seen as a classic example of the exploration of the aphanisis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Les quatre concepts fondamnetaux de la psychanalyse'' (Le Séminaire, Livre XI, 1964), Texte établi par J.-A. Miller, Paris, Seuil, coll. Points, 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apollon/R. Feldstein, ''Lacan, Politics, Aestetics'' (1996) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambridge University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-521-36815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Asimakopulos was born in Montreal in 1930.  He was educated at [[McGill University]] earning a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1953. In September 1953 Tom went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; his research topic was a three-commodity, three-country study in international trade theory entitled ''Productivity Changes, the Trade Balance and the Terms of Trade''.&lt;ref name=TERMS&gt;Asimakopulos, A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661902 ''A Note on Productivity Changes and the Terms of Trade'']. Oxford Economic Papers, New Series, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Jun., 1957), pp. 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; With his classmate [[Keith Frearson]], the Australian economist, Tom went to [[Joan Robinson|Joan Robinson's]] lectures on what would become ''The Accumulation of Capital''&lt;ref name=ACCUMCAP&gt;Robinson, Joan. [https://www.questia.com/library/book/the-accumulation-of-capital-by-joan-robinson.jsp ''The Accumulation of Capital'']. London: Macmillan Company, 1965. First published 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; – Robinson's ''magnum opus'', which sought to extend [[Keynesian economics|Keynes's theory]] to account for long-run issues of growth and [[capital accumulation]]. Initially Asimakopulos was irritated by Robinson's criticisms  of the orthodox theories of value and distribution and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical methodology]] on which he had been brought up. Asimakopulos also went regularly to research students's seminars run by [[Piero Sraffa]], [[Robin Marris]], and [[Nicholas Kaldor]].

Asimakopulos was a Lecturer in Economics and Political Science from 1956 to 1957 at McGill. From 1957 to 1959 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the Royal Military College. In 1959 he returned to McGill and became an assistant professor, working close to [[J.C. Weldon]]. Promoted to the position of associate professor in 1963, he became a full professor in 1966. In 1988 he was appointed ''"William Dow Professor of Political Economy"'' on Weldon's vacancy. He served as Chairman of the Department of Economics from 1974 to 1978. Teaching was his top priority; Asimakopulos loved teaching the microeconomics course to the Honours Students at McGill. Even though he had an assistant, Asimakopulos made sure that, from time to time, he gave tutorials himself, on which he would emphasize, ''ad nauseam'' the importance of the ''assumptions'' of the analysis and its implications on the results of the theoretical model studied.  He wrote extensively on the work of such economic theorists as J. M. Keynes, Joan Robinson, and [[Michał Kalecki]]. He was active in many professional associations and organizations. He held numerous fellowships and was a Visiting Professor and a Fellow at universities in the United States, England and Australia. From 1976 to 1990 he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Athanasios Asimakopulos died of leukemia in 1990.&lt;ref name=harcourt/&gt;

==Contributions to economic theory==
Asimakopulos was a [[Post Keynesian]] / "[[Michał Kalecki|Kaleckian]]" scholar, who elaborated upon Michał Kalecki's theories.&lt;ref name=KALECIANMODEL&gt;Lavoie, Marc. [http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/6/789 ''The Kaleckian model of growth and distribution and its neo-Ricardian and neo-Marxian critiques'']. Cambridge Journal of Economics 19 (6), 1993, pp. 789–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopulos wrote mainly around and on Keynesian themes and on growth, distribution and technical progress (the latter often with Weldon). Over time Kalecki's contributions came to be a major influence and interest; Tom came back to Kalecki, influenced by Joan Robinson. Kalecki stresses on determinants of income distribution, determinants of economic activity, determinants of profits, long-run growth, prospects of economy, or impact of imperfect competition on growth of income has been an important inspiration to many economists we call [[Post Keynesian]]s, including Asimakopulos.&lt;ref name= KALECKI1&gt;Nuti, D. M. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n5_v39/ai_6123769 ''Michal Kalecki – excerpts from a paper entitled Michal Kalecki's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Socialist Planning'']. Monthly Review, Oct. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POSTKEYNES2&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm The American Post Keynesians] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418155213/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of theories that originate from Kalecki is that they are closer to what can be called "normal" theories. Kalecki's papers are acceptably formalized and not as extensively open to various interpretations as Keynes' ''General Theory''.&lt;ref name=KALECKINAMOD2&gt;Lavoie. Marc. [http://rrp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/4/113 ''Traverse, Hysteresis, and Normal Rates of Capacity Utilization in Kaleckian Models of Growth and Distribution'']. Review of Radical Political Economics 28 (4), 1996, 113–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Post Keynesians]] treat production side of the economy in their models, they usually inhabit their models with firms, which operate within neither perfectly competitive environment, nor within perfect monopoly setting. Post Keynesian firms usually set their prices as mark-ups above their prime costs. Profits of those firms usually, along with ''"animal spirits and expectations"'', have pronounced impact on investment decisions and therefore determine profits in the future. This double-sided relationship between profits and investment is clearly in spirit of Asimakopulos (1971)&lt;ref name=DETKEY&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journals/00084239.html Asimakopulos, Athanasios. ''The Determination of Investment in Keynes's Model'', Canadian JE, 1971, vol. 4, issue 3, pp. 382–88.]&lt;/ref&gt; The most succinct definition of post-Keynesian economics comes from Joan Robinson:

::To me, the expression '''''post-Keynesian''''' has a definite meaning; it applies to an economic theory or method of analysis which takes account of the difference between the future and the past. {{small|(emphasis in the original)}} {{small|(1978; CEP, vol. V, 1979b, 210)}}

===Post Keynesianism===
The principal concern of [[Post Keynesians]] is to have a more complex and realistic aggregate [[supply and demand]] framework that includes mark-up pricing, the trend to monopoly, the workings of [[endogenous money]] and credit, circular and cumulative causation, and a pragmatic guide to policy. The workings of uncertainty lead to an unstable capitalistic system that requires the making of agreements and accords to promote stability. At the global level, it requires a fairer distribution of power such that the onus is on nations with trade surpluses to adjust their policies. More than anything, Post Keynesians eschew the quantity theory of money, since money and credit are seen to affect output and employment in both the short and long term. Indeed, like the institutionalists and Marxists, they see the capitalist economy as a monetary system of production, where money and [[creative financing]] are essential aspects of its functioning.&lt;ref name=POSTKEY1&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/37-RA-2.pdf O'Hara, Phillip Anthony.

They all moved well and truly outside it, attempting to create either a revolutionary alternative or to rehabilitate the [[Marxist Socialism|classical Marxian tradition]], in most cases in the light of the [[Keynesians|Keynesian revolution]]. The one exception is Michał Kalecki, whose personal history and independent mind combined to place him virtually always outside the mainstream.

Asimakopulos however viewed himself as a [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream]] economist. He even declined an invitation to be included in the first edition of Philip Arestis and Malcolm Sawyer's ''A Biographical Dictionary of Dissenting Economists'',&lt;ref name=DICTDISSENT&gt;Arestis, Philip and Sawyer, Malcolm.

First published 1992. {{ISBN|1-85898-560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he regarded his views and contributions as belonging fully within the tradition of economics proper, not in a dissenting stream (he was included in the second edition).&lt;ref name=POSTKEY&gt;Harcourt, G.

====Asimakopulos' critique of Keynes' ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment''====
In his ''General Theory'', John Maynard Keynes proposed an investment function of the sort &lt;  I = I0 + I(r)  &gt; where the relationship between investment and interest rate was of a rather naive form. Firms were presumed to "rank" various investment projects depending on their ''"[[internal rate of return]]"'' (or ''"marginal efficiency of investment"'') and thereafter, faced with a given rate of interest, chose those projects whose internal rate of return exceeded the rate of interest. With an infinite number of projects available, this amounted to arguing that firms would invest until their marginal efficiency of investment was equal to the rate of interest, i.e. &lt;  MEI = r  &gt;.

Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) and several Post Keynesians offered a troublesome critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very possibility of a downward-sloping ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)'' function in the presence of unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the marginal efficiency of investment function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase  which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the ''MEI'' curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.&lt;ref name=KEYNESIRR&gt;Asimakopulos et al., [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm ''J. M. Keynes's Internal Rate of Return''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418015246/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}, at HET website.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, it is easy to conceive that, in situations of unemployment where the multiplier works its magic, investment is actually indeterminate&amp;nbsp;– or rather, an ever-shifting ''MEI'' curve could imply that all investment projects will be eventually undertaken and not merely those that are profitable at the given rate of interest since the profitability of projects is itself a function of aggregate demand and thus endogenous to the problem.

==Quotes on Asimakopulos==
::Tom Asimakopulos was a great Kaleckian scholar. His knowledge of the nuances and innuendos of Kalecki's approach to macroeconomics had no equal. {{small|Paul Davidson, Journal of Economic Issues.}}

::This book (''Keynes's General Theory and Accumulation'') is the legacy of a dedicated and tough-minded scholar who did his heroes the compliment of taking their work seriously, rather than just praising it. {{small|Robert W. Dimand, History of Political Economy.}}

'''Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI)''' is an autonomous organization under the [[Ministry of agriculture]], that conducts research on all crops except rice, [[jute]], sugarcane, and tea for which there are separate institutes. The central research station of the institute is at [[Joydebpur]] about {{convert|35|km}} north of [[Dhaka]].

The research compound of the central station is spread over 176 hectares of land of which 126 hectares are experiment fields. The institute has established six regional research stations in six regions of Bangladesh to develop new technologies. These research stations are located at Ishurdi, [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]], [[Jessore]], [[Hathazari]], Rahmatpur, and [[Akbarpur, Ramabai Nagar|Akbarpur]]. It also has 28 research stations including three hill research stations ([[Khagrachari]], [[Ramgarh Upazila|Ramgarh]] and Raikhali). Besides these, ''BARI'' has seven crop research centers, four of which are at the central research station at Joydebpur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bari.gov.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=58|title=Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) |work=Bangladesh National Portal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4804">A '''chief creative officer''' ('''CCO''') is the highest ranking position of the creative team within a company. Depending on the type of company, this position may be responsible for the overall look and feel of [[marketing]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[brand]]ing associated with the organization. The CCO may also be charged with managing, developing, and leading the team of [[creative director]]s, [[art director]]s, [[designer]]s, and [[copywriter]]s.

==Overall description==
The CCO directs a company's creative output, developing the artistic design strategy that defines the company's brand.&lt;ref name="do"&gt;Written By: Terry Masters, Edited By: Allegra J. Lingo [http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-a-chief-creative-officer-do.htm "What Does a Chief Creative Officer Do"], 14 October 2014, Retrieved on 30 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO creates the unique image of the firm and deliver this distinctive design to consumers and to create a clear [[brand image]] which is a fundamental and essential work throughout the company. Advertisements present a certain memorable artistic design while also structured to accomplish functional goals. The CCO ensures that the design and functionality combine harmoniously so the firm can present a product that successfully represents its creative brand.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

CCOs, in some cases are called [[creative directors]], are demanded in firms which involve creative thinking and artistic design. The position of generic head of marketing is usually replaced by chief creative officer in advertising firms.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt; The power of chief creative officer can even be compared to [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and at the early stages of a small company, usually at the start of [[partnerships]], the CCO and the CEO manage jointly.&lt;ref name="do" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3653">"'''Common prostitute'''" is a term used in [[English law]] related to [[prostitution]]. The term was first used in the [[Vagrancy Act 1824]]. The term continued to be used in the [[Street Offences Act 1959]] which maintained the illegality of street prostitution. Section 1 stated: "It shall be an offence for a common prostitute to loiter or solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/legResults.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Street+Offences+Act+1959%2c&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;activeTextDocId=1127916&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;SortAlpha=0  Street Offences Act 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was widely regarded as archaic, stigmatising, and offensive, and a number of failed attempts had been made since the 1920s to enact new legislation which would replace the wording with a solicitation law that applied to both sexes equally, and did not create an offence that could only be committed by a special class of person.
 
In 2007 the government announced that it would introduce new legislation which would eliminate the use of the term, and replace it with new language which would apply equally to males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Policing and Crime Act 2009 also introduced tough new measures aimed at men seeking women for the purpose of prostitution.  In particular the act makes it an offence for someone to pay or promise to pay a prostitute who has been subject to ‘exploitive conduct’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Prostitution_loitering_paying_or_soliciting_a_prostitute_subjected_to_force Prostitution loitering paying or soliciting a prostitute subjected to force] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201101807/http://wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Prostitution_loitering_paying_or_soliciting_a_prostitute_subjected_to_force |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change made the customer an equal offender with the street prostitute.

Cosmopolitan localism fosters a global network of mutually supportive communities (neighbourhoods, villages, towns, cities and regions) who share and exchange knowledge, ideas, skills, technology, culture and (where socially and ecologically sustainable) resources. The approach seeks to foster a creative, [[reciprocal relationship]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} between the local and the global.

Italian social innovation scholar [[Ezio Manzini]] describes cosmopolitan localism as having the potential to generate a new [[sense of place]]. With cosmopolitan localism, places are not considered isolated entities, but nodes in short-distance and long-distance networks. The short-distance networks generate and regenerate the local socio-economic fabric and the long-distance networks connect a particular community to the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/904398409|title=Design, when everybody designs : an introduction to design for social innovation|last=Ezio,|first=Manzini,|isbn=9780262328630|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=904398409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:St Stephen's Church (1).JPG|thumb|right|300px|St Stephen's Church in St Albans, the legal owner of the Dunkeld Lectern]]

The '''Dunkeld Lectern''' is a [[mediaeval]] [[lectern]] which was one of the most prized possessions of [[St. Stephen's Church, St. Albans|St Stephen's Church]], [[St Albans]].  The 150&amp;nbsp;kg brass reading desk stood approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;metres high and took the form of a large [[eagle]] with outspread wings with the bird perched on an orb supported by a turned shaft - an [[eagle lectern]].  Engraved on the orb was a [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription - ''Georgius Creichton Episcopus Dunkeldensis'' (translation: 'George Creichton Bishop of Dunkeld').  [[George Crichton]] was abbot at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in [[Edinburgh]] from 1515 to 1522, and it is believed that he was presented the lectern to the Abbey on being made [[Bishop of Dunkeld]] by [[Pope Alexander VI]]. The lectern was plundered by English invaders in 1544, lost (and recovered) in the [[English Civil War]], and stolen by a group of Scottish nationalists in 1984. On two occasions the lectern was hidden in a [[Grave (burial)|grave]].  It remains the subject of dispute.

==History==

In the autumn of 1543 [[Scotland]] and [[England]] signed two agreements which are often referred to as "The [[Treaties of Greenwich]]".  The first guaranteed peace between the two countries for a fixed period of time and the second affirmed that an [[arranged marriage]] would take place between [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward of England]], the son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], soon after her tenth birthday.

At the beginning of 1544 the relationship between England and Scotland began to worsen as it had done so many times before. The Scots reneged on the treaties which drove Henry VIII into a fury.  His response was swift and brutal. He directed the commander-in-chief of the English army, the [[Earl of Hertford]] to "... put all to fyre and sworde, burne Edinborough town... [so it] may remayn forever a perpetuel memory of the vengeance of God... for their [the Scots] faulsehode and disloyailtye... over throwe the castle, sack Holyrod house".

In May 1544, the English army arrived by [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|boat to destroy Edinburgh]]. The army landed near the port of [[Leith]] from whence it marched on [[Edinburgh]].  The invaders pillaged and laid waste the town, and the surrounding areas and villages, excepting only the castle.  They destroyed [[Holyrood Abbey]] and carried off much of its property as plunder.  Henry hoped his aggression would force the Scots to accept the marriage treaty.

The Earl of Hertford was accompanied to Edinburgh by [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Sir Richard Lee]] who was a military engineer - a destroyer and builder of fortifications.  His services to the English crown for his work in Scotland (and elsewhere) was formally recognised in 1544 when he was knighted and appointed Surveyor of the King's Works.  He was granted the ground covered by St Albans monastery (but not the church which was bought by the townspeople), [[Sopwell Priory]], and the rectorship of [[St. Stephen's Church, St. Albans|St Stephen's church]].

This fact, when taken with circumstantial evidence, suggests it was probably at this time the Holyrood Abbey lectern found its way into this Hertfordshire church, with the other Scottish plunder of Sir Richard Lee.

===English Civil War===

In 1642 the [[English Civil War]] began and St Albans became a Parliamentarian stronghold.  Parliament passed new laws which authorised the destruction of religious images and articles.  In response many religious items and artefacts were hidden by Anglican clergy from their Puritan prosecutors.  In August 1643 more draconian measures were introduced and continuity of the St Stephen's parish registers is broken perhaps hinting at the turbulent nature of those times.

It was during this period of national upheaval that the lectern disappeared.  Who removed it and exactly why remains a mystery to this day. Over 100 years were to pass before the lectern came to light once more.

In 1748 the Montagu family tomb in the chancel of St Stephen's church was opened up for an interment and the lectern was found lying in the grave. It was retrieved and brought back into the use.

==Scottish requests for return==

Since the eighteenth century Scottish academics, clergy and Scottish patriots have sought the return of the lectern.  A review of the history of the lectern in the newspaper ''[[Scottish Guardian|The Scottish Guardian]]'' dated 2 May 1879, finished with a plea for readers to find a way to "... secure the lectern for our new Cathedral in Edinburgh.  Who will take up the matter?"

In November 1879 an approach from the [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] was rebuffed by the vicar of St Stephen's, the Rev Marcus R. Southwell.  In December of that year he wrote to the Lord Provost, sent his best wishes and expressed the "utmost repugnance to parting with the Crichton lectern."  The Dean of the [[Order of the Thistle]] and Chapel Royal fared no better in 1914.  Nor did further approaches made by Edinburgh corporation in 1931 and 1936.

===Attempted theft===

One day in 1972 the lectern was found lying in pieces halfway down the nave of the church.  Intruders were disturbed in the course of their nefarious activities, but did not leave empty handed, taking with them three small lions from the base which supported the lectern.

===Return===

In 1982 the lectern returned to Scotland for the first time in over 400&amp;nbsp;years.  Permission was given by the [[Church of England]] for the lectern to appear in ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns'' - an exhibition of mediaeval Scottish art at the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.  Its appearance at the exhibition caused a great deal of upset and letters to the press demanded that it should remain in Scotland but when the exhibition ended the Dunkeld lectern was returned to St Stephen's church.

In the past 150&amp;nbsp;years or so, the clergy and academics have not succeeded in resolving the issue to the satisfaction of some of the Scots people.  In November 1984 a group of individuals broke into the church and removed the lectern.  The Scottish group "[[Siol nan Gaidheal]]" (Seed of the Gael) contacted the press and reported they had the lectern.  They provided a 'hostage' photograph and wrote '... This piece of our heritage is here to stay... patriotic Scots have asked for the eagle to be returned... to its rightful home.  English arrogance won the day... all requests were refused.'

In the 15 years since the lectern disappeared the rights and wrongs of the matter have been debated on television and in the press many times.  Representatives of the established churches of Scotland and England met on many occasions and invested much effort and time to resolve the matter.  Dialogue between all parties was nurtured and helped by the activities of Inverness Press and Journal reporter Mr John Vass.  He worked closely with the vicar Revd John Pragnell, Mr David Maxwell, Convenor of the Church of Scotland's Artistic Committee, and Mr David Caldwell of the Royal Museum of Scotland to get the lectern returned for permanent display in Scotland.

===Criminal endeavour prevails===

Over the years Mr Vass received a number of anonymous communications from those who held the lectern.  The "kidnappers" laid down two conditions before the Dunkeld lectern would be released.  These were that it was to stay in Scotland, and that no action would be taken to find and prosecute those responsible.  St Stephen's parish made an offer that should the lectern be forthcoming, the parish would see that it was returned to Scotland.

In recognition of this promise, St Margaret's church, Barnhill, Dundee offered St Stephen's church a Victorian eagle lectern to replace the one removed in 1984.  This Victorian lectern was a replica of the Dunkeld one.  The "Siol nan Gaidheal" failed to respond positively.  The Church of Scotland decided to proceed and present St Stephen's with the Barnhill lectern before the Revd J. Pragnell moved to his new parish.  The St Stephen's vicar had been pivotal in the efforts to bring about a satisfactory conclusion of this matter since he arrived in the parish in 1991.

==Current whereabouts==

In 1999 the Dunkeld Lectern mysteriously turned up in an Edinburgh arts centre after being missing for 15&amp;nbsp;years.  It is believed that it had been hidden in a Highland grave for the intervening period.  It has since been moved to the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and is on a three-year loan.  A permanent loan agreement is being negotiated between the National Museums of Scotland and the church of St Stephen's, still the legal owner of the Dunkeld Lectern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Epochalism''' is an attitude of respect for the progressive [[spirit of the age]] and for social and technological advancement, which was contrasted by [[Clifford Geertz]] with what he termed the ([[Essentialism|essentialist]]) valorisation of traditional values. He viewed this distinction as a central social polarity pervading developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''The Interpretation of Culture'' (1973)  p. 240-1&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, the term used has been used to describe the [[Post-Fordism|post-Fordist]], [[postmodern]] belief that the current era or epoch represents a fundamental clean break with the past; is something unique in human history; and due to this radical change, previous rules will no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 44 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Urry, ''Climate Change and Society'' (2011) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polarities in emerging economies==
Epochalism in the developing world can be seen purely as a progressive force, favouring movement toward secularisation and industrial advance, as opposed to a regressive return to the traditional values of community and [[Gemeinschaft]].&lt;ref&gt;B. K. Khlief, ''Language, Ethnicity and Education in Wales'' (1980) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice the situation is likely to be more complicated: nationalist struggles for independence have often relied on essentialist appeals to authentic ethnic communities and cultural practices, as well as to epochalism, in order to free themselves from dependence on a Western [[Conceptual model|model]]/Western control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Said]], ''Culture and Imperialism'' (1993) p. 263 and p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet epochalism==
The rapid rise of the [[World Wide Web]] led many [[digerati]] to see it as an unprecedented human phenomenon, wholly divorced from all past experience.&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evgeny Morozov]] used the term epochalism to describe the prevalent 21st-century belief that "one is living in truly exceptional times – an intellectual fallacy I call 'epochalism{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous technological advances, as with the age of railways or the age of broadcasting,&lt;ref&gt;A. Briggs/P. Burke, ''A Social History of the Media'' (2002) p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; had of course made very similar claims for themselves; and [[A. E. Housman]] a century before had denounced the mind "which commands no outlook upon the past or the future, but believes that the fashion of the present, unlike all fashions heretofore, will endure perpetually".&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Housman, ''Collected Poems and Selected Prose'' (1988) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Late modernity]] however, with its shortening of awareness of time-spans and its focus on the present,&lt;ref&gt;I. Craib, ''The Importance of Disappointment'' (1994) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; makes the short-sightedness of epochalism - with what Morozov saw as its dark fetishism of Internet-based solutions&lt;ref&gt;E. Morozov, ''To Save Everything, Click Here'' (2013) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; - an increasingly plausible intellectual posture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6377">'''Ethogenics''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|iː|θ|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|ɪ|k|s}}; "the study of behavior as generated by persons who exhibit a character, an ethos",&lt;ref&gt;Wayne C. Boot (1988), ''The Vocation of a Teacher: Rhetorical Occasions, 1967-1988'', University of Chicago Press, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἦθος ''ethos'', "custom, character" and γένος ''genos'', "birth, generation") is an interdisciplinary social scientific approach that attempts to understand the systems of belief or means through which individuals attach significance to their actions and form their identities by linking these to the larger structure of rules (norms) and cultural resources in society. For [[Rom Harré]], the founder of ethogenics, it represents a radical innovation in traditional psychology, even a completely "new psychology" that should take its place.  (Harré et al., 1985: 129).

== Roots of ethogenics ==
The origins of ethogenic social science are in [[microsociology]] and [[symbolic interactionism]]: in particular, Erving Goffman's [[dramaturgy (sociology)|dramaturgical sociology]] and Harold Garfinkel's [[ethnomethodology]].&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, Ian. (1991). ''Social Selves: Theories of the Social Formation of Personality.'' London: Sage Publications, 55-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Goffman and Garfinkel looked at the particular ways in which social actors manage authenticity and construct social order through their performances. Therefore, microsociologists working in this tradition are concerned with [[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life|the presentation of self in everyday life]].

== Ethogenic theories ==
Ethogenicists argue that the unified self (or 'I') emerges through everyday discourse and is enabled through metaphors. Rom Harré states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All that is personal in our mental and emotional lives is individually appropriated from the conversation going on around us and perhaps idiosyncratically transformed. The structure of our thinking and our feeling will reflect, in various ways, the form and content of that conversation. The main thesis of this work is that mind is no sort of entity, but a system of beliefs structured by a cluster of grammatical models. The science of psychology must be reformed accordingly (1983: 20).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Methodologically, ethogenics starts with the social formation as the primary human reality ''and then'' shows how the human self exists within it via personally modified 'templates.'(Harré 1983: 64-65). While Harré makes a distinction between personal and social being, he does not claim that personal being is prior to social being.

By contrast, John Shotter's approach to ethogenics analyzes social action with others (as opposed to individual rule-following and performances), which is said to give individuals 'social powers.' There is no cognitive structure of the social self-independent of social context (Shotter 1983: 33). Therefore, Shotter emphasizes the practical necessities which bring individuals together in moral configurations, which it is necessary to hermeneutically approach. Shotter believes this is a better way to understand the "accounting practices" (and resulting consciousness) of individuals than Harré's methods. 

[[Kenneth Gergen]] argues that scientific activity (theories) also plays a significant role in [[social constructionism|constructing the reality]] and values of individuals. Gergen argues that scientific theories appeal to the common sense within our everyday symbolic world. Societal power relations are affected by groups who try to impose certain frameworks for understanding selfhood, which then guide action (Gergen 1989).

== Critique of mainstream social psychology ==
Ethogenics emerged from a period of crisis in social psychology, representing a rejection of experimental methods (Ginsburg 1995). Such methods apply external "treatments" to groups of individuals rather than studying the personal "sense-making" that individuals must engage in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in order to live in society.

{{Spirituality sidebar|experience}}
The '''evolutionary psychology of religion''' is the study of [[religious belief]] using [[evolutionary psychology]] principles. It is one approach to the [[psychology of religion]]. As with all other organs and organ functions, the [[brain]]'s functional structure is argued to have a genetic basis, and is therefore subject to the effects of [[natural selection]] and [[evolution]]. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes, religion in this case, by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Steadman, L. |author2=Palmer, C. |date=2008 |title=The Supernatural and Natural Selection: Religion and Evolutionary Success |publisher=Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of evolution==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

There is general agreement among scientists that a propensity to engage in religious behavior evolved early in human history. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. There are two schools of thought. One is that religion itself evolved due to [[natural selection]] and is an [[adaptation]], in which case religion conferred some sort of evolutionary advantage. The other is that religious beliefs and behaviors may have emerged as by-products of other adaptive traits without initially being selected for because of their own benefits.&lt;ref name="Sosis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Watts2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tamas/&gt;

Religious behavior often involves significant costs including economic costs, [[celibacy]], dangerous rituals, or by spending time that could be used otherwise. This would suggest that natural selection should act against religious behavior unless it or something else causing religious behavior to have significant advantages.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 The Evolution of Religion by Joseph A. Bulbulia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as an adaptation===
{{further|Handicap principle|Signalling theory}}

Richard Sosis and Candace Alcorta have reviewed several of the prominent theories for the [[adaptive value]] of religion.&lt;ref name="Sosis"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Signaling, solidarity, and the sacred: the evolution of religious behavior|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=12|issue=6|doi=10.1002/evan.10120|pages=264–274 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |first2=C. |last2=Alcorta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are "social solidarity theories", which view religion as having evolved to enhance cooperation and cohesion within groups. Group membership in turn provides benefits which can enhance an individual's chances for survival and reproduction. These benefits range from coordination advantages&lt;ref name=Tamas&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the facilitation of costly behavior rules.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Broad supernatural punishment but not moralizing high gods precede the evolution of political complexity in Austronesia|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1804/20142556|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2015-04-07|pmc = 4375858|pmid = 25740888|pages = 20142556|volume = 282|issue = 1804|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2556|first = Joseph|last = Watts|first2 = Simon J.|last2 = Greenhill|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Thomas E.|last4 = Currie|first5 = Joseph|last5 = Bulbulia|first6 = Russell D.|last6 = Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for development of religion for group cohesion is strongly suggested by Edward O. Wilson's theory of "eusociality".  He posited that the individuals of a small percentage of species including homo sapiens, ants, termites, bees and a few other species, replicated their genes by adhering to one of a number of competing groups.  He further postulates that, in homo sapiens, thanks to our enormous forebrains, there evolved a complex interplay between group evolution and individual evolution within a group.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Conquest of Earth|year=2007|first=Edward O.|last=Wilson|publisher=Liveright|isbn=978-0871403636}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2018}}

These social solidarity theories may help to explain the painful or dangerous nature of many religious rituals. [[Handicap principle|Costly-signaling theory]] suggests that such rituals might serve as public and hard-to-fake signals that an individual's commitment to the group is sincere. Since there would be a considerable benefit in trying to cheat the system - taking advantage of group living benefits without taking on any possible costs - the ritual would not be something simple that can be taken lightly.&lt;ref name="Sosis"/&gt; Warfare is a good example of a cost of group living, and Richard Sosis, Howard C. Kress, and James S. Boster carried out a cross-cultural survey which demonstrated that men in societies which engage in war do submit to the costliest rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Scars for war: evaluating alternative signaling explanations for cross-cultural variance in ritual costs |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.02.007 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=4| pages=234–247 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |last2=Kress |first2=H. C. |first3=J. S. |last3=Boster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that show more direct positive associations between religious practice and health and longevity are more controversial. Harold G. Koenig and Harvey J. Cohen summarized and assessed the results of 100 evidence-based studies that systematically examined the relationship between religion and human well-being, finding that 79% showed a positive influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Link between Religion and Health: Psychoneuroimmunology and the Faith Factor|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2001|first1=Harold G. |last1=Koenig |first2=Harvey J. |last2=Cohen|isbn=0-19-514360-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies are popular in the media, as seen in a recent [[NPR]] program including University of Miami Professor Gail Ironson's findings that belief in God and a strong sense of spirituality were good predictors of a lower viral load and improved immune cell levels in HIV patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104351710|title=Can Positive Thoughts Help Heal Another Person?|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara|year=2009|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Richard P. Sloan of Columbia University was quoted in the New York Times as saying that "...there is no really good compelling evidence that there is a relationship between religious involvement and health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E0DE1730F934A35756C0A9649C8B63|title=Religion and Health: New Research Revives an Old Debate|date=May 7, 2002|accessdate=2009-12-19|newspaper=New York Times | first=Mary | last=Duenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still debate over the validity of these findings, and they do not necessarily prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between religion and health. Mark Stibich claims there is a clear correlation but the reason for it is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;http://longevity.about.com/od/longevityboosters/a/religion_life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of such [[placebo]] effects, as well as the advantage of religion giving a sense of meaning, is that it seems likely that less complex mechanisms than religious behavior could achieve such goals.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

===Religion as a by-product===
{{See also|Agent detection}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] cites religion as an example of an [[exaptation]] or [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], but he does not himself select a definite trait which he thinks was actually acted on by natural selection. He does, however, bring up Freud's suggestion that our large brains, which evolved for other reasons, led to consciousness. The beginning of consciousness forced humans to deal with the concept of personal mortality. Religion may have been one solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="exaptation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|year=1991|title=Exaptation: a crucial tool for an evolutionary psychology|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=47|pages=43–65|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01822.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have proposed specific psychological processes which may have been co-opted for religion. Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm ([[agent detection]]), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion|year= 2004|publisher= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|journal= The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pascal Boyer]] suggests, in his book ''[[Religion Explained]]'', that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. He builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including [[folk psychology]]. He argues that one such factor is that it has, in most cases, been advantageous for humans to remember "minimally counter-intuitive" concepts which are somewhat different from the daily routine and somewhat violate innate expectations about how the world is constructed. A god that is in many aspects like humans but much more powerful is such a concept, while the often much more abstract god discussed at length by theologians is often too counter-intuitive. Experiments support that religious people think about their god in [[anthropomorphic]] terms even if this contradicts the more complex theological doctrines of their religion.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Pierre Lienard and Pascal Boyer suggest that humans have evolved a "hazard-precaution system" which allows us to detect potential threats in the environment and attempt to respond appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Whence collective rituals? A cultural selection model of ritualized behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=108|pages=824–827|last1=Lienard |first1=P. |first2=P. |last2=Boyer |doi=10.1525/aa.2006.108.4.814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several features of ritual behaviors, often a major feature of religion, are held to trigger this system. These include the occasion for the ritual, often the prevention or elimination of danger or evil, the harm believed to result from nonperformance of the ritual, and the detailed proscriptions for proper performance of the ritual. Lienard and Boyer discuss the possibility that a sensitive hazard-precaution system itself may have provided fitness benefits, and that religion then "associates individual, unmanageable anxieties with coordinated action with others and thereby makes them more tolerable or meaningful".

[[Justin L. Barrett]] in ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'' suggests that belief in God is natural because it depends on mental tools possessed by all human beings. He suggests that the way our minds are structured and develop make belief in the existence of a supreme god with properties such as being superknowing, superpowerful and immortal highly attractive. He also compares belief in God to belief in other minds, and devotes a chapter to looking at the evolutionary psychology of atheism. He suggests that one of the fundamental mental modules in the brain is the Hyperactive Agency Detection Device (HADD), another potential system for identifying danger. This HADD may confer a survival benefit even if it is over-sensitive: it is better to avoid an imaginary predator than be killed by a real one. This would tend to encourage belief in ghosts and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Justin L.|title=Why Would Anyone Believe in God|chapter=3|isbn=0-7591-0667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though hominids probably began using their emerging cognitive abilities to meet basic needs like nutrition and mates, [[Terror Management Theory]] argues that this happened before they had reached the point where significant self (and thus end-of-self) awareness arose. Death awareness became a highly disruptive byproduct of prior adaptive functions. The resulting anxiety threatened to undermine these very functions and thus needed amelioration. Any social formation or practice that was to be widely accepted by the masses needed to provide a means of managing this terror. The main strategy to do so was to "become an individual of value in a world of meaning…acquiring self-esteem [via] the creation and maintenance of culture", as this would counter the sense of insignificance represented by death and provide 1) symbolic immortality through the legacy of a culture that lives on beyond the physical self ("earthly significance") 2) literal immortality, the promise of an afterlife or continued existence featured in religions ("cosmic significance").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M.

===Memes===
{{See also|Memes}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] suggests in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' that cultural [[memes]] function like genes in that they are subject to natural selection. In ''[[The God Delusion#Roots of religion and morality|The God Delusion]]'' Dawkins further argues that because religious truths cannot be questioned, their very nature encourages religions to spread like "mind viruses". In such a conception, it is necessary that the individuals who are unable to question their beliefs are more biologically fit than individuals who are capable of questioning their beliefs. Thus, it could be concluded that sacred scriptures or oral traditions created a behavioral pattern that elevated biological fitness for believing individuals. Individuals who were capable of challenging such beliefs, even if the beliefs were enormously improbable, became rarer and rarer in the population. (See [[denialism]].)

This model holds that religion is the byproduct of the cognitive modules in the human brain that arose in our evolutionary past to deal with problems of survival and reproduction. Initial concepts of supernatural agents may arise in the tendency of humans to "overdetect" the presence of other humans or predators (momentarily mistaking a vine for a snake). For instance, a man might report that he felt something sneaking up on him, but it vanished when he looked around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=Stewart Elliot|title=Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-19-506901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of these experiences are especially likely to be retold, passed on and embellished due to their descriptions of standard ontological categories (person, artifact, animal, plant, natural object) with counterintuitive properties (humans that are invisible, houses that remember what happened in them, etc.). These stories become even more salient when they are accompanied by activation of non-violated expectations for the ontological category (houses that "remember" activates our intuitive psychology of mind; i.e. we automatically attribute thought processes to them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/boyer_religious_concepts.htm|title=Functional Origins of Religious concepts|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|accessdate=2009-12-19|authorlink=Pascal Boyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the attributes of our intuitive psychology of mind is that humans are interested in the affairs of other humans. This may result in the tendency for concepts of supernatural agents to inevitably cross connect with human intuitive moral feelings (evolutionary behavioral guidelines). In addition, the presence of dead bodies creates an uncomfortable cognitive state in which dreams and other mental modules (person identification and behavior prediction) continue to run decoupled from reality producing incompatible intuitions that the dead are somehow still around. When this is coupled with the human predisposition to see misfortune as a social event (as someone's responsibility rather than the outcome of mechanical processes) it may activate the intuitive "willingness to make exchanges" module of the human theory of minds resulting in the tendency of humans to try to interact and bargain with their supernatural agents ([[ritual]]).&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought|publisher=Basic Books|year=2001|authorlink=Pascal Boyer|isbn=0-465-00695-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a large enough group, some individuals will seem better skilled at these rituals than others and will become specialists. As the societies grow and encounter others, competition will ensue and a "survival of the fittest" effect may cause the practitioners to modify their concepts to provide a more abstract, more widely acceptable version. Eventually the specialist practitioners form a cohesive group or guild with its attendant political goals (religion).&lt;ref name="boyer"/&gt;

'''Freshwater environmental quality parameters'''  are the natural and man-made [[chemical]], [[biology|biological]] and [[microbiology|microbiological]] characteristics of [[river]]s, [[lake]]s and [[ground-water]]s, the ways they are measured and the ways that they change. The values or concentrations attributed to such [[Parameter#Environmental science|parameters]] can be used to describe the pollution status of an environment, its biotic status or to predict the likelihood or otherwise of a particular organisms  being present. Monitoring of environmental quality parameters is a key activity in managing the environment, restoring polluted environments and anticipating the effects of man-made changes on the environment.

'''Freshwater environmental quality parameters''' are those  chemical, physical or biological parameters that can be used to characterise a freshwater body. Because almost all water bodies are dynamic in their composition, the relevant quality parameters are typically expressed as a range of expected concentrations.

==Characterisation==
{{see also|water chemistry analysis}}
The first step in understanding the chemistry of freshwater is to establish the relevant concentrations of the parameters of interest. Conventionally this is done by taking representative samples of the water for subsequent analysis in a laboratory . However, in-situ monitoring using hand-held analytical equipment or using bank-side monitoring stations are also used.

===Sampling===
Freshwaters are surprisingly difficult to sample because they are rarely [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] and their quality varies during the day and during the year. In addition the most representative sampling locations are often at a distance from the shore or bank increasing the logistic complexity.

====Rivers====
Filling a clean bottle with river water is a very simple task, but a single sample is only representative of that point along the river the sample was taken from and at that point in time. Understanding the chemistry of a whole river, or even a significant tributary, requires prior investigation to understand how homogeneous or mixed the flow is and to determine if the quality changes during the course of a day and during the course of a year. Almost all natural rivers will have very significant patterns of change through the day and through the seasons. [[Water remote sensing]] offers a spatially continuous tool to improve understanding of spatial and temporal river water quality. Many rivers also have a very large flow that is unseen. This flows through underlying gravel and sand layers and is called [[hyporheic zone|hyporheic flow]]. How much mixing there is between the hyporheic zone and the water in the open channel will depend on a variety of factors, some of which relate to flows leaving [[aquifers]] which may have been storing water for many years.

===Ground-waters===
Ground waters by their very nature  are often very difficult to access to take a sample. As a consequence the majority of ground-water data comes from samples taken from [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, [[water well|well]]s, water supply bore-holes and in natural [[cave]]s. In recent decades as the need to understand ground water dynamics has increased, an increasing number or monitoring bore-holes have been drilled into aquifers

===Lakes===

''see also [[Limnology]]''

Lakes  and ponds can be very large  and support a complex  eco-system in which environmental parameters vary widely in all three physical dimensions and with time. Large lakes in the temperate zone often stratify in the warmer months into a warmer upper layers rich in oxygen and a colder lower layer with low oxygen levels. In the autumn, falling temperatures and  occasional high winds result in the mixing of the two layers into a more homogeneous whole. When stratification occurs it not only affects oxygen levels but also many related parameters such as [[iron]], [[phosphate]] and [[manganese]] which are all changed in their chemical form by change in the [[redox]] potential of the environment.

Lakes also receive waters, often from many different sources with varying qualities. Solids from stream inputs will typically settle near the mouth of the stream and depending on a variety of factors the incoming water may float over the surface of the lake, sink beneath the surface or rapidly mix with the lake water. All of these phenomena can  skew the results of any environmental monitoring unless the process are well understood.

==Mixing zones==
Where two rivers meet at a confluence there exists a mixing zone. A mixing zone may be very large and extend for many miles as in the case of the [[Mississippi]] and [[Missouri]] rivers in the [[United States]] and the [[River Clwyd]] and [[River Elwy]] in [[North Wales]]. In a mixing zone water chemistry may be very variable and can be difficult to predict. The chemical interactions are not just simple mixing but may be complicated by biological processes from submerged [[macrophyte]]s and by water joining the channel from the [[hyporheic]] zone or from springs draining an aquifer.

==Geological inputs==
The geology that underlies a river or lake has a major impact on its chemistry. A river flowing across very ancient [[precambrian]] [[schists]] is likely to have dissolved very little from the rocks and maybe similar to de-ionised water at least in the headwaters. Conversely a river flowing through [[chalk]] hills, and especially if its source is in the chalk, will have a high concentration of [[carbonate]]s and [[bicarbonate]]s of [[Calcium]] and possibly [[Magnesium]].

As a river progresses along its course it may pass through a variety of geological types and it may have inputs from aquifers that do not appear on the surface anywhere in the locality.

==Atmospheric inputs==
Oxygen is probably the most important chemical constituent of surface water chemistry, as all [[aerobic organism]]s require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen’s solubility in water decreases as water temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water’s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.  Oxygen is a by-product of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring such as following Autumn leaf-fall.

Most other atmospheric inputs come from man-made or [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] sources the most significant of which are the oxides of sulphur produced by burning sulphur rich fuels such as [[coal]] and [[oil]] which give rise to [[acid rain]].&lt;ref&gt;Likens, G. E., W. C. Keene, J. M. Miller and J. N. Galloway.  1987.  Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia.  J. Geophys. Res. 92(D11):13,299-13,314.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemistry of sulphur oxides is complex both in the [[atmosphere]] and in river systems. However the effect on the overall chemistry is simple in that it reduces the pH of the water making it more acidic. The pH change is most marked in rivers with very low concentrations of dissolved salts as these cannot [[Buffer solution|buffer]] the effects of the acid input. Rivers downstream of major industrial conurbations are also at greatest risk. In parts of [[Scandinavia]] and [[West Wales]] and [[Scotland]] many rivers became so acidic from oxides of sulphur that most fish life was destroyed and pHs as low as pH4 were recorded  during critical weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Air pollution, acid rain, and the environment. Kenneth Mellanby, Watt Committee on Energy, Springer, 1988 {{ISBN|1-85166-222-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-85166-222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropogenic inputs==
The majority of rivers on the planet and many lakes have received or are receiving inputs from human-kind's activities. In the industrialised world, many rivers have been very seriously polluted, at least during the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries. Although in general there has been much improvement in the developed world, there is still a great deal of river pollution apparent on the planet.

==Toxicity==
In most environmental situations the presence or absence of an organism is determined by a complex web of interactions only some of which will be related to measurable chemical or biological parameters. Flow rate, turbulence, inter and intra specific competition, feeding behaviour, [[disease]], [[parasite|parasatism]], [[commensalism]] and [[symbiosis]] are just a few of the pressures and opportunities facing any organism or population. Most chemical constituents favour some organisms and are less favourable to others. However, there are some cases where a chemical constituent exerts a toxic effect. i.e. where the concentration can kill or severely inhibit the normal functioning of the organism. Where a toxic effect has been demonstrated this may be noted in the sections below dealing with the individual parameters.

==Chemical constituents==

===Colour and turbidity===
Often it is the colour of freshwater or how clear or hazy the water is that is the most obvious visual characteristic. Unfortunately neither colour nor turbidity are strong indicators of the overall chemical composition of water. However both colour and turbidity reduce the amount of light penetrating the water and can have significant impact on algae and macrophytes. Some algae in particular are highly dependent on water with low colour and turbidity

Many rivers draining high moor-lands overlain by [[peat]] have a very deep yellow brown colour caused by dissolved [[humic acid]]s.

===Organic constituents===

One of the principal sources of elevated concentrations of organic chemical constituents is from treated sewage.
{{main|Sewage treatment}}

Dissolved organic material is most commonly measured using either the [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD) test or the [[Chemical oxygen demand]] (COD) test. Organic constituents are significant in river chemistry for the effect that they have on dissolved oxygen concentration and for the impact that individual organic species may have directly on aquatic biota.

Any organic and degradable material consumes oxygen as it decomposes. Where organic concentrations are significantly elevated the effects on oxygen concentrations can be significant and as conditions get extreme the river bed may become [[anoxic waters|anoxic]].

Some organic constituents such as synthetic [[hormone]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[phthalate]]s have direct metabolic effects on aquatic biota and even on humans drinking water taken from the river. Understanding such constituents and how they can be identified and quantified is becoming of increasing importance in the understanding of freshwater chemistry.

===Metals===
A wide range of metals may be found in rivers from natural sources where metal ores are present in the rocks over which the river flows or in the aquifers feeding water into the river. However many rivers have an increased load of metals because of industrial activities which include mining and quarrying and the processing and use of metals.

====Iron====
Iron, usually as Fe&lt;sup&gt;+++&lt;/sup&gt; is a common constituent of river waters at very low levels. Higher iron concentrations in acidic springs or an anoxic hyporheic zone may cause visible orange/brown staining or semi-gelatinous precipitates of dense orange [[iron bacteria]]l [[Flocculation|floc]] carpeting the river bed. Such conditions are very deleterious to most organisms and can cause serious damage in a river system.

Coal mining is also a very significant source of  Iron both in mine-waters and from stocking yards of coal and from coal processing. Long abandoned mines can be a highly intractable source of high concentrations of Iron.
Low levels of iron are common in spring waters emanating from deep-seated aquifers and maybe regarding as health giving springs. Such springs are commonly called [[Chalybeate]] springs and have given rise to a number of [[Spa]] towns in Europe and the United States.

====Zinc====
[[Zinc]] is normally associated with metal mining, especially Lead and Silver mining but is also a component pollutant associated with a variety of other metal mining activities and with [[Coal mining]]. Zinc is toxic at relatively low concentrations to many aquatic organisms. ''Microregma'' starts to show a toxic reaction at concentrations as low as 0.33&amp;nbsp;mg/l &lt;ref&gt;Bringmann G. and Kuhn R., 1959, The toxic effects of waste water on aquatic bacteria, algae and small crustaceans, Gesund Ing 80, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heavy metals====
Lead and silver in river waters are commonly found together and associated with  lead mining. Impacts from very old mines can be very long-lived. In the [[River Ystwyth]] in [[Wales]] for example, the effects of silver and lead mining in the 17th and 18th centuries in the headwaters still causes unacceptably high levels of Zinc and [[Lead]] in the river water right down to its confluence with the sea. 
[[Silver]] is very toxic even at very low concentrations but leaves no visible evidence of its contamination.

Lead is also highly toxic to freshwater organisms and to humans if the water is used as drinking water. As with Silver, Lead pollution is not visible to the naked eye. The [[River Rheidol]] in west Wales had a major series of lead mines in its headwaters until the end of the 19th century and its mine discharges and waste tips remain to this day. In 1919 - 1921  only 14 species of invertebrates were found in the lower Rheidol when Lead concentrations were between 0.2ppm and 0.5ppm. By 1932 the lead concentration had reduced to 0.02ppm to 0.1ppm because of the abandonment of mining and, at those concentrations, the bottom fauna had stabilized to 103 species including three [[leech]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, R.D. and Jones, J.R.E., 1938, The faunistic recovery of a lead polluted river in north Cardiganshire, Wales, J. Anim. Ecol, 7, 272 -286&lt;/ref&gt;

Coal mining is also a very significant source of metals, especially Iron, Zinc and [[Nickel]] particularly where the coal is rich if [[pyrites]] which oxidises on contact with the air producing a very acidic [[leachate]] which is able to dissolve metals from the coal.

Significant levels of copper are unusual in rivers and where it does it occur the source is most likely to be mining activities, coal stocking, or [[pig]] farming. Rarely elevated levels may be of geological origin. Copper is acutely toxic to many freshwater organisms, especially algae, at very low concentrations and significant concentration in river water may have serious adverse effects on the local ecology.

===Nitrogen===
Nitrogenous compounds have a variety of sources including washout of oxides of nitrogen from the atmosphere, some geological inputs and some from macrophyte and [[algae|algal]] [[nitrogen fixation]]. However, for many rivers in the proximity of humans, the largest input is from sewage whether treated or untreated. The nitrogen derives from breakdown products of [[protein]]s found in [[urine]] and [[faeces]]. These products, being very soluble, often pass through sewage treatment process and are discharged into rivers as a component of [[sewage treatment]] effluent. Nitrogen may be in the form of [[nitrate]], [[nitrite]], [[ammonia]] or ammonium salts or what is termed albuminoid nitrogen or nitrogen still within an organic proteinoid molecule.

The differing forms of nitrogen are relatively stable in most river systems with nitrite slowly transforming into nitrate in well oxygenated rivers and ammonia transforming into nitrite/ nitrate. However, the process are slow in cool rivers and reduction in concentration may more often be attributed to simple dilution. All forms of nitrogen are taken up by macrophytes and algae and elevated levels of nitrogen are often associated with overgrowths of plants or [[eutrophication]]. These can have the effect of blocking channels and inhibiting [[navigation]]. However, ecologically, the more significant effect is on dissolved oxygen concentrations which may become super-saturated during daylight due to plant [[photosynthesis]] but then drop to very low levels during darkness as plant respiration uses up the dissolved oxygen. Coupled with the release of oxygen in photosynthesis is the creation of bi-carbonate ions which cause a steep rise in pH and this is matched in darkness as [[carbon dioxide]] is released through respiration which substantially lowers the pH. Thus high levels of nitrogenous compounds tends to lead to eutrophication with extreme variations in parameters which in turn can substantially degrade the ecological worth of the watercourse.

Ammonium ions also have a toxic effect, especially on [[fish]]. The toxicity of ammonia is dependent on both pH and temperature  and an added complexity is the buffering effect of the blood/water interface across the [[gill]] [[Biological membrane|membrane]] which masks any additional toxicity over about pH 8.0. The management of river chemistry to avoid ecological damage is particularly difficult in the case of ammonia as a wide range of potential scenarios of concentration, pH and temperature have to be considered and the diurnal pH fluctuation caused by photosynthesis considered. On warm summer days with high-bi-carbonate concentrations unexpectedly toxic conditions can be created.

===Phosphorus===
[[Phosphorus]] compounds are usually found as relatively insoluble phosphates in river water and, except in some exceptional circumstances, their origin is [[agriculture]] or human sewage. Phosphorus can encourage excessive growths of plants and algae and contribute to [[eutrophication]]. If a river discharges into a lake or reservoir phosphate can be mobilised year after year by natural processes. In the summer time, lakes stratify so that warm oxygen rich water floats on top of cold oxygen poor water. In the warm upper layers - the [[epilimnion]]- plants consume the available phosphate. As the plants die in the late summer they fall into the cool water layers underneath - the [[hypolimnion]] - and decompose. During winter turn-over, when a lake becomes fully mixed through the action of winds on a cooling body of water - the phosphates are spread throughout the lake again to feed a new generation of plants. This process is one of the principal causes of persistent [[algal bloom]]s at some lakes.

===Arsenic===
Geological deposits of arsenic may be released into rivers where deep ground-waters are exploited as in parts of [[Pakistan]]. Many metalloid ores such as lead, gold and [[copper]] contain traces of arsenic and poorly stored tailings may result in arsenic entering the [[hydrological cycle]].

===Solids===
Inert solids are produced in all montane rivers as the energy of the water helps grind away rocks into gravel, sand and finer material. Much of this settles very quickly and provides an important substrate for many aquatic organisms. Many [[salmon]]id fish require beds of gravel and sand in which to lay their eggs.
Many other types of solids from agriculture, mining, quarrying, urban run-off and sewage may block-out sunlight from the river and may block interstices in gravel beds making them useless for spawning and supporting insect life.

===Bacterial, viral and parasite inputs===
Both agriculture and sewage treatment produce  inputs into rivers with very high concentrations of [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[virus]]es including a wide range of [[pathogen]]ic organisms. Even in areas with little human activity significant levels of bacteria and viruses can be detected originating from fish and aquatic mammals and from animals grazing near rivers such as [[deer]].
Upland waters draining areas frequented by [[sheep]], [[goats]] or deer may also harbour a variety of opportunistic human parasites such as [[liver fluke]]. Consequently, there are very few rivers from which the water is safe to drink without some form of sterilisation or disinfection. In rivers used for contact recreation such as swimming, safe levels of bacteria and viruses can be established based on risk assessment.

Under certain conditions bacteria can colonise freshwaters occasionally making large rafts of filamentous mats known as ''sewage fungus'' – usually ''[[Sphaerotilus natans]]''. The presence of such organisms is almost always an indicator of extreme [[Organic compound|organic pollution]] and would be expected to be matched with low dissolved oxygen concentrations and high BOD vales.

[[E. coli]] bacteria have been commonly found in recreational waters and their presence is used to indicate the presence of recent faecal contamination, but E. coli presence may not be indicative of human waste. '' E. coli'' are found in all warm-blooded animals.  ''E. coli''  have also been found in  fish and turtles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks/lab/Hansen%20et%20al%202008%20JGLR%2034.pdf|title=Sources and Sinks of ''Escherichia coli'' in Benthic and Pelagic Fish|publisher=Internat. Assoc. Great Lakes Res|date=2008|author1= John J. Clark|author2= Satoshi Ishii|author3=Michael J. Sadowsky|author4=Randall E. Hicks|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enterobacteria]] may also persist in the environment in mud, sediments, sand and soil for considerable lengths of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~rhicks/lab/Ksoll%20et%20al%202007%20AEM%2073.pdf|title=Presence and Sources of Faecal Coliform Bacteria in Epilithic Periphyton Communities of Lake Superior|publisher= American Society for Microbiology|date=2007|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pH===
pH in rivers is affected by the geology of the water source, atmospheric inputs and a range of other chemical contaminants. pH is only likely to become an issue on very poorly buffered upland rivers where atmospheric sulphur and nitrogen oxides may very significantly depress the pH as low as pH4 or in eutrophic alkaline rivers where photosynthetic bi-carbonate ion production in photosynthesis may drive the pH up above pH10

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2480">The '''Galileo Galilei Institute for Theoretical Physics''' (GGI) is a research institute near [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  It "organizes and hosts small-size advanced workshops in theoretical [[particle physics]] in its broadest sense."&lt;ref name="GGI"&gt;[http://www.ggi.infn.it GGI Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each workshop is devoted to a specific topic at the forefront of current research. During its typical duration of 2–3 months it hosts about 10 to 30 participants selected among those most active in the field within the international community. The purpose of each workshop is to foster discussions, confrontation of ideas, and collaborations among participants.
As in similar Institutes, the aim is to produce results with a significant impact on the corresponding research field. Various Institutes for Theoretical Physics already work along similar lines, hosting distinguished researchers from all over the world for extended periods. They play an active and important role in the development of theoretical physics.
However an institution focused on the physics of fundamental interactions was still lacking in Europe and the Galileo Institute is filling this gap. The Galileo Institute, funded by INFN and sponsored by [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare]]  and [[University of Florence]], is located on the historic hill of [[Arcetri]], near the house where [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] spent periods of his life and died in 1642, in a building owned by the University of Florence. Its basic referent is the INFN Scientific Committee for Theoretical Physics which gives its full support to favour the activities of the Institute. The internationally recognized excellent record of INFN physicists in this domain of theoretical physics guarantee a profitable and fertile environment. The activity of the Institute is organized jointly by a Scientific and an Advisory Committee.

A "Launching Committee" was appointed with the task of giving advice about scientific and management structures and of suggesting criteria for the formation of the Scientific and Advisory Committees. The appointed members of the Launching Committee were [[David Gross]], Giuseppe Marchesini, [[Alfred Mueller]], [[Giorgio Parisi]] and [[Gabriele Veneziano]] (chair).

'''NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field''' is a [[NASA]] center, located within the cities of [[Brook Park, Ohio|Brook Park]] and [[Cleveland]] between [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] and the Rocky River Reservation of [[Cleveland Metroparks]], with a subsidiary facility in [[Sandusky, Ohio]]. Its director is Janet L. Kavandi. Glenn Research Center is one of ten major NASA field centers, whose primary mission is to develop science and technology for use in aeronautics and space. {{As of|May 2012}}, it employed about 1,650 civil servants and 1,850 support contractors located on or near its site.

In 2010, the formerly on-site NASA Visitors Center moved to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]] in the [[North Coast Harbor]] area of [[downtown Cleveland]].

==History==
The installation was established in 1942 as part of the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) and was later incorporated into the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] as a laboratory for aircraft engine research.

It was first named the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory after funding was approved in June 1940. It was renamed the Flight Propulsion Research Laboratory in 1947, the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (LFPL) in 1948 (after [[George W. Lewis]], the head of NACA from 1919 to 1947), and the NASA Lewis Research Center in 1958.

On March 1, 1999, the center was officially renamed the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field. [[John Glenn]] was an American fighter pilot, astronaut, and politician.

As early as 1951, researchers at the LFPL were studying the combustion processes in [[liquid rocket]] engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?Ntt=tn-2349&amp;Ntk=all&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall | title=NACA TN-2349, Fluctuations in a spray formed by two impinging jets | publisher=[[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plum Brook Field Station===
[[File:GRC PBS B-2 Facility Aerial View.jpg|thumb|right|GRC Plum Brook Station Spacecraft Propulsion Facility (B-2)]]

The {{convert|6400|acre|ha|sing=on}} Plum Brook Field Station near [[Sandusky, Ohio]] is also part of Glenn ({{coord|41|20|59.4|N|82|39|01.8|W|region:US-OH_type:landmark|display=inline}}). It is located about {{convert|50|mi}} from the main campus. It specializes in very large scale tests that would be hazardous on the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/facility.html | title=NASA Glenn Test Facilities | publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226144534/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/facility.html | archivedate=February 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the station consisted of five major facilities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-ig-scrutinizes-seldom-used-plum-brook-test-facilities/ | title=NASA IG Scrutinizes Seldom-used Plum Brook Test Facilities | author=Dan Leone | publisher=Spacenews, Inc. | website=spacenews.com | date=April 24, 2015 | accessdate=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility: not fully functional
* Combined Effects Chamber: never used and unusable
* Cryogenic Components Laboratory: slated for demolition
* Hypersonic Test Facility
* Space Power Facility

The [[Plum Brook Reactor]] was decontaminated and decommissioned under a 2008 cost-plus-fee contract valued at more than $33.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2008/may/HQ_C08030_Plum_Brook.html | title=NASA Awards Reactor Decontamination and Decommission Contract | publisher=[[NASA]] | date=May 29, 2008 | accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility====
{{anchor|Spacecraft Propulsion Facility}}
{{main|Space Power Facility}}

The B-2 Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility is the world's only facility capable of testing full-scale, upper-stage launch vehicles and rocket engines under simulated high-altitude conditions. The Space Power Facility houses the world's largest space environment vacuum chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/plumbrook.html | title=Plum Brook Station | publisher=NASA | accessdate=October 3, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511160415/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/testfacilities/plumbrook.html | archivedate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Icing tunnel ===
An icing tunnel is capable of simulating atmospheric icing condition to test the effect of ice accretion on aircraft wings and body as well as to test anti-icing systems for aircraft.

=== Zero Gravity Research Facility ===
{{main|Zero Gravity Research Facility}}
The Zero Gravity Research Facility is a vertical [[vacuum chamber]] used for [[microgravity]] experiments. It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985. The facility uses vertical drop tests in a vacuum chamber to investigate the behavior of components, systems, liquids, gases, and combustion in such circumstances.

The facility consists of a concrete-lined shaft, {{convert|28|ft|m}} in diameter, that extends {{convert|510|ft|m}} below ground level. An aluminum vacuum chamber, {{convert|20|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|470|ft|m}} high, is contained within the concrete shaft. The pressure in this vacuum chamber is reduced to 13.3 newtons per square meter (1.3{{e|-4}}atm) before use.

After the closing of the [[Japan Microgravity Centre]] (JAMIC), the NASA Zero-G facility is the largest microgravity facility in the world.

Another, smaller drop tower remains in use. That tower has a free fall time of 2.2 seconds, and the [[Dropping In Microgravity Environment]] (DIME) program is conducted there.

==Significant developments==
===Aeronautics science and technology===
{{unsourced section|date=June 2018}}
NASA Glenn does significant research and technology development on jet engines, producing designs that reduce energy consumption, pollution, and noise. The chevrons it invented for noise reduction appear on many commercial jet engines today, including the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]].

===Space science and technology===
The Glenn Research Center, along with its partners in industry, are credited with the following:
* The [[Rocket propellant|liquid hydrogen]] rocket engine, which [[Wernher von Braun]] credited as being the critical technology leading to the [[Apollo moon landing]]&lt;ref name="Hydrogen"&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4404/cover.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029053729/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4404/cover.htm|date=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Air-breathing propulsion
* Communications technology and development
* Space propulsion and cryogenic fluids management
* Power, energy storage, and conversion
* Materials and structures for extreme environments

===Education===

The Glenn Research Center is home to the Lewis' Educational and Research Collaborative Internship Program (LERCIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/education/LERCIP_GRC.html | title=USA.gov | publisher=NASA | date=September 29, 2013 | accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides internships for high school and college students and high school teachers. The high school program is an eight-week internship for sophomores and juniors with interests in science, technology, engineering, math, or professional administration. The college level consists of a 10-week internship and is open to college students at all levels. Only residents of the Cleveland area are eligible for high school LERCIP, but college LERCIP is open to students nationwide. Interns work closely with their NASA mentors and are involved in the daily activities of the Center. They are expected to be available to work 40 hours a week for the duration of the internship. The LERCIP Teacher program is a 10-week internship for educators in STEM fields.

====Other====
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2018}}
The [[Dropping In Microgravity Environment]] is an annual contest held yearly by the center. Teams of high school students write proposals for experiments to be performed in the Drop Tower. The winners travel to the Center, perform their experiments, and submit a research report to NASA.

==Future of Glenn==
After 2004, NASA had been shifting its focus towards space exploration as mandated by the [[Vision for Space Exploration]]. Because of this, it was perceived by some that regional NASA centers like Glenn, which focus on research and technology, were becoming more and more marginalized in terms of resources and relevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/politics/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/opinion/1145090523129980.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Northeast Ohio|publisher=[[Cleveland.com]]|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212626/http://www.cleveland.com/politics/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fopinion%2F1145090523129980.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2013-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on May 13, 2006, it was announced that NASA Glenn Research Center had secured management of the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]]'s service module, which promised to generate billions of dollars and hundreds of jobs for the center.  This work secured the center's future in the near term, and signalled a shift in priority for the center from aeronautical research to space exploration, aligning itself closer with NASA's new mission.

Another change of direction created uncertainty in 2010, however, when [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] declared the end of the Vision for Space Exploration and sought to chart a new course{{clarify|date=November 2010}} for human space flight and NASA.  However, the 2015 budget for NASA made substantial increases to projects in which the Research Center participates, such as aeronautics research, planetary science and space technology, and some of that funding was expected to flow down to the Center.&lt;ref name=CCB2015&gt;{{cite news |last1=Soder |first1=Chuck |title=Beefed-up budget is big development for NASA Glenn |url=http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20150111/SUB1/301119979/beefed-up-budget-is-big-development-for-nasa-glenn |accessdate=August 12, 2016 |agency=Crain's Cleveland Business |date=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA Glenn Visitor Center==
[[File:Skylab 3 Apollo Command Module.JPG|thumb|The Apollo Command Module of the [[Skylab 3]] mission being moved to the Great Lakes Science Center]]

The NASA Glenn Visitor Center features six galleries with interactive exhibits about NASA, space exploration, John Glenn and other astronauts, satellites and the solar system.  The center also features an auditorium for lectures, movies and special programs, and a gift shop.  Admission is free. Adult visitors must be U.S. citizens and present photo identification.

The NASA Glenn Research Center also offers public tours of its research facilities on the first Saturday of each month. Reservations must be made in advance.

The Visitor Center closed in September 2009 with many displays shifted to the [[Great Lakes Science Center]], and new ones created there.  This move was done to reduce the public relations budget and to provide easier access to the general public, especially the under-served community.  It was hoped that putting the displays at the much more visited science center will bring the NASA Glenn facility more public exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/cuyahoga/1247733104222090.xml&amp;coll=2|title=Cleveland Plain Dealer &amp;#124; Cleveland, Ohio Newspaper|publisher=cleveland.com|date=|accessdate=2013-10-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616174255/http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fcuyahoga%2F1247733104222090.xml&amp;coll=2|archivedate=2013-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, this proved true: compared to the 60,000 visitors per year at its former site, the Glenn Visitor Center enjoyed 330,000 visitors in the first year at the Great Lakes Science Center.

'''Global Engineering Education''' is a field of study that focuses on the impact of [[globalization]] on the [[engineering industry]].

== History ==
Over the past decade or so educators and researchers have made an effort to transform engineering education in light of global trends in the profession.  In 1985, the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] issued a study that spotlighted the need for universities to graduate engineers with professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Education and Practice in the United States: Foundations of our Techno-Economic Future. 1985, National Research Council: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; This message was reinforced through a 1994 joint report published by the Engineering Deans Council and [[ASEE]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, E., E. Baum, and J. McTague, Green Report: Engineering Education for a Changing World. American Soc. for Engineering Education, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that stated, “Today, engineering colleges … must educate their students to work as part of teams, communicate well, and understand the economic, social, environmental and international context of their professional activities.”

== Definitions ==

===Global Competency===
[[Global competency]] is essential for engineers from any country who now compete in an international market for engineering know-how.  No longer is [[cultural sensitivity]] needed only for [[product design]] destined for diverse markets. Increasingly, successful entry into the engineering profession requires significant intercultural skills in order to join efficient and productive collaborations with diverse engineering colleagues. Those colleagues may be encountered “virtually” at a distance, in person at an international site, or next door in the office of a [[multinational corporation]]. Outsourcing is increasing, not only for products but also for processes, including highly technical engineering work. Projects are distributed across sites and effective collaboration requires professionals who can work productively with colleagues who are very different from themselves.&lt;ref&gt;B. I. Allert, D.

[[IEEE Education Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/edsoc/ The Education Society]&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and its major objective is to strive a global leader in engineering education. The organization of education engineering worldwide conferences as they are the EDUCON and the FIE - Frontiers in Education Conference with an open view of all the publications included there as well the integration of engineering educator leaders along all the world in the Administration Committee allows a world integration of different views and perspectives. Newly publication IEEE-RITA (Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologías del Aprendizaje - Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologías de Aprendizagem - Latin-American Learning Technologies Journal) incorporates a new vision of technology and engineering education in Spanish and Portuguese languages.&lt;ref&gt;R.

'''Halogen Foundation (Singapore)''' is an Institute of Public Character &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page03.aspx?id=1268 Institute of Public Character] Retrieved June 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[not-for-profit organization]] in [[Singapore]] whose mission is to inspire and influence a generation of young people to lead themselves and others well.

==Origins==
Halogen Foundation was started in 1997 in [[Australia]] originally called the Young Leaders Foundation. Its hallmark program is the National Young Leaders Days, an annual event initiated in 1997 to develop student leadership in schools. The Foundation exists in five major cities in [[Australia]] - [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. It can also be found in [[New Zealand]], incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halogenfoundation.org/about.asp Who We Are.] Retrieved June 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and covering [[Auckland]], [[Wellington]], [[Christchurch]], and [[Dunedin]].  It also has operations in [[Singapore]] where it is considered an Institute of Public Character.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
National Young Leaders Day consists of a range of presenters, who aim to motivate young leaders in taking action in their schools and passing on the lessons they have learned on the day. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Halogen Foundation is endorsed by national leaders of the respective countries.

'''Humor research''' (also '''humor studies''') is a multifaceted field which enters the domains of [[linguistics]], [[history]], and [[literature]]. Research in humor has been done to understand the psychological and physiological effects, both positive and negative, on a person or groups of people. Research in humor has revealed many different [[theories of humor]] and many different kinds of humor including their functions and effects personally, in relationships, and in society.

==Areas==
Humor research deals with a wide variety of issues,&lt;ref name=mn2002&gt;M.P. Mulder, A. Nijholt (2002). [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/580062.html Humour&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Research: State of the Art].&lt;/ref&gt; which can be categorized according to several [[theories of humor]]. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, humor research has many areas of study which aim to explain the phenomenon of humor.

===Neuroanatomy of humor===
[[Cognitive neuroscience]] has provided insight into how humor is neurologically realized. Brain imaging techniques such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]] have been implemented in this subfield of humor research.
 
There are a few main regions of the human brain associated with humor and laughter. The production of laughter involves two primary brain pathways, one for involuntary and one for voluntary laughter (i.e., Duchenne and non-Duchenne laughter). Involuntary laughter is usually emotionally driven and includes key emotional brain areas such as the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus|thalamic areas]], and the [[brainstem]]. Voluntary laughter, however, begins in the premotor opercular area in the temporal lobe and moves to the motor cortex and pyramidal tract before moving to the brainstem. Wild et al. (2003)&lt;ref name="Wild, B. 2003"&gt;Wild, B., Rodden, F.A., Grodd, W., &amp; Ruch, W. (2003). Neural correlates of laughter and humour&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;. ''Brain'', 126, 2121-1238.&lt;/ref&gt; propose that the generation of laughter is mostly influenced by neural pathways that go from the premotor and motor cortex to the ventral side of the brainstem through the cerebral peduncles. It is also suggested that real laughter is not produced from the motor cortex, but that the normal inhibition of cortical frontal areas stops during laughter.

When the electrical activity of the brain is measured during and after hearing a joke, a prominent response can be seen approximately 300ms after the punchline, followed by a depolarization about 100ms later. The fact that humor response occurs in two separate waves of activity supports the idea that humor processing occurs in two stages.

Functional MRI and PET studies further illuminate which parts of the brain are participating in the experience of humor. A study by Ozawa et al. (2000) found that, when participants heard sentences that they rated as humorous, the [[Broca's area]] and the middle [[frontal gyrus]] were activated. Additionally, [[Wernicke's area]] and the [[transverse temporal gyri]] were activated, but these areas also were also found to be active in control (non-humorous) conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Ozawa, F., Matsuo, K., Kato, C., Nakai, T., Isoda, H., Takehara, Y., et al. (2000). The effects of listening comprehension of various genres of literature on response in the linguistic area: An fMRI study. ''NeuroReport'', 11, 1141-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study using fMRI showed that the linguistic basis of jokes participants found to be humorous impacted which parts of the brain were activated. In response to [[pun]]s, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus were activated. When listening to semantic jokes, the left posterior middle temporal gyrus was again activated, as were the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus, the right posterior middle temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum. Brain activity in the medial ventral prefrontal cortex was associated with ratings of funniness that the participants gave after the brain scan and initial humor response. This response may stem from the mood or emotional change that occurs after hearing humor.&lt;ref&gt;Goel, V., &amp; Dolan, R. (2001). The functional anatomy of humor: Segregating cognitive and affective components. ''Nature Neuroscience'', 4(3), 237-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Induction of laughter through direct brain stimulation has been reported in a number of studies, and includes areas such as ACC, globus pallidus, floor of the third ventricle, and most recently left superior frontal gyrus – though these results are hard to draw inferences from (may be inhibitory, may be artefacts, etc.) Because the nature of laughter is so complex—involving facial muscles, respiratory actions, etc.--a control center has been hypothesized in the upper pons.&lt;ref name="Wild, B. 2003"/&gt;

===Play research===
[[File:Children playing in the sand at Lido Beach- Sarasota, Florida (4565683128).jpg|thumb|Children playing in the sand in Florida, United States]]

Studies within [[play (activity)|play]] research have provided correlates to the study of humor, as play often takes on a humorous demeanor. A child's social play often invokes the use of [[joke]]s, non-serious social [[Theories of humor#Incongruity theory|incongruity]], physical [[slapstick]] humor. Studies on how play "promot[es] [[social cohesion]], [[cooperation]], and even [[altruism]],"&lt;ref name=Gervais2005&gt;Gervais, M. &amp; Wilson, D., 2005. The evolution and functions of laughter and humor: A synthetic approach. ''The Quarterly Review of Biology''. 80(4), 395-430&lt;/ref&gt; have been used to describe humor's function. Laughter is often a byproduct of playful social interactions, and can therefore be viewed as serving a similar function as play. It can be said that the perception and appreciation of humor decreases aggression and stress while promoting cooperation and fairness. Play research can provide a functional look at humor in its relation to social interactions.

===Evolutionary psychology===
Evolutionary theorists have attempted to study and explain the phenomena of laughter and humor in terms of survival benefit. Laughter-like behavior is not unique to humans, but humans do display a much more consistent and complex use of humor and laughter than other animals &lt;ref name=Gervais2005 /&gt; The evolution and functions of laughter and humor have been explored in an attempt to understand how and why humor and laughter have become part of human existence.

[[Duchenne de Boulogne|Duchenne]] [[laughter]] refers to laughter that is stimulus-driven and linked to some positive experience. This is usually the result of a perceived social incongruity. Non-Duchenne laughter refers to laughter that is unconnected to any emotional experience, but rather laughter that is originated voluntarily. Duchenne laughter evolved before non-Duchenne laughter with the function of making play and playful emotions contagious. In these situations, laughter serves as an in-group designator. Early evolutionary laughter is also theorized to serve the function of dissolving social tension. During moments of displays of social superiority, laughter could be used to dissolve tensions that otherwise could lead to fighting or exclusion from a group, by designating those situations as play rather than as a real challenge. Duchenne laughter, which should be thought of as emotionally-valenced rather than simply spontaneous, can increase positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]] and mood of an individual as well as a group.&lt;ref&gt;Spoor, J. R. &amp; Kelly, J. R. (2004). The evolutionary significance of affect in groups: Communication and group bonding. ''Group Processes and Intergroup Relations'', 7, 398-412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neuhoff, C. &amp; Shaeffer, C. (2002). Effects of laughing, smiling, and howling on mood. ''Psychological Reports'', 91, 1079-1080&lt;/ref&gt; So, early laughter most likely provided survival benefits through effects of emotional contagion that served to strengthen within-group ties. Non-duchenne laughter developed later than Duchenne laughter. Non-duchenne laughter was co-opted for a variety of other social situations as laughter and humor already existed. Voluntarily accessing the laughter system that was already in place would serve to strengthen in-group fitness just as genuine, emotional laughter did before it, but now it could be done at will. Thus, non-Duchenne laughter developed to express things like aggression, nervousness, hierarchy positions, and to do things such as manipulate, appease, and make fun of others. Even when non-Duchenne laughter is unconscious, that does not mean it is necessarily emotional or using the same brain pathways as genuine Duchenne laughter. As social situations became more complex in later hominid stages of evolution, so did the functions and usefulness of laughter. As linguistics developed, proto-laughter and proto-humor were both co-opted for assistance in the production of and response to effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, J. &amp; Panksepp, J.B. (2000). The seven sins of evolutionary psychology. ''Evolution and Cognition'', 6, 108-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor as a mental fitness indicator====
It has been hypothesized that intentional humor evolved as indicator of [[intelligence]]. Humor is often rated as important in mate selection, and it may be that partners are selecting for genetic fitness. General intelligence predicted higher ratings on humor tasks, even after controlling for [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] personality factors.&lt;ref&gt;Howrigan, D. &amp; MacDonald, K. (2008). Humor as a mental fitness indicator. ''Evolutionary Psychology'', 6(4), 652-666.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greengross &amp; Miller&lt;ref name="greengross"&gt;Greengross, G. &amp; Miller, G. (2011). Humor ability reveals intelligence, predicts mating success, and is higher in males. ''Intelligence'', 39, 188-192.&lt;/ref&gt; propose that humor plays into sexual selection. Rather than being sexually attractive for its own sake, humor is attractive because it is an indicator of other things which humor is correlated with, such as intelligence, [creativity], and other desirable traits. Intelligence has been shown to be a mental fitness indicator and is highly sexually desirable for both traits&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D.M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 12, 1-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligence and humor ability are positively correlated and the ability to produce humor on the spot predicts mating success. In line with theories regarding sex differences of mating strategies, humor ability was rated higher by a blind panel of judges when produced from males than females.

A large proportion of humor is produced during informal conversation and involves the derision of a specific person (either oneself or another). The adaptiveness of deprecating humor in social interactions is a point of interest among researchers. Drawing attention to one's own faults seems counter-intuitive when considering humor's function of strengthening within-group fitness and sexual desirability. Other-deprecating humor has functions which are implicated in establishing same-sex rivalries. This sort of humor usually targets fitness indicators of rivals, which can be risky if an opponent perceives the humor as a threat worthy of retaliation. Self-deprecating humor is proposed to fit within [[cost signaling theory]]. Greengross and Miller&lt;ref name="greengross" /&gt; found that self-deprecating humor had predictive value for long-term sexual attractiveness. However, this occurred as an interaction effect, and only was predictive for high-status individuals. Self-deprecating humor may only work for high-status individuals because it ironically points out the desirable traits by way of discrepancy. In low-status individuals, this approach is unproductive, as the humor is pointing to actual weak fitness traits rather than a discrepancy as with high-status individuals.

==Benefits of humor==

===Psychological benefits===

==== Humor style and psychological outcomes ====
There are two [[adaptive]] styles of humor and two [[maladaptive]] styles of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., Puhlik-Doris, P., Larsen, G., Gray, J., &amp; Weir, K. (2003). Individual differences in the uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the Humor Styles Questionnaire. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliative and self-enhancing humor are the two adaptive styles. The defining feature of affiliative humor is humor that is used to strengthen interpersonal relationships or ease tensions within those relationships. Self-enhancing humor involves the use of a humorous outlook on situations in life as a coping tool. In this instance, humor is used to mitigate stress without targeting others or the self in a hurtful way. The two maladaptive humor styles are aggressive humor, which uses sarcasm and other humor styles to target or put down others and self-defeating humor, which uses self-deprecating tactics for the enjoyment of others.  Martin et al. (2003) found that higher levels of adaptive humor are related to psychological well-being in terms of lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem. Self-defeating humor contrasts with the adaptive types, and is associated with poorer psychological health. Kuiper and McHale (2009) found support for humor styles being mediators between self-evaluation and psychological well-being. Simply put, rather than humor styles directly affecting psychological well-being, they are involved with how people self-evaluate, which results in different amounts of psychological well-being.

In a study examining humor as an intervention, random assignment to a humor group, a social group, and a non-intervention control group was used. A standardized manual and booklet were used in the intervention group, and results showed that the humor group demonstrated significant increases in emotional well-being. Importantly, self-efficacy, positive affect, optimism, and perceptions of control were found to go up while other negative measures decreased. Crawford &amp; Caltabiano (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S.A. &amp; Caltabiano, N.J. (2011). Promoting emotional well-being through the use of humor. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology'', 6(3), 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt; found support for humor as an intervention which may increase positive aspects of emotional well-being. Humor skills of the intervention group were targeted through the use of a manual. Humor increased several measures of well-being including self-efficacy, positive affect, optimism, and perception of control, even more than a “social group” control or a non-intervention control group. The exposure to humor and humor skills training was also found to decrease certain negative aspects of emotional well-being, including perceived stress, certain depressive symptoms, and anxiety.

==== Benefit vs. detriment of humor ====
Adaptive components of humor show facilitative effects on psychological well-being. Maladaptive styles that were self-focused showed detrimental effects, while maladaptive styles that did not focus on self were unrelated to personal well beings. Self-deprecating humor is the specific component of maladaptive humor that results in decreased psychological well-being, while both of the adaptive styles of humor (affiliative and self-enhancing) are associated with positive psychological outcomes, such as greater self-esteem, lower depression and anxiety levels, and greater endorsement of self-efficacy. It is important to note that the relevant psychological states may have preceded the humor style rather than vice versa.

===Physical health benefits===
Humor research includes investigations into the positive benefits of humor, sense of humor, and laughter on physical health. In recent decades, humor research has seen a surge in publications in part because of [[Norman Cousins]] and his claims that he became cured from ankylosing spondilitis due to a daily regimen which included humor and laughter.

====Humor and immune response====
Positive affect is theorized to influence physical health by means of the [[immune system]]. The immune system could be influenced positively by humor in a number of ways. The possibilities include simple immunoenhancement, stress moderation, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Berk L, Tan S, Eby B, Carmons M, Vorce D. Modulation of human natural killer cells by catecholamines. Clin Res. 1984;32(1):51A&lt;/ref&gt; The pleasant experience of humor is thought to positively influence affect so that stress is moderated. The antibody secretory immunoglobin A (S-IgA) is associated with both positive and negative affect states, with negative states decreasing effectiveness and positive states increasing effects of the antibody.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, A. A., Cox, D. S., Valdimarsdottir, H., Jandorf, L., &amp; Neale, J. M. (1987). Evidence that secretory IgA antibody is associated with daily mood. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 52, 988-993.&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of immune response can be predicted by the number of desirable events (and presumably mood) which occur in preceding days to the immune assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, A. A., Neale, J. M., Cox, D. S., Napoli, A., Valdimarsdottir, H., &amp; Kennedy-Moore, E. (1994). Daily events are associated with secretory immune response to an oral antigen in men. ''Health Psychology'', 13, 440 446.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also evidence that significant mood changes in either direction can induce an increase in immune response.&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, P. H., Levy, E. M., Giorgi, R. G., Black, P. H., Fox, B. H., &amp; Heeren, T. C. (1992). Short-term immunological effects of induced emotions. ''Psychosomatic Medicine'', 54, 133-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Laughter as an overt behavior is also associated with immune response, specifically [[NK cell]] activity, which are part of the body’s immune response. [[Glucocorticoids]] are lower in subjects who laughed while watching a humorous video, and glucocorticoids decrease NK cell activity, so humor theory posits this pathway as a possible mechanism for humor as a benefit to immune responses.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, M.P., Zeller, J. M., Rosernberg, L., McCann, J., (2003). The effect of mirthful laughter on stress and natural killer cell activity. ''Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine'', 9(2), 38-45.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear whether these effects on this specific immune response measurement have long-term effects with clinical significance. Using humor as a coping style is a way which these long-term effects on the immune system may be enacted. In one study, levels of S-IgA and the use of humor as a coping style were positively correlated, although the saliva sampling procedure of this study was subsequently called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, K. M., Minchoff, B., &amp; Baker, K. H. (1985-1986). Positive emotional states and enhancement of the immune system. ''International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine'', 15, 13-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salovey, P., Rothman, A.J., Detweiler, J.B., &amp; Steward, W.T. (2000). Emotional States and Physical Health. ''American Psychologist'', 55(1), 110-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor and stress====
Humor is thought to play a role in the levels of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that people experience, both in the short-term and long-term. Watching a humorous video for 20 minutes can significantly lower stress levels, on a level comparable to 20 minutes of exercise. Since watching a video is more widely feasible than exercising for 20 minutes for large portions of the population, humor researchers hope that the acute anxiety-alleviating effects of humor can be used in a therapeutic setting.&lt;ref name="Szabo"&gt;Szabo, A. (2003) The acute effects of humor and exercise on mood and anxiety. ''Journal of Leisure Research''. (35)2, 152-162.&lt;/ref&gt; Although acute benefits of humor may be obtained, this does not guarantee any long term benefits.&lt;ref name="Szabo"/&gt;

====Humor and pain====
Humor's effect on pain tolerance is another point of interest within humor research. Hypotheses for this research include the idea that the positive feelings of humor will increase the threshold of pain that a person can endure. These ideas are implicit in some folk wisdom&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthcentral.com/chronic-pain/coping-277931-5.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in anecdotes such as Norman Cousins' recovery story. Though not all studies have showed support for the pain-reducing effect of humor,&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, O., Keinan, G., &amp; Teshimovsky-Arditi, M. (1993). Humor and pain tolerance. Humor: International Journal of Humor Research, 6, 71-88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudak, D. A., Dale, A., Hudak, M. A., &amp; DeGood, D. E. (1991). Effects of humorous stimuli and sense of humor on discomfort. ''Psychological Reports'', 69, 779-786.&lt;/ref&gt; humor and comedy stimuli do have effects on pain tolerance and perception, particularly when pain is assessed after the humor stimuli is completed.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, R., Cogan, D., Waltz, W., &amp; McCue, M. (1987). Effects of laughter and relaxation on discomfort thresholds. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, W, 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laughterremedy.com/2010/12/humor-and-laughter-reduce-pain/&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the measures of most studies examining pain, it is difficult to tell if simply consuming humorous material is sufficient for pain reduction, or if actual laughter is a necessary component.&lt;ref name="Martin, R. A. 2001"&gt;Martin, R. A. (2001). "Humor, laughter, and physical health: Methodological issues and research findings." ''Psychological bulletin'', (127)4, 504-519.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some studies that used negative affect control groups found that pain thresholds also increased for people experiencing unsettling stimuli, such as a clip from a horror movie.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J., &amp; Zillmann, D. (1994). Effect of humor and tragedy on discomfort tolerance. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 78, 632-634.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisenberg, M., Tepper, L, &amp; Schwarzwald, J. (1995). Humor as a cognitive technique for increasing pain tolerance. Pain, 63, 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt; So, humor does have an effect on pain, but it is unclear what exact behavioral requirements are necessary as well as if humor has an effect greater than other emotionally salient experiences.

====Issues in humor research and physical health====
Even though the positive benefits of humor have been lauded by popular media and have found support among scientific research, the field of humor research also has received criticism. The scientific support for the physical benefits of humor are somewhat sparse, and the findings from the existing research have been called into question in some cases.&lt;ref name="Martin, R. A. 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R.A. (2004). Sense of humor and physical health: Theoretical issues, recent findings, and future directions. ''Humor'', 17, 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Humor is assessed differently based on the theories which underpin the research, such as whether humor is a stable personality trait or not. Because of the non-standard measurements of humor in research, it is difficult to tell whether researchers are measuring the same thing across studies. Sense of humor, internal humor response, and laughter can all be targeted to measure humor, but are not necessarily interchangeable. Martin (2001) critiques several studies for not measuring laughter along with their self-report humor measures.

Aside from theoretical issues, the methods of some key humor research was also called into question by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the immune response sampling techniques of some humor research may have not been reliable because of how baseline immune levels were set. According to Martin (2001), within the nine studies assessing S-IgA levels in response to humor, three did not have control groups, five had control groups which involved a documentary viewing where interest was not assessed, and only one study had a negative affect control. Proper use of control groups is among the major issues within humor research. Some experimental findings are encouraging, but no firm conclusions involving humor and physical health where controls were not used correctly can be drawn. Thus, there is only partial support of immune effects of humor.

===Humor in marriage===
[[File:YoungCoupleEmbracing-20070508.jpg|thumb|A couple laughing together]]&lt;!-- alternately [[File:Laughing couple.jpg]] --&gt;

In 2002, a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Koning|first=E.E.|author2=Weiss, R. L.|title=The Relational Humor Inventory: Functions of humor in close relationships.|journal=American Journal of Family Therapy |year=2002|volume=30|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/019261802753455615}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was conducted on the functions of humor in close relationships. The study examined three types of humor:

*'''positive humor''', describing positive aspects of humor, such as humor appreciation, attractiveness, and closeness
*'''negative humor''', describing humor used to express aggression, or humor used in a manipulative manner
*'''instrumental humor''', measuring the extent to which the person uses humor to avoid tension or tries to smooth over negative feelings

Positive humor is expected to be related to intimacy and marital satisfaction. This relation was true for the wives, but not for the husbands. This suggests that whether or not husbands use positive humor, it has nothing to do with how closely they feel to their partner or their marital satisfaction. Research suggests that instrumental humor is negatively related to marital satisfaction and is an indicator of potential future marital deterioration. Results showed that husbands acknowledged using instrumental humor in their relationship in relation to demand-withdrawal, in which the wife demands and the husband withdraws. Wives, on the other hand, did not acknowledge the use of instrumental humor in this communication pattern. This seems to indicate that men more often withdraw than women, in this case, with the use of humor. Negative humor was not related to any of the other humor measure in the study. This makes sense considering that put-downs or hurtful humor does not tend to lead to laughter or humor appreciation. Negative humor items in the questionnaire given to the participants described expressing negative emotion. Negative humor somewhat correlated with demand-withdrawal for husbands and wives. This humor can be a form of passive aggressiveness where the one using the humor is not taking responsibility for the put-down or hurtful joke, and in doing so, avoiding, or withdrawing from, conflict.

==Measuring responses to humor==
When someone finds something funny, there are different ways of expressing it. Common responses of humor include laughing and smiling. In 2008, a study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=G.|author2=Sadler, S. J. |author3=Barrett, C. E. |author4=Beaven, A. |title=Measuring responses to humor: How the testing context affects individuals' reaction to comedy.|journal=Humor: International Journal of Humor Research|year=2008|volume=21|issue=2|pages=143–155|doi=10.1515/HUMOR.2008.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was conducted using 155 undergraduate students at North London University in order to measure responses to humor using a British comedy. The participants were divided into one of three categories: watched a video of the comedy, listened to an audiotape of the comedy, or read a script of the comedy. Approximately half of the participants were observed by an overt video camera and half were observed by a covert video camera. Results showed that participants laughed and smiled much more frequently when watching a video of the comedy and listening to the audiotape of the comedy than when reading a script. The difference in the frequency of smiling and laughing between the video and the audiotape was not significant. Participants laughed and smiled more frequently when observed by a covert video camera than an overt video camera. Aspects of the video and audiotape such as visualization of the acting, auditory representation, and also the presence of audience laughter significantly increase the frequency of laughter and smiling.

== History ==
At the late of 1970s, Egypt was motivated to build eight [[nuclear power plant]]s and to develop experience at the back end of a [[nuclear fuel cycle]] and was concluded several contracts with an unnamed foreign company to build the Hydrometallurgy Pilot Plant (HPP).&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP was originally designed as a [[nuclear reprocessing]] facility,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;&lt;ref name=ffi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gabrielsen|first1=Andreas|title=Drivers of nuclear weapons proliferation in Egypt and Saudi Arabia|url=http://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/13-02307.pdf|website=[[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]]|accessdate=4 May 2015|date=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1982, the second laboratory became operational.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Overview ==
The HPP consists of three laboratories, the first laboratory consists of three hot cells (modules 1-3)&lt;ref name=nti /&gt; with the first module, is [[radiation protection|shielded]] [[alpha particle]] cell dedicated for mechanical shearing of research reactor fuel, it was unfinished due to the inability to secure the necessary export licence for the shearing equipment from the foreign vendor. The second module, is dissolver and [[mixer-settler]]s for first stage fission product separation. The third module, was designed for [[radioactive waste#Vitrification|waste vitrification]] with no equipment had been installed.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

The second laboratory contains two modules, module 4, whish is a [[Lead shielding|lead shielded]] [[glove box]] for second stage fission product separation using mixer settlers, while module 5, is an unshielded glove box for the separation of plutonium from uranium.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

The third laboratory consists of two connected glove box lines suitable for plutonium chemistry but which contain no equipment.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt;

HPP possess a minor plutonium processing capacity and unable to reprocess and extract [[weapons-grade#Weapons-grade plutonium|weapons-grade plutonium]] from the spent fuel of the research reactors due to the inability to complete the facility,&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blanc|first1=Alexis|last2=Roberts|first2=Brad|title=Nuclear Proliferation: A Historical Overview|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA482642|publisher=[[Institute for Defense Analyses]]|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Egypt decided to use one cell of the HPP within the framework of a project for the management of unused and orphan radioactive sealed sources,&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; which provides Egypt with the research capabilities on the back-end of nuclear fuel cycle.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;

== Undeclared nuclear materials and activities ==
{{main|Nuclear program of Egypt#Undeclared nuclear activity}}
In early 2001, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) detected particles of [[actinides]] and [[nuclear fission product|fission products]] near the HPP facility, which shed light on the existence of the HPP.&lt;ref name=nti /&gt;&lt;ref name=mef /&gt;

In November 2004 and January 2005, Egypt declared that, in 1987, it had carried out [[acceptance test]]s in the HPP using unirradiated [[uranyl nitrate]] in chemical reagents purchased from the local market while the uranyl nitrate had been mixed with a solution obtained from the dissolution of domestically produced scrap [[UO2]] pellets (with 1.9&amp;nbsp;kg of uranium compounds). Egypt rationalized that it did not inform the IAEA about the facility, materials nor their use in the tests as the HPP never completed and it was designed for bench scale radiochemistry experiments, while Egypt should declared the HPP to the Agency as early as possible prior to the introduction of nuclear material into the facility, according to the [[IAEA safeguards|Safeguards Agreement]] which came into forece in 1982.&lt;ref name=globalsecurity /&gt; Therefore, Between 2004 and 2006, Egypt had submitted design information for the HPP and had provide inventory change reports (ICRs) with respect to the acceptance tests.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

In 2009, The IAEA's Safeguards Implementation Report (SIR) for 2008, concludes that earlier issues of undeclared nuclear activities and material reported to the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] in February 2005 are no longer outstanding.&lt;ref name=wikileaks /&gt;

The '''Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society''' (IBES) is an [[Australia]]n research institute focusing on the development of [[broadband]]-enabled applications and technologies. The Institute is based in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [[The University of Melbourne]] in [[Victoria (Australia)]]. Research in the centre is clustered around five research themes:
* Education and Learning
* Health and Wellbeing
* Network Deployment and Economics
* Service and Business Transformation
* Social Infrastructure and Communities

== History ==
The Institute was established in 2009 with funding from the University of Melbourne and the State Government of Victoria. The Institutes aim is to develop research that will be able to exploit the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government']]s [[National Broadband Network]]. IBES is one of a number of research institutes developed by the University of Melbourne to increase interdisciplinary research activity. 
The Institute's Director is Laureate Professor Rod Tucker.

== Organisation ==
The Institute was established in 2009. IBES is jointly funded by the University of Melbourne and the [[Government of Victoria|Victorian State Government]], through the Department of Business and Innovation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2125">The '''Instituto de Física Corpuscular (IFIC''', [[English language|English]]: ''Institute for Corpuscular Physics'') is a [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] and [[University of Valencia]] joint center dedicated to experimental and theoretical research in the fields of [[particle physics]], [[nuclear physics]], [[cosmology]], [[astroparticle physics|astroparticles]] and [[medical physics]].

It is located at the [http://www.pcuv.es scientific park] of the University of Valencia, in [[Paterna]] ([[Valencia, Spain]]).

==History==
In the autumn of 1950 Prof. Joaquin Catalá formed a group in Valencia to study [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and [[elementary particles]] using [[nuclear emulsion]]s. 
He had first been working in [[Bristol]] with [[Cecil Frank Powell|C.F. Powell]],
who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1950 for using this technique to detect
particles in [[cosmic rays]].

Prof. Catalá’s group first operated as a Local Division of the Instituto de Óptica Daza de Valdés 
belonging to CSIC and specialized in photo-nuclear studies. One of Catalá’s students, Fernando Senent, later becoming Professor and director of the Institute, produced what was the first Spanish thesis in Experimental Particle and Nuclear Physics. It was at the beginning of 1960 when the Institute got its present name, IFIC, Instituto de Física Corpuscular. IFIC, hence, is one of the oldest Spanish Institutes in Experimental Physics and the oldest studying particle and nuclear physics.

== History ==

=== School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) (1966-1992) ===
The Library and Information Science (LIS) program at the University of Western Ontario was established in 1966 as the School of Library and Information Science (SLIS). In response to a shortage of professional librarians in Canada in the 1960s, the [[Government of Ontario|Ontario government]] set up a committee to investigate the creation of a new library school.&lt;ref name="White2004"&gt;White, Janette. (2004). University of Western Ontario Faculty of Information and Media Studies Library and Information Science Program.[http://www.exlibris.ca/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:newsletters:elan_special_summer_2004.pdf "ELAN: Ex Libris Association Newsletter, Special Issue, Summer 2004"], 22-26. Toronto: Ex Libris Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Delbridge Osborn, the SLIS's first dean, decided the SLIS would have its own library operating outside of the University of Western Ontario's library system in order to support library instruction and research. Generous funding allowed the SLIS to establish their general and special collections, including rare books and materials to support specialized coursework.&lt;ref name="Dorner1990"&gt;Dorner, Daniel G. (1990). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4308478 "The School of Library and Information Science Library, University of Western Ontario"], ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'', 60(3), 232-243.&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Western Ontario's MLS program officially began in September 1967 with 40 full-time and 20 part-time students.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;

=== Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) (1993-1995) ===
The University of Western Ontario's School of Library and Information Science (SLIS) was renamed to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) in 1993.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt; The new name reflected the change in the school's degree designation from Master of Library Science (MLS) to Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS), which occurred in 1985.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UWO1989"&gt;The University of Western Ontario School of Library and Information Science Self-Study Report, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; This change addressed the evolution of library schools across Canada to reflect the expanding impact of computers and technology on the discipline.&lt;ref name="Land2004"&gt;Land, Brian. (2004). History of Education for Library and Information Studies in Canada. [http://www.exlibris.ca/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=wiki:newsletters:elan_special_summer_2004.pdf "ELAN: Ex Libris Association Newsletter, Special Issue, Summer 2004"], 1-2. Toronto: Ex Libris Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faculty of Communications and Open Learning (FC&amp;OL) (1996-1997) ===
The Graduate School of Library and Information Science merged with the Graduate School of Journalism to form the Faculty of Communications and Open Learning in 1996.&lt;ref name="GSLIS1997" /&gt;

=== Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS) (1997-Present) ===
The Faculty of Communications and Open Learning was shortly thereafter renamed to the [[Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies (University of Western Ontario)|Faculty of Information and Media Studies (FIMS)]].&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2000"&gt;Curry, Ann. (2000). [http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=4403209&amp;site=ehost-live "Canadian LIS education: Trends and issues"]. ''Education for Information'', 18(4), 325-337.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, there are 34 full-time faculty members in the Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies.&lt;ref name="Western2016a"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.uwo.ca/about/whoweare/facts.html Facts &amp; Figures 2015-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

=== Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) ===
The University of Western Ontario's Faculty of Information and Media Studies is one of seven faculties in Canada which offers the Masters level graduate study in library and information science.&lt;ref name="Land2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2000" /&gt; The MLIS program is a professional-based Master's program designed to emphasize participation through a seminar style method of education. Tests and exams are not a common method of evaluation in this program, but there is a strong focus on group collaboration, presentation skills, and high quality academic writing. The MLIS program was founded on the belief that there is a common set of principles underlying the practices of all information professions. In order to reflect the values of the research university the program is housed in, there has been a long tradition in this program of developing curriculum that strives for a balance between professional practice and research based theory.&lt;ref name="ALA1976"&gt;Committee on Accreditation, [[American Library Association]]. (1976). ''Report on school of library and information science of University of Western Ontario''. Chicago, IL: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haycock2007"&gt;Haycock, K. (2007), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/03074800710722162 Education for library and information studies in Canada: a cross-cultural comparison], ''New Library World'', 108 1/2, pp. 32-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Western Ontario offers the only MLIS degree in Canada which can be completed in 12 months.&lt;ref name="Curry2000" /&gt; Students are required to complete a total of 15 courses, which can be completed in one academic year (3 terms, 12 months) if students take the full course load of five courses per term and do not participate in the co-op program.&lt;ref name="Western2016b"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/structure.html Program Structure].&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also choose to take a reduced course load or complete the program on a part-time basis.&lt;ref name="Western2016b" /&gt;

There are five required courses which all MLIS students are required to take: 
* LIS 9001 (Perspectives on Library and Information Science)
* LIS 9002 (Information Organization, curation and Access)
* LIS 9003 (Information Sources and Services)
* LIS 9004 (Research Method and Statistics)
* LIS 9005 (Managing and Working in Information Organizations).&lt;ref name="Western2016b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western2016c"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/courses.html Courses].&lt;/ref&gt;

Students must also complete a total of 10 elective courses, choosing these electives from at least four out of the five [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/content_areas.html program content areas]:
* Information Organization, Curation, and Access
* Information Policy
* Connecting People with Information
* Information and Communication Technology
* Managing and Working in Information Institutions&lt;ref name="Western2016b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western2016d"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/content_areas.html Program Content Areas].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Co-op Program ====
The LIS [[Cooperative education|co-op]] program at the University of Western Ontario started in 1979, making it the first LIS co-op program in Canada.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Curry2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MLIS Graduate Student Handbook Winter 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It allows students to engage in one or two paid work terms at a library or information-related position.&lt;ref name="Western2016e"&gt;Western University. (2016). [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/ Master of Library &amp; Information Science (MLIS)].&lt;/ref&gt; However, co-op is not a requirement of the program and students do not gain credits towards their degree by completing co-op work terms.&lt;ref name="Western2016coop"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/coop.html |title=MLIS Co-op |publisher=Western University |date=2016| access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berg2009"&gt;Berg, S.

''The Journal of Academic Librarianship, 35''(6), 591-598. doi:10.1016/j.acalib.2009.08.007&lt;/ref&gt; The placements are facilitated by the co-op office and arranged between the employers and students.&lt;ref name="OLAnd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessola.org/web/OLA/Membership/Students_and_Recent_Graduates/Host_a_student/OLA/Careers/Library_School_Programs.aspx?hkey=320f62ff-de9c-4cd1-aac8-0bfebbc7529d|title=Employer Opportunities to Engage Library School Students|publisher=Ontario Library Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number and locations of placements vary each term.&lt;ref name="Western2016coop" /&gt;

=== Library and Information Science PhD ===
The Ontario Council of Graduate Studies approved the University of Western Ontario's LIS PhD program in 1973, and the first graduate of the program was awarded a PhD in Library and Information Sciences in 1978.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt; The initial focus of the doctoral program was on bibliographical control, but the program has since shifted over the decades to cover two broad [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/specialization.html fields of specialization] which represent the areas of research and teaching in the LIS PhD program: "Information &amp; Society" and "Information Organization &amp; Technologies".&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDSpec"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/specialization.html |title=Fields of Specialization |publisher=Western University |date=2016 |access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research clusters within the faculty and doctoral program include:
* Information and Communication Technologies
* Health Information and Policy
* Marxist Political Economy of Information
* Social Relations of Information Practices, Reading and Libraries
* Theoretical Problems in Information Studies: Philosophy, Ethics, Epistemology
* Webometrics and Infometrics
&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDSpec" /&gt;

In addition to completing six courses (two required, four elective), doctoral candidates are required to complete a research proposal, thesis (including public presentation of thesis topic), comprehensive and oral exams, and they are also required to attend all LIS research colloquia.&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDProg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/progression.html |title=Progression and Milestones |publisher=Western University|date=2016|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the PhD program depends on each student's own pace and on their decision whether to participate in the [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/coop.html PhD co-op program].&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDcoop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/coop.html|title=The Co-op Program|publisher=Western University|date=2016|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may also choose to complete the PhD program on a part-time bases.&lt;ref name="Western2016PhDPT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/phd_library_information_science/part_time.html|title=Part-time PhD in the LIS Program|publisher=Western University|date=2016|access-date=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== American Library Association (ALA) Accreditation ==
The MLIS program at the University of Western Ontario has continually held its ALA accreditation since 1967/68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/accreditedprograms/directory/historicallist|title=Accredited Library and Information Studies Master's Programs from 1925 through Present|first=|last=admin|date=20 July 2006|publisher=[[American Library Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facilities ==
The Library and Information Science programs are currently housed in the FIMS and Nursing Building (FNB) at the University of Western Ontario's main campus, after moving in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.westerngazette.ca/news/the-insider-look-at-campus-s-latest-building/article_21f3937e-bb1c-11e6-a9f5-abf93a2a7456.html|title=The insider look at campus's latest building|last=Monterroza|first=Moses|work=The Gazette • Western University's Student Newspaper|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library program was previously hosted in the following buildings: a temporary structure near the football stadium (1967-1982), Elborn College (1982-1998), Middlesex College (1998-2004), and North Campus Building (2004-2016).&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;

=== Library ===
A key component of the LIS program at the University of Western Ontario is its faculty-supported library, which was first developed alongside the program's inception in 1966/1967 to support instruction, research, experimentation, and professional development.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorner1990" /&gt; The library first operated entirely outside of the university library system; while still independent of the university system, it now works more closely with it than in its early years.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dorner1990" /&gt;

The current version of the program's independent library is called the FIMS Graduate Library, and is located in the FIMS and Nursing Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.fims.uwo.ca/about/|title=About – FIMS Graduate Library|website=lib.fims.uwo.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still primarily serves the LIS program but now also supports the other graduate programs within the Faculty of Media and Information Studies.&lt;ref name="White2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GRCAbout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fims-grc.fims.uwo.ca/about-the-grc/|title=About the GRC|access-date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Library Services and Collections ====
The FIMS Graduate Library offers a number of resources to support FIMS graduate students' and faculty's research, instruction, assignment, collaboration, and project needs. The Library houses several bookable meeting spaces complete with presentation tools. The library also contains computer workstations, a maker space, scanners, printers, a reading room, study space, and the FIMS Graduate collection. Although the library collection does not circulate, the contents can be searched for using Western Libraries' Catalogue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lib.fims.uwo.ca/about/|title=About - FIMS Graduate Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library collection at the FIMS Graduate Library is intended to support the learning and research needs of FIMS Graduate students and faculty. The materials generally do not circulate, and can be used in the library space. In addition to the academic print collection, the FIMS Graduate Library provides non-circulating children's books, comics and graphic novels, DVDs, a censored books collection, board games, the [[Peter Desbarats]] journalism collection, and some rare books. The comic books and graphic novels, DVDs, and board games can be borrowed overnight by graduate students or faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lib.fims.uwo.ca/collections/|title=Collections - FIMS Graduate Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the print resources in the library, the FIMS Graduate Library provides graduate students and faculty with access to a number of electronic databases to support research, learning, and professional development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For student and faculty use, experimentation, and programming, the Library contains a makerspace, Bibliotech. Bibliotech contains both high and low-tech maker technology, such as a [[3D printing|3D printer]], a [[Makey Makey|Makeymakey]], and craft supplies. 

As part of the FIMS Graduate Library's involvement in students' professional development and learning, the library offers a series of seminars and workshops. The series, titled "The FIMS Graduate Library Presents...", invites faculty, staff, and guests to share their expertise with students in discussions, lectures, or hands-on workshops. The subject matter for this series ranges from information technology, to career preparedness, to social justice issues in the library and information science discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.fims.uwo.ca/events/|title=Events - FIMS Graduate Library|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tor Relay ====
Staff at the FIMS Graduate Library (previously, the Graduate Resource Centre) created Canada's first ever [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor relay service]] allowing for anonymous, encrypted internet browsing while improving access to information around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2016/03/16/first-ever-tor-node-in-a-canad.html|title=First-ever Tor node in a Canadian library|date=16 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanlibrariesmagazine.org/latest-links/canadian-library-runs-tor-relay-service/|title=Canadian library runs Tor relay service - American Libraries Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/news/2016/library_in_fims_joins_global_network_fighting_back_against_digital_surveillance_censorship_and_the_obstruction_of_information.html|title=Library in FIMS joins global network fighting back against digital surveillance, censorship, and the obstruction of information - Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies - Western University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this contribution to Internet privacy and freedom, the FIMS Graduate Library was recognized by the [[Ontario Library Association]] at the 2017 OLA Superconference. The OLA awarded the FIMS Graduate Library with the Les Fowlie Intellectual Freedom Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessola.org/web/OLA/Membership/Awards_ola/OLA_Les_Fowlie_Intellectual_Freedom_Award.aspx|title=OLA's Les Fowlie Intellectual Freedom Award|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 67(6). doi:10.1002/asi.23448&lt;/ref&gt;

When examining the disciplinary composition of library schools, Irene Lopatovska and Ellie Ransom found that Western's LIS program was among the schools that had the highest percentage of faculty members with training in library professions (42 percent of faculty).&lt;ref name="Lopatovska2016"&gt;Lopatovska, I., &amp; Ransom, E.

Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, 48(1), 18-35. doi:10.1177/0961000614533718&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers also gave the faculty a high disciplinary rating for having faculty trained across seven different disciplines, including: computing, information, library, social and behavioural sciences, education, humanities, and communication.&lt;ref name="Lopatovska2016" /&gt;

Western's MLIS program reports a good employment placement rate. A 2016 survey by FIMS found that 70% of respondents found employment within or around 6 months after graduation. Out of the 70% that found employment, 95% found employment in the Library and Information Sciences field.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fims.uwo.ca/programs/graduate_programs/master_of_library_and_information_science/grads_at_work/placement16.pdf|title=2016 Master of Library and Information Science Placement Survey|last=Faculty of Information and Media Studies at the University of Western Ontario|first=|date=|website=fims.uwo.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey collected responses from 60 out of 114 MLIS students who graduated from Western in 2016. Most graduates found employment at public libraries (42.5% of those employed) or academic libraries (25% of those employed).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 57.5 of those students who found work cited the co-op experience as being most helpful in helping them acquire skills and knowledge to secure employment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Student Groups and Activities ==

There are several [http://www.fims.uwo.ca/student_life/student_clubs/ student groups] that operate within the Library and Information Science program at Western. Some of these groups include MLIS Student Council, [[Librarians Without Borders]], the [[Special Libraries Association]], Student Librarians Association for Children and Youth Services (SLACYS), [[Association of Canadian Archivists]] (ACA) and the [[Art Libraries Society of North America]] (ARLIS/NA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fims.uwo.ca/current/studentgroups.htm|title=FIMS Student Clubs - Faculty of Information &amp; Media Studies - Western University|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bible dictionary''' is a reference work containing encyclopedic entries related to the [[Bible]], typically concerning people, places, customs, doctrine and [[Biblical criticism]]. Bible dictionaries can be scholarly or popular in tone.

The first dictionary of the Bible in English was the ''Christian Dictionarie'' (1612) of [[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=29689|title=Wilson, Thomas|first=Stephen|last=Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11826">In [[art history]], an '''[[Notname|anonymous master]]''' is an [[Old Master]] whose work is known, but whose name is lost.

==Renaissance==
Only in the Renaissance did individual artists in Western Europe acquire personalities known by their peers (some listed by [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''), such as those known by :
* Their true name or their father's name  :
** [[Filippino Lippi]] after his father [[Fra Filippo Lippi]]
* A chosen [[pseudonym]], possibly linked to his birthplace or his father's trade :
** [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] worked on the gate of saint Gall
** [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], after his father, a chicken farmer (pollo in Italian)
** [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], after his father, a saddler (''sellier'')
** The [[Della Robbia]]s (after the Tuscan word ''robbia'', dyers' [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]], and his father, the dyer [[Luca della Robbia]])
** [[Masuccio Segondo]], student of [[Masuccio Primo]]
** etc.
* '''A surname attributed to him :'''
** [[Simone del Pollaiolo|Il Cronaca]], who never stopped talking about the ruins he had seen in Rome
** [[Daniele da Volterra]], nicknamed  ''Il Braghettone'' (the [[breeches]] maker) for having censored nudes in paintings by adding cloths or branches, at the request of [[pope Paul IV]]
** [[Luca della Robbia]], for the madder colour he used as a ceramicist
** [[Masaccio]], known as the idiot
** etc.
* '''A [[corporation]], whose generic name is given to works made by all its members :'''
** the [[Campionesi Masters]], sculptors and builders of religious buildings (Ugo da Campione, [[Bonino da Campione]], Giovanni da Campione, Zenone de Campione, Matteo da Campione)

==20th-century problems of attribution==
The idea of a named and recognised painter originated among art historians early in the 20th century, who were attributing works they recognised to known painters. They later went back on some of these attributions, renaming as anonymous the painters they had formerly named. One example is the case of [[Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], to whom [[Bernard Berenson]] attributed a number of works which were later re-attributed to [[Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], a Florence copyist. Some painters have even been described as anonymous (even many times like [[Barthélemy Eyck]]) before later being recognised. They thus held several names historically (those who are noted on the page devoted to them), although doubts continue surrounding some, such as [[Giovanni Gaddi (painter)|Giovanni Gaddi]] (after 1333 – 1383) maybe the ''Master of the Misericordia dell’Accademia''.

==Artists whose names have since been established==
In recent years the names of a variety of artists who were formerly listed as "anonymous" have become known; accordingly scholarly writings and museum labels have been changed to reflect their new identities. Much the most famous of these is the Master of Flémalle (c 1378–1445), painter of the [[comté de Hainaut]], who was established as [[Robert Campin]]. Other examples include:
* [[Jehan Bellegambe]], sometimes called the "master of colours".
* Master of 1419 – recognised as [[Battista di Biagio Sanguigni]], having painted and dated in 1419 the central panel for a triptych executed for Santa Maria a Latera, broken up and dispersed
* Master of the Chiostro degli Aranci – recognised as being [[Giovanni Consalvo]], fresco painter at the monastery at [[Badia Fiorentina]]
* [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]] is the generally accepted as the painter known as the Master of the Aix Annunciation for paintings, and the Master of René of Anjou for illuminated manuscripts; he is also thought by many to be the Master of the Shadows
* The Dombild Master, as [[Stefan Lochner]]

{{Governance}}

The '''multistakeholder governance model''', sometimes known as a '''multistakeholder initiative''' ('''MSI'''),&lt;ref&gt;Utting, P. (2001). [http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hiscox/Utting.pdf "Regulating Business Via Multistakeholder Initiatives: A Preliminary Assessment."] (Paper prepared in late 2001 under the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) research project "Promoting Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility in Developing Countries: The Potential and Limits of Voluntary Initiatives".) Accessed 14/May/2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, D., Kalfagianni, A.,  &amp; Havinga, T. (2011) "Actors in private food governance: the legitimacy of retail standards and multistakeholder initiatives with civil society participation", Agriculture and Human Values , September 2011, Volume 28, Issue 3, pp 353-367.&lt;/ref&gt; is a governance structure that seeks to bring [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s together to participate in the dialogue, decision making, and implementation of solutions to common problems or goals. The principle behind such a structure is that if enough input is provided by all actors involved in a question, the eventual consensual decision gains more legitimacy, and therefore better reflects a set of perspectives rather than a single source of validation.

A [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]] refers to an individual, group, or organization that has a direct or indirect interest or stake in a particular organization, these may be businesses, [[civil society]], governments, research institutions, and non-government organizations.

==Multi-Stakeholder Models==

The multistakeholder model is used in Internet governance by entities such as the [[ICANN]] and [[IETF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Society Questionnaire on Multistakeholder Governance Report and Summary of the Results. October 2013|url=http://www.internetsociety.org/doc/internet-society-questionnaire-multistakeholder-governance-report-and-summary-results-october|publisher=Internet Society|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been the foundation of local governance entities such as [[Community boards of New York City|New York City's Community Boards]].

Norbert Bollow, co-coordinator on the Civil Society Internet Governance Forum&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igcaucus.org/&lt;/ref&gt; distinguishes between  "representative" multistakeholderism, using as examples the United Nation's [https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/about-mag MAG] and ECWG, in which a limited number of seats are distributed to representatives through some selection process, and "open" multistakeholderism, as represented by the IETF and RIRs, which relies on participants self-selecting to balance perspectives.

'''MusicEase''' is a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[WYSIWYG]] [[scorewriter]] created by Gary Rader and produced by MusicEase Software (formerly known as Grandmaster). It enables computers using [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] to produce [[musical notation]] and listen to them in [[MIDI]].

==Brief history==

MusicEase was initially created under [[DOS]] using muLisp The first version appeared in 1987 and was completely controlled by the keyboard.&lt;ref name="rothstein"&gt;Rothstein, Joseph (1989), "''Grandmaster MusicEase Notation Software''". MIT Computer Music Journal, Volume 13, Number 2, pp.94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rothstein2"&gt;Rothstein, Joseph (1989), "''MusicEase Notation Software for IBM PCs''". MIT Computer Music Journal, Volume 13, Number 3, pp.105-106.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, a Windows version was created using [[Allegro Common Lisp]]. Toolbars and mouse support were then added. During the ensuing years, additional functionality was added as new versions were produced. In 2013, version 9.0 was released for both Windows and the Mac.

==Functionality==

MusicEase is both a music score editor and an automatic accompaniment generator. As a score editor, the user can create, edit, play and print high quality music notation. The user sees on the computer screen the musical score exactly as it will be printed out. As an automatic accompaniment creator/generator, it allows the user to quickly create accompaniment styles using the full range of notational functionality and to easily apply a style to a melody to add an accompaniment consisting of any number of general MIDI instruments including drums.

MusicEase is a constraint-based system with a large amount of knowledge of music notation. This allows it to handle intelligently many of the details of scoring automatically.&lt;ref name="rader"&gt;Rader, Gary (1994) "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp;jsessionid=GGpHPDpWmznlQ4sfBNkmQ1Why1SwLKdQqGxKyZp9S7Yd2fYlT6fQ!-996370577?arnumber=369308&amp;contentType=Conference+Publications ''Helping naive users create publication quality music scores'']". TENCON '94. IEEE Region 10's Ninth Annual International Conference. Theme: Frontiers of Computer Technology. Proceedings of 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="rader2"&gt;Rader, Gary (1996) "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=620470 ''Creating Printed Music Automatically'']". IEEE Computer, Volume 29, Issue 6, June 1996,
pp. 61-68.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, bar lines are inserted automatically according to the current [[Meter (music)|meter]] (time signature). If the user changes the time signature, the bar line placements change automatically, and beam scopes are automatically recomputed as directed by the new time signature. (Users can also insert [[Bar (music)|barlines]] themselves wherever they like.) [[Slur (music)|Slurs]] and [[phrase mark]]s can often be inserted with a single keystroke combination. The end points, shape, direction and location (above or below the included notes) are automatically determined. The result is that users can create professional looking scores easily and quickly without knowing [[music engraving]]/music copyist rules. (Generally no one can create engraver quality printed music without having explicitly been trained in music copyist techniques. And incorrectly notated music is harder for trained musicians to play.)

Jerry Pournelle, reviewer for Byte Magazine, says ''The samples [of music printouts from MusicEase] I have seen, and a couple I have produced, are sure in the same league as hand engraved.''&lt;ref name="pournelle"&gt;Pournelle, Jerry (1990) "[https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1990-12/1990_12_BYTE_15-13_State_of_the_Art_Advanced_Graphics#page/n121/mode/2up/search/musicease ''MusicEase'']". Byte Magazine, Volume 15, Number 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many people are familiar with [[word processors]], the notation aspect of MusicEase is designed to work much like a word processing program. For instance, pressing the G key enters the note G. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) then deletes this note. Pressing the Enter key begins a new system. Pressing the Delete key (Mac) or Backspace key (Windows) at the beginning of a system appends it to the previous system. Blocks can be cut from one location and pasted into another location and then everything can be reformatted with just several keystrokes (using MusicEase's cast-off function which redetermines system breaks so that the density of notes in each system is roughly the same followed by the justify function to stretch/shrink all staves so they horizontally span from the left margin to the right margin.) Most functions are invoked via key presses which allows fast content entry as opposed to using the mouse to drag music notational elements from palettes to staves which generally requires more effort.

MusicEase supports a number of additional generally useful functions such as true [[Transposition (music)|transposition]] (as opposed to just shifting existing configurations up or down on the staff), [[Part (music)|part extraction]] (any combination of system staves can be extracted), scaling of the music to a large range of sizes, [[Melodic inversion|inverting]] or [[Retrograde (music)|retrograding]] selected blocks of notes, combining 2 staves containing single voices into a single staff containing mixed single and double [[Stem (music)|stemmed]] voicing and ''vice versa'' (splitting a single staff with several voices into 2 separate staves, each containing a single voice), automatically adding chord fret diagrams, using any computer fonts for verses, titles, etc., [[unicode]] text support, and displaying music as [[tablature]] and/or as [[shape note]]s (4 or 7 shape systems --- the shapes associated with scale degrees can be fully customized.)

==Prominent uses==
MusicEase was used by University of Colorado at Boulder Professor Emeritus of Music [[Karl Kroeger]] to create much of the music in ''[http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/resource/chap01.html Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820]'', for which he was the main editor. Professor Kroeger states, ''In particular, I acknowledge my debt to Gary M. Rader, developer of the MusicEase music notation software used for the musical scores''&lt;ref name="kroeger"&gt;Kroeger, Karl, (ed.) (1995) ''Music of the New American Nation - Sacred Music from 1780 to 1820'', Volume 3, p. ix, Garland Publishing, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

MusicEase Software's virtual songbook technology was created using MusicEase Professional. It allows a single piece of music to be ramified in many different ways (e.g., just verses or just the music displayed). [[Integrity Music]], a major publisher of praise-worship music, used this functionality for the transposable sheet music versions of many of its recent products: e.g., the CD-Rom versions of its [[Hosanna! Music]] songbooks, versions 3 and 4 of its Worship Software, music available via its worshipleaderassistant.com and Worship Kitchen websites, and various iWorship CD-Rom songbooks.

The "Shout Music Manager" by Media Shout included this virtual songbook technology to provide transposable, customizable printed music.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8603">A '''runoff footprint''' is the total [[surface runoff]] that a site produces over the course of a year. According to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), stormwater is "rainwater and melted snow that runs off streets, lawns, and other sites." &lt;ref&gt;EPA Stormwater Management http://www.epa.gov/greeningepa/stormwater/&lt;/ref&gt; Urbanized areas with high concentrations of [[impervious surface]]s like buildings, roads, and driveways produce large volumes of runoff which can lead to flooding, sewer overflows, and poor [[water quality]]. Since soil in urban areas can be compacted and have a low [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration rate]], the surface runoff estimated in a runoff footprint is not just from impervious surfaces, but also pervious areas including yards. The total runoff is a measure of the site’s contribution to stormwater issues in an area, especially in urban areas with sewer overflows. Completing a runoff footprint for a site allows a property owner to understand what areas on his or her site are producing the most runoff and what scenarios of stormwater green solutions like [[Rainwater tank|rain barrels]] and [[rain gardens]] are most effective in mitigating this runoff and its costs to the community.

== Significance ==

The runoff footprint is the stormwater equivalent to the carbon/energy footprint. When homeowners or business owners complete an energy audit or carbon footprint, they understand how they are consuming energy and learn how this consumption can be reduced through [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] measures. Correspondingly, the runoff footprint allows someone to calculate their baseline annual runoff and assess what the impact of ideal stormwater green solutions would be for their site. Since the passage of the [[Clean Water Act]] in 1972, the EPA has monitored and regulated stormwater issues in urban areas. Municipalities across the United States are now required to upgrade sanitary and stormwater systems to meet EPA mandates. The total cost for these upgrades across the United States exceeds $3000 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html Syracuse.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Municipalities across the United States need $300 billion in sewer, water upgrades http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2012/02/epa_us_needs_300_billion_in_se.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The stormwater runoff from every property in an area can contribute to the overall stormwater issues including overflows and water pollution. Stormwater runoff carries nonpoint source pollution which is a leading cause of water quality issues.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - What is Nonpoint Source Pollution? http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/nps/whatis.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

By completing a runoff footprint, homeowners and business owners can consider how stormwater green solutions can reduce runoff on-site. Stormwater green solutions (also called green infrastructure) use "vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments.  At the scale of a city or county, green infrastructure refers to the patchwork of natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air, and cleaner water. At the scale of a neighborhood or site, green infrastructure refers to stormwater management systems that mimic nature by soaking up and storing water".&lt;ref&gt;What is Green Infrastructure? http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/gi_what.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Stormwater green solutions include bioswales (directional rain gardens), cisterns, green roofs, permeable pavement, rain barrels, and rain gardens. According to the EPA, onsite stormwater green solutions or [[Low-impact development (UK)|low-impact development]]s (LIDs) can significantly reduce runoff and costly stormwater/sewer infrastructure upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;EPA - Reducing Stormwater Costs http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/green/costs07_index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Stormwater green solutions can also reduce energy consumption. Treating and pumping water is an energy-intensive activity. According to the River Network, the U.S. consumes at least 521 million MWh a year for water-related purposes which is the equivalent to 13% of the nation’s electricity consumption &lt;ref&gt;River Network. The Carbon Footprint of Water. http://www.rivernetwork.org/resource-library/carbon-footprint-water&lt;/ref&gt; Potable water must be treated and then pumped to the consumer. Wastewater is treated before being discharged. In areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewer systems with high [[Infiltration/Inflow|inflow and infiltration]], stormwater is also treated at the wastewater treatment facilities. By capturing stormwater runoff onsite in rain barrels and cisterns, the consumption of potable water for irrigation and its corresponding energy impact can be reduced. The reduction of runoff from all types of stormwater green solutions reduces the stormwater that may end up at the wastewater treatment facility in areas with combined sewer systems or old separate sewers.

== Completing a Runoff Footprint ==

There are number of methods available to complete a Runoff Footprint. The simplest methods involve using a runoff coefficient, which according to the State Water Resources Control Board of California is "a dimensionless coefficient relating the amount of runoff to the amount of precipitation received. It is a larger value for areas with low infiltration and high runoff (pavement, steep gradient), and lower for permeable, well vegetated areas (forest, flat land)."&lt;ref&gt;Runoff Coefficient (C) Fact Sheet http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/docs/cwt/guidance/513.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The runoff coefficients for different surface types on a site can be multiplied with the area for each surface along with the annual precipitation to generate a rough runoff footprint. If the runoff coefficient and areas of proposed stormwater green solutions like rain gardens and bioswales for the site are known, the reduction in overall runoff from these improvements can be estimated.

More accurate Runoff Footprint tools exist. By using computer modeling and detailed weather data, complex runoff footprints can be made easy. The amounts of pollution in the stormwater runoff can be estimated, and the effects of combinations of stormwater green solutions can be assessed. The James River Association of central Virginia provides an [http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/ online tool] where property owners in the James River watershed can generate a site-specific runoff pollution report.&lt;ref&gt;JRA - Do you know What’s in Your Runoff? http://www.jamesriverassociation.org/get-involved/runoff-calculator/&lt;/ref&gt; MyRunoff.org provides an online [http://www.myrunoff.org runoff footprint calculator] for property owners across the United States to estimate their baseline runoff and the reduction from different scenarios of rain barrels and rain gardens.&lt;ref&gt;MyRunoff.org's Runoff Footprint Calculator. http://myrunoff.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA launched the National Stormwater Calculator in July, 2013, which is a desktop application for Windows allowing users to model the annual impact of a range of stormwater green solutions.&lt;ref&gt;National Stormwater Calculator http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/wswrd/wq/models/swc/&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation states its aim as 'increasing enjoyment of and participation in science and technology-based subjects in Scottish schools' and operates mainly at [[Standard Grade]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On the road to attract pupils to science fun |url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/On-the-road-to-attract.5977138.jp |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates a travelling roadshow which visits schools in Scotland and the north of England, and organises special events such as at the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]]. Its mode of operation as a travelling roadshow enables SCI-FUN to provide a [[science centre]] experience to pupils in remote areas of Scotland, such as the [[Highlands and Islands]].

==SCI-FUN Roadshow==

The SCI-FUN Roadshow tours secondary schools around Scotland offering a combination of presentations and hands-on exhibits encompassing scientific subjects in the fields of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[maths]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. The Roadshow is presented to S1 and S2 pupils ([[Education in Scotland|11-14 years old]]) with assistance from senior pupils studying sciences at [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] or [[Advanced Higher]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pupils shown fun of science |url=http://news.scotsman.com/education/Pupils-shown-fun-of-science.6026274.jp |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010/11 Roadshow includes presentations focusing on the [[senses]] and research, along with a talk encouraging pupils to consider the study of science subjects at [[Standard Grade]].  Current research at the [[University of Edinburgh]] is also covered in collaboration with FUSION; information on research in [[stem cells]], the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the [[Highland midge]] and [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] technology is currently included.  In previous years, talks have discussed [[Climate change]], the [[Stars#Chemical_composition|chemistry of the stars]] and [[:wikt:survival|survival]].

There are around forty-five hands-on exhibits included in the Roadshow to allow pupils to have a go at a number of scientific experiments in a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SCI-FUN Roadshow |url=http://www.newbattle.org.uk/News/Newsletters/2010Summer.pdf |work=Newbattle News |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721021246/http://www.newbattle.org.uk/News/Newsletters/2010Summer.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gairlochhigh.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/school-news-2nd-april-2010/ |title=Science events|publisher=Gairloch High School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A report on the recent Sci-Fun Roadshow compiled by Beck Gillespie and Alex Holden, S6. |url=http://www.lochaber.highland.sch.uk/LHS%20News%2015_Dec%2009.pdf |work=St Ninian's High School Parents' Newsletter |date=March 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SCI-FUN Day |url=http://www.st-ninians.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/downloadfile.asp?file=24 |work=News from Lochaber High School |date=December 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008222448/http://www.st-ninians.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/downloadfile.asp?file=24 |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/content/news/general/3271739|title=Sci Fun roadshow rolls into Oban High|publisher=Argyll and Bute Council}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCI-FUN Primer==

SCI-FUN Primer states its aims as 'explaining to upper primary school children that science is something that is all around them' and is aimed at primary school pupils P6 and P7 (age 9-12). SCI-FUN Primer is based on the hands-on part of the main SCI-FUN Roadshow programme, with activities scaled down so it fits within a classroom environment. This may be hosted by an associated secondary school.

==SCI-FUN at Science Festivals==

===Edinburgh International Science Festival===

SCI-FUN have a presence at the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]] which is held every year in Edinburgh over the Easter holidays. Elements of the SCI-FUN Roadshow are incorporated into the Science Festival programme, including exhibits and presentations. In 2011, as previous years, SCI-FUN was at Adam House on [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/whats-on/categories/activity/sci-fun-at-discover-science |title=SCI-FUN at Discover Science at the Edinburgh International Science Festival |publisher=Edinburgh International Science Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also presented their Senses show for the general public. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/whats-on/categories/show/the-senses-show |title=The Senses Show |publisher=Edinburgh International Science Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebridean Science Festival 2011===

SCI-FUN took part in the Hebridean Science Festival in 2011. The festival is run by ESTEEM (Engineering, Science, Technology, Employability, Enterprise, Mathematics), which is based in Stornaway and aims to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists and mathematicians from the Western Isles. SCI-FUN ran their usual Roadshow for Hebridean schools, as well as hosting an evening session and a drop-in session for the general public. Other guests at the Hebridean Science Festival include the Astronomer Royal for Scotland Professor [[John Campbell Brown|John C Brown]], [[Johnny Ball]], the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]], Mr Boom and the Stornoway Astronomical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hebrideansciencefestival.com/index.aspx |title=Hebridean Science Festival 2011 |publisher=Hebridean Science Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711161244/http://hebrideansciencefestival.com/index.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Science Festivals===

SCI-FUN has previous attended other Science Festivals around Scotland, including in Shetland and Orkney, and plan to attend more.

==FUSION==

FUSION ''(Focusing on University Science Interpretation and Outreach Needs)'' is the sister group of SCI-FUN that collaborates with research groups within the University to find ways to promote their science to a wider audience. FUSION projects also lead to new topical science materials and exhibits, some of which have already been incorporated within the SCI-FUN Roadshow.

===CCS Interactive===

A major project of FUSION has been to produce the CCS Interactive (Carbon Capture and Storage Interactive) exhibit, with funding from the [[EPSRC]]. The CCS Interactive is a working model of [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] and has been developed alongside the Schools of Engineering and GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh. The CCS Interactive can be used to demonstrate the process of Carbon Capture and Storage to school and public audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G02037X/1 |title=EPSRC grant for the CCSI|publisher=Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carboncapturejournal.com/displaynews.php?NewsID=614|title=The public perception of Carbon Capture and Storage|publisher=Carbon Capture Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708120404/http://www.carboncapturejournal.com/displaynews.php?NewsID=614|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/downloads/news/Global-CCS-Institute-Newsletter-September-2010.pdf|title=Public perception of CCS|publisher=Global CCS Institute}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCS Interactive consists of a model of a [[fossil fuel]] burning [[power station]] with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being introduced into the system using a gas cylinder.  There are two carbon capture columns, filled with high surface area [[zeolites]] which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[adsorbs]] to. Directions of gas flow and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of gas emissions are indicated using LEDs, and water vapour is used to simulate the gas emissions from the power station.

==History of SCI-FUN==

SCI-FUN started out as ''FUNdamental Physics'' in the early 1990s. This was a small scale, volunteer-run show focusing on talks about the physical sciences. This was expanded and in 1999 became SCI-FUN in its current form, incorporating the hands-on exhibits about all the sciences and touring the whole of Scotland. A pilot project involved the hiring of equipment from the National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadshow.org |title=National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust|publisher=National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roadshow has evolved over time, increasing collaboration with researchers at the University of Edinburgh and responding to changes in the school curriculum.

==Previous SCI-FUN Projects==

===PP4SS===

Since 2004, Alan Walker from the Department of Physics at the University of Edinburgh has led the PP4SS ''(Particle Physics for Scottish Schools)'' project, funded by the [[PPARC]]. This is a workshop activity aimed at senior secondary school pupils which has been used at school visits, University functions, the Edinburgh International Science Festival and at [[Scottish Parliament]] events. The PP4SS team visited [[CERN]] as part of its 50th Anniversary celebration, along with Professor [[Peter Higgs]] who theorised the existence of the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cern50.web.cern.ch/cern50/Welcome.php |title=CERN 50th anniversary|publisher=CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LERU===

In 2005 and 2006, SCI-FUN organised and ran the University of Edinburgh's part of the Europe-wide [[LERU]] Kids' University programme. This programme aimed to allow secondary school pupils to experience the University environment at an early stage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=8c5f026c9212469c898af2118387b433 |title=LERU-Kids-University|publisher=ist world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work experience placements===

Previously, SCI-FUN has taken on S5 and S6 pupils for work experience placements.  One week work experience places were offered to pupils to either travel out to schools with the Roadshow, or to work in the office developing exhibits or shows.  In the past, pupils have also been offered a chance to apply for a bursary from the [[Nuffield Foundation]] for a six-week placement to work on exhibits for PP4SS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/science-bursaries-schools-and-colleges |title=Science bursaries for schools and colleges |publisher=Nuffield Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Second-language acquisition''' ('''SLA'''), '''second-language learning''', or '''L2''' ('''language 2''') '''acquisition''', is the process by which people learn a [[second language]]. Second-language acquisition is also the scientific discipline devoted to studying that process. The field of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of [[applied linguistics]], but also receives research attention from a variety of other disciplines, such as [[psychology]] and [[education]].

A central theme in SLA research is that of ''[[interlanguage]]'', the idea that the language that learners use is not simply the result of differences between the languages that they already know and the language that they are learning, but that it is a complete language system in its own right, with its own systematic rules. This interlanguage gradually develops as learners are exposed to the targeted language. The order in which learners acquire features of their new language stays remarkably constant, even for learners with different native languages, and regardless of whether they have had language instruction. However, languages that learners already know can have a significant influence on the process of learning a new one. This influence is known as ''[[language transfer]]''.

The primary factor driving SLA appears to be the language input that learners receive. Learners become more advanced the longer they are immersed in the language they are learning, and the more time they spend doing free voluntary reading. The [[input hypothesis]] developed by linguist [[Stephen Krashen]] makes a distinction between language acquisition and language learning (acquisition–learning distinction),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html|title=Stephen Krashen's Theory of Second Language Acquisition (Assimilação Natural - o Construtivismo no Ensino de Línguas)|author=|date=|website=www.sk.com.br|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122150432/http://www.sk.com.br/sk-krash.html|archivedate=22 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that acquisition is a subconscious process, whereas learning is a conscious one. According to this hypothesis, the acquisition process in L2 (Language 2) is the same as L1 (Language 1) acquisition. The learning process is consciously learning and inputting the language being learned.{{sfn|Solé|1994|p=100}} However, this goes as far as to state that input is all that is required for acquisition. Subsequent work, such as the [[interaction hypothesis]] and the [[comprehensible output hypothesis]], has suggested that opportunities for output and for interaction may also be necessary for learners to reach more advanced levels.

Research on how exactly learners acquire a new language spans a number of different areas. Focus is directed toward providing proof of whether basic linguistic skills are innate (nature), acquired (nurture), or a combination of the two attributes. Cognitive approaches to SLA research deal with the processes in the brain that underpin language acquisition, for example how paying attention to language affects the ability to learn it, or how language acquisition is related to short-term and long-term memory. Sociocultural approaches reject the notion that SLA is a purely psychological phenomenon, and attempt to explain it in a social context. Some key social factors that influence SLA are the level of immersion, connection to the L2 community, and gender. Linguistic approaches consider language separately from other kinds of knowledge, and attempt to use findings from the wider study of linguistics to explain SLA. There is also a considerable body of research about how SLA can be affected by individual factors such as age and learning strategies. A commonly discussed topic regarding age in SLA is the [[critical period hypothesis]], which suggests that individuals lose the ability to fully learn a language after a particular age in childhood. Another topic of interest in SLA is the differences between adult and child learners. Learning strategies are commonly categorized as learning or communicative strategies, and are developed to improve their respective acquisition skills. Affective factors are emotional factors that influence an individual's ability to learn a new language. Common affective factors that influence acquisition are anxiety, personality, social attitudes, and motivation.

Individuals may also lose a language through a process called [[second-language attrition]]. This is often caused by lack of use or exposure to a language over time. The severity of attrition depends on a variety of factors including level of [[Language proficiency|proficiency]], age, social factors, and motivation at the time of acquisition. Finally, classroom research deals with the effect that language instruction has on acquisition.

== Definitions ==
''Second language'' refers to any language learned in addition to a person's [[first language]]; although the concept is named ''second''-language acquisition, it can also incorporate the learning of third, fourth, or subsequent languages.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=7}} Second-language acquisition refers to what learners do; it does not refer to practices in [[language teaching]], although teaching can affect acquisition. The term ''acquisition'' was originally used to emphasize the non-conscious nature of the learning process,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Krashen|1982}} made a sharp distinction between ''learning'' and ''acquisition'', using ''learning'' to refer to the conscious aspects of the language learning process and ''acquisition'' to refer to the subconscious aspects. This strict separation of learning and acquisition is widely regarded as an oversimplification by researchers today, but his hypotheses were very influential and the name has stuck.&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years ''learning'' and ''acquisition'' have become largely synonymous.

SLA can incorporate [[heritage language learning]],{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=21–24}} but it does not usually incorporate [[bilingualism]]. Most SLA researchers see bilingualism as being the end result of learning a language, not the process itself, and see the term as referring to native-like fluency. Writers in fields such as education and psychology, however, often use bilingualism loosely to refer to all forms of [[multilingualism]].{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=24–25}} SLA is also not to be contrasted with the acquisition of a [[foreign language]]; rather, the learning of second languages and the learning of foreign languages involve the same fundamental processes in different situations.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=3}}

== Research background ==
The academic discipline of second-language acquisition is a subdiscipline of [[applied linguistics]]. It is broad-based and relatively new. As well as the various branches of [[linguistics]], second-language acquisition is also closely related to psychology, [[cognitive psychology]], and education. To separate the academic discipline from the learning process itself, the terms ''second-language acquisition research'', ''second-language studies'', and ''second-language acquisition studies'' are also used.

SLA research began as an interdisciplinary field, and because of this it is difficult to identify a precise starting date.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} However, two papers in particular are seen as instrumental to the development of the modern study of SLA: Pit Corder's 1967 essay ''The Significance of Learners' Errors'', and Larry Selinker's 1972 article ''Interlanguage''.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}} The field saw a great deal of development in the following decades.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=1}} Since the 1980s, SLA has been studied from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, and theoretical perspectives. In the early 2000s, some research suggested an equivalence between the acquisition of human languages and that of computer languages (e.g. Java) by children in the 5 to 11 year age window, though this has not been widely accepted among educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Readin', Writin' &amp; Ruby On Rails: Let's Teach Our Kids To Code|last = Koerner|first = Brendan I.|date = October 2013|journal = Wired|doi = |pmid = |page = 30|author-link = Brendan I. Koerner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant approaches in the field today are: systemic functional linguistics, sociocultural theory, cognitive linguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[universal grammar]], [[Skill-based theories of second-language acquisition|skill acquisition theory]] and [[connectionism]].{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=2–5}}

There has been much debate about exactly how language is learned, and many issues are still unresolved. There are many theories of second-language acquisition, but none are accepted as a complete explanation by all SLA researchers. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field of SLA, this is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. Although attempts have been made to provide a more unified account that tries to bridge first language acquisition and second language learning research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janciauskas|first=Marius|last2=Chang|first2=Franklin|date=2017-07-26|title=Input and Age-Dependent Variation in Second Language Learning: A Connectionist Account|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12519|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=42|pages=519–554|doi=10.1111/cogs.12519|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Stages ==
Stephen Krashen divides the process of second-language acquisition into five stages: preproduction, early production, speech emergence, intermediate fluency, and advanced fluency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108053/chapters/The-Stages-of-Second-Language-Acquisition.aspx|title=The Stages of Second Language Acquisition|first=|last=ASCD|date=|website=www.ascd.org|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328231719/http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108053/chapters/The-Stages-of-Second-Language-Acquisition.aspx|archivedate=28 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}} The first stage, preproduction, is also known as the [[silent period]]. Learners at this stage have a receptive vocabulary of up to 500 words, but they do not yet speak their second language.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}} Not all learners go through a silent period. Some learners start speaking straight away, although their output may consist of imitation rather than creative language use. Others may be required to speak from the start as part of a language course. For learners that do go through a silent period, it may last around three to six months.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=73–75}}

The second of Krashen's stages of acquisition is early production, during which learners are able to speak in short phrases of one or two words. They can also memorize chunks of language, although they may make mistakes when using them. Learners typically have both an active and receptive vocabulary of around 1000 words. This stage normally lasts for around six months.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}}

The third stage is speech emergence. Learners' vocabularies increase to around 3000 words during this stage, and they can communicate using simple questions and phrases. They may often make grammatical errors.

The fourth stage is intermediate fluency. At this stage, learners have a vocabulary of around 6000 words, and can use more complicated sentence structures. They are also able to share their thoughts and opinions. Learners may make frequent errors with more complicated sentence structures.

The final stage is advanced fluency, which is typically reached somewhere between five and ten years of learning the language. Learners at this stage can function at a level close to native speakers.{{sfn|Haynes|2007|pp=29–35}}

Krashen has also developed a number of hypotheses discussing the nature of second language learners' thought processes and the development of self-awareness during second language acquisition. The most prominent of these hypotheses are Monitor Theory and the Affective Filter hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307232341/http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The time taken to reach a high level of proficiency can vary depending on the language learned. In the case of native English speakers, some estimates were provided by the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) of the [[U.S. Department of State]], which compiled approximate learning expectations for a number of languages for their professional staff (native English speakers who generally already know other languages). Of the 63 languages analyzed, the five most difficult languages to reach proficiency in speaking and reading, requiring 88 weeks (2200 class hours), are [[Arabic]], [[Cantonese]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Korean language|Korean]]. The Foreign Service Institute and the [[National Virtual Translation Center]] both note that Japanese is typically more difficult to learn than other languages in this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zidbits.com/2011/04/what-is-the-hardest-language-to-learn/|title=What's the Hardest Language to Learn?|work=Zidbits|accessdate=10 June 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611010429/http://zidbits.com/2011/04/what-is-the-hardest-language-to-learn/|archivedate=11 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparisons with first-language acquisition ==
Adults who learn a second language differ from children [[Language acquisition|learning their first language]] in at least three ways: children are still developing their brains whereas adults have mature minds, and adults have at least a first language that orients their thinking and speaking. Although some adult second-language learners reach very high levels of proficiency, pronunciation tends to be non-native. This lack of native pronunciation in adult learners is explained by the [[critical period hypothesis]]. When a learner's speech plateaus, it is known as [[Interlanguage fossilization|fossilization]].

Some errors that second-language learners make in their speech originate in their first language. For example, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] speakers learning [[English language|English]] may say "Is raining" rather than "It is raining", leaving out the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the sentence. This kind of influence of the first language on the second is known as ''negative'' [[language transfer]]. [[French language|French]] speakers learning English, however, do not usually make the same mistake of leaving out "it" in "It is raining." This is because [[Pronoun|pronominal]] and impersonal sentence subjects [[Pro-drop language|can be omitted]] (or as in this case, are not used in the first place) in Spanish but not in French.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=13}} The French speaker knowing to use a pronominal sentence subject when speaking English is an example of ''positive'' language transfer. It is important to note that not all errors occur in the same ways; even two individuals with the same native language learning the same second language still have the potential to utilize different parts of their native language. Likewise, these same two individuals may develop near-native fluency in different forms of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;Monika S. Schmid (2014) The Debate on Maturational Constraints in Bilingual Development: A Perspective from First-Language Attrition, Language Acquisition, 21:4, 386-410, DOI: 10.1080/10489223.2014.892947&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when people learn a second language, the way they speak their first language changes in subtle ways. These changes can be with any aspect of language, from pronunciation and syntax to the gestures the learner makes and the language features they tend to notice.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=232}} For example, French speakers who spoke English as a second language pronounced the /t/ sound in French differently from monolingual French speakers.{{sfn|Flege|1987}} This kind of change in pronunciation has been found even at the onset of second-language acquisition; for example, English speakers pronounced the English /p t k/ sounds, as well as English vowels, differently after they began to learn Korean.{{sfn|Chang|2012}} These effects of the second language on the first led [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]] to propose the idea of [[multi-competence]], which sees the different languages a person speaks not as separate systems, but as related systems in their mind.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=15}}

== Learner language ==
''Learner language'' is the written or spoken language produced by a learner. It is also the main type of data used in second-language acquisition research.{{sfn|Ellis|Barkhuizen|2005|p=4}} Much research in second-language acquisition is concerned with the internal representations of a language in the mind of the learner, and in how those representations change over time. It is not yet possible to inspect these representations directly with brain scans or similar techniques, so SLA researchers are forced to make inferences about these rules from learners' speech or writing.{{sfn|Ellis|Barkhuizen|2005|p=6}}

=== Interlanguage ===
{{main article|Interlanguage}}

Originally, attempts to describe learner language were based on [[Contrastive analysis|comparing different languages]] and on [[Error analysis (linguistics)|analyzing learners' errors]]. However, these approaches weren't able to predict all the errors that learners made when in the process of learning a second language. For example, Serbo-Croat speakers learning English may say "What does Pat doing now?", although this is not a valid sentence in either language.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm | title=Didactics&amp;nbsp;– 7 : Critique of Krashen III. Natural Order Hypothesis (2) :Interlanguage | accessdate=2011-02-10 | author=Mason, Timothy | work=Lecture in the didactics of English, Université of Versailles St. Quentin, a course run from 1993 to 2002 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110125249/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/LangTeach/Licence/CM/OldLectures/L7_Interlanguage.htm | archivedate=2012-01-10 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain this kind of systematic error, the idea of the ''interlanguage'' was developed.{{sfn|Selinker|1972}} An interlanguage is an emerging language system in the mind of a second-language learner. A learner's interlanguage is not a deficient version of the language being learned filled with random errors, nor is it a language purely based on errors introduced from the learner's first language. Rather, it is a language in its own right, with its own systematic rules.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=14}} It is possible to view most aspects of language from an interlanguage perspective, including [[grammar]], [[phonology]], [[lexicon]], and [[pragmatics]].

There are three different processes that influence the creation of interlanguages:&lt;ref name="Mason" /&gt;
* ''[[Language transfer]]''. Learners fall back on their mother tongue to help create their language system. Transfer can be positive, i.e. promote learning, or negative, i.e. lead to mistakes. In the latter case, linguists also use the term interference error.
* ''Overgeneralization''. Learners use rules from the second language in roughly the same way that children overgeneralise in their first language. For example, a learner may say "I goed home", overgeneralizing the English rule of adding ''-ed'' to create past tense verb forms. English children also produce forms like goed, sticked, bringed. German children equally overextend regular past tense forms to irregular forms.
* ''Simplification''. Learners use a highly simplified form of language, similar to speech by children or in [[pidgin]]s. This may be related to [[linguistic universal]]s.

The concept of interlanguage has become very widespread in SLA research, and is often a basic assumption made by researchers.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|p=14}}

|}
{{main article|Order of acquisition}}
In the 1970s, several studies investigated the order in which learners acquired different grammatical structures.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;These studies were based on work by {{Harvtxt|Brown|1973}} on child first-language acquisition. The first such studies on child second-language acquisition were carried out by {{Harvs|txt|last=Dulay|last2=Burt|year=1973|year2=1974a|year3=1974b|year4=1975}}. {{Harvtxt|Bailey|Madden|Krashen|1974}} investigated the order of acquisition among adult second-language learners. See {{Harvtxt|Krashen|1977}} for a review of these studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  These studies showed that there was little change in this order among learners with different first languages. Furthermore, it showed that the order was the same for adults and children, and that it did not even change if the learner had language lessons. This supported the idea that there were factors other than language transfer involved in learning second languages, and was a strong confirmation of the concept of interlanguage.

However, the studies did not find that the orders were exactly the same. Although there were remarkable similarities in the order in which all learners learned second-language grammar, there were still some differences among individuals and among learners with different first languages. It is also difficult to tell when exactly a grammatical structure has been learned, as learners may use structures correctly in some situations but not in others. Thus it is more accurate to speak of ''sequences'' of acquisition, in which specific grammatical features in a language are acquired before or after certain others but the overall order of acquisition is less rigid.  For example, if neither feature B nor feature D can be acquired until feature A has been acquired and if feature C cannot be acquired until feature B has been acquired but if the acquisition of feature D does not require the possession of feature B (or, therefore, of feature C), then both acquisition order (A, B, C, D) and acquisition order (A, D, B, C) are possible.

=== Variability ===

Although second-language acquisition proceeds in discrete sequences, it does not progress from one step of a sequence to the next in an orderly fashion. There can be considerable variability in features of learners' interlanguage while progressing from one stage to the next.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} For example, in one study by Rod Ellis a learner used both "No look my card" and "Don't look my card" while playing a game of bingo.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=166}} A small fraction of variation in interlanguage is ''free variation'', when the learner uses two forms interchangeably. However, most variation is ''systemic variation'', variation that depends on the context of utterances the learner makes.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} Forms can vary depending on linguistic context, such as whether the subject of a sentence is a pronoun or a noun; they can vary depending on social context, such as using formal expressions with superiors and informal expressions with friends; and also, they can vary depending on psycholinguistic context, or in other words, on whether learners have the chance to plan what they are going to say.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|pp=25–29}} The causes of variability are a matter of great debate among SLA researchers.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=166}}

== Language transfer ==
{{main article|Language transfer}}

One important difference between first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition is that the process of second-language acquisition is influenced by languages that the learner already knows. This influence is known as ''language transfer''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The term ''language transfer'' is not without controversy, however. Sharwood Smith and Kellerman preferred the term ''[[crosslinguistic influence]]'' to ''language transfer''. They argued that ''cross-linguistic influence'' was neutral regarding different theories of language acquisition, whereas ''language transfer'' was not. {{harvnb|Sharwood Smith|Kellerman|1986}}, cited in {{harvnb|Ellis|2008|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Language transfer is a complex phenomenon resulting from interaction between learners’ prior linguistic knowledge, the target-language input they encounter, and their cognitive processes.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Language transfer is not always from the learner’s native language; it can also be from a second language, or a third.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Neither is it limited to any particular domain of language; language transfer can occur in grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, discourse, and reading.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=350}}

Language transfer often occurs when learners sense a similarity between a feature of a language they already know and a feature of the interlanguage they have developed. If this happens, the acquisition of more complicated language forms may be delayed in favor of simpler language forms that resemble those of the language the learner is familiar with.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Learners may also decline to use some language forms at all if they are perceived as being too distant from their first language.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}}

Language transfer has been the subject of several studies, and many aspects of it remain unexplained.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|2006|pp=93–96}} Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain language transfer, but there is no single widely accepted explanation of why it occurs.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=397}}

== Input and interaction ==

The primary factor affecting language acquisition appears to be the input that the learner receives. [[Stephen Krashen]] took a very strong position on the importance of input, asserting that [[comprehensible input]] is all that is necessary for second-language acquisition.{{sfn|Krashen|1981a}}{{sfn|Krashen|1994}} Krashen pointed to studies showing that the length of time a person stays in a foreign country is closely linked with his level of language acquisition. Further evidence for input comes from studies on reading: large amounts of free voluntary reading have a significant positive effect on learners' vocabulary, grammar, and writing.{{sfn|Elley|1991}}{{sfn|Krashen|2004}} Input is also the mechanism by which people learn languages according to the [[universal grammar]] model.{{sfn|Cook|2008|p=215}}

The type of input may also be important. One tenet of Krashen's theory is that input should not be grammatically sequenced. He claims that such sequencing, as found in language classrooms where lessons involve practicing a "structure of the day", is not necessary, and may even be harmful.{{sfn|Krashen|1981b|pp=54–55}}

While input is of vital importance, Krashen's assertion that ''only'' input matters in second-language acquisition has been contradicted by more recent research. For example, students enrolled in French-[[language immersion]] programs in Canada still produced non-native-like grammar when they spoke, even though they had years of meaning-focused lessons and their listening skills were statistically native-level.{{sfn|Swain|1991}} Output appears to play an important role, and among other things, can help provide learners with feedback, make them concentrate on the form of what they are saying, and help them to automatize their language knowledge.{{sfn|Skehan|1998}} These processes have been codified in the theory of [[comprehensible output]].{{sfn|Swain|1995}}

Researchers have also pointed to interaction in the second language as being important for acquisition. According to Long's [[interaction hypothesis]] the conditions for acquisition are especially good when interacting in the second language; specifically, conditions are good when a breakdown in communication occurs and learners must negotiate for meaning. The modifications to speech arising from interactions like this help make input more comprehensible, provide feedback to the learner, and push learners to modify their speech.{{sfn|Long|1996}}

== Cognitive factors ==

Much modern research in second-language acquisition has taken a cognitive approach.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=5}} Cognitive research is concerned with the mental processes involved in language acquisition, and how they can explain the nature of learners' language knowledge. This area of research is based in the more general area of [[cognitive science]], and uses many concepts and models used in more general cognitive theories of learning. As such, cognitive theories view second-language acquisition as a special case of more general learning mechanisms in the brain. This puts them in direct contrast with linguistic theories, which posit that language acquisition uses a unique process different from other types of learning.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=71}}{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}}

{{anchor|Computational models}}The dominant model in cognitive approaches to second-language acquisition, and indeed in all second-language acquisition research, is the computational model.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}} The computational model involves three stages. In the first stage, learners retain certain features of the language input in short-term memory. (This retained input is known as ''intake''.) Then, learners convert some of this intake into second-language knowledge, which is stored in long-term memory. Finally, learners use this second-language knowledge to produce spoken output.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=35}} Cognitive theories attempt to codify both the nature of the mental representations of intake and language knowledge, and the mental processes that underlie these stages.

In the early days of second-language acquisition research on [[interlanguage]] was seen as the basic representation of second-language knowledge; however, more recent research has taken a number of different approaches in characterizing the mental representation of language knowledge.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=408–410}} There are theories that hypothesize that learner language is inherently variable,{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=410–415}} and there is the functionalist perspective that sees acquisition of language as intimately tied to the function it provides.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=415–417}} Some researchers make the distinction between ''implicit'' and ''explicit'' language knowledge, and some between ''declarative'' and ''procedural'' language knowledge.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=242–243}} There have also been approaches that argue for a ''dual-mode system'' in which some language knowledge is stored as rules, and other language knowledge as items.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=431–433}}

The mental processes that underlie second-language acquisition can be broken down into micro-processes and macro-processes. Micro-processes include attention;{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=248–249}} working memory;{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=250–253}} integration and restructuring. Restructuring is the process by which learners change their interlanguage systems;{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=443–445}} and ''monitoring'' is the conscious attending of learners to their own language output.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=253–255}} Macro-processes include the distinction between intentional learning and incidental learning; and also the distinction between explicit and implicit learning.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=445–452}} Some of the notable cognitive theories of second-language acquisition include the [[nativization model]], the [[multidimensional model]] and [[processability]] theory, [[emergentist model]]s, the [[competition model]], and [[skill-acquisition theories]].{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=445–482}}

Other cognitive approaches have looked at learners' speech production, particularly learners' [[speech planning]] and [[communication strategies]]. Speech planning can have an effect on learners' spoken output, and research in this area has focused on how planning affects three aspects of speech: complexity, accuracy, and fluency. Of these three, planning effects on fluency has had the most research attention.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=488–492}} Communication strategies are conscious strategies that learners employ to get around any instances of communication breakdown they may experience. Their effect on second-language acquisition is unclear, with some researchers claiming they help it, and others claiming the opposite.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=511}}

== Sociocultural factors ==

From the early days of the discipline researchers have also acknowledged that social aspects play an important role.{{sfn|Ellis|1997|p=37}} There have been many different approaches to sociolinguistic study of second-language acquisition, and indeed, according to Rod Ellis, this plurality has meant that "sociolinguistic SLA is replete with a bewildering set of terms referring to the social aspects of L2 acquisition".{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=280–281}} Common to each of these approaches, however, is a rejection of language as a purely psychological phenomenon; instead, sociolinguistic research views the social context in which language is learned as essential for a proper understanding of the acquisition process.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=280–281}}

Ellis identifies three types of social structure that affect acquisition of second languages: sociolinguistic setting, specific social factors, and situational factors.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=281}} Sociolinguistic setting refers to the role of the second language in society, such as whether it is spoken by a majority or a minority of the population, whether its use is widespread or restricted to a few functional roles, or whether the society is predominantly bilingual or monolingual.{{sfn|Siegel|2003|p=178}} Ellis also includes the distinction of whether the second language is learned in a natural or an educational setting.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=288}} Specific social factors that can affect second-language acquisition include age, gender, social class, and ethnic identity, with ethnic identity being the one that has received most research attention.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=323}} Situational factors are those that vary between each social interaction. For example, a learner may use more polite language when talking to someone of higher social status, but more informal language when talking with friends.{{sfn|Gass|Selinker|2008|pp=268–269}}

Immersion programs provide a sociolinguistic setting that facilitates second-language acquisition. Immersion programs are educational programs where children are instructed in an L2 language.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} Although the language of instruction is the L2 language, the curriculum parallels that of non-immersion programs and clear support exists in the L1 language, as the teachers are all bilingual. The goal of these programs is to develop a high level of proficiency in both the L1 and L2 languages. Students in immersion programs have been shown to have greater levels of proficiency in their second language than students who receive second language education only as a subject in school.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} This is especially true in terms of their receptive skills. Also, students who join immersion programs earlier generally have greater second-language proficiency than their peers who join later. However, students who join later have been shown to gain native-like proficiency. Although immersion students' receptive skills are especially strong, their productive skills may suffer if they spend the majority of their time listening to instruction only. Grammatical skills and the ability to have precise vocabulary are particular areas of struggle. It is argued that immersion is necessary, but not sufficient for the development of native-like proficiency in a second language.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}} Opportunities to engage in sustained conversation, and assignments that encourage syntactical, as well as semantic development help develop the productive skills necessary for bilingual proficiency.{{sfn|Pinter|2011|pp=80–82}}

A learner's sense of connection to their in-group, as well as to the community of the target language emphasize the influence of the sociolinguistic setting, as well as social factors within the second-language acquisition process. [[Social identity theory|Social Identity Theory]] argues that an important factor for second language acquisition is the learner's perceived identity in relation to the community of the language being learned, as well as how the community of the target language perceives the learner.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} Whether or not a learner feels a sense of connection to the community or culture of the target language helps determine their social distance from the target culture. A smaller social distance is likely to encourage learners to acquire the second language, as their investment in the learning process is greater. Conversely, a greater social distance discourages attempts to acquire the target language. However, negative views not only come from the learner, but the community of the target language might feel greater social distance to the learner, limiting the learner's ability to learn the language.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} Whether or not bilingualism is valued by the culture or community of the learner is an important indicator for the motivation to learn a language.{{sfn|Vega|2008|pp=185–198}}

Gender, as a social factor, also influences SLA. Females have been found to have higher motivation and more positive attitudes than males for second-language acquisition. However, females are also more likely to present higher levels of anxiety, which may inhibit their ability to efficiently learn a new language.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}}

There have been several models developed to explain social effects on language acquisition. Schumann's [[Acculturation Model]] proposes that learners' rate of development and ultimate level of language achievement is a function of the "social distance" and the "psychological distance" between learners and the second-language community. In Schumann's model the social factors are most important, but the degree to which learners are comfortable with learning the second language also plays a role.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=326–327}} Another sociolinguistic model is Gardner's [[socio-educational model]], which was designed to explain classroom language acquisition. Gardner's model focuses on the emotional aspects of SLA, arguing that positive motivation contributes to an individuals willingness to learn L2; furthermore, the goal of an individual to learn a L2 is based on the idea that the individual has a desire to be part of a culture, in other words, part of a (the targeted language) mono-linguistic community. Factors, such as [[Motivation in second-language learning|''integrativeness'']] and ''attitudes towards the learning situation'' drive motivation. The outcome of positive motivation is not only linguistic, but non-linguistic, such that the learner has met the desired goal. Although there are many critics of Gardner's model, nonetheless many of these critics have been influenced by the merits that his model holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Critical Review on the Socio-educational Model of SLA|url = http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/tpls/article/view/tpls0503605612|journal = Theory and Practice in Language Studies|date = 2015-03-24|issn = 1799-2591|pages = 605–612|volume = 5|issue = 3|doi = 10.17507/tpls.0503.21|first = Masumeh|last = Taie|first2 = Asghar|last2 = Afshari|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120181053/http://www.academypublication.com/ojs/index.php/tpls/article/view/tpls0503605612|archivedate = 2015-11-20|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=330}} The [[inter-group model]] proposes "ethnolinguistic vitality" as a key construct for second-language acquisition.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=332}} [[Language socialization]] is an approach with the premise that "linguistic and cultural knowledge are ''constructed'' through each other",{{sfn|Watson-Gegeo|Nielsen|2003|p=157}} and saw increased attention after the year 2000.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=334}} Finally, Norton's theory of [[social identity (linguistics)|social identity]] is an attempt to codify the relationship between power, identity, and language acquisition.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=336}}

=== Sociocultural approaches ===

A unique approach to SLA is Sociocultural theory. It was originally developed by [[Lev Vygotsky]] and his followers.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=151–152}}  Central to Vygotsky's theory is the concept of a [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD). The ZPD notion states that social interaction with more advanced target language users allows one to learn language at a higher level than if they were to learn language independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Languages are Learned|last=Lightbown|first=Patsy|last2=Spada|first2=Nina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-442224-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociocultural theory has a fundamentally different set of assumptions to approaches to second-language acquisition based on the computational model.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=517–518}} Furthermore, although it is closely affiliated with other social approaches, it is a theory of mind and not of general social explanations of language acquisition. According to Ellis, "It is important to recognize... that this paradigm, despite the label 'sociocultural' does not seek to explain how learners acquire the cultural values of the L2 but rather how knowledge of an L2 is internalized through experiences of a sociocultural nature."{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=517–518}}

== Linguistic factors ==

Linguistic approaches to explaining second-language acquisition spring from the wider study of linguistics. They differ from cognitive approaches and sociocultural approaches in that they consider language knowledge to be unique and distinct from any other type of knowledge.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=71}}{{sfn|Ellis|2008|pp=405–406}} The linguistic research tradition in second-language acquisition has developed in relative isolation from the cognitive and sociocultural research traditions, and as of 2010 the influence from the wider field of linguistics was still strong.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=5}} Two main strands of research can be identified in the linguistic tradition: approaches informed by [[universal grammar]], and typological approaches.{{sfn|Ellis|2008|p=557}}

[[Typological universals]] are principles that hold for all the world's languages. They are found empirically, by surveying different languages and deducing which aspects of them could be universal; these aspects are then checked against other languages to verify the findings. The [[interlanguage]]s of second-language learners have been shown to obey typological universals, and some researchers have suggested that typological universals may constrain interlanguage development.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=161}}

The theory of universal grammar was proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s, and has enjoyed considerable popularity in the field of linguistics. It focuses on describing the [[linguistic competence]] of an individual. He believed that children not only acquire language by learning descriptive rules of grammar; he claimed that children ''creatively'' play and form words as they learn language, creating meaning of these words, as opposed to the mechanism of memorizing language.{{sfn|Solé|1994|p=99}} It consists of a set of ''principles'', which are universal and constant, and a set of ''parameters'', which can be set differently for different languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=162–163}} The "universals" in universal grammar differ from typological universals in that they are a mental construct derived by researchers, whereas typological universals are readily verifiable by data from world languages.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|p=161}} It is widely accepted among researchers in the universal grammar framework that all first-language learners have access to universal grammar; this is not the case for second-language learners, however, and much research in the context of second-language acquisition has focused on what level of access learners may have.{{sfn|VanPatten|Benati|2010|pp=162–163}}

Universal grammar theory can account for some of the observations of SLA research. For example, L2-users often display knowledge about their L2 that they have not been exposed to.{{sfn|VanPatten|Williams|2015|pp=36–37}} L2-users are often aware of ambiguous or ungrammatical L2 units that they have not learned from any external source, nor from their pre-existing L1 knowledge. This unsourced knowledge suggests the existence of a universal grammar.

== Individual variation ==
{{main article|Individual variation in second-language acquisition}}

There is considerable variation in the rate at which people learn second languages, and in the language level that they ultimately reach. Some learners learn quickly and reach a near-native level of competence, but others learn slowly and [[Interlanguage fossilization|get stuck]] at relatively early stages of acquisition, despite living in the country where the language is spoken for several years. The reason for this disparity was first addressed with the study of [[language learning aptitude]] in the 1950s, and later with the ''[[good language learner studies]]'' in the 1970s. More recently research has focused on a number of different factors that affect individuals' language learning, in particular strategy use, social and societal influences, personality, motivation, and anxiety. The relationship between age and the ability to learn languages has also been a subject of long-standing debate.

=== Age ===
The issue of age was first addressed with the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The critical period hypothesis was formulated for first-language acquisition by {{Harvtxt|Penfield|Roberts|1959}} and popularized by {{Harvtxt|Lenneberg|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The strict version of this hypothesis states that there is a cut-off age at about 12, after which learners lose the ability to fully learn a language. However, the exact age marking the end of the critical period is debated, and ranges from age 6 to 13, with many arguing that it is around the onset of puberty.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} This strict version has since been rejected for second-language acquisition, as some adult learners have been observed who reach native-like levels of pronunciation and general fluency. However, in general, adult learners of a second-language rarely achieve the native-like fluency that children display, despite often progressing faster in the initial stages. This has led to speculation that age is indirectly related to other, more central factors that affect language learning.

Children who acquire two languages from birth are called simultaneous bilinguals. In these cases, both languages are spoken to the children by their parents or caregivers and they grow up knowing the two languages. These children generally reach linguistic milestones at the same time as their monolingual peers.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}} Children who do not learn two languages from infancy, but learn one language from birth, and another at some point during childhood, are referred to as sequential bilinguals. People often assume that a sequential bilingual's first language is their most proficient language, but this is not always the case. Over time and experience, a child's second language may become his or her strongest.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}} This is especially likely to happen if a child's first language is a minority language spoken at home, and the child's second language is the majority language learned at school or in the community before the age of five. Proficiency for both simultaneous and sequential bilinguals is dependent upon the child's opportunities to engage in meaningful conversations in a variety of contexts.{{sfn|Kohnert|2008}}

Often simultaneous bilinguals are more proficient in their languages than sequential bilinguals. One argument for this is that simultaneous bilinguals develop more distinct representations of their languages, especially with regards to [[phonological]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] levels of processing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lexical Processing and Second Language Acquisition|last = Tokowicz|first = Natasha|publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-415-87755-8|location = New York, NY|pages = 57–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would cause learners to have more differentiation between the languages, leading them to be able to recognize the subtle differences between the languages that less proficient learners would struggle to recognize. Learning a language earlier in life would help develop these distinct representations of language, as the learner's first language would be less established. Conversely, learning a language later in life would lead to more similar semantic representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although child learners more often acquire native-like proficiency, older child and adult learners often progress faster in the initial stages of learning.{{sfn|Long|2007}} Older child and adult learners are quicker at acquiring the initial grammar knowledge than child learners, however, with enough time and exposure to the language, children surpass their older peers. Once surpassed, older learners often display clear language deficiencies compared to child learners. This has been attributed to having a solid grasp on the first language or mother tongue they were first immersed into. Having this cognitive ability already developed can aid the process of learning a second language since there is a better understanding of how language works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning difficulties or learning English difficulties? Additional language acquisition: An update for paediatricians.|last = Clifford, Rhodes, &amp; Paxton|first = |date = 2014|journal = Journal of Paediatricians &amp; Child Health Vol. 50 Issue 3|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this same reason interaction with family and further development of the first language is encouraged along with positive reinforcement. The exact language deficiencies that occur past a certain age are not unanimously agreed upon. Some believe that only pronunciation is affected, while others believe other abilities are affected as well. However, some differences that are generally agreed upon include older learners having a noticeable accent, a smaller vocabulary, and making several linguistic errors.

One explanation for this difference in proficiency between older learners and younger learners involves [[Universal grammar|Universal Grammar]]. Universal Grammar is a debated theory that suggests that people have innate knowledge of universal linguistic principles that is present from birth.{{sfn|Long|2007}} These principles guide children as they learn a language, but its parameters vary from language to language.{{sfn|Gass|Glew|2008}} The theory assumes that, while Universal Grammar remains into adulthood, the ability to reset the parameters set for each language is lost, making it more difficult to learn a new language proficiently.{{sfn|Long|2007}} Since adults have an already established native language, the language acquisition process is much different for them, than young learners. The rules and principles that guide the use of the learners' native language plays a role in the way the second language is developed.{{sfn|Gass|Glew|2008}}

Some nonbiological explanations for second-language acquisition age differences include variations in social and psychological factors, such as motivation; the learner's linguistic environment; and the level of exposure. Even with less advantageous nonbiological influences, many child learners attain a greater level of proficiency than adult learners with more advantageous nonbiological influences.{{sfn|Long|2007}}

=== Strategies ===
Considerable attention has been paid to the strategies learners use to learn a second language. Strategies have been found to be of critical importance, so much so that ''strategic competence'' has been suggested as a major component of [[communicative competence]].{{sfn|Canale|Swain|1980}} Strategies are commonly divided into ''[[learning strategies]]'' and ''[[communicative strategies]]'', although there are other ways of categorizing them. Learning strategies are techniques used to improve learning, such as [[mnemonic]]s or using a [[dictionary]]. Communicative strategies are strategies a learner uses to convey meaning even when he or she doesn't have access to the correct form, such as using [[pro-form]]s like ''thing'', or using non-verbal means such as [[gesture]]s. If learning strategies and communicative strategies are used properly language acquisition is successful. Some points to keep in mind while learning an additional language are: providing information that is of interest to the student, offering opportunities for the student to share their knowledge and teaching appropriate techniques for the uses of the learning resources available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Good practice for pupils learning English as an additional language: Lessons from effective literacy teachers in inner-city primary schools|last = Flynn|first = Naomi|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Early Childhood Literacy Vol.7 Issue2 p.184|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy may include intentional ways to acquire or improve official their second language skills. Adult immigrants and/or second language learners seeking to acquire a second language can engage in different activities to receive and share knowledge as well improve their learning; some of these include:

*incidental or informal learning (''media resources, family/friend interactions, work interactions'')
*purposeful learning (''self-study, taking language classes'')
*pursuing formal education  &lt;ref&gt;Adamuti-Trache’ (2012). Language Acquisition Among Adult Immigrants in Canada: The Effect of Premigration Language. Adult Education Quarterly, 63(2), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affective factors ===
The learner's attitude to the learning process has also been identified as being critically important to second-language acquisition. [[Anxiety]] in language-learning situations has been almost unanimously shown to be detrimental to successful learning. Anxiety interferes with the mental processing of language because the demands of anxiety-related thoughts create competition for mental resources. This results in less available storage and energy for tasks required for language processing.{{sfn|Ashcraft|Kirk|2001}} Not only this, but anxiety is also usually accompanied by self-deprecating thoughts and fear of failure, which can be detrimental to an individual's ability to learn a new language.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}} Learning a new language provides a unique situation that may even produce a specific type of anxiety, called language anxiety, that affects the quality of acquisition.{{sfn|MacIntyre|Gardner|1991}} Also, anxiety may be detrimental for SLA because it can influence a learner's ability to attend to, concentrate on, and encode language information.{{sfn|Piechurska-Kuciel|2011}} It may affect speed and accuracy of learning. Further, the apprehension created as a result of anxiety inhibits the learner's ability to retrieve and produce the correct information.

A related factor, personality, has also received attention. There has been discussion about the effects of [[Extraversion and introversion|extravert]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|introvert]] personalities. Extraverted qualities may help learners seek out opportunities and people to assist with L2 learning, whereas introverts may find it more difficult to seek out such opportunities for interaction.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} However, it has also been suggested that, while extraverts might experience greater fluency, introverts are likely to make fewer linguistic errors. Further, while extraversion might be beneficial through its encouragement of learning autonomously, it may also present challenges as learners may find reflective and time-management skills to be difficult.{{sfn|Studenska|2011}} However, one study has found that there were no significant differences between extraverts and introverts on the way they achieve success in a second language.{{sfn|Erton|2010}}

Other personality factors, such as [[conscientiousness]], [[agreeableness]], and [[Openness to experience|openness]] influence self-regulation, which helps L2 learners engage, process meaning, and adapt their thoughts, feelings, and actions to benefit the acquisition process.{{sfn|Studenska|2011}} SLA research has shown conscientiousness to be associated with time-management skills, metacognition, analytic learning, and persistence; agreeableness to effort; and openness to elaborative learning, intelligence, and metacognition. Both genetics and the learner's environment impact the personality of the learner, either facilitating or hindering an individual's ability to learn.

Social attitudes such as gender roles and community views toward language learning have also proven critical. Language learning can be severely hampered by cultural attitudes, with a frequently cited example being the difficulty of [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] children in learning English{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

Also, the [[Motivation in second-language learning|motivation]] of the individual learner is of vital importance to the success of language learning. Motivation is influenced by goal [[salience (language)|salience]], [[wikt:valence|valence]], and [[self-efficacy]].{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} In this context, goal salience is the importance of the L2 learner's goal, as well as how often the goal is pursued; valence is the value the L2 learner places on SLA, determined by desire to learn and attitudes about learning the L2; and self-efficacy is the learner's own belief that he or she is capable of achieving the linguistic goal.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Studies have consistently shown that ''intrinsic motivation'', or a genuine interest in the language itself, is more effective over the long term than ''extrinsic motivation'', as in learning a language for a reward such as high grades or praise. However, motivation is dynamic and, as a L2 learner's fluency develops, their extrinsic motivation may evolve to become more intrinsic.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Learner motivation can develop through contact with the L2 community and culture, as learners often desire to communicate and identify with individuals in the L2 community. Further, a supportive learning environment facilitates motivation through the increase in self-confidence and autonomy.{{sfn|Piasecka|2011}} Learners in a supportive environment are more often willing to take on challenging tasks, thus encouraging L2 development.

== Attrition ==
{{main article|Second-language attrition}}

Attrition is the loss of proficiency in a language caused by a lack of exposure to or use of a language.{{sfn|Loewen|Reinders|2011}} It is a natural part of the language experience as it exists within a dynamic environment.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} As the environment changes, the language adapts. One way it does this is by using L1 as a tool to navigate the periods of change associated with acquisition and attrition. A learner's L2 is not suddenly lost with disuse, but its communicative functions are slowly replaced by those of the L1.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

Similar to second-language acquisition, second-language attrition occurs in stages. However, according to the regression hypothesis, the stages of attrition occur in reverse order of acquisition. With acquisition, receptive skills develop first, and then productive skills, and with attrition, productive skills are lost first, and then receptive skills.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

Age, proficiency level, and social factors play a role in the way attrition occurs.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Most often younger children are quicker than adults to lose their L2 when it is left unused. However, if a child has established a high level of proficiency, it may take him or her several years to lose the language. Proficiency level seems to play the largest role in the extent of attrition. For very proficient individuals, there is a period of time where very little, if any, attrition is observed. For some, residual learning might even occur, which is the apparent improvement within the L2.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Within the first five years of language disuse, the total percentage of language knowledge lost is less for a proficient individual than for someone less proficient. A cognitive psychological explanation for this suggests that a higher level of proficiency involves the use of [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s, or mental representations for linguistic structures. Schemas involve deeper mental processes for mental retrieval that are resistant to attrition. As a result, information that is tied to this system is less likely to experience less extreme attrition than information that is not.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}} Finally, social factors may play an indirect role in attrition. In particular, motivation and attitude influence the process. Higher levels of motivation, and a positive attitude toward the language and the corresponding community may lessen attrition. This is likely due to the higher level of competence achieved in L2 when the learner is motivated and has a positive attitude.{{sfn|Hansen|1999|pp=3–10}}

== Classroom second-language acquisition ==
{{main article|Second-language acquisition classroom research}}

While considerable SLA research has been devoted to language learning in a natural setting, there have also been efforts made to investigate second-language acquisition in the classroom. This kind of research has a significant overlap with [[language education]], and it is mainly concerned with the effect that instruction has on the learner. It also explores what teachers do, the classroom context, the dynamics of classroom communication. It is both qualitative and quantitative research.

The research has been wide-ranging. There have been attempts made to systematically measure the effectiveness of language teaching practices for every level of language, from phonetics to pragmatics, and for almost every current teaching methodology. This research has indicated that many traditional language-teaching techniques are extremely inefficient.{{sfn|Lightbown|1990}} cited in {{Harvnb|Ellis|1994}} It is generally agreed that pedagogy restricted to teaching grammar rules and vocabulary lists does not give students the ability to use the L2 with accuracy and fluency.  Rather, to become proficient in the second language, the learner must be given opportunities to use it for communicative purposes.{{sfn|Doughty|Williams|1998}}{{sfn|Ellis|2002}}

Another area of research has been on the effects of corrective feedback in assisting learners. This has been shown to vary depending on the technique used to make the correction, and the overall focus of the classroom, whether on formal accuracy or on communication of meaningful content.{{sfn|Lightbown|Spada|1990}}{{sfn|Lyster|Ranta|1997}}{{sfn|Lyster|Mori|2006}} There is also considerable interest in supplementing published research with approaches that engage language teachers in action research on learner language in their own classrooms.{{sfn|Allwright|Hanks|2009}} As teachers become aware of the features of learner language produced by their students, they can refine their pedagogical intervention to maximize interlanguage development.{{sfn|Tarone|Swierzbin|2009}}

'''Sentinel species''' are [[organism]]s, often animals, used to detect risks to humans by providing advance warning of a danger. The terms primarily apply in the context of environmental hazards rather than those from other sources. Some animals can act as sentinels because they may be more susceptible or have greater exposure to a particular hazard than humans in the same environment.&lt;ref name="national research council"&gt;National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards, "Animals as Sentinels of Environmental Health Hazards: Committee on Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards," National Academy Press: 1991, {{ISBN|0309040469}}.&lt;/ref&gt; People have long observed animals for signs of impending hazards or evidence of environmental threats. Plants and other living organisms have also been used for these purposes.

== Historical examples ==
There are countless examples of environmental effects on animals that later manifested in humans. The classic example is the "[[domestic canary|canary]] in the [[Coal mining|coal mine]]". The idea of placing a [[Atlantic canary|canary]] or other warm blooded animal in a mine to detect [[carbon monoxide]] was first proposed by [[John Scott Haldane]], in 1913 or later.&lt;ref name=acott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=JS Haldane, JBS Haldane, L Hill, and A Siebe: A brief resume of their lives. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=3 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6016 |accessdate=2008-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boycott |first=A. E. |first2=G. C. C. |last2=Damant |first3=J. S. |last3=Haldane |title=Prevention of compressed air illness |journal=J. Hygiene |volume=8 |issue=03 |pages=342–443 |year=1908 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7489 |accessdate=2013-09-05 |doi=10.1017/S0022172400003399 |pmc=2167126 |pmid=20474365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{The Timetables of Science|pages=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well into the 20th century, coal miners brought canaries into coal mines as an early-warning signal for toxic gases, primarily [[carbon monoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;David A. Bengston, Diane S. Henshel, "Environmental Toxicology and Risk Assessment: Biomarkers and Risk Assessment", ASTM International, 1996, {{ISBN|0803120311}}, p 220.&lt;/ref&gt; The birds, being more sensitive, would become sick before the miners, who would then have a chance to escape or put on protective [[respirators]].

In [[Minamata Bay|Minamata Bay, Japan]], [[Domestic cat|cats]] developed "[[Minamata disease|dancing cat fever]]" before humans were [[Minamata disease|affected]] due to eating mercury-contaminated fish.&lt;ref name="withrow"&gt;Stephen J. Withrow, David M. Vail, ''Withrow and MacEwen's Small Animal Clinical Oncology'', Elsevier: 2007, {{ISBN|0721605583}}, p. 73-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were recognized as early as 1939 to be more susceptible to tonsil cancer if they were kept in crowded urban environments.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; Studies similarly found higher disease rates in animals exposed to tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="withrow" /&gt; [[Yushō disease]] was similarly discovered when poultry began dying at alarming rates due to [[polychlorinated biphenyl]] poisoning, although not before approximately 14,000 people were affected.

== Characteristics ==
Animal sentinels must have measurable responses to the hazard in question, whether that is due to the animal's death, disappearance, or some other determinable aspect.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Many of these species are ideally [[Endangered species|unendangered]] and easy to handle. It is important that the species' range overlap with the range being studied.&lt;ref name="bds" /&gt; Often the ideal species is determined by the characteristics of the hazard.

For example, [[honey bee]]s are susceptible to [[air pollution]].&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Similarly both [[bats]] and [[swallows]] have been used to monitor pesticide contamination due to their diet of insects that may have been affected by the chemicals.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} By the same token, aquatic animals, or their direct predators, are used as sentinel species to monitor [[water pollution]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Some species may show effects of a contaminant before humans due to their size, their reproductive rate, or their increased exposure to the contaminant.&lt;ref name="bds"&gt;Arthur D. Bloom, Frederick de Serres, ''Ecotoxicity and Human Health: A Biological Approach to Environmental Remediation'', CRC Press: 1995, {{ISBN|1566701414}}, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specific applications ==
[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at [[Sarin gas|Sarin nerve gas]] production plant.]]

=== Toxic gases ===
Canaries were iconically used in [[coal mines]] to detect the presence of [[carbon monoxide]]. The bird's rapid breathing rate, small size, and high metabolism, compared to the miners, led birds in dangerous mines to succumb before the miners, thereby giving them time to take action.

=== Air and water pollution ===
A number of animals have been used to measure varying kinds of air pollution. These include [[honey bee]]s for air pollution, [[bivalve molluscs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://molluscan-eye.epoc.u-bordeaux1.fr/index.php?rubrique=accueil&amp;lang=en]&lt;/ref&gt; for online water-quality survey and [[pigeon]]s for atmospheric lead.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}} Bats and swallows have been used to monitor pesticide contamination due to their diet of insects that may have been affected by the chemicals.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|35}}

Aquatic [[DDT]] pollution has been quantitatively measured in [[California]] fish. [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]] has been measured through the analysis of fish livers.&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|82}} [[Toxaphene]] concentrations were discovered far from the area of its use through analysis of [[trout]] in the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref name="national research council" /&gt;{{rp|85}} The evidence of atmospheric transport of the substance influenced the subsequent prohibition of its widespread use. [[Alligators]] may have been used to warn of hazardous contamination in [[Centreville, Mississippi]] retention ponds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Eugene Love Fair Jr. |publication-date=May 28, 2013 |title=Christmas v. Exxon Mobil |work= [[Mississippi Court of Appeals]] |url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ms-court-of-appeals/1632483.html |accessdate=January 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases ===
The discovery of [[West Nile virus]] in the Western Hemisphere was heralded by an outbreak of disease in crows and other wild birds. Other emerging diseases have demonstrated linkages between animal health events and human risk, including [[monkeypox]], [[SARS]], and [[avian influenza]]. In outbreaks of bubonic plague, rats begin dying out before humans.

=== Household toxins ===
[[Dog]]s may provide early warning of [[lead poisoning]] hazards in a home, and certain cancers in dogs and [[cat]]s have been linked to household exposures to [[pesticide]]s, [[cigarette]] smoke, and other carcinogens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12670">{{Sex differences}}

It is uncertain if there is a link between [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD) and [[sex]]. Males are more likely than females to be [[Diagnosis|diagnosed]] with autism, but there is some debate about whether [[Sex differences in autism#Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis|females are just underdiagnosed]], of if there really is a gender difference in autism [[Incidence (epidemiology)#Incidence rate|incidence rates]].

Several theories exist to explain the male-female sex based discrepancy, such as a [[Sex differences in autism#Female protective effect hypothesis|genetic protective effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Gockley, J., Willsey, a J., Dong, S., Dougherty, J.

==Summary==
Autism spectrum disorders are currently more commonly diagnosed in males, with a ratio of about 1 female for every 4 males diagnosed.&lt;ref&gt;Fombonne, E. (2009). Epidemiology of pervasive developmental disorders. Pediatric Research, 65(6), 591–598. http://doi.org/10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7203&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, one in every 189 females and one in 42 males in the United States is diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate=2014-04-18 |df= }} Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): Data &amp; Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that females may also receive diagnoses somewhat later than males, however thus far results have been contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Begeer, S., Mandell, D., Wijnker-Holmes, B., Venderbosch, S., Rem, D., Stekelenburg, F., &amp; Koot, H. M. (2013). Sex Differences in the Timing of Identification Among Children and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 43, 1151–1156. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-012-1656-z&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in presentation of [[Autism#Characteristics|autistic traits]] are widely supported within the [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism#Autistic culture and community|autistic community]], and gaining support in the professional field. [[Hans Asperger]] was one of the first people to study autism, yet all of his four students were male. Another early researcher, [[Leo Kanner]] described "autistic disturbances of affective contact" in the group consisting of eight boys and three girls.&lt;ref&gt;Kanner, L. (1943). Autistic disturbances of affective contact. Nervous Child, 2, 217-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Since biological differences exist between males and females, it follows that the presentation of autism would differ as well. Recent studies suggest this to be true, with evidence of increased incidence of [[social anxiety]],&lt;ref name="ludlow2015" /&gt; [[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]],&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S., Jaffa, T., Davies, S., Auyeung, B., Allison, C., &amp; Wheelwright, S. (2013). Do girls with anorexia nervosa have elevated autistic traits? Molecular Autism, 4(1), 24. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-4-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhind, C., Bonfioli, E., Hibbs, R., Goddard, E., Macdonald, P., Gowers, S., … Treasure, J. (2014). An examination of autism spectrum traits in adolescents with anorexia nervosa and their parents. Molecular Autism, 5(1), 56. http://doi.org/10.1186/2040-2392-5-56&lt;/ref&gt; and [[self-harm]] in autistic females.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, I. L., Tsiouris, J. A., Flory, M. J., Kim, S.-Y., Freedland, R., Heaney, G., … Brown, W. T. (2010). A Large Scale Study of the Psychometric Characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale: Findings and Evidence for Increased Self-Destructive Behaviors in Adult Females with Autism Spectrum Disorder. J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 599–609.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Female protective effect hypothesis==
According to the female protective effect hypothesis, more extreme genetic mutations are required for a girl to develop autism than for a boy. In 2012, [[Harvard University|Harvard]] researchers published findings suggesting that, on average, more genetic and environmental risk factors are required for girls to develop autism, compared to boys. The researchers analyzed DNA samples of nearly 800 families affected by autism and nearly 16,000 individuals with a variety of [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s. They looked for various types of [[Mutation|gene mutations]]. Overall, they found that females diagnosed with autism or another neurodevelopmental disorder had a greater number of harmful mutations throughout the [[genome]] than did males with the same disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Jacquemont, S., Coe, B., Hersch, M., Duyzend, M., Krumm, N., Bergmann, S., Beckmann, J., Rosenfeld, J., Eichler, E. (2014) A Higher Mutational Burden in Females Supports a “Female Protective Model” in Neurodevelopmental Disorders. The American Society of Human Genetics, http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(14)00059-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexuality and gender variance==
[[Sexuality]] is often discussed within the autistic community, with many observations that identities other than [[Cisgender|cis]]-[[Heterosexuality|hetero]] seem to be more common than is observed in the [[neurotypical]] population. There have not been many formal studies on this to date, however members of the community speculate that autistic individuals generally have different ideals, perceptions, and desires than neurotypicals, or simply do not comprehend or agree with society's expectation, making them more apt to diverge from the norm.

===Gender identity===
A study looking at the co-occurrence of ASD in patients with [[gender dysphoria]] found 7.8% of patients to be on the autism spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;De Vries, A. L. C., Noens, I. L. J., Cohen-Kettenis, P. T., van Berckelaer-Onnes, I. A., &amp; Doreleijers, T. A. (2010). Autism Spectrum Disorders in Gender Dysphoric Children and Adolescents. J Autism Dev Disord, 40, 930–936. http://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-010-0935-9&lt;/ref&gt; This is much higher than the estimated 1% of people with ASD in the general population, suggesting a link between autism and gender variance.

As of yet, there have been no studies specifically addressing the occurrence of autism in [[intersex]] individuals, and this is an area that requires further research.

=== Sexual satisfaction ===
A study conducted by Byers and Nichols (2014), explored the level of sexual satisfaction of [[High-functioning autism|high functioning autistic individuals]], with researchers testing the sexual and relationship satisfaction of neurotypical versus high functioning autistic individuals. The results suggest that men with ASD are generally less satisfied with their relationship or marriage compared to neurotypical men and women, and women with ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sexual Satisfaction of High-Functioning Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder|last = Byers|first = E|date = 2014|journal = Sexuality and Disability Sex|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypothesis of female underdiagnosis ==
Some authors, clinicians and experts like [[Judith Gould (psychologist)|Judith Gould]], [[Tony Attwood]], [[Lorna Wing]] and [[Christopher Gillberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autism.org.uk/about/what-is/gender.aspx |title=Gender and autism |publisher=The National Autistic Society |date= |accessdate=2016-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have proposed that autism in females may be underdiagnosed due to better natural superficial [[Imitation|social mimicry]] skills in females, partially different set of symptoms and less knowledge about autism in females among experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwood|first1=Tony|title=Asperger's and Girls|date=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1932565409|pages=2–6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Foreword|preword]] to the book ''Asperger's and Girls'', Tony Attwood writes: "These tentative explanations for the apparent underrepresentation of girls with Asperger's Syndrome have yet to be examined by objective research studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Attwood|first1=Tony|title=Asperger's and Girls|date=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|location=London|isbn=978-1932565409|page=6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically Judith Gould has discussed the idea that a pervasive developmental disorder called [[pathological demand avoidance]], which is not officially included in [[Psychiatry#Diagnostic manuals|diagnostic manuals]] may offer a glimpse about how autism in females may present in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://shiggs55.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/pda-conference-plenary-session-jacqui-smith-and-judy-gould.pdf |title=Missed Diagnosis or Misdiagnosis?

'''Si6''' is the [[codename]] of the ''Laboratorio de Investigación y Desarrollo en Seguridad Informática'' (Information Security Research and Development Laboratory) of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[CITEFA]] (''Instituto de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas de las Fuerzas Armadas'', [[Military of Argentina|Armed Forces]] Scientific and Technical Research Institute).

SI6 belongs to the Information Security Division of CITEFA's Information Technology Department.

==History==
The Si6 was created on January 2004 to analyze and provide the [[Ministry of Defense (Argentina)|Argentine Ministry of Defense]] with scientific and technical assistance on subjects related to [[computer security]].
Si6 creation was somehow hard to accomplish, mainly because it's very difficult to admit new workers into Argentina's Government. Finally it was possible thanks to the support and effort a lot people made.

==Goal==
Its mission is to create and direct [[information security]] R&amp;D activities for both general purpose and national defense areas.

==Philosophy==
Si6 believes that the sum of community efforts through applied research of innovative technologies is one of the most efficient ways to achieve technology knowledge. At the same time, Si6 think that improved education, specially on those areas, is a basic pillar of the society welfare. 

All Si6 public projects are published under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license. As part of this common knowledge exchange policy, CITEFA makes different agreements with public and private institutions in order to establish a national research and development network.

==Work==
SI6 is currently working on [[intruder detection]], [[intruder classification]], [[intruder identification]], [[honeypot (computing)|honeypot]]s, [[pattern analysis]], [[biometric authentication]], [[virtual private networks]], [[firewall (networking)|firewalls]], [[digital signature]], [[penetration test]]s, etc.

==Location==
Si6 is located at CITEFA headquarters, [[Buenos Aires]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8529">The '''Sydney Accord''' is an international mutual recognition agreement for qualifications in the fields of [[engineering technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ieagreements.org/sydney/| title=The Sydney Accord| publisher=International Engineering Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and background==
The Sydney Accord is an agreement between the bodies responsible for [[accredit]]ing engineering technologist qualification programs in each of the signatory countries. 
It recognizes the substantial [[equivalency]] of programs accredited by those bodies, and recommends that graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries be recognized by the other countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering technologist. The Sydney Accord was signed in 2001.

==Scope==
The Sydney Accord covers '''engineering technologist''' qualifications.

The scope of the Sydney Accord only covers the ''academic'' requirement for an engineering technologist qualification.  Engineering technologist titles do not transfer directly between signatory countries that don't have reciprocating agreements, because the signatory countries reserve the right to scrutinize foreign titles and compare them to their own licensing criteria. However, this does not mean the titles are not respected by employers within those signatory countries.

The engineering technologist may be hired within a country by an employer where a formal license is not required. The ''industrial exemption'' clause negates formal engineering registration within the United States for those who meet the criteria.

Foreign titles may be utilized as a foundation for recognition of professional licensing.  The titles can be supplemented with additional experience and/or training to meet the local definition of formal registration.  This serves to underline that a foreign technologist covered under the accord does not arrive in a fellow signatory country without merit.  The Sydney Accord is therefore not a hollow agreement without advantages.

==Accord Enhancements==
The [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT) and the United Kingdom's [[Institution of Incorporated Engineers]] (IIE) signed a reciprocating agreement of recognition for engineering technologist. In 2006, the IIE merged with the [[Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE) to form the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]] (IET). The CCTT also signed a reciprocating agreement with the [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET).  NICET is a United States organization sponsored by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE).  The formal recognition of the CCTT as a common link between NICET and the IET has not been realized.

===Canada===
Canada has signed the Sydney Accord with the title of "Applied Science" and "Engineering Technologist".

The Canadian signatory body is the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=CCTT| title=National and International Mobility| url=http://www.cctt.ca/template.asp?id=66BCF9F972D1468B9286F72D20549DE1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is different from the Canadian signatory of the [[Washington Accord]], [[Engineers Canada]].

In the case of all other Sydney Accord members, the same organization has signed both the Sydney Accord and the Washington Accord.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong originally signed the Sydney Accord with the title of "Science Technologist" and later abbreviated the title to "Technologist."

===United States===
The [[United States]] applied for recognition with the Sydney Accord in 2007 and was granted that status in 2009. Despite this achievement the United States still has significant confusion in defining a unified technologist registration for professionals. Part of the reason for this is that the engineering technology profession is not well defined as a separate profession (distinct from professional engineering) in the United States. This is because the NSPE has opposed legal registration of technologist by the United States government through a licensing program. The loss of government oversight has led to competing ideologies from societies with different perspectives on what represents the qualities of a technologist.

====Confusion====
Some legitimate societies and organizations that have established technology programs do not have clear representation in the accord. The [[Society of Manufacturing Engineers]] (SME), and the [[Society of Broadcast Engineers]] (SBE) are two organizations that have engineering technology and technician certifications that are respected and recognized but operate independently from the accord.  In addition to these societies there are legitimate accreditations that are unacknowledged.  They are the [[Distance Education and Training Council]] (DETC), the [[National Association of Industrial Technology]] (NAIT), the [[Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges of Technology]] (ACCSCT), or other non-[[ABET]]/TAC institutions that are exclusively regionally accredited.  It is unclear if these organizations or societies will eventually be represented by a formal avenue of recognition in the Sydney Accord.

As an international representative of the accord the UK offer a registration program for individuals from any country.  However, since the standards for technologist are higher in UK (B.Sc. and B.Eng. in Engineering) only 25 UK (emigrating) registrants up to this date applied for registration as "Technologist" indicating the failure of the Accord within UK.  In the UK the term "engineer", "professional engineer" or "engineering" have no meaning in law so anyone can call themselves a professional engineer, or technologist without restrictions. However the titles "Chartered Engineer", "Incorporated Engineer" and "Engineering Technician" awarded by The Engineering Council (UK) are protected by law. United States' graduates may apply for a peer review by the [[Engineering Council UK]] if they belong to one of the organizations or societies that are not explicitly mentioned as a member of the accord.  Individuals that graduate from a regionally accredited technology program are likely to receive acceptance through professional engineering registration as an Incorporated Engineer.

U.S. professional registration is a [[U.S. state|state]] concern. While the profession of engineering technologist is not specifically recognised, many states provide engineering technologists with a pathway towards ''Professional Engineer (PE)'' licensing that bypasses national engineering requirements. This is opposed by the national regulatory and representative bodies for professional engineers, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE). Notably, the Washington Accord does not apply to American PEs who have obtained this status through a technologist route.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">{{Anthropology |methods}}

In the social science fields of [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[religious studies]], [[human-centered design]] and organizational development, a '''thick description''' results from a scientific observation of any particular human behavior that describes not just the behavior, but its context as well, so that the behavior can be better understood by an outsider. A thick description typically adds a record of subjective explanations and meanings provided by the people engaged in the behaviors, making the collected data of greater value for studies by other social scientists.

The term was introduced by the 20th-century [[philosopher]] [[Gilbert Ryle]] (1900-1976).  [[Anthropologist]] [[Clifford Geertz]] later developed the concept in his ''[[The Interpretation of Cultures]]'' (1973) to characterise his own method of doing [[ethnography]] (Geertz 1973:5-6, 9-10). Since then, the term and the methodology it represents has gained currency in the [[social science]]s and beyond. Today, "thick description" is used in a variety of fields, including the type of [[literary criticism]] known as [[New Historicism]].

In his essay "Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Culture" (1973), Geertz explains that he adopted the term from philosopher [[Gilbert Ryle]], specifically his lecture "What is ''le Penseur'' doing?"

==Adoption==
Geertz's "thick description" approach has become increasingly recognized as a method of symbolic anthropology, enlisted as a working antidote to overly technocratic, mechanistic means of understanding cultures, organizations, and historical settings. 

Influenced by [[Gilbert Ryle]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Max Weber]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], and [[Alfred Schütz]], the method of descriptive ethnography that came to be associated with Geertz is credited with resuscitating field research from an endeavor of ongoing objectification—the focus of research being "out there"—to a more immediate undertaking, where participant observation embeds the researcher in the enactment of the settings being reported (For critique, see e.g. Munson 1986). 

Geertz is revered for his pioneering field methods and clear, accessible prose writing style (compare Robinson's [1983] critique). He was considered "for three decades...the single most influential cultural anthropologist in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Deirdre. "Thick and Thin Methodologies in the History of Economic Thought," in &lt;i&gt;The Popperian Legacy in Economics. Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1988. 245-57.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
He served until his death as professor emeritus at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Timbral listening''' is the process of actively listening to the [[timbre|timbral]] characteristics of sound.

==Concept==
In timbral listening, 'pitch is subordinate to timbre'.  Instead, the specific quality of a musical tone is determined by considering 'the presence, distribution and relative [[amplitude]] of [[overtones]].'&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

When using this listening technique/ method of perception / interpretation there is 'a relation between timbre and [[Harmonic series (music)|spectral]] content which is analogous to that between pitch and [[frequency]] in that one is the prevalent cultural construct of the other'&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p133-134&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common form of timbral listening is listening to [[speech]]. This is demonstrated by listening to, for example, the vowels /a/ and /i/ spoken at the same [[pitch accent|pitch]] and intensity. The difference between the two sounds is entirely one of spectrum, or as the term is used in this article, [[timbre]].

==Nature==

It has been suggested that "timbral listening is an ideal sonic mirror of the natural world".&lt;ref&gt;Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p58&lt;/ref&gt; It is often (but not always) used in association with musics that are based in [[mimicry]] of sounds in the natural environment. [[Valentina Suzukei]] suggests that 'it was the [[nomadic]] way of life and its focus on the timbral qualities of natural sounds that created this kind of musicality'.&lt;ref&gt;Süzükei, V., ''Listening The Tuvan Way'' in Levin, T., ''Where Rivers and Mountains Sing, Sound, Music and Nomadism in Tuva and Beyond'' (Bloomington: Indiana University press, 2006) p51.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially prevalent in Canada where composers such as [[Hildegard Westerkamp]] apply the thinking of [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s World [[Soundscape]] Project to their compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, L., 'The Something to Hold on to Factor in Timbral Composition', "Contemporary Music Review" 10:2 (1994): 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptive language and notation==

As timbre has 'no domain-specific adjectives' it 'must be described in metaphor or by analogy to other senses',&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; This method also has limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, S., "Timbre Composition: Ideology, Metaphor and Social Process", Contemporary Music Review, 10:2 (1994), p131, 134&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

*Traditional music in [[Tuva]] and other Turkic cultures of inner Asia
The composition of timbre-centered music in the nomadic communities of Tuva involves mimicry of sounds heard in the environment. Timbral listening is a fundamental component of listening to, understanding and being able to correctly perform this music using vocal techniques such as [[Overtone singing|throat singing]] "khoomei" and harmonic producing instruments such as the [[jaw harp]], bzaanchy, shoor, qyl qiyak, qyl-gobyz, ku-rai and [[igil]].

*[[Burundi|Barundi]] whispered [[Inanga (instrument)|Inanga]] or ''Inanga Chucotée'' in Africa
This music employs a fundamental [[Drone (music)|drone]] and overtone harmonics. It consists of "a whispered text, accompanied by the ''inanga'', a trough [[zither]] of eight strings. To listen correctly (using timbral listening), one must consider "the effect of the combined timbres of the noisy whisper and the inanga" as a whole sound.&lt;ref&gt;Fales, C., "The Paradox of Timbre", Ethnomusicology, 46:1 (Winter, 2002), 56&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some forms of contemporary electronic music
More recently, computers and [[synthesizers]] are being used by contemporary composers to produce timbral-centered music. Contemporary composers state timbral listening as the correct technique to adopt in listening to and analysing their timbre (as opposed to pitch) based compositions. 'Pure timbres' are explored using methods such as [[granular synthesis]] in works such as ''Dragon of the Nebula'' by [[Mara Helmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth, M., "Timbral Composition and Gesture" Columbia University Music Department, available at {{cite web |url=http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20020121195155/http://meowing.memh.uc.edu/~mara/papers/TimbralCompGest.Greece92.html |archivedate=2002-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Shakuhachi]] music in Japan
The music produced by the Shakuhachi end blown flute such as [[honkyoku]], contains timbral variations that are of equal importance to pitch variations. These timbral variations are indicated in [[Shakuhachi musical notation]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Donald Paul (Autumn, 1969). "The Shakuhachi and the Kinko Ryu Notation". Asian Music 1 (2): 32–72. Springer. {{doi|10.2307/833910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==

The technique of timbral listening is used by sound engineers to evaluate timbre difference.&lt;ref&gt;Quesnel, R., "Timbral Ear Trainer: Adaptive, Interactive Training of Listening Skills for Evaluation of Timbre Differences", paper presented at the 100th Audio Engineering Society Convention, Copenhagen, May 11th–14th, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tissue residue''' is the concentration of a chemical or compound in an organism’s tissue, or a portion of an organism’s tissue.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"&gt;McCarty, L. and D. MacKay. 1993. Enhancing ecotoxicological modeling and assessment. Environmental Science and Technology 27 (9): 1719-1728.&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue residue is used in [[aquatic toxicology]] to help determine the fate of chemicals in aquatic systems, [[bioaccumulation]] of a substance, [[bioavailability]] of a substance, account for multiple routes of exposure (ingestion, absorption, inhalation), and address an organism’s exposure to chemical mixtures.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based"&gt;Tissue-Based Criteria for “Bioaccumulative” Chemicals.http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/2008/october/aquatic_life_criteria_guidelines_tissue_08_26_05.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A Tissue residue approach to toxicity testing is considered a more direct and less variable measure of chemical exposure and is less dependent on external environmental factors than measuring the concentration of a chemical in the exposure media.&lt;ref name="McElroy"&gt;McElroy, A.E., M.G. Barron, N. Beckvar, S.B. K. Driscoll, J.P. Meador, T.F. Parkerton, T.G. Preuss, and J.A. Steevens. 2011. A review of the tissue residue approach for organic and organometallic compounds in aquatic organisms. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 50-74.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.132/abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, tissue residue approaches are used for chemicals that bioaccumulate or for bioaccumulative chemicals.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; The majority of these substances are [[organic compounds]] that are not easily metabolized by organisms and have long environmental persistence. Examples of these chemicals include: [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]], [[furans]], [[biphenyl]]s, [[DDT]] and its [[metabolites]], and [[dieldrin]].&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt;

The use of tissue residues in assessing toxicity and bioaccumulation may also be referred to as the tissue residue-effects approach (TRA), critical body residue (CBR) or tissue residue-based toxicity tests.&lt;ref name="McCarty93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meador"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meador|first1=J.P.|title=The Tissue Residue Approach for Toxicity Assessment: Findings and Critical Reviews from a Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry Pellston Workshop|journal=Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management|date=2011|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2–6|doi=10.1002/ieam.133|pmid=21184566|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.133/abstract|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Historically, [[aquatic toxicology]] toxicity tests have focused on water-based approaches where concentration of a [[toxicant]] is determined by its concentration in the water.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; Although tissue residue use and concepts have existed for over 100 years due to interest in narcosis and anesthesia, it was not widely used in toxicology.&lt;ref name="McCarty11" /&gt; The first known study of tissue residue in environmental toxicology was reported in 1912 by White and Thomas who investigated the effects of copper exposure to fish using whole-body copper concentrations.&lt;ref name="McCarty11"&gt;McCarty, L.S., P.F. Landrum, S.N. Luoma, J.P. Meador, A.A. Merten, B.K. Shephard and A.P. van Wezel. 2011. Advancing environmental toxicology through chemical dosimetry: External exposures versus tissue residues. Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management 7 (1): 7-27.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ieam.98/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s, there has been rapid growth in the tissue residue approach to toxicology.&lt;ref name="McCarty11" /&gt; The water-based approach has been re-evaluated due to challenges in assessing the [[toxicity]] of bioaccumulating chemicals.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; Water-based approaches are not always an accurate estimation of the concentration of a bioaccumulating chemical in an organism, nor does the water-based approach incorporate the multiple routes of exposure of an organism to a toxicant and the additive effects across these routes.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt;

== Advantages ==

The use of tissue residue allows an investigator to: account for multiple routes of exposure, account for [[toxicokinetic]] differences between species, account for factors that alter bioavailability and potentially address exposure of an organism to a chemical mixture.&lt;ref name="McCarty93" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvinen"&gt;Jarvinen, A.W., D.R. Mount and G.T. Ankley. Development of Tissue Residue Threshold Valueshttp://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/mount.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCartyEPA"&gt;McCarty, L.S. Comments on the Significance and Use of Tissue Residues in Sediment Toxicology and Risk Assessment.http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/mccarty.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue residue also has the ability to represent temporal and spatial exposure or an organism,&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field"&gt;Field, L.J. Use of Tissue Residue Data in Exposure and Effects Assessments for Aquatic Organisms.http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/sediments/cs/upload/field.pdf U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as clarify the cause-effect relationship of chemicals. These relationships are often distorted by uncertainty in chemical bioavailability.&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt; The mechanism of action for a chemical depends on the internal tissue concentration, thus tissue residue gives researchers a more direct estimate of the residue-effect (dose-response) relationship.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyer"&gt;Dyer, S., St J. Warne, J.S. Meyer, H. A. Leslie, and B.I. Escher. 2011. Tissue residue approach for chemical mixtures. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 99-115.&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue residue is also less variable than other measures of chemical exposure.&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Field" /&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned advantages of tissue residue use, the U.S. EPA also states that this approach explicitly considers exposure through diet, will support identification and investigation of a chemical’s mode of action, incorporate the effects of an organism’s metabolism on accumulation and allow for experimental verification between lab and field studies.&lt;ref name="Jarvinen" /&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

The majority of issues with tissue residue arise in the interpretation of tissue residue data.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Interpretation complication can be caused by choice of endpoints, species choice, life stage sensitivity, data quality, and toxicity data extrapolation.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Choice of tissue for tissue residue analysis can also be difficult and has an effect on tissue residue data. When choosing tissue, a scientist needs to consider: mode and mechanism of action of chemical being tested, site of toxic action for the chemical and species combination being studied and strength of the tissue residue-response relationship. There is also a lack of reliable tissue residue relationships available for comparison.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;

Although use of tissue residue can account for multiple routes of exposure, it cannot identify the routes of exposure. Tissue residue also cannot account for [[biotransformation]] of organic chemicals.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt; If a chemical is biotransformed, the concentration of the parent chemical is lower, but the [[metabolites]] may still be toxic.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Tissue residue approaches are not as useful for chemicals with short half-lives because an organism will only be sporadically exposed.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"/&gt; Overall, tissue residue is meant to compliment data from water-based approaches, not replace them.&lt;ref name="Meador"/&gt;

== Use in regulation ==

=== North America ===

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has incorporated tissue residue through the development of the [[Biotic Ligand Model]] as well as water quality standards for copper. USEPA has also recently published draft aquatic life criteria for selenium using a tissue-based approach. USEPA is currently working on incorporating tissue residue into standards for bioaccumulating chemicals, which are usually hydrophobic with a log octanol-water [[partition coefficient]] greater than 5 (log Kow&gt;5).&lt;ref name="Tissue-based" /&gt; Canada uses tissue residue formally in guidelines called tissue residue guidelines (TRGs), which are primarily used for protecting wildlife that consume aquatic life.&lt;ref name="Canada2"&gt;Canada Environmental Quality Guidelines. 1998. http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/download/en/290/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;Canada Environmental Quality Guidelines. 1999. http://ceqg-rcqe.ccme.ca/download/en/314/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===

There is a lack of formal use of tissue residue in Europe.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

Australia and New Zealand both use tissue residue-based approaches for [[biomonitoring]] programs for mussels and oysters.

=== Available databases ===

There are two comprehensive aquatic toxicology databases[[Aquatic Toxicology Databases]] available for tissue residue in the United States. The first is the [[Aquatic Toxicology Databases#Toxicity/Residue Database|Toxicity Residue Database]] maintained by the USEPA.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; The second is the Environmental residue-effects database [[Aquatic Toxicology Databases#Environmental Residue Effects Database|(ERED)]] maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt; Currently, the majority of the data available is derived from acute lethal response studies.&lt;ref name="McElroy"/&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Metals ===

Tissue residue of metals in invertebrate prey organisms may reduce uncertainty in estimating exposure from multiple routes.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; This may be especially important in early life stages of an organism or for species listed under the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA).&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; However, it is challenging to develop a suitable approach to assessing metal toxicity through tissue residue because water quality can have a large influence on metal toxicity. With the exception of [[organometallic compounds]], no generalized approaches have been created for analyzing metals in tissue residue, although site-specific and species-specific approaches have been successfully developed and used, especially for invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;Adams, W. J., R. Blust, U. Borgmann, K. V. Brix, D. K. DeForest, A. S. Green, J. S. Meyer, J. C. McGeer, P. R. Paquin, P. S. Rainbow and C. M. Wood. 2010. Utility of tissue residues for predicting effects of metals on aquatic organisms. Integrated environmental assessment and management 7 (1): 75-98.&lt;/ref&gt; A recent paper examined tissue-residue toxicity for copper and cadmium in fish and found low variability among species for both metals compared to aqueous-exposure toxicity metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meador|first1=J.P.|title=Tissue concentrations as the dose metric to assess potential toxic effects of metals in field-collected fish: Copper and cadmium|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|date=2015|volume=34|issue=6|pages=1309–1319|doi=10.1002/etc.2910|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.2910/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These results indicate that whole-body concentrations of metals in fish may be useful for Environmental Quality Guidelines, forensic evaluation, and ecological risk assessment.  An additional benefit includes the potential to characterize a contaminated ecosystem based on elevated whole-body metal concentrations resulting from acclimation.

=== PAHs (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) ===

Fish are able to quickly metabolize and eliminate [[PAHs]], therefore tissue residue of parent PAH compounds will not provide adequate information on exposure to the organism.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; PAH exposure in fish has been associated with reproductive impairment, immune deficiency, and liver lesions as well as other health problems.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; In contrast, invertebrates do not metabolize and excrete PAHs as efficiently as fish, therefore an investigator can better understand location and temporal patterns of bioavailable PAHs through tissue residue of these invertebrates.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

=== PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) ===

Unlike PAHs, tissue residue of [[PCBs]] for fish can provide reliable information on exposure and toxicity.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; The tissue residue of PCBs in fish can provide vital information in an [[exposure assessment]] because fish generally receive PCBs through exposure via the food web. There are currently two screening approaches for PCBs in fish based on PCB body burdens.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

=== In-situ ===

Both the United States and United Kingdom have mussel watch monitoring programs. Although these programs differ in many ways, both use tissue residues to establish biological effects, such as survival and body condition, of chemicals present. In contrast to the passive nature of the mussel watch monitoring programs, tissue residue has also been applied in [[in-situ]] bioassays in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.

=== Superfund sites ===

Tissue residue guidelines were developed for [[tributyltin]] (TBT) for the Harbor Island Superfund site, Lower Duwamish Superfund site and the Portland Harbor Superfund site. At the Harbor Island Superfund site, tissue trigger levels were developed to provide guidance on remediation action.&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt; Tissue residue toxicity reference value (TRV) was developed for TBT regarding mortality and growth at the Lower Duwamish Superfund site. Tissue residue TRVs were also developed for TBT, as well as many other chemicals, for use in the Portland Harbor Superfund site work.&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt;

=== Ecological risk assessment ===

Ecological [[risk assessment]] aims to source of contamination to exposure to a toxicity endpoint.&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt; This requires a risk assessor to identify and estimate exposure pathways.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; Tissue residue is the only approach that inherently accounts for toxicity due to multiple exposure pathways.&lt;ref name="McCarty93"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jarvinen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCartyEPA"/&gt; There is also a need in risk assessment to understand the [[bioaccumulation]] of chemicals4, as well as a direct estimation of [[bioavailability]].&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; Modeling food web exposure is difficult in risk assessment and requires many assumptions but this uncertainty can be reduced through tissue residue.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt; Tissue residue may also allow provide a link between ecological risk assessment and human health risk assessment.&lt;ref name="McCarty11"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sappington"/&gt;

The issues with using tissue residue in risk assessment are similar to the disadvantages listed above.&lt;ref name ="Sappington"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sappington|first1=K.G.|title=Application of the tissue residue approach in ecological risk assessment|journal=Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management|date=2011|volume=7|pages=116–140|doi=10.1002/ieam.116|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''triptych''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|p|t|ɪ|k}} {{respell|TRIP|tik}}; from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''τρίπτυχον'' "''triptukhon''" ("three-fold"), from ''tri'', i.e., "three" and ''ptysso'', i.e., "to fold" or ''ptyx'', i.e., "fold")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=triptych|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=triptych&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|tri/ptuxos|τρίπτυχον|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a work of [[art]] (usually a [[panel painting]]) that is divided into three sections, or three [[Wood carving|carved]] panels that are hinged together and can be folded shut or displayed open. It is therefore a type of [[polyptych]], the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for [[pendant]] jewelry.

Despite its connection to an art format, the term is sometimes used more generally to connote anything with three parts, particularly if they are integrated into a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triptych |title=Triptych |quote=Although triptych originally described a specific type of Roman writing tablet that had three hinged sections, it is not surprising that the idea was generalized first to a type of painting, and then to anything composed of three parts. |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
[[File:Verdun Altar.JPG|thumb|The Verdun Altar in [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]]]]
The triptych form arises from early Christian art, and was a popular standard format for altar paintings from the Middle Ages onwards. Its geographical range was from the eastern [[Byzantine]] churches to the Celtic churches in the west. During the Byzantine period, tryptichs were often used for private devotional use, along with other relics such as icons.&lt;ref&gt;2014. ''History of the World in 1,000 Objects.''London, New York. [[Dorling Kindersley|D.K. Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;Renaissance painters such as [[Hans Memling]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] used the form. Sculptors also used it. Triptych forms also allow ease of transport.

From the [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] period onward, both in Europe and elsewhere, altarpieces in churches and cathedrals were often in triptych form. One such cathedral with an altarpiece triptych is [[Llandaff Cathedral]]. The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], Belgium, contains two examples by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Notre Dame de Paris]] is another example of the use of triptych in architecture. One can also see the form echoed by the structure of many ecclesiastical [[stained glass window]]s. Although strongly identified as an [[altarpiece]] form, triptychs outside that context have been created, some of the best-known examples being works by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Max Beckmann]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].

The then highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction was $142.4 million for a 1969 triptych, ''[[Three Studies of Lucian Freud]]'', by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Bacon's Study of Freud Sells for $142.4 Million|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 12, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/arts/design/bacons-study-of-freud-sells-for-more-than-142-million.html|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record was broken in May 2015 by $179.4 million for [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1955 painting ''[[Les Femmes d’Alger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://digg.com/2015/modigliani-nu-couche-140-million A History Of Insane Art Prices] Digg.com Retrieved 16 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has migrated and been used in other religions, including [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]]. For example: the triptych ''Hilje-j-Sherif'' displayed at the [[National Museum of Oriental Art]], Rome, Italy, and a page of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum|Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts]] in Istanbul, Turkey, exemplify [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] religious art adapting the motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Museum With No Frontiers]] |publisher=Museum With No Frontiers, Arab Institute for Research and Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA3dSlLBG38C&amp;pg=PA258&amp;lpg=PA258&amp;dq=islamic+triptych&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCWXu3Zrse&amp;sig=Hm07LC4FwEbcecVNBxv6KRSBkvQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiD0ufi2eTRAhVB7YMKHSkICIgQ6AEIODAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20triptych&amp;f=false |location=Brussels, Belgium, Beirut, Lebanon |year=2007 |title=Discover Islamic Art in the Mediterranean |page=258 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Tibetan Buddhists have used it in traditional altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Tibetan-Buddhist-Altars-Gallery-Traditional/dp/1577314670/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1577314670&amp;pd_rd_r=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK&amp;pd_rd_w=jTPLw&amp;pd_rd_wg=Y0eb9&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK |title=Tibetan Buddhist Altars: A Pop-Up Gallery of Traditional Art and Wisdom |type=Hardcover |first1=Tad |last1=Wise |first2=Robert |last2=Beers |first3=David A. |last3=Carter |publisher=[[New World Library]]  |date=August 25, 2004 |ISBN=978-1577314677 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Universidad de la Sierra Juárez''' '''(UNSIJ)''' is a [[university]] located in the town of [[Ixtlán de Juárez]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Oaxaca]].  It is part of the State University System of Oaxaca (SUNEO) and is public institution of [[higher education]] and scientific research.  The university is funded by the Oaxaca State Government and the Mexican Federal Government.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsij.edu.mx/nuestrauniversidad.html|title=UNSIJ: About our University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Placa de Universidad de la Sierra Juárez Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Commemorative plaque|Plaque]] commemorating the establishment of the University.]]

===Ixtlán de Juárez===
The town of Ixtlán de Juárez existed before the [[Spanish Conquest of Mexico]].  It is thought to have been founded in the latter half of the 15th century, by [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] people from the region around [[Tarabundi]] and [[San Pedro Laduu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdi.gob.mx/planes_desarrollo/oaxaca/05_ixtlan_de_juarez.pdf |title=Ixtlán de Juárez: Plan for integrated, sustainable and pluricultural development |access-date=2009-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217091721/http://www.cdi.gob.mx/planes_desarrollo/oaxaca/05_ixtlan_de_juarez.pdf |archive-date=2012-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; (though there are also [[neolithic]] remains in the area).&lt;ref&gt;Entry for Ixtlán de Juárez in the Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The first settlers were probably warriors establishing a defensive outpost against [[Aztec]] invaders.  In 1859 Ixtlán was the site of a battle during the [[Reform War]] between liberal and conservative forces.  Some of the other communities in the municipality are probably several centuries older than the town of Ixtlán &lt;ref&gt;Jaffee, op. cit., p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===University establishment===
As a rural mountainous region, higher education had previously not been available.  In April 2005 the government of the state of Oaxaca established the Universidad de la Sierra Juarez to help further the development and education of citizens in the [[Sierra Madre de Oaxaca|Sierra Norte]] region.  Currently the university offers degrees in the fields of [[forestry]], [[computer science]], [[environmental science]], [[biology]] and natural resource technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unsij.edu.mx/ensenanza.html#oferta UNSIJ: Educational offerings]&lt;/ref&gt;    UNSIJ also encourages four core academic activities among its students, including: teaching, research, cultural enrichment, and promotion of regional development.&lt;ref name="University"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unsij.edu.mx/nuestrauniversidad.html|title=Universidad de la Sierra Juárez:¿Qué es la UNSIJ?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of New Brunswick''' ('''UNB''') is a [[public university]] with two primary campuses in [[Fredericton]] and [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], [[New Brunswick]]. It is the oldest English-language university in Canada, and among the oldest public universities in North America.&lt;ref name = facts&gt;University of New Brunswick [https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/quickfacts.html]. Retrieved on: August 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; UNB was founded by a group of seven [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who left the United States after the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Happy Birthday to the University of New Brunswick"&gt;[http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2010/09/23/canadas-oldest-english-university/ Happy Birthday to the University of New Brunswick].

UNB has two main campuses: the original campus, founded in 1785 in [[Fredericton]], and a smaller campus which opened in [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] in 1964. In addition, there are two small satellite health sciences campuses located in [[Moncton]] and [[Bathurst, New Brunswick]], and two offices in the [[Caribbean]] and in [[Beijing]]. UNB offers over 75 degrees in fourteen faculties at the [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate student|graduate]] levels with a total student enrollment of approximately 11,400 between the two principal campuses.&lt;ref name="UNB Quick Facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNB Quick Facts|url=https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/quickfacts.html|publisher=University of New Brunswick|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNB was named the most entrepreneurial university in Canada at the 2014 Startup Canada Awards.&lt;ref name="UNB Newsroom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.unb.ca/newsroom/2014/06/12/unb-named-most-entrepreneurial-university-in-canada/|title=UNB Newsroom|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Founding and charters===
In 1783, [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] settlers began to build upon the ruins of a former [[Acadian]] village called Ste-Anne-des-Pays-Bas. The new settlement was named Frederick's Town in honour of [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Prince Frederick]], son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and uncle of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="Fredericton"&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/literary-tour/027020-2020-e.html "Fredericton"]. ''Collections Canada''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially modelled on the [[Anglican]] ideals of older, European institutions, the University of New Brunswick was founded in 1785 as the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref name="CanEncyc"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kernaghan| first = Lois| title = University of New Brunswick| work = The Canadian Encyclopedia| accessdate = 2014-10-05| date = 2013-12-16| url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university-of-new-brunswick/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150911115746/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/university-of-new-brunswick/| archivedate = 2015-09-11| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition requesting the establishment of the school, titled "The Founders' Petition of 1785," was addressed to Governor [[Thomas Carleton]] and was signed by seven [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] men: [[William Paine (physician)|William Paine]], [[William Wanton]], [[George Sproule]], [[Zephaniah Kingsley Sr.|Zephaniah Kingsley, Sr.]], [[John Coffin (judge)|John Coffin]], [[Ward Chipman]], and [[Adino Paddock]].&lt;ref name="The Founders' Petition of 1785"&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/225/petition.html "The Founders' Petition of 1785"].

[[File:UNB Old Arts Building.jpg|left|thumb|319x319px|The Old Arts Building on the Fredericton campus is the oldest university building in the country that is still in regular use for school operations.]]

By an 1800 provincial charter, signed by [[Jonathan Odell]], the Academy of Liberal Arts and Sciences became the College of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="Historical Sketch of UNB"&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/history/historicalsketch.html "Historical Sketch of UNB"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414183443/http://www.unb.ca/aboutunb/history/historicalsketch.html |date=2015-04-14 }}. ''About UNB''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The College was succeeded by King's College, which was granted by royal charter in December 1827. King's College operated under the control of the [[Church of England]] until 1859, when it was made non-sectarian by an act of the provincial legislature that transformed the College into the University of New Brunswick.&lt;ref name="UNB's Heraldic Tapestries"&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/225/tapestries.html "UNB's Heraldic Tapestries"]. ''UNB Libraries''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, Mary Kingsley Tibbits became the first regularly admitted female student of UNB.

===20th/21st centuries===
In 1906, UNB established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors exercising exclusive control over financial policy and other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to provide institutional leadership. By 1867, the University of New Brunswick had two faculties: Arts and Applied Science. It awarded the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Bachelor of Science]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Science]]. The latter was awarded only in the fields of [[civil engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[forestry]]. At this time, the university had 156 male students, 21 female students, and only eleven academic staff, who were all male.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, University policies changed in response to social pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. In 1964, a second, smaller campus was established in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. The growth of the UNBSJ campus is particularly notable, for the campus began with only 96 students spread throughout various buildings in Saint John's central business district. In 1968, UNBSJ moved to its new home at Tucker Park.

The [[Association of University of New Brunswick Teachers]] (AUNBT) was established in 1954; in 1979, this association became the bargaining agent for all full-time academic staff, and in 2008, it achieved certification for contract academic staff.

====Relocation of the Faculty of Law====
[[File:UNBSJ.jpg|thumb|311x311px|View from the UNB Saint John campus]]
{{Main|University of New Brunswick Faculty of Law}}
In 1959, the Faculty of Law moved from Saint John to Fredericton following a report on the status of legal education in Canada by Professor Maxwell Cohen from [[McGill University]]. In his report, Cohen stated that the Saint John Law School was only "nominally a faculty of UNB". This prompted [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], as Chancellor, and UNB President [[Colin B. Mackay]], to permanently move the Saint John Law School to the UNB Fredericton campus, despite the Dean's objections.

====Polytechnic controversy====
In the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended that UNBSJ and the [[New Brunswick Community College]] be reformed and consolidated into a new [[institute of technology|polytechnic]] post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the several organized protests. Under heavy fire from the public, the [[Shawn Graham|Graham government]] eventually announced that it would set aside the possibility of UNB Saint John losing its status as a university and would refer the report to a working group for further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2007/10/17/university-report.html | work=CBC News | title=UNB Saint John will remain a university, says minister | date=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government would go on to announce in January that UNBSJ would retain its liberal arts program and its association with UNB&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnb.ca/cnb/news/pre/2008e0119pr.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the working group reported back to government in May, with its findings and government's response being made public in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2008/06/13/nb-post-sec-report.html | work=CBC News | title=Post-secondary education report will be released within days: minister | date=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==
Currently UNBF has approximately 9,000 students while UNBSJ has 3,000. Though UNBF has more students at the moment, UNSBT is growing at a faster rate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Both campuses have undergone significant expansion over the years, and many University buildings have received funding from Lord Beaverbrook and other prominent industrialists and philanthropists. UNB's largest expansion coincided with the [[Post–World War II baby boom|baby boom]], when its Fredericton campus tripled in size.

[[File:Sir Max Aitken.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] served as Chancellor of the University of New Brunswick and became the university's greatest benefactor.]]

===Fredericton===
The UNB Fredericton campus is located on a hill overlooking the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]]. The campus is well known for its colourful fall foliage, Georgian style red-brick buildings, and a very steep hill.{{cn|date=August 2018}} UNB Fredericton has shared the "College Hill" with [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]] (STU) since 1964, when the former St. Thomas College moved from Chatham, NB (now [[Miramichi, New Brunswick|Miramichi]]). While the universities share some infrastructure, they remain separate institutions.

====Architecture====
Architect [[G. Ernest Fairweather]] designed several of the campus buildings, including the Old Civil Engineering Building (1900) and the Gymnasium (1906).&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1283 Biographic Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800–1950 [[G. Ernest Fairweather]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several of the stained glass windows in the Convocation Hall were created by [[Robert McCausland Limited]].

UNBF's War Memorial Hall (usually referred to as Memorial Hall), originally built as a science building in 1924, honours the 35 UNB Alumni who died in [[World War I]].

UNBF's Brigadier Milton F. Gregg, V.C., Centre for the Study of War and Society (usually referred to as The Gregg Centre) was created in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8513{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Gregg Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The Richard J. Currie Center, a five-storey 139,000-square-foot building, was constructed in 2013.&lt;ref name="University of New Brunswick"/&gt;

====National Historic Sites====
Two buildings on the Fredericton campus have been designated [[National Historic Sites of Canada]]: the 1827 [[Sir Howard Douglas Hall]] (the Old Arts Building), and the 1851 [[William Brydone Jack Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|7369|Arts Building|3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|9981|William Brydone Jack Observatory|3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint John===
The UNB Saint John campus (UNBSJ) is located in Tucker Park in the [[Millidgeville, New Brunswick|Millidgeville]] neighbourhood, several kilometres north of the city's central business district, and has views of the Kennebecasis River and Grand Bay. New Brunswick's largest health care facility, [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], is located adjacent to the UNBSJ campus. Since 2010, the UNBSJ campus has been home to Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick, a medical school that operates as a partnership between the [[Government of New Brunswick]], the University of New Brunswick and [[Dalhousie University|Dalhousie]]’s Faculty of Medicine.

The Saint John campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed between the 1970s and the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students.
[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|303x303px|The Hans W. Klohn Commons at UNB Saint John]]

Notable{{cn|date=August 2018}} differences from its parent campus in Fredericton lay in the campus culture. While UNB Fredericton has a substantial number of students living in its on-campus residences, this is not the case for UNBSJ. The majority of students do not live within walking distance of the campus due to its remote location, so unlike Fredericton, Saint John is predominantly a "commuter campus".

====Architecture====
April 1, 2010, the construction on the Hans W. Klohn Commons began. This building is one of the most environmentally friendly buildings in Atlantic Canada.&lt;ref name="A smarter, greener library"&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/excellence/commons.html "A smarter, greener library"]. ''UNB Excellence''. Retrieved 2012-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The building features an electric elevator that produces power for the commons. The building is part of the Tucker Park enhancement project, which will include the refurbishment of the Canada Games Stadium, the new Dalhousie Medicine New Brunswick facility, and the New Brunswick Community College’s Allied Health building.

===Sustainability===
The University of New Brunswick has attempted to reduce its environmental impact through installing a natural gas burning microturbine at the Central Heating Plant that produces 100&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity for the university.&lt;ref name=" Campus Sustainability Projects"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2009-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heat energy, a result of this process, is used to contribute to the overall heating of the campus to increase its overall energy efficiency.  In addition, all produce and dairy products used within its dining services are obtained from local farmers and local producers; the campus offers grass-fed beef, [[fair trade coffee]], and dining locations offer biodegradable to-go containers. UNB recycles electronics in addition to traditional materials and operates a move-out materials collection program. The university adheres to a green purchasing policy and has reduced greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent since 1990; they have also decreased water consumption since 2005 through the adoption of new technologies. With these efforts to create a more sustainable campus, the University of New Brunswick received an overall "B+" grade in the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card put out by the Sustainable Endowment’s Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Report Card 2011|url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2011/schools/university-of-new-brunswick|publisher= Sustainable Endowments Institute|accessdate=February 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poets' Corner====
Because so many of UNB's students, alumni, and professors have produced celebrated poetry, the city of Fredericton has earned the nickname "Poets' Corner." Two of Canada's four [[Confederation Poets]] – [[Charles G. D. Roberts|Sir Charles G.D. Roberts]] and [[Bliss Carman]] – were educated at UNB, as was [[Francis Joseph Sherman]], along with a number of notable 20th- and 21st-century Canadian writers. In 1947, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada unveiled a "Poet's Corner" monument in honour of Carman, Roberts, and Sherman.&lt;ref name="Poets' Corner of Canada"&gt;[http://lib.unb.ca/225/poetscorner.html "Poets' Corner"].

===Institute of Biomedical Engineering===
The Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) on the Fredericton campus is one of the research institutes in biomedical engineering in Canada. It was founded in 1965 as the Bio-Engineering Institute, making it one of the oldest research institutes to be solely dedicated to the field of biomedical engineering. The institute is also the region's prosthetic fitting centre where amputees are fitted with "intelligent" artificial limbs. The institute also carries out research in the field of myoelectric signal processing, biomedical instrumentation and human [[motion analysis]]. The IBME also developed the UNB Test of Prosthetic Function which is used by researchers all over the world. Although the institute does not offer degrees in biomedical engineering, students at UNB usually enroll in one of the other faculties of engineering such as electrical or mechanical and pursue their research in biomedical engineering at the IBME.

===Canadian Rivers Institute===
{{Main|Canadian Rivers Institute}}
The Canadian Rivers Institute was founded in 2000 and is a site of [[river]] sciences research. The mandate of the CRI is to conduct both multi-disciplinary basic and applied research focusing on rivers from their [[headwaters]] to their [[estuaries]], to promote the conservation, protection and sustainable use of water, and to educate professionals, graduate students and the public on water sciences.  Members of the CRI conduct research on regional, national and international issues related to rivers and their land-water linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.unb.ca/cri/documents/CRI_Annual_Report_2005.pdf | title=CRI Annual Report | date=2007-08-01 | accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With researchers from both UNB campuses, the CRI develops the aquatic science needed to understand, protect and sustain water resources. Since 2013, the CRI and its partners have been working with NB Power to research the potential environmental impacts of the future options being considered for the Mactaquac Generating Station. The Mactaquac Dam on the Saint John River will reach the end of its lifespan by 2030, and CRI has been evaluating key environmental challenges such as river health, fish passage and flow management. In 2015, CRI was given an additional $2.8 million from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to conduct an aquatic ecosystem study on the Saint John River.

===Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Institute===
UNB created its BEd program for [[First Nations]] students in 1977 in an effort to help First Nations communities take control of their own schools. In 1981, the Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Institute opened its doors with an expanded mandate to train professionals and improve First Nations access to First Nations education. The Institute provides a variety of services, including research, curriculum development, language education, policy development, children's literacy, and more. In addition, the Institute funds the Mi'kmaq-Maliseet Resource Collection, which contains materials that are immensely valuable to knowledge of First Nations culture, history, and perspective in the region.

Students have over 125 clubs and societies to choose from between the Fredericton and Saint John campuses and there are 13 residences available to students in Fredericton and two in Saint John. Students on both campuses have access to UNB's facilities, fitness classes and outdoor activities such as snowshoeing and kayaking.  There are exchanges available in more than 35 countries around the world with over 89 university partners.

==Athletics==
{{Main|UNB Varsity Reds}}

[[File:UNB Varsity Reds logo.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Varsity Reds logo]]

UNB Fredericton is represented in [[U Sports]] by the [[UNB Varsity Reds]] while UNBSJ is represented by the [[UNBSJ Seawolves]].&lt;ref name="University of New Brunswick"/&gt; The Varsity Reds compete in the following sports: men's and women's [[basketball]], men's [[hockey]], men's and women's [[soccer]], men's and women's [[volleyball]], and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]. Men's and women's track &amp; field and cross country were added as a varsity sport for 2010/2011; this is a joint Fredericton/Saint John Campus program.

In the past, UNBF used different names for each individual sport's team; for instance, the men's swim team was the Beavers, and the hockey team was the Red Devils. The university club teams, which are supported financially by the Student Union as well as by individual members of the teams, do not use the Varsity Reds name and thus continue the tradition of using different nicknames for each sport.

===Songs===
Traditional among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various times such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic events are "Carmina Universitatis Novi Brunsvici", "Alma Mater" (1904), and "UNB Anthem", with words by A.G. Bailey and music by D.V. Start.&lt;ref&gt;Green, R. [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/college-songs-and-songbooks-emc/ College Songbooks and Songs – University of New Brunswick]. Encyclopedia of Music in Canada. Historia. Retrieved on: August 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Colloquial songs included "Bombers Away" to celebrate the football team:{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
Bombers away, my boys&lt;br /&gt;
Bombers away,&lt;br /&gt;
'Cause when you fight red bombers.&lt;br /&gt;
Fight you Bombers, Fight you Bombers,&lt;br /&gt;
Fight, Fight, Fight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2881">[[Image:Fair Trade Products.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fair Trade goods sold in an Italian Worldshop]]'''Worldshops''', '''world shops''' or '''Fair Trade Shops''' are specialized retail outlets offering and promoting [[Fair trade|Fair Trade]] products. Worldshops also typically organize various  educational Fair Trade activities and play an active role in [[trade justice]] and other North-South political campaigns.

Worldshops are often [[not-for-profit]] organizations and run by locally based volunteer networks.

Although the movement emerged in [[Europe]] and a vast majority of worldshops are still based on the continent, worldshops can also be found today in [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]].

== History ==
[[Image:Oxfam shop on Drury Lane.jpg|thumb|Oxfam shop on [[Drury Lane]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].]]
The start of the movement is usually attributed to the first worldshop in Europe, which was founded by [[Oxfam]] in 1959. The Oxfam shop sold Chinese bric-a-brac that had been sourced from Chinese [[refugees]] that had escaped the [[Chinese civil war|Communist revolution]] to [[Hong Kong]]. However, some sources credit the first fair trade shop that had been opened in the US in 1958, selling [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] needlework.

The shops were not called worldshops at that time, however. [[Alternative trading organisation]]s imported various [[third world]] goods, such as [[sugarcane|cane]] [[sugar]] starting in the 1960s, and still continuing today. These goods were sold in "third world shops" or "developing country shops" (the actual name differing from country to country). The most active organisations were operating in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Netherlands]]. The term "worldshop" came into existence in the 1990s. In 1994, worldshops organised themselves under the auspices of NEWS, the [[Network of European Worldshops]], who now falls under the [[World Fair Trade Organization]]. The [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark|Fairtrade]] label, which is used on fair trade products, has its roots in the 1980s worldshop movement.

== Aims ==
Worldshops' aim is to make [[trade]] as direct and [[fair trade|fair]] with the trading partners as possible. Usually, this means a producer in a [[developing country]] and consumers in [[industrialisation|industrialized]] countries. The worldshops' target is to pay the producers a fair price that guarantees subsistence and positive social development. They often cut out any intermediaries in the import chain.
