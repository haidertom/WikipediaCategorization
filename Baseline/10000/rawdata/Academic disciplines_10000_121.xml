      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4412">'''Aceramic''' is defined as "not producing pottery". In [[archaeology]], the term means "without [[pottery]]".

Aceramic societies usually used bark, basketry, gourds and leather for containers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=aceramic|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used to refer to a specific early [[Neolithic]] period before a culture develops [[Pottery|ceramics]], such as the Middle Eastern [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]], in which case it is a synonym of '''preceramic''' (or '''pre-pottery''').

It should be distinguished from the specific term '''Pre-Ceramic''', which is a period in many chronologies of the [[archaeology of the Americas]], typically showing some [[agriculture]] and developed [[textile]]s but no fired [[pottery]].  For example, in the [[Norte Chico civilization]] and other cultures of [[Peru]], the cultivation of [[cotton]] seems to have been very important in economic and power relations, from around 3200 BC. Here, [[Cotton Pre-Ceramic]] may be used as a period. The "Pre-Ceramic" may be followed by "Ceramic" periods or a [[formative stage]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone-Miller, Rebecca, ''Art of the Andes'', pp. 7, 18-23, 2002 (2nd edn), Thames &amp; Hudson, World of Art series, {{ISBN|0500203636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Aceramic" is also used to describe a culture at any time prior to its development of pottery as well as cultures that lack pottery altogether. A '''preceramic''' period is traditionally regarded as occurring in the early stage of the [[Neolithic]] period of a culture, but recent findings in Japan and China have pushed the origin of ceramic technology there well back into the [[Paleolithic]] era.

The Aceramic Neolithic period began roughly around 8500 BC and can be identified with over a half a dozen sites. The period was most prominent in Western Asia in an economy based on the cultivation of crops or the rearing of animals or both. Aceramic Neolithic groups are more rare outside Western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=aceramic|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aceramic Neolithic villages had many attributes of agricultural communities: large settlement size, substantial architecture, long settlement duration, intensive harvesting of seeds with sickles, equipment and facilities for storing and grinding seeds, and containers. Morphological evidence for domestication of plants comes only from Middle PPNB ([[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]]), and by Late PPNB some animals, notably goats, were domesticated or at least managed in most of the sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0023-0_1|title = Aceramic Neolithic|last = Banning|first = Edward|date = 2002-01-01|publisher = Springer US|isbn = 9781468471359|editor-last = Peregrine|editor-first = Peter N.|pages = 1–20|language = en|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-0023-0_1|editor-last2 = Ember|editor-first2 = Melvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sites ==
Some of the most famous Aceramic sites are located in the [[Republic of Cyprus]]. There was an Early Aceramic Neolithic phase beginning around 8200 BC. The phase can be best thought of as a "colony", or initial settlement of the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brynmawr.edu/collections/nehinterns/cypriote/akrotiri-neolithic.html|title = Untitled Document|website = www.brynmawr.edu|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the relatively recent discoveries of the Akrotiri and the Early Aceramic Neolithic phases, the Aceramic Neolithic culture known as the Khirokitia culture was thought to be the earliest human settlement on Cyprus, from 7000 to 5000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brynmawr.edu/collections/nehinterns/cypriote/aceramicneolithic.html|title = Untitled Document|website = www.brynmawr.edu|access-date = 2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of Late Aceramic Neolithic sites throughout the island. The two most important are called Khirokitia and Kalavasos-Tenta. Late Aceramic Cyprus did not have much external contact because of a lack of settlement in the west or northwest during the period. However, Late Aceramic Cyprus was a well-structured society.

'''Agada''' is one of the eight branches into which [[ayurveda]] medicine is traditionally divided. Literally, ''gada'' means a disease and ''agada'' means any agent which makes the body free from disease; however the term ''agada'' is used specifically for the branch of medicine dealing with [[toxicology]], the description of the different types of [[poison]]s, and their [[antidote]]s.&lt;ref name="DashKashyap1994"/&gt;

''Agada Tantra'' is defined as a section of toxicology that deals with [[food poisoning]], [[snakebite]]s, [[dog bite]]s, [[insect bite]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="Sudarshan1999"/&gt; The school of toxicology was founded and expounded upon by Kashyapa, also known as Vriddhakashyapa, a contemporary of [[Atreya Punarvasu]]. He lived in [[Taxila|Taksashila]] in what is now [[Pakistan]]. His text was called the ''Kashyapa Samhita''. This, however, is a different book than the ''[[Kashyap Samhita]]'' of [[pediatrics]]. This text is not available now but the references of this text are found mentioned in different commentaries. Some other texts written by Alambayana, [[Ushana]], [[Saunaka]], and Latyayana were known to exist. However except for references to them, the original texts are no longer available.&lt;ref name="Tivārī1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Govindan2002"/&gt;

The traditional practice of toxicology is still practiced by different families of [[vishavaidya]]s (poison doctors) who specialize in toxicology. However, their knowledge is limited compared to the knowledge possessed by the earlier ayurvedic physicians. In ancient times, it was the job of Vishavaidyas to protect members of the [[royal families]] from being poisoned, as well to poison enemies of the kings.&lt;ref name="Sudarshan1999-2"/&gt;

'''Aicardi–Goutières syndrome''' ('''AGS'''), which is completely distinct from the similarly named [[Aicardi syndrome]], is a rare, usually early onset childhood, inflammatory disorder most typically affecting the brain and the skin  ([[neurodevelopmental disorder]]).&lt;ref name="Aicardi J &amp; Goutieres F"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Aicardi J, Goutieres F|title=A progressive familial encephalopathy in infancy with calcifications of the basal ganglia and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis |journal=Ann Neurol |year=1984 |volume=15 |pages=49–54 |doi=10.1002/ana.410150109 |pmid=6712192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tolmie"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tolmie JL |author2=Shillito P |author3=Hughes-Benzie R |author4=Stephenson JB. |title=The Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (familial, early onset encephalopathy with calcifications of the basal ganglia and chronic cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis) |journal=J Med Genet |year=1995 |volume=32 |pages=881–884 |doi=10.1136/jmg.32.11.881 |pmid=8592332 |pmc=1051740}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of affected individuals experience significant intellectual and physical problems, although this is not always the case. The clinical features of AGS can mimic those of ''in utero'' acquired infection, and some characteristics of the condition also overlap with the autoimmune disease [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aicardi |first1=J |last2=Goutieres |first2=F |title=Systemic lupus erythematosus or Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome? |journal=Neuropediatrics |year=2000 |volume=31 |pages=113 |doi=10.1055/s-2000-7533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dale RC |author2=Tang SP |author3=Heckmatt JZ |author4=Tatnall FM |title=Familial systemic lupus erythematosus and congenital infection-like syndrome |journal=Neuropediatrics |year=2000 |volume=31 |pages=155–158 |doi=10.1055/s-2000-7492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crow |first1=YJ |last2=Livingston |first2=JH |title=Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome: an important Mendelian mimic of congenital infection |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2008 |volume=50 |pages=410–416 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2008.02062.x |pmid=18422679 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an original description of eight cases in 1984,&lt;ref name="Aicardi J &amp; Goutieres F"/&gt; the condition was first referred to as 'Aicardi–Goutières syndrome' (AGS) in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bonnemann |first1=CG |last2=Meinecke |first2=P |title=Encephalopathy of infancy with intracerebral calcification and chronic spinal fluid lymphocytosis - another case of the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome|year=1992 |journal=Neuropaediatrics |volume=23 |pages=157–61 |doi=10.1055/s-2008-1071333}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first international meeting on AGS was held in Pavia, Italy, in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Proceedings of the International Meeting on Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome Pavia, Italy, 28-29 May 2001. |journal=Eur J Paediatr Neurol |year=2002 |volume=6, Suppl A |pages=A1-86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AGS can occur due to [[mutations]] in any one of a number of different [[gene]]s, of which seven have been identified to date, namely: [[TREX1]],&lt;ref name="TREX1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crow |first1=YJ |title=Mutations in the gene encoding the 3'-5' DNA exonuclease TREX1 cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome at the AGS1 locus. |journal=Nat Genet |year=2006 |volume=38 |pages=917–20 |doi=10.1038/ng1845 |pmid=16845398 |issue=8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RNASEH2A]], [[RNASEH2B]], [[RNASEH2C]] (which together encode the [[Ribonuclease H]]2 [[enzyme]] complex),&lt;ref name="RNASEH2"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crow |first1=YJ |title=Mutations in the genes encoding ribonuclease H2 subunits cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and mimic congenital viral brain infection |journal=Nat Genet |year=2006 |volume=38 |pages=910–6|doi=10.1038/ng1842 |pmid=16845400 |issue=8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SAMHD1]],&lt;ref name="SAMHD1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=GI |title=Mutations involved in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome implicate SAMHD1 as regulator of the innate immune response |journal=Nat Genet |year=2009 |volume=41 |pages=829–32 |doi=10.1038/ng.373 |pmid=19525956 |issue=7|display-authors=etal |pmc=4154505}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ADAR]]1,&lt;ref name="ADAR1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=GI |title=Mutations in ADAR1 cause Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome associated with a type 1 interferon signature |journal=Nat Genet |year=2012 |volume=44 |pages=1243–8 |doi=10.1038/ng.2414 |pmid=23001123 |issue=11|display-authors=etal |pmc=4154508}}&lt;/ref&gt; and IFIH1 (coding for [[MDA5]]).&lt;ref name="IFIH1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=GI |title=Gain-of-function mutations in IFIH1 cause a spectrum of human disease phenotypes associated with upregulated type 1 interferon signaling. |journal=Nat Genet |year=2014 |volume= 46|pages= 503–509|doi=10.1038/ng.2933|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This neurological disease occurs in all populations worldwide, although it is almost certainly under-diagnosed. To date (2014) at least 400 cases of AGS are known.

== Signs and symptoms==
The initial description of AGS suggested that the disease was always severe, and was associated with unremitting neurological decline, resulting in death in childhood.&lt;ref name="Aicardi J &amp; Goutieres F" /&gt; As more cases have been identified, it has become apparent that this is not necessarily the case, with many patients now considered to demonstrate an apparently stable clinical picture, alive in their 4th decade.&lt;ref name="Clinical and molecular phenotype" /&gt; Moreover, rare individuals with pathogenic mutations in the AGS-related genes can be minimally affected (perhaps only with [[chilblains]]) and are in mainstream education, and even affected siblings within a family can show marked differences in severity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McEntagart |first1=M|last2=Kamel |first2=H |last3=Lebon |first3=P |last4=King |first4=MD |title=Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome: an expanding phenotype |journal=Neuropaediatrics |year=1998 |volume=29 |pages=163–7 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-973555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostergaard |first1=JR|last2=Christensen |first2=T |last3=Nehen |first3=AM |title=A distinct difference in clinical expression of two siblings with Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome |journal=Neuropaediatrics |year=1999 |volume=30 |pages=38–41 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-973455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vogt |first1=J |title=Striking intrafamilial phenotypic variability in Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome associated with the recurrent Asian founder mutation in RNASEH2C |journal=Am J Med Genet |year=2013 |volume=161A |pages=338–42|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.35712 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In about ten percent of cases, AGS presents at or soon after birth (i.e. in the neonatal period).  This presentation of the disease is characterized by microcephaly, neonatal seizures, poor feeding, jitteriness, cerebral calcifications (accumulation of calcium deposits in the brain), [[white matter]] abnormalities, and [[cerebral atrophy]]; thus indicating that the disease process became active before birth i.e. ''in utero''.&lt;ref name="Clinical and molecular phenotype" /&gt; These infants can have [[hepatosplenomegaly]] and [[thrombocytopaenia]], very much like cases of transplacental viral infection.

AGS is a genetically heterogeneous disease resulting from [[mutation]]s in any of seven [[gene]]s encoding: a [[3']] repair [[exonuclease]] with preferential activity on single stranded DNA ([[TREX1]]);&lt;ref name="TREX1" /&gt; any of the three components of the [[ribonuclease H|ribonuclease H2]] [[endonuclease]] complex acting on [[ribonucleotide]]s in RNA:DNA hybrids ([[RNASEH2A]], [[RNASEH2B]], [[RNASEH2C]]);&lt;ref name="RNASEH2" /&gt; a [[SAM domain]] and [[HD domain]] containing protein which functions as a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase ([[SAMHD1]]);&lt;ref name="SAMHD1" /&gt; an enzyme catalysing the hydrolytic [[deamination]] of [[adenosine]] to [[inosine]] in double-stranded RNA ([[ADAR1]]);&lt;ref name="ADAR1" /&gt; and the cytosolic double-stranded RNA receptor ([[MDA5]], also known as ''IFIH1'').

[[Interferon type I|Type I interferon]] activity was originally described over 50 years ago as a soluble factor produced by cells treated with inactivated, non-replicating viruses that blocked subsequent infection with live virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Isaacs |first1=A |last2=Lindenmann |first2=J |title=Virus interference.

Studies of the AGS-related proteins TREX1, the RNase H2 complex, SAMHD1 and ADAR1, suggest that an '''inappropriate accumulation''' of self-derived nucleic acids can induce type I interferon signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stetson |first1=DB |last2=Ko |first2=JS |last3=Heidmann |first3=T |last4=Medzhitov |first4=R| title=Trex1 prevents cell-intrinsic initiation of autoimmunity |journal=Cell |year=2008 |volume=134 |pages=587–98 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.032 |pmid=18724932 |pmc=2626626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crow |first1=YJ |last2=Rehwinkel |first2=J |title=Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and related phenotypes: linking nucleic acid metabolism with autoimmunity |journal=Hum Mol Genet |year=2009 |volume=18 |pages=R130-6 |doi=10.1093/hmg/ddp293 |pmid=19808788 |pmc=2758706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stetson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stetson |first1=DB |title=Endogenous retroelements and autoimmune disease |journal=Curr Opin Immunol |year=2012 |volume=24 |pages=692–7 |doi=10.1016/j.coi.2012.09.007|pmc=4005353 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of ''IFIH1'' mutations in the similar context implicates the '''aberrant sensing''' of nucleic acids as a cause of immune upregulation.&lt;ref name="IFIH1" /&gt;

== Diagnostic criteria ==
''' Laboratory''': normal metabolic and infective screening. An increase in the number of white cells (particularly lymphocytes) in the CSF,&lt;ref name="Aicardi J &amp; Goutieres F" /&gt; and high levels of interferon-alpha activity and [[neopterin]] in the CSF&lt;ref name="Blau" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinical and molecular phenotype" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interferon-related biomarkers" /&gt; are important clues - however, these features are not always present. More recently, a persistent elevation of mRNA levels of interferon-stimulated gene transcripts have been recorded in the peripheral blood of almost all cases of AGS with mutations in ''TREX1'', ''RNASEH2A'', ''RNASEH2C'', ''SAMHD1'', ''ADAR1'' and ''IFIH1'', and in 75% of patients with mutations in ''RNASEH2B''.&lt;ref name="interferon-related biomarkers" /&gt; These results are irrespective of age. Thus, this interferon signature appears to be a very good marker of disease.

''' Neuroradiology''': The spectrum of neuroradiological features associated with AGS is broad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uggetti |first1=C |title=Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome: neuroradiologic findings and follow-ups |journal=AJNR Am J Neuroradiol |year=2009 |volume=30 |pages=1971–6 |doi=10.3174/ajnr.a1694|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Livingston |first1=JH |last2=Stivaros |first2=S |last3=van der Knaap |first3=MS |last4=Crow |first4=YJ |title=Recognizable phenotypes associated with intracranial calcification |journal=Dev Med Child Neurol |year=2013 |volume=55 |pages=46–57 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8749.2012.04437.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is most typically characterised by the following:

:*'''''Cerebral calcifications''''': Calcifications on CT ([[computed tomography]]) are seen as areas of abnormal signal, typically bilateral and located in the basal ganglia, but sometimes also extending into the white matter. Calcifications are usually better detected using CT scans (and can be missed completely on MRI without gradient echo sequences ([[magnetic resonance imaging]])).

:*'''''White matter abnormalities''''': These are found in 75-100% of cases, and are best visualised on MRI. Signal changes can be particularly prominent in frontal and temporal regions. White matter abnormalities sometimes include cystic degeneration.

:*'''''Cerebral atrophy''''': is seen frequently.

'''Genetics''': pathogenic mutations in any of the seven genes known to be involved in AGS.

== Treatment ==
At the moment there are no therapies specifically targeting the underlying cause of AGS. Current treatments address the symptoms, which can be varied both in scope and severity. Many patients benefit from tube-feeding. Drugs can be administered to help with seizures / [[epilepsy]]. The treatment of chilblains remains problematic, but particularly involves keeping the feet / hands warm. Physical therapy, including the use of splints can help to prevent contractures and  surgery is sometimes required.  Botox (botulinium toxin) has sometimes caused severe immune reactions in some AGS patients, and the high risk of possible further brain damage must be considered before giving Botox.    [[Occupational therapy]] can help with development, and the use of technology (e.g. Assistive Communication Devices) can facilitate communication.  Patients should be regularly screened for treatable conditions, most particularly glaucoma and [[endocrine]] problems (especially [[hypothyroidism]]).  The risk versus benefit of giving immunizations also must be considered, as some AGS patients have high immune responses or flares that cause further brain damage from immunizations but other patients have no problems with immunizations; on the other hand,  AGS patients have died from illnesses that can be immunized against, so the family must consider the risk vs. benefit of each immunization vs. risk of the actual virus if they choose not to immunize. As of 2017, there are current drug trials being conducted that may lead to drug treatments for AGS.

== History ==
In 1984, [[Jean Aicardi]] and Francoise Goutières described eight children from five families presenting with a severe early onset [[encephalopathy]], which was characterized by [[calcification]] of the [[basal ganglia]], abnormalities of the cerebral [[white matter]] and diffuse brain atrophy.&lt;ref name="Aicardi J &amp; Goutieres F"/&gt; An excess of white cells, chiefly [[lymphocytes]], was found in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), thus indicating an inflammatory condition. During the first year of life, these children developed [[microcephaly]], [[spasticity]] and [[dystonia]]. Some of the parents of the children were genetically related to each other, and the children were both male and female, which suggested that the disease was inherited as an [[autosomal recessive]] genetic trait.

In 1988, Pierre Lebon and his colleagues identified the additional feature of raised levels of [[interferon alfa|interferon-alpha]] in  patient CSF in the absence of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lebon |first1=P |title=Intrathecal synthesis of interferon-alpha in infants with progressive familial encephalopathy |journal=J Neurol Sci |year=1988 |volume=84 |pages=201–8 |doi=10.1016/0022-510x(88)90125-6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This observation supported the suggestion that AGS was an inflammatory disease, as did the later finding of increased levels of the inflammatory marker [[neopterin]] in CSF,&lt;ref name="Blau"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blau |first1=N |title=Cerebrospinal fluid pterins and folates in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome: a new phenotype|journal=Neurology |year=2003 |volume=61 |pages=642–7 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000082726.08631.e7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clinical and molecular phenotype"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=GI |title=Clinical and molecular phenotype of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome |journal=Am J Hum Genet |year=2007 |volume=81 |pages=713–25|doi=10.1086/521373 |pmid=17846997 |pmc=2227922|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the demonstration that more than 90% of individuals with a genetic diagnosis of AGS, tested at any age, demonstrate an upregulation of interferon-induced [[Transcription (genetics)|gene transcripts]] - a so-called interferon signature.&lt;ref name="interferon-related biomarkers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rice |first1=GI |title=Assessment of interferon-related biomarkers in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome associated with mutations in TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, SAMHD1, and ADAR1: a case-control study|journal=Lancet Neurol |year=2013 |volume=12 |pages=1159–69 |doi= 10.1016/S1474-4422(13)70258-8|display-authors=etal|pmc=4349523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Airglow''' (also called '''nightglow''') is a faint emission of light by a planetary [[atmosphere]]. In the case of [[Earth's atmosphere]], this [[optical phenomenon]] causes the [[night sky]] to never be completely dark, even after the effects of [[starlight]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffused sunlight]] from the far side are removed.

==History==

[[File:Airglow in Allier (FRANCE) during the night at the 13th August of 2015.jpg|thumb|Airglow in Allier, France, on the night of 13 August 2015|220x220px]]

The airglow phenomenon was first identified in 1868 by Swedish physicist [[Anders Ångström]]. Since then, it has been studied in the laboratory, and various chemical reactions have been observed to emit electromagnetic energy as part of the process.  Scientists have identified some of those processes that would be present in Earth's atmosphere, and astronomers have verified that such emissions are present.

==Description==
[[File:Iss030e015472 Edit.jpg|thumb|[[C/2011 W3|Comet Lovejoy]] passing behind Earth's airglow on December 22, 2011]]

Airglow is caused by various processes in the upper [[atmosphere of Earth]], such as the recombination of atoms which were [[photoionization|photoionized]] by the [[Sun]] during the day, luminescence caused by [[cosmic ray]]s striking the upper atmosphere, and [[chemiluminescence]] caused mainly by [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]] reacting with [[hydroxyl]] ions at heights of a few hundred kilometres. It is not noticeable during the daytime due to the [[glare (vision)|glare]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|scattering]] of [[sunlight]].

Even at the best ground-based observatories, airglow limits the [[photosensitivity]] of [[optical telescope]]s. Partly for this reason, [[space telescope]]s like [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based telescopes at [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]].

Airglow at night may be bright enough for a ground observer to notice and appears generally bluish. Although airglow emission is fairly uniform across the atmosphere, it appears brightest at about 10° above the observer's [[horizon]], since the lower one looks, the greater the [[air mass (astronomy)|depth of atmosphere]] one is looking through. Very low down, however, atmospheric [[extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] reduces the apparent brightness of the airglow.

One airglow mechanism is when an atom of [[nitrogen]] combines with an atom of [[oxygen]] to form a molecule of [[nitric oxide]] (NO). In the process, a [[photon]] is emitted. This photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules. The free atoms are available for this process, because molecules of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are dissociated by solar energy in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form NO. Other species that can create air glow in the atmosphere are hydroxyl (OH),&lt;ref name=meinel50a&gt;

The [[sky brightness]] is typically measured in units of [[apparent magnitude]] per square [[minute and second of arc|arcsecond]] of sky.

==Calculation of the effects of airglow==
[[File:Cupola above the darkened Earth.jpg|thumb|left|The airglow above the horizon, captured from the [[International Space Station|ISS]].]]
[[File:Airglow ESO.webm|thumb|Airglow.]]
[[File:Induced Airglow (HAARP).gif|thumb|Two images of the sky over the [[HAARP]] [[Gakona]] facility using the NRL-cooled [[CCD imager]] at 557.7 nm. The field of view is approximately 38°.

Structure is evident in the emission region.]]

{{see also|Apparent magnitude}}
In order to calculate the relative intensity of airglow, we need to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes of photons; this clearly depends on the spectrum of the source, but we will ignore that initially.  At visible wavelengths, we need the parameter S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(V), the power per square centimetre of aperture and per micrometre of wavelength produced by a zeroth-magnitude star, to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes — {{nowrap|S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(V) {{=}} {{val|4.0|e=-12|u=W cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; µm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;''High Energy Astrophysics: Particles, Photons and Their Detection'' Vol 1, Malcolm S. Longair, {{ISBN|0-521-38773-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If we take the example of a ''V''=28 star observed through a normal ''V'' band filter ({{nowrap|''B'' {{=}} {{val|0.2|u=µm}}}} bandpass, frequency {{nowrap|ν ≈ {{val|6|e=14|u=Hz}}}}), the number of photons we receive per square centimeter of telescope aperture per second from the source is ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;N_s = 10^{-28/2.5}\times\frac{S_0(V) \times B}{h\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

(where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]; ''hν'' is the energy of a single photon of frequency ''ν'').

At ''V'' band, the emission from airglow is {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} 22}} per square arc-second at a high-altitude observatory on a moonless night; in excellent [[Astronomical seeing|seeing]] conditions, the image of a star will be about 0.7 arc-second across with an area of 0.4 square arc-second,  and so the emission from airglow over the area of the image corresponds to about {{nowrap|''V'' {{=}} 23}}. This gives the number of photons from airglow, ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;N_a = 10^{-23/2.5}\times\frac{S_0(V) \times B}{h\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

The signal-to-noise for an ideal ground-based observation with a telescope of area ''A'' (ignoring losses and detector noise), arising from [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] statistics, is only:

:&lt;math&gt;S/N = \sqrt{A}\times\frac{N_{s}}{\sqrt{N_{s}+N_{a}}}&lt;/math&gt;

If we assume a 10&amp;nbsp;m diameter ideal ground-based telescope and an unresolved star: every second, over a patch the size of the seeing-enlarged image of the star, 35 photons arrive from the star and 3500 from air-glow.  So, over an hour, roughly {{val|1.3|e=7}}&lt;!-- this value was 1.3e7±3500 photons, but the ±3500 makes no sense as 1.3e7 implies an uncertainty of ±5e5, which is far greater--&gt; arrive from the air-glow, and approximately {{val|1.3|e=5}} arrive from the source; so the S/N ratio is about:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1.3 \times 10^5}{\sqrt{1.3 \times 10^7}} \approx 36.&lt;/math&gt;

We can compare this with "real" answers from exposure time calculators. For an 8 m unit [[Very Large Telescope]] telescope, according to the [http://www.eso.org/observing/etc/bin/gen/form?INS.NAME=FORS1++INS.MODE=imaging FORS] exposure time calculator you need 40 hours of observing time to reach ''V'' = 28, while the 2.4 m Hubble only takes 4 hours according to the [https://archive.is/20050209215954/http://apt.stsci.edu/webetc/acs/acs_img_etc.jsp ACS] exposure time calculator. A hypothetical 8 m Hubble telescope would take about 30 minutes.

It should be clear from this calculation that reducing the view field size can make fainter objects more detectable against the airglow; unfortunately, [[adaptive optics]] techniques that reduce the diameter of the view field of an Earth-based telescope by an order of magnitude only as yet work in the infrared, where the sky is much brighter.  A space telescope isn't restricted by the view field, since they are not affected by airglow.

==Induced airglow==
[[File:Figure 7.png|thumb|[[SwissCube-1]]'s first airglow image of the Earth (shifted to green from near [[Infrared|IR]]) captured on March 3, 2011.]]

Scientific experiments have been conducted to induce airglow by directing high-power radio emissions at the Earth's [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name='agu2005'&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090726023615/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2005GL023864.shtml HF-induced airglow at magnetic zenith: Thermal and parametric instabilities near electron gyroharmonics].

[[Naval Research Laboratory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental observation==
[[SwissCube-1]] is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] satellite operated by [[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]]. The spacecraft is a single unit [[CubeSat]], which was designed to conduct research into airglow within the Earth's atmosphere and to develop technology for future spacecraft. Though SwissCube-1 is rather small (10 x 10 x 10&amp;nbsp;cm) and weighs less than 1&amp;nbsp;kg, it carries a small telescope for obtaining images of the airglow. The first [[SwissCube-1]] image came down on February 18, 2011 and was quite black with some thermal noise on it. The first airglow image came down on March 3, 2011. This image has been converted to the human optical range (green) from its near-infrared measurement. This image provides a measurement of the intensity of the airglow phenomenon in the [[near-infrared]]. The range measured is from 500 to 61400 [[photons]], with a resolution of 500 photons.&lt;ref name='EPFL_Sopace_Center_airglow'&gt;[http://swisscube.epfl.ch/ SwissCube official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observation of airglow on other planets==
The [[Venus Express]] spacecraft contains an [[infrared]] sensor which has detected near-IR emissions from the upper atmosphere of [[Venus]].  The emissions come from [[nitric oxide]] (NO) and from molecular oxygen.&lt;ref name="Garcia MunozMills2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garcia Munoz|first1=A.|last2=Mills|first2=F.

Scientists had previously determined in laboratory testing that during NO production, [[ultraviolet]] emissions and near-IR emissions were produced.  The UV radiation has been detected in the atmosphere, but until this mission, the atmosphere-produced near-IR emissions were only theoretical.&lt;ref name="Wilson2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Elizabeth|title=PLANETARY SCIENCE Spectral band in Venus' 'nightglow' allows study of NO, O|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|volume=87|issue=4|date=2009|page=11|issn=0009-2347|doi=10.1021/cen-v087n004.p011a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11002">The '''Arts Olympiad''' is an international art competition for children ages 8 to 12 organized by [[International Child Art Foundation]] with one million participants from seventy countries. Each competition is four years long and it is held every four year. The competition includes the element of art and peace to encourage children around the world to use creativity and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promising Practices - Arts Olympiad|url=http://www.arizonahealthmatters.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PromisePractice&amp;file=promisePractice&amp;pid=769|publisher=The Healthy Communities Institute|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dr. Ashfaq Ishaq, founder of the International Child Art Foundation, started the first Arts Olympiad competition in 1999&lt;ref name="1st-ao"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st Arts Olympiad (1997-2000)|url=http://www.icaf.org/whatwedo/ao/1st-ao.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the issue which was coined decades earlier as the "fourth grade slump" in creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Torrance|first=Ellis Paul|title=Understanding the fourth grade slump in creative thinking: final report|year=1967|publisher=University of Minnesota|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers at the time suggested that the phenomenon is a result of a drop in creativity around the ages of nine as they start conforming to [[standardized test]]ing and to please parents and teachers. The plan was to let children who were the winners of [[U.S. state]]s and other countries to come together in a festival to let them work together and learn other cultures with the goal to move future generations toward [[World peace|global peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Jane Hess|title=Get Out and Give Back: World Children’s Festival|url=http://www.washingtonlife.com/2011/06/13/get-out-and-give-back-world-children%E2%80%99s-festival/|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Washington Life Magazine|date=13 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme for the first Art Olympiad was ''My World in the Year 2000'' to ask children to create art in which they envisioned themselves in the [[new millennium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future Of Peace: Art By Young People|url=http://go.worldbank.org/HE9OOAUR30|publisher=The World Bank Group|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one million children in 86 countries in the program which was run between 1997 and 2000. The winning pieced from around the world were exhibited at the ''World Children’s Festival'' in 1999 on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, DC]]. The artworks were also later exhibited at the [[White House Millennium Council#White House Millennium Celebration|White House Millennium Celebration]], the [[United Nations Headquarters]], and the 2003 [[Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group|World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings]] in [[Dubai]].&lt;ref name="1st-ao"/&gt;

Since then the format of the global competition, a festival in Washington, DC and global exhibitions have been following in the next Arts Olympiad cycles. The 2nd Arts Olympiad was held between 2001 and 2004 with the theme of ''Me in the New Millennium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dally|first=Ashley|title=Me in the New Millennium.(Perspective)(ICAF's 2000-2004 Arts Olympiad)|journal=ChildArt|date=1 April 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-140305540.html|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 3rd Arts Olympiad (2005-2008), the theme was shifted to relate art and sport&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culture of Peace Project and Resources: Arts Olympiad|url=http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087|publisher=International Year for the Culture of Peace - Unesco|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707045049/http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_visu_projet.asp?Proj=00087#|archive-date=2010-07-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the artist-athlete ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The President's Challenge / About / Advocates / Nonprofit|url=https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml|publisher=The President’s Council on Fitness, Sports &amp; Nutrition|accessdate=8 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025013502/https://www.presidentschallenge.org/about/advocates/nonprofit.shtml#|archive-date=2012-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth Arts Olympiad (2009-2012) continued the same theme with title ''My Favorite Sport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCAC Partners International Child Art Foundation(ICAF) |url=http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222172708/http://www.ncac.gov.ng/ncacicf.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 February 2013 |publisher=National Council for Arts &amp; Culture, Nigeria |accessdate=8 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection Process==
During the first two years of the competition, local schools are participated in the Arts Olympiad lesson plan. The artworks as the result of the lessons are then put into a selection process.

The selection process in the United States is first done from at the local [[school district]]. The selection of artworks from within a school or school district. The artworks are then submitted to Washington, DC for another selection to have a representative of each participating state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Berwick Academy selected to represent Maine at World Children's Festival|url=http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20110311/GJNEWS_01/703119949&amp;template=SouthernMaineRegion|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Fosters Daily Democrat|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries, the partner in each country will administrate the selection. The selection can be in many phases involving the competition at the local level and at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=150 in Arts Olympiad|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/1/3/central/13010258&amp;sec=central|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=The Star Online|date=3 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gana niño mazatleco Olimpiada del Arte a nivel nacional|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones.php?id=660595&amp;id_seccion=84363|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Noroeste.com|date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners who represent the participating U.S. states and countries are invited to the World Children's Festival in Washington, DC.

==World Children's Festival==
The World Children's Festival is a three-day festival held every four years on the National Mall in Washington, DC for winners of the Arts Olympiad to participate. The festival includes over 50 performances and many art-related workshops. It also has sessions for the winners from different countries to co-create artworks with many adult artists.&lt;ref name="south-south"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan |first=Richard |title=4th World Children's Festival Held at the National Mall in Washington, DC |url=http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104844/http://www.southsouthnews.com/pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsId=c45230b5-620e-4126-9bfe-9bcfca02812b |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2011 |accessdate=8 January 2013 |newspaper=South-South News |date=22 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Before the event, the Arts Olympiad winners from Washington, D.C. are asked to be ambassadors for the festival and exchange emails with international winners to welcome to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Children's Festival|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/misc-events/the-world-childrens-festival,1209274/critic-review.html|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international winners are welcomed to the host families around the Washington area.

Children share ideas and work together during the three-day festival. On the last night of the festival, the celebratory dinner is held with all guests dressing in [[Folk costume|national attire]].&lt;ref name="south-south"/&gt;

Similar festivals have been replicated in other counties such as the European Children’s Festival at Olympia Park in Munich in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founder of World’s Largest Art Program for Children Earns The Academy’s Distinguished Service Award|url=http://ussa.edu/publications/news/2011/10/27/founder-of-worlds-largest-art-program-for-children-earns-the-academys-distinguished-service-award/|publisher=United States Sports Academy|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Exhibitions==
After the World Children's Festival, the winning pieces will travel to exhibitions in the U.S. and internationally. The past exhibitions have been in [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Germany]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Uganda]], [[Italy]], [[Egypt]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAF Exhibitions 1998-2011|url=http://icaf.org/pdfs/ICAF%20Exhibitions%201998-2011.pdf|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of Winners==
The organizer have seen the potential and the importance of Art Olympiad winners to promote the cause. An example was demonstrated when a winner from [[Peru]] who have gone through difficulties in arranging competition because there was no office of the Internal Child Art Foundation in the country, that child eventually set up and organize the competition in the country for the next season with the support from the [[Ministry of Education (Peru)|ministry of education]]. With that, they started encouraging the winners to contribute back to the program and set up a youth board for the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashfaq Ishaq Discusses Challenges Faced Due To Lack of Arts Education |url=http://www.eclips.cornell.edu/clip.do?id=5127&amp;clipID=5127&amp;tab=TabClipPage |publisher=Charles H.

===Youth Board Members===
In each cycle of the Arts Olympiad competition, a number of winners are choose to serve the youth board of the organization. Their roles are to be organization's [[spokesperson]]s, conduct fundraising to support the programs, write for ChildArt magazine, help stage and be the [[master of ceremonies]] at the World Children's Festival, and nominate innovative leaders, companies and organizations for the World Children's Award.

Since the formation of the youth board there have been 38 members from two dozen counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ICAF Youth Board|url=http://www.icaf.org/about/youth.php|publisher=International Child Art Foundation|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attachment disorder''' is a broad term intended to describe [[mental disorder|disorder]]s of [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[behavior]], and [[Interpersonal relationship|social relation]]ships arising from a failure to form normal [[attachment theory|attachments]] to [[Primary caregiver|primary care giving figures]] in early [[Attachment in children|childhood]]. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of [[neglect]], [[Child abuse|abuse]], abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers of caregivers, or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonagy, Peter. ''Attachment Theory and Psychoanalysis''. Other Professional, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A person's ''attachment style'' is permanently established before the age of three. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.

The term attachment disorder is used to describe [[emotion]]al and [[behavior]]al problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on the age of the individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality.&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; No list of [[symptom]]s can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of [[age appropriate]] social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.

There are currently two main areas of theory and practice relating to the definition and [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] of attachment disorder, and considerable discussion about a broader definition altogether. The first main area is based on scientific enquiry, is found in academic journals and books and pays close attention to [[attachment theory]]. It is described in [[ICD-10]] as [[reactive attachment disorder]], or "RAD" for the inhibited form, and [[disinhibited attachment disorder]], or "DAD" for the disinhibited form. In [[DSM-IV-TR]] both comparable inhibited and disinhibited types are called reactive attachment disorder or "RAD".&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al. 2006 p78"&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p78&lt;/ref&gt;

The second area is controversial and considered [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name="Berlin et al."&gt;{{Cite book |author=Berlin LJ |year=2005 |contribution=Preface |title=Enhancing Early Attachments: Theory, Research, Intervention and Policy |veditors=Berlin LJ, Ziv Y, Amaya-Jackson L, Greenberg MT |series=Duke series in child development and public policy |publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-59385-470-6 | pages=xvii|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in [[clinic]]al practice, on websites and in books and publications, but has little or no [[Evidence based medicine|evidence base]]. It makes controversial claims relating to a basis in attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser p 183&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these controversial [[medical diagnosis|diagnoses]] of attachment disorder is linked to the use of pseudoscientific [[Attachment therapy|attachment therapies]] to treat them.&lt;ref name="Chaffin et al. 2006 p78" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlin et al." /&gt;

Some authors have suggested that attachment, as an aspect of emotional [[Child development|development]], is better assessed along a spectrum than considered to fall into two non-overlapping categories. This spectrum would have at one end the characteristics called secure attachment; midway along the range of disturbance would be insecure or other undesirable attachment styles; at the other extreme would be
non-attachment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor &amp; Zeanah, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Agreement has not yet been reached with respect to diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. p. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the term is also sometimes used to cover difficulties arising in relation to various attachment styles which may not be disorders in the clinical sense.

==''Attachment'' and ''attachment disorder''==
{{main | Attachment theory | Attachment in children}}
[[Attachment theory]] is primarily an [[Adaptation|evolutionary]] and [[Ethology|ethological theory]]. In relation to infants, it primarily consists of ''proximity seeking'' to an ''attachment figure'' in the face of threat, for the purpose of survival.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1970) p 181&lt;/ref&gt; Although an attachment is a "tie," it is not synonymous with love and affection, despite their often going together and a healthy attachment is considered to be an important foundation of all subsequent relationships. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton &amp; Munholland (1999) p 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental aspect of attachment is called ''basic trust''. Basic trust is a broader concept than attachment in that it extends beyond the infant-caregiver relationship to "...the wider social network of trustable and caring others."&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, Barbara M., and Philip R. Newman. ''Development through Life: A Psychosocial Approach''. 12th ed. Stamford: Cenage Learning, 2015. 177. Print. {{ISBN|9781285459967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "...links confidence about the past with faith about the future."&lt;ref name="Newman" /&gt; [[Erik Erikson|"Erikson]] argues that the sense of trust in oneself and others is the foundation of human development"&lt;ref&gt;Kail, Robert V., and John C. Cavanaugh. ''Human Development: A Life-span View''. 5th ed. Australia: Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2010. 168. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and with a balance of mistrust produces [[hope]].

In the [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] sense, a [[Disease|disorder]] is a condition requiring [[therapy|treatment]] as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders.&lt;ref&gt;AACAP 2005, p1208&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term 'attachment disorder' although there is general agreement that such disorders only arise following early adverse caregiving experiences. [[Reactive attachment disorder]] indicates the absence of either or both the main aspects of ''proximity seeking'' to an identified ''attachment figure''. This can occur either in institutions, or with repeated changes of caregiver, or from extremely neglectful primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs after the age of 6 months. Current official classifications of [[Reactive attachment disorder|RAD]] under [[DSM-IV-TR]] and [[ICD-10]] are largely based on this understanding of the nature of attachment.

The words ''[[Attachment in children|attachment style]]'' or ''pattern'' refer to the various types of attachment arising from early care experiences, called ''secure'', ''anxious-ambivalent'', ''anxious-avoidant'', (all organized), and ''disorganized''. Some of these styles are more problematic than others, and, although they are not disorders in the clinical sense, are sometimes discussed under the term 'attachment disorder'.

Discussion of the disorganized attachment style sometimes includes this style under the rubric of attachment disorders because disorganized attachment is seen as the beginning of a developmental trajectory that will take the individual ever further from the normal range, culminating in actual disorders of thought, behavior, or mood.&lt;ref&gt;Levy K.N. et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Early intervention for disorganized attachment, or other problematic styles, is directed toward changing the trajectory of development to provide a better outcome later in the person's life.

[[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and colleagues proposed an alternative set of [[Criterion validity|criteria]] (see below) of three categories of attachment disorder, namely "no discriminated attachment figure", "secure base distortions" and "disrupted attachment disorder". These classifications consider that a disorder is a variation that requires treatment rather than an individual difference within the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p 223&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boris and Zeanah's typology==
Many leading attachment theorists, such as [[Charles H. Zeanah|Zeanah]] and Leiberman, have recognized the limitations of the DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria and proposed broader diagnostic criteria. There is as yet no official consensus on these criteria. The APSAC Taskforce recognised in its recommendations that "attachment problems extending beyond RAD, are a real and appropriate concern for professionals working with children", and set out recommendations for assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin (2006) p 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Boris and Zeanah (1999),&lt;ref&gt;Boris &amp; Zeannah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; have offered an approach to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those where there is a distorted relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a ''specified'' attachment figure.

Boris and Zeanah use the term "disorder of attachment" to indicate a situation in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. Such children may be indiscriminately sociable and approach all adults, whether familiar or not; alternatively, they may be emotionally withdrawn and fail to seek comfort from anyone. This type of attachment problem is parallel to Reactive Attachment Disorder as defined in DSM and ICD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms as described above.

Boris and Zeanah also describe a condition they term "secure base distortion". In this situation, the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, may cling to the adult, may be excessively compliant, or may show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult.

The third type of disorder discussed by Boris and Zeanah is termed "disrupted attachment". This type of problem, which is not covered under other approaches to disordered attachment, results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. The young child's reaction to such a loss is parallel to the grief reaction of an older person, with progressive changes from protest (crying and searching) to despair, sadness, and withdrawal from communication or play, and finally detachment from the original relationship and recovery of social and play activities.

Most recently, [[Daniel Schechter]] and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between maternal violence-related [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter DS, Willheim E (2009).  Disturbances of attachment and parental psychopathology in early childhood.   Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Issue.  Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Clinics of North America, 18(3), 665-687.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of attachment style==
{{main|Attachment theory | Attachment in children}}
The majority of 1-year-old children can tolerate brief separations from familiar caregivers and are quickly comforted when the caregivers return. These children also use familiar people as a "secure base" and return to them periodically when exploring a new situation. Such children are said to have a secure attachment style, and characteristically continue to develop well both cognitively and emotionally.

Smaller numbers of children show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's behavior at 12 months is not a serious problem, they appear to be on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.

Insecure attachment styles in toddlers involve unusual reunions after separation from a familiar person. The children may snub the returning caregiver, or may go to the person but then resist being picked up. They may reunite with the caregiver, but then persistently cling to him/her, and fail to return to their previous play. These children are more likely to have later social problems with peers and teachers, but some of them spontaneously develop better ways of interacting with other people.

A small group of toddlers show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness of the person who is being sought.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J (2006) p 107&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;VanIJzendoorn &amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible mechanisms==
One study has reported a connection between a specific [[genetic marker]] and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting.&lt;ref name= "Van Ijzendoorn &amp;amp; Bakermans-Kranenburg (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Ijzendoorn MH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ |title=DRD4 7-repeat polymorphism moderates the association between maternal unresolved loss or trauma and infant disorganization |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=291–307 |year=2006 |pmid=17178609 |doi=10.1080/14616730601048159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another author has compared atypical social behavior in genetic conditions such as [[Williams syndrome]] with behaviors symptomatic of RAD.&lt;ref name ="Zeanah 2007"&gt;Zeanah CH (2007). "Reactive Attachment Disorder". In  Narrow WE, First MB ''et al.'' (Eds.) ''Gender and age consideration in psychiatric diagnosis.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association. {{ISBN|0-89042-295-8}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical attachment development begins with unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to send and receive social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This makes it possible for an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in the toddler and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.&lt;ref name="Dozier ''et al.'' (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dozier M, Stovall KC, Albus KE, Bates B |title=Attachment for infants in foster care: the role of caregiver state of mind |journal=Child Dev |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=1467–77 |year=2001 |pmid=11699682 |doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With insensitive or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, an infant may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways of coping with fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[[DSM-IV]] [[American Psychiatric Association]] 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as the development of an internal working model of social relationships that facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.&lt;ref name="Mercer, Sarner, &amp; Rosa 2003"&gt;Mercer J, Sarner L and Rosa L (2003) ''Attachment Therapy on Trial: The Torture and Death of Candace Newmaker.'' Westport, CT: Praeger {{ISBN|0-275-97675-0}}, pp. 98–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006), pp. 64–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atypical development of fearfulness, with a constitutional tendency either to excessive or inadequate fear reactions, might be necessary before an infant is vulnerable to the effects of poor attachment experiences.&lt;ref name="Marshall &amp; Fox (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marshall, |first=P.J. |authorlink= |author2=Fox, N.A. |year=2005 |month= |title=Relationship between behavioral reactivity at 4 months and attachment classification at 14 months in a selected sample |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=28 |issue= 4|pages=492–502 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2005.06.002 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the two variations of RAD may develop from the same inability to develop "stranger-wariness" due to inadequate care. Appropriate fear responses may only be able to develop after an infant has first begun to form a selective attachment. An infant who is not in a position to do this cannot afford not to show interest in any person as they may be potential attachment figures. Faced with a swift succession of carers the child may have no opportunity to form a selective attachment until the possible biologically-determined sensitive period for developing stranger-wariness has passed. It is thought this process may lead to the disinhibited form.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p"&gt;Prior and Glaser p.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inhibited form infants behave as if their attachment system has been "switched off". However the innate capacity for attachment behavior cannot be lost. This may explain why children diagnosed with the inhibited form of RAD from institutions almost invariably go on to show formation of attachment behavior to good carers. However children who suffer the inhibited form as a consequence of neglect and frequent changes of caregiver continue to show the inhibited form for far longer when placed in families.&lt;ref name="Prior and Glaser p" /&gt;

Additionally, the development of [[Theory of Mind]] ''may'' play a role in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as [[autism]], have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie the development of reactive attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer (2006) p.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fonagy ''et al.''

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Attachment measures}}
Recognised assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the [[Attachment measures|Strange Situation procedure]] ([[Mary Ainsworth]]),&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1978),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Main &amp;amp; Solomon (1986), pp.95-124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Main &amp;amp; Solomon (1990), pp. 121-160.&lt;/ref&gt; the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment ("PAA"),&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment ("ORCE")&lt;ref&gt;[[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]](1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Attachment measures|Attachment Q-sort]] ("AQ-sort").&lt;ref&gt;Waters and Deane (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;
More recent research also uses the [[Attachment measures|Disturbances of Attachment Interview]] or "DAI" developed by Smyke and Zeanah, (1999).&lt;ref&gt;Smyke and Zeanah (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; This is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely having a discriminated, preferred adult, seeking comfort when distressed, responding to comfort when offered, social and emotional reciprocity, emotional regulation, checking back after venturing away from the care giver, reticence with unfamiliar adults, willingness to go off with relative strangers, self endangering behavior, excessive clinging, vigilance/hypercompliance and role reversal.
===Classification===
{{main|Reactive attachment disorder}}

[[ICD-10]] describes [[Reactive attachment disorder|Reactive Attachment Disorder of Childhood]], known as RAD, and Disinhibited Disorder of Childhood, less well known as [[Disinhibited attachment disorder|DAD]]. [[DSM-IV-TR]] also describes Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood. It divides this into two subtypes, Inhibited Type and Disinhibited Type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:
*markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate social relatedness in most contexts,
*the disturbance is not accounted for solely by developmental delay and does not meet the criteria for [[Pervasive Developmental Disorder]],
*onset before 5 years of age,
*requires a history of significant neglect, and
*implicit lack of identifiable, preferred attachment figure.
ICD-10 includes in its diagnosis psychological and physical [[Child abuse|abuse]] and injury in addition to neglect. This is somewhat controversial, being a ''commission'' rather than ''omission'' and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.

The inhibited form is described as "a failure to initiate or respond...to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited responses" and such infants do not seek and accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain 'proximity', an essential element of attachment behavior. The disinhibited form shows "indiscriminate sociability...excessive familiarity with relative strangers" (DSM-IV-TR) and therefore a lack of 'specificity', the second basic element of attachment behavior. The ICD-10 descriptions are comparable. 'Disinhibited' and 'inhibited' are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can co-exist in the same child. The inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver whilst the disinhibited form is more enduring.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser 2006, p. 220-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

While RAD is likely to occur following neglectful and abusive childcare, there should be no automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment disorganization is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p218-219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
{{main|Attachment-based therapy (children)}}
There are a variety of  mainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment disorder, attachment problems and moods or behaviors considered to be potential problems within the context of [[attachment theory]]. All such approaches for infants and younger children concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, changing the caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp;amp; Glaser (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AACAP (2005) p. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BakermansKranenburg ''et al.'' (2003) A meta-analysis of early interventions.&lt;/ref&gt; Such approaches include 'Watch, wait and wonder,'&lt;ref&gt;Cohen ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; manipulation of sensitive responsiveness,&lt;ref&gt;van den Boom (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van den Boom (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; modified 'Interaction Guidance,'.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit ''et al.'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Preschool Parent Psychotherapy,'.&lt;ref&gt;Toth ''et al.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Circle of Security',&lt;ref&gt;Marvin et al. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper et al. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC),&lt;ref name="Dozier et al. 2005"&gt;Dozier ''et al.'' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; the New Orleans Intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Larrieu &amp; Zeanah (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larrieu &amp; Zeannah (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeannah &amp; Smyke (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; and Parent-Child psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Leiberman ''et al.'' (2000), p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Other known treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, Relationship-based therapy (DIR) (also referred to as ''Floor Time'') by [[Stanley Greenspan]], although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of [[pervasive developmental disorders]]&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental &amp; Learning Disorders. (2007). [http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml Dir/floortime model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225132429/http://www.icdl.com/dirFloortime/overview/index.shtml |date=2008-02-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these approaches, such as that suggested by Dozier, consider the attachment status of the adult caregiver to play an important role in the development of the emotional connection between adult and child. This includes foster parents, as children with poor attachment experiences often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses from their attachment behaviors despite 'normative' care.&lt;ref name="Dozier et al. 2005" /&gt;

Treatment for reactive attachment disorder for children usually involves a mix of therapy, counseling, and parenting education. These must be designed to make sure the child has a safe environment to live in and to develop positive interactions with caregivers and improves their relationships with their peers.

Medication can be used as a way to treat similar conditions, like depression, anxiety, or hyperactivity; however, there is no quick fix for treating reactive attachment disorder. A pediatrician may recommend a treatment plan. For example, a mix of family therapy, individual psychological counseling, play therapy, special education services and parenting skills classes.&lt;ref name="Types of treatment for reactive attachment disorder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helpguide.org/mental/parenting_bonding_reactive_attachment_disorder.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126145603/http://helpguide.org/mental/parenting_bonding_reactive_attachment_disorder.htm |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }} , 'HelpGuide.org', 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscientific diagnoses and treatment==
{{main|Attachment therapy}}
In the absence of officially recognized [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] criteria, and beyond the ambit of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians to refer to a broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al., (2006) p 81&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al.

A common feature of this form of diagnosis within [[attachment therapy]] is the use of extensive lists of "symptoms" which include many behaviours that are likely to be a consequence of neglect or abuse, but are not related to attachment, or not related to any clinical disorder at all. Such lists have been described as "wildly inclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p186-187&lt;/ref&gt; The APSAC Taskforce (2006) gives examples of such lists ranging across multiple domains from some elements within the DSM-IV criteria to entirely non-specific behavior such as developmental lags, destructive behaviors, refusal to make eye contact, cruelty to animals and siblings, lack of cause and effect thinking, preoccupation with fire, blood and gore, poor peer relationships, stealing, lying, lack of a conscience, persistent nonsense questions or incessant chatter, poor impulse control, abnormal speech patterns, fighting for control over everything, and hoarding or gorging on food. Some checklists suggest that among infants, "prefers dad to mom" or "wants to hold the bottle as soon as possible" are indicative of attachment problems. The APSAC Taskforce expresses concern that high rates of [[false positive]] diagnoses are virtually certain and that posting these types of lists on web sites that also serve as marketing tools may lead many parents or others to conclude inaccurately that their children have attachment disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin (2006) p 82&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a considerable variety of treatments for alleged attachment disorders diagnosed on the controversial alternative basis outlined above, popularly known as [[attachment therapy]]. These therapies have little or no evidence base and vary from talking or play therapies to more extreme forms of physical and coercive techniques, of which the best known are [[holding therapy]], [[Rebirthing (attachment therapy)|rebirthing]], [[rage-reduction]] and the Evergreen model. In general these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. Critics maintain these therapies are not based on an accepted version of [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) p 262&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical base is broadly a combination of [[Age regression in therapy|regression]] and [[catharsis]], accompanied by parenting methods which emphasise [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] and parental control.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin ''et al.'' 2006, p. 79–80. The APSAC Taskforce Report.&lt;/ref&gt; These therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006) p 79&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated six children have died as a consequence of the more coercive forms of such treatments and the application of the accompanying parenting techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Boris 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, Sarner &amp; Rosa 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeanah 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most well-known cases are those of [[Candace Newmaker]] in 2001 and the [[Michael and Sharen Gravelle|Gravelles]] in 2003 through 2005. Following the associated publicity, some advocates of attachment therapy began to alter views and practices to be less potentially dangerous to children. This change may have been hastened by the publication of a Task Force Report on the subject in January 2006, commissioned by the [[American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children]] (APSAC) which was largely critical of attachment therapy, although these practices continue.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffin et al. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, ATTACh, an organisation originally set up by attachment therapists, formally adopted a White Paper stating its unequivocal opposition to the use of coercive practices in therapy and parenting.&lt;ref name="attach07"&gt;{{Cite web|title=ATTACh White paper on coercion|year=2007|url=http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=ATTACh|accessdate=2008-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072425/http://www.attach.org/WhitePaper.pdf|archive-date=2007-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], a '''beneficial organism''' is any [[organism]] that benefits the growing process, including [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, other [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[nematode]]s. Benefits include [[pest control]], [[pollination]], and maintenance of [[soil health]]. The opposite of beneficial organisms are [[pest (animal)|pest]]s, which are organisms deemed detrimental to the growing process.There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain  insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots.

==Beneficial or pest==
The distinction between ''beneficial'' and ''pest'' is arbitrary, subjectively determined by examining the effect of a particular organism in a specific growing situation.There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain  insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots.

With beneficial organisms there is a flip side to these helpful organisms and that's the non beneficial organisms. These organisms hinder or stop the growing process or prey on beneficial organisms. Examples of these are Aphids, Assassin Bugs, and Japanese beetles. Aphids are attracted by pollen which is bad for plants because the aphids feed on the plants after they are located from spreading their pollen. Assassin Bugs are non beneficial because they feed on many beneficial insects by stabbing them with a horn on their head repeated times living up to its name "Assassin bug". Japanese beetles are especially a pest to gardeners and plants because the larva feed on the stems and roots while full grown beetles feed on leaves and flowers killing the plant.

===Insects===
[[Beneficial insect]]s can include predators (such as [[ladybug]]s) of pest insects, and [[pollinators]] (such as [[bee]]s, which are an integral part of the growth cycle of many crops). Increasingly certain species of insects are managed and used to intervene where natural pollination or biological control is insufficient, usually due to human disturbance of the balance of nature.

===Nematodes===
Certain microscopic [[nematodes]] (worms) are beneficial in destroying and controlling populations of larvae that are damaging or deadly to crops and other plants. They are commonly used in organic gardening for their ability to kill various kinds of harmful larvae ([[fungus gnat]]s, [[flea]] larvae, [[spidermite]]s, [[weevil]]s, [[Larva|grub]]s, [[rootworm]]s, [[cutworm]]s, etc.)

===Animals===
[[Bird]]s and other animals may, by their actions, improve conditions in various growing situations, and in such cases are also beneficials. Birds assist in the spread of seeds by ingesting the fruits and berries of plants, then depositing the seeds in their droppings. Other animals, such as raccoons, bears, etc. provide similar benefits.

===Plants===
Plants that perform positive functions can also be considered beneficials ([[companion planting]] is one technique based on principle of beneficial plants).

==Issues==

In agriculture, controversy surrounds the concept of beneficial insects. Much of this has to do with the effect of [[agrichemicals]], like [[insecticides]], [[herbicides]] and large quantities of synthetic [[fertilizers]], on what are considered beneficials. Citing the reduction or elimination of various organisms as a side effect of agrichemical-based farming, some argue that critical damage is being done to the [[ecosystem]], to the point where conventional agriculture is [[sustainability|unsustainable]]. For example, if bee populations are reduced by insecticides aimed at other pests, pollination is inhibited and crops don't appear. If soil microorganisms are killed off, natural [[soil regeneration]] is inhibited, and reliance on mechanical and chemical inputs to keep the soil viable is increased. The longer term impact of these conditions has not been determined. Commercial ventures currently exist to provide pollinators and [[biological pest control]].

'''Blasticidin S''' is an [[antibiotic]] that is produced by ''[[Streptomyces griseochromogenes]]''.  In biological research, specifically [[genetic engineering]], it is used to select transformed cells which have been engineered to carry a resistance gene for blasticidin.  In short, [[DNA]] of interest is fused to DNA encoding a resistance gene, and then is transformed into cells.  After allowing time for recovery and for cells to begin transcribing and translating their new DNA, blasticidin is added.  Now only the cells that have the new DNA can grow.

== History ==
In the 1950s, a drug screening program was designed in [[Japan]] to discover a new antibiotic that prevents [[Magnaporthe grisea|Blast Disease]] by the [[fungus]] ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Products Isolation: Separation Methods for Antimicrobials, Antivirals, and Enzyme Inhibitors. Wagman G. H., Elsevier R. C.; p. 191 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance genes ==
Three resistance genes have been cloned:

*  bls (an [[acetyltransferase]]), isolated from ''[[Streptoverticillium]] sp.'', which itself produces blasticidin in a natural example of biological warfare.
* bsr (a [[blasticidin-S deaminase]]), isolated from ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' (other bsr genes are known as well, see listings in [[Genbank]]).
* BSD (another [[deaminase]]), isolated from ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]''.

bsr and BSD are the most commonly used resistance genes.  The proteins produced from these genes enable the cells carrying them to produce proteins in the presence of blasticidin.

== Mechanism of action ==
Blasticidin prevents the growth of both [[eukaryotic]] and [[prokaryotic]] cells.  It works by inhibiting termination step of translation and peptide bond formation (to lesser extent) by the [[ribosome]].  This means that cells can no longer produce new proteins through [[translation (genetics)|translation]] of [[mRNA]].

[[File:The logo of the Centre for Integrative Bee Research as used since 2010.jpg|thumb|The Ciber Logo]]
The '''Centre for Integrative Bee Research''' ('''CIBER''') is located on the Crawley campus at the [[University of Western Australia]] in [[Perth]]. CIBER conducts basic scientific research into [[honeybee]] reproduction, immunity and ecology and aligns its work with the needs of industrial and governmental partners. CIBER is specifically dedicated to facilitate interdisciplinary research and offers opportunities for scientists to perform collaborative research on honeybees using methods and approaches from [[systems biology]] and [[evolutionary ecology]]. The ultimate goal is to better understand how individual molecules and their interplay are responsible for complex biological process such as sexual reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER is done in close collaboration with the local [[beekeeping]] industry, notably the Better Bees of Western Australia bee breeding program. The research group consists of 20–30 researchers from all different academic levels as well as representatives from the governmental and honeybee industry sector.  The research group also runs an outreach program and was involved in the making of the theatrical movie ''[[More than Honey]]''.

== History ==

Reports about dramatic declines in a number of global honeybee populations, especially in commercially managed stock, resulted in an inquiry of the Australian Parliament into the future of the Australian honey bee industry. A house standing committee on Primary Industries and Resources finally published a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=House of Representatives, Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Resources|title=More Than Honey: The future of the Australian honey bee and pollination industries |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=/pir/honeybee/report.htm|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 June 2008 that summarised the situation of the honeybee industry in Australia.  Among a large number of recommendations, the report identified an urgent need for more research to address existing and future problems of Australian honeybees, the bee industry and recommended a substantial increase in funding for honeybee research. The need for additional and coordinated research into honeybees stimulated in a number of initiatives from Australian researchers and research institutions. However, it became clear that the geographical isolation of Western Australia and the ban to import bees or some bee products into the state requires the buildup of a specific research hub. CIBER was formally set up as the Collaborative Initiative for Bee Research at the [[University of Western Australia]] in 2008 and was renamed in 2011 to Centre for Integrative Bee Research. The name change coincided with the introduction of a new logo, that is currently still in use. In 2017 CIBER shifted its operations from the University of Western Australia to the University of California, Riverside campus.  See http://ciber.ucr.acsitefactory.com/

== Research ==
The interdisciplinary approach is one of the core characteristics of CIBER’s activities, which run along two different gradients: First, CIBER connects several disciplines of research including the molecular and nano sciences, evolutionary biology, and sociobiology, as well as economics. Second, CIBER bridges fundamental and applied sciences by generating new knowledge in areas of practical interest for honeybee industry partners. CIBER uses a number of modern molecular technologies such as [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]] to identify molecules involved in physiological processes such as reproduction or immunity. Research conducted at CIBER pioneered a novel scientific field in research known as evolutionary proteomics. The central idea is to understand how evolutionary processes operate on the molecular level. Researchers at CIBER conducted the first large scale analyses of the proteins present in glandular secretions supporting honeybee sperm, such as seminal fluid and spermathecal fluid.

For experimental work, CIBER maintains and breeds its own bee stock of around 60 colonies, kept at an apiary on the campus of the University of Western Australia. During the winter month, most of the bee stock is moved north to overwintering grounds.

CIBER personnel is represented in a number of National boards and councils to provide expertise and advice on issues about honeybees, for example the [http://www.rirdc.gov.au/research-programs/animal-industries/honeybee RIRDC Honeybee Advisory Board], the Primary Producers Committee or the  [http://asianhoneybee.net.au/ Asian Honeybee Transition to Management Scientific Advisory group].

== Collaboration with the honeybee industry ==
A number of research projects are done in collaboration with local beekeepers. To do this, CIBER received funding in 2009 from the [[Australian Research Council]] to conduct research on male honeybee fertility together with '''Better Bees of Western Australia''' as an industry partner. 
Better Bees of Western Australia is a group of 8 commercial beekeepers. Each individual beekeeper owns and maintains some of the 24 bee lineages that are recognized as part of "The Western Australian Bee Breeding Program". The aim of the honey bee breeding program is to maintain a genetic pool of honey bee breeding stock for the WA apiary industry to use in maintaining a healthy population of managed honeybees.
In 2013 CIBER and Better Bees received a second grant from the [[Australian Research Council]] to study the fungal disease Nosema and its interactions with the honeybee immune system.

== CIBER outreach ==
The research and activities of CIBER are communicated to the broader public through an outreach program, which includes the organisation of public lectures and seminars, the showing of bees to the public and in schools and exhibitions, as well as activities during the yearly honeybee week. In 2011, CIBER and the [[Perth]] based museum SciTech organised an exhibition "The Science of Honeybees", which initially ran for 6 months at SciTech, then toured through schools and libraries in Western Australia. The success of the exhibition insipired plans for a permanent CIBER - Honeybee exhibition at [[Scitech|SciTech]], which was scheduled to open in 2013.
CIBER also maintains its own [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Centre-for-Integrative-Bee-Research-CIBER/107607792730734 facebook page], which allows interested users to follow ongoing activities at CIBER as well as get updated information on honeybees in general.
CIBER is also involved in organisation of the yearly Honey Week, which is held annually in May. Honey week is an Australia-wide initiative to showcase bees and beekeeping to the public.
The outreach activities of CIBER were awarded with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140923093546/http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/science/ScienceAwards/Pages/2014Winners.aspx Premier's Science Award] of Western Australia in 2014, acknowledging its success in raising community awareness about the importance of honeybees in the environment.

== ''More than Honey'' movie==
CIBER was involved in the making of the theatrical documentary ''[[More than Honey]]'' by Swiss film maker [[Markus Imhoof]], which was released into several European movie theatres in 2012. The group provided scientific advisory for the film, and some of the research conducted at CIBER is featured in the film. The movie had its world premiere on 11 August 2012, concluding the [[Locarno film festival]] in Switzerland and was later on shown at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) in September 2012. The documentary was the most successful Swiss film of 2012 and is the most successful Swiss documentary movie of all time. The movie was awarded more than 25 international prizes such as the German and Swiss Film Awards for best documentary, and became the Swiss candidate for a nomination in the category of Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards (Oscar) . CIBER actively promoted screenings of the movie in Australia as part of the [http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/fia/ffg/fil/fuef/enindex.htm German Film Festival] and maintains the official [http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/ English] and [http://www.ciber.science.uwa.edu.au/blog/?lang=de German] blog of the movie.

== Future Bees Fund ==

For fund raising purposes and in order to finance activities such as bee research, beekeeping and outreach activities, CIBER set up the [http://www.futurebeesfund.org Future Bees Fund] in 2013, which is a non-profit fund located at the University of Western Australia. A board consisting of representatives from research and the bee keeping industry decides on the usage of funds available and to help publicise the fund activities.

The '''Chapman–Jouguet condition''' holds approximately in [[detonation]] waves in [[high explosive]]s. It states that the detonation propagates at a [[velocity]] at which the reacting gases just reach [[sonic velocity]] (in the frame of the leading [[shock wave]]) as the reaction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cooper |first=Paul W. |title=Explosives Engineering |location=New York |publisher=Wiley-VCH |year=1996 |isbn=0-471-18636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Wildon |last1=Fickett |first2=William C. |last2=Davis |title=Detonation |publisher=U.

In more detail (in the ZND model) in the frame of the leading shock of the detonation wave, gases enter at supersonic velocity and are compressed through the shock to a high-density, subsonic flow. This sudden change in pressure initiates the chemical (or sometimes, as in [[steam explosion]]s, physical) energy release. The energy release re-accelerates the flow back to the local speed of sound. It can be shown fairly simply, from the one-dimensional gas equations for steady flow, that the reaction must cease at the sonic ("CJ") plane, or there would be discontinuously large pressure [[gradient]]s at that point.

The sonic plane forms a so-called choke point that enables the lead shock, and reaction zone, to travel at a constant velocity, undisturbed by the expansion of gases in the [[rarefaction]] region beyond the CJ plane.

This simple one-dimensional model is quite successful in explaining detonations. However, observations of the structure of real chemical detonations show a complex three-dimensional structure, with parts of the wave traveling faster than average, and others slower.  Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

The '''Rayleigh line''' equation and the '''Hugoniot curve''' equation obtained from the [[Rankine–Hugoniot conditions#Simplified Rankine-Hugoniot relations|Rankine–Hugoniot relations]] for an [[ideal gas]], with the assumption of constant specific heat and constant molecular weight, respectively are

\tilde p = &amp;\frac{[2\alpha + (\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]-\tilde v}{[(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)]\tilde v-1},

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat ratio]] and

Here the subscript 1 and 2 identifies flow properties (pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, density &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;) upstream and downstream of the wave and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the constant mass flux and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat released in the wave.

At the Chapman-Jouguet point, both slopes are equal, leading the condition that

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde p = \frac{\tilde v}{(\gamma+1)\tilde v-\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this back into the Rayleigh equation, we find 

:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \gamma\frac{\tilde p}{\tilde v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the definition of mass flux &lt;math&gt;m\equiv \rho_1 u_1=\rho_2 u_2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; denotes the flow velocity, we find

:&lt;math&gt;M_2 = \frac{u_2}{c_2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Mach number]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]], in other words, downstream flow is sonic with respect to the Chapman-Jouguet wave. Explicit expression for the variables can be derived,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tilde p_{\pm} &amp;= 1 + \alpha(\gamma-1)\left\{1\pm\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\},  \\
\tilde v_{\pm} &amp;= 1 + \frac{\alpha(\gamma-1)}{\gamma}\left\{1\mp\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\}, \\
\mu_{\pm} &amp;= \gamma + \alpha(\gamma^2-1)\left\{1\pm\left[1+\frac{2\gamma}{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}\right]^{1/2}\right\}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The upper sign applies for the '''Upper Chapman-Jouguet''' point ([[detonation]]) and the lower sign applies for the '''Lower Chapman-Jouguet''' point ([[deflagration]]). Similarly, the upstream Mach number can be found from

:&lt;math&gt;M_{1\pm} = \left[1+\frac{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}{2\gamma}\right]^{1/2} \pm \left[\frac{\alpha(\gamma^2-1)}{2\gamma}\right]^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the temperature ratio &lt;math&gt;\tilde T=T_2/T_1&lt;/math&gt; can be found from the relation &lt;math&gt;\tilde T=\tilde p\tilde v&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''clone''' is a group of ''identical'' cells that share a ''common ancestry'', meaning they are derived from the same cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=2754|title=Clone definition - Medical Dictionary definitions of popular medical terms easily defined on MedTerms&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|date=2013-08-28|website=MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clonality implies the state of a cell or a substance being derived from one source or the other. Thus there are terms like ''polyclonal''—derived from '''many''' clones; ''oligoclonal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical.merriam-webster.com/medical/oligoclonal|title=oligoclonal - Definition from Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;—derived from a '''few''' clones; and ''monoclonal''—derived from '''one''' clone. These terms are most commonly used in context of [[Monoclonal antibody|antibodies]] or [[White blood cell|immunocytes]].

==Contexts==

This concept of clone assumes importance as all the cells that form a clone share common ancestry, which has a very significant consequence: shared [[genotype]].

# One of the most prominent usage is in describing a clone of [[B cell]]s. The B cells in the body have two important [[phenotypes]] (functional forms) -- the antibody secreting, terminally differentiated (that is, they cannot divide further) plasma cells, and the memory and the naive cells—both of which retain their proliferative potential.
# Another important area where one can talk of "clones" of cells is [[neoplasm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pozo-Garcia |first1=Lucia |last2=Diaz-Cano |first2=Salvador J. |last3=Taback |first3=Bret |last4=Hoon |first4=Dave S.B. |title=Clonal origin and expansions in neoplasms: biologic and technical aspects must be considered together |journal=The American Journal of Pathology |date=January 2003 |volume=162 |issue=1 |pages=353–355 |doi=10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63826-6|doi-access=free |pmid=12507918 |pmc=1851102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the tumors derive from [[neoplasm#Clonality|one]] (sufficiently) mutated cell, so they are technically a single clone of cells. However, during course of cell division, one of the cells can get mutated further and acquire new characteristics to diverge as a new clone. However, this view of cancer onset has been challenged in recent years and many tumors have been argued to have polyclonal origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsons |first1=Barbara L. |title=Many different tumor types have polyclonal tumor origin: evidence and implications. |journal=Mutation Research |date=September 2008 |volume=659 |issue=3 |pages=232-47 |doi=10.1016/j.mrrev.2008.05.004 |pmid=18614394}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. derived from two or more cells or clones,  including malignant mesothelioma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comertpay |first1=Sabahattin |last2=Pastorino |first2=Sandra |last3=Tanji |first3=Mika |last4=Mezzapelle |first4=Rosanna |last5=Strianese |first5=Oriana |last6=Napolitano |first6=Andrea |last7=Baumann |first7=Francine |last8=Weigel |first8=Tracey |last9=Friedberg |first9=Joseph |last10=Sugarbaker |first10=Paul |last11=Krausz |first11=Thomas |last12=Wang |first12=Ena |last13=Powers |first13=Amy |last14=Gaudino |first14=Giovanni |last15=Kanodia |first15=Shreya |last16=Pass |first16=Harvey I |last17=Parsons |first17=Barbara L |last18=Yang |first18=Haining |last19=Carbone |first19=Michele |title=Evaluation of clonal origin of malignant mesothelioma |journal=Journal of Translational Medicine |date=4 December 2014 |volume=12 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/s12967-014-0301-3|doi-access=free |pmid=25471750 |pmc=4255423|display-authors=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# All the [[granulosa cells]] in a [[ovarian follicle|Graafian follicle]] are in fact clones.
# [[Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria]] is a disorder of bone marrow cells resulting in shortened life of red blood cells, which is also a result of clonal expansion, i.e., all the altered cells are originally derived from a single cell, which also somewhat compromises the functioning of other "normal" bone marrow cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Basis of clonal proliferation==

Most other cells cannot divide indefinitely as after a few cycles of cell division the cells stop expressing an enzyme [[telomerase]]. The genetic material, in the form of [[deoxyribonucleic acid|deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)]], continues to shorten with each cell division, and cells eventually stop dividing when they sense that their DNA is critically shortened. However, this enzyme in "youthful" cells replaces these lost bits ([[nucleotides]]) of DNA, thus making almost unlimited cycles of cell division possible. It is believed that the above-mentioned tissues have a constitutional elevated expression of telomerase. When ultimately many cells are produced by a single cell, ''clonal expansion'' is said to have taken place.

==Concept of clonal colony==

A somewhat similar concept is that of a ''[[clonal colony]]'' (also called a ''genet''), wherein the cells (usually unicellular) also share a common ancestry, but which also requires the products of clonal expansion to reside at "one place", or in close proximity. A clonal colony would be well exemplified by a [[cell culture|bacterial culture]] colony, or the bacterial films that are more likely to be found ''in vivo'' (e.g., in infected multicellular hosts). Whereas, the cells of clones dealt with here are specialized cells of a multicellular organism (usually vertebrates), and reside at quite distant places. For instance, two plasma cells belonging to the same clone could be derived from different memory cells (in turn with shared clonality) and could be residing in quite distant locations, such as the cervical (in the neck) and inguinal (in the groin) [[lymph node]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16683">'''Computer art''' is any [[art]] in which [[computer]]s play a role in production or display of the artwork.  Such art can be an image, sound, animation, [[video]], [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD-ROM]], [[video game]], [[website]], [[algorithm]], [[performance]] or gallery installation. Many traditional disciplines are now integrating [[Digital data|digital]] technologies and, as a result, the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers has been blurred. For instance, an artist may combine traditional [[painting]] with [[algorithm art]] and other digital techniques.   As a result, defining computer art by its end product can thus be difficult.  Computer art is bound to change over time since changes in technology and [[software]] directly affect what is possible.

== The term "computer art" ==
On the title page of the magazine ''Computers and Automation'', January 1963, Edmund Berkeley published a picture by [[Efraim Arazi]] from 1962, coining for it the term "computer art." This picture inspired him to initiate the first [[Computer Art Contest]] in 1963. The annual contest was a key point in the development of computer art up to the year 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/Publication/206|title=Computers and Automation - Database of Digital Art|author=|date=|website=dada.compart-bremen.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert W.

{{further|Mathematics and art}}

The precursor of computer art dates back to 1956–1958, with the generation of what is probably the first image of a human being on a computer screen, a ([[George Petty]]-inspired)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/the_first_ever_computer_art_was_made_possible_by_the_cold_war_and_it_was_a |title=Boobs not bombs: The first ever computer art was made possible by the Cold War... &amp; it was a girly pic |publisher=Dangerous Minds |date=2013-01-25 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pin-up]] girl at a [[Semi-Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] air defense installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/01/the-never-before-told-story-of-the-worlds-first-computer-art-its-a-sexy-dame/267439/ |title=The Never-Before-Told Story of the World's First Computer Art (It's a Sexy Dame) |author= Benj Edwards |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desmond Paul Henry]] invented the Henry Drawing Machine in 1960; his work was shown at the Reid Gallery in London in 1962, after his machine-generated art won him the privilege of a one-man exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=O'Hanrahan, Elaine |year=2005 |title=Drawing Machines: The machine produced drawings of Dr. D.

By the mid-1960s, most individuals involved in the creation of computer art were in fact engineers and scientists because they had access to the only computing resources available at university scientific research labs. Many artists tentatively began to explore the emerging computing technology for use as a creative tool. In the summer of 1962, [[A. Michael Noll]] programmed a digital computer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey to generate visual patterns solely for artistic purposes .&lt;ref&gt;Noll, A. Michael, “The Beginnings of Computer Art in the United States: A Memoir,” ''Leonardo'', Vol. 27, No. 1, (1994), pp. 39-44.&lt;/ref&gt; His later computer-generated patterns simulated paintings by [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Bridget Riley]] and became classics.&lt;ref name="design.osu.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/dietrich-leonardo.pdf|format=PDF|title= Visual Intelligence: The First Decade of Computer Art |accessdate=2008-04-28 |author=Dietrich, Frank |year= 1986 |pages= 159–169|publisher=Leonardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noll also used the patterns to investigate aesthetic preferences in the mid-1960s.

The two early exhibitions of computer art were held in 1965: Generative Computergrafik, February 1965, at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart, Germany, and Computer-Generated Pictures, April 1965, at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York. The Stuttgart exhibit featured work by [[Georg Nees]]; the New York exhibit featured works by Bela Julesz and A. Michael Noll and was reviewed as art by ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Stuart, “Art ex Machina,” ''The New York Times'', Sunday, April 18, 1965, p. X23.&lt;/ref&gt; A third exhibition was put up in November 1965 at Galerie Wendelin Niedlich in Stuttgart, Germany, showing works by [[Frieder Nake]] and Georg Nees. Analogue computer art by Maughan Mason along with digital computer art by Noll were exhibited at the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference in Las Vegas toward the end of 1965.

In 1968, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] (ICA) in London hosted one of the most influential early exhibitions of computer art called [[Cybernetic Serendipity]]. The exhibition included many of whom often regarded as the first digital artists, [[Nam June Paik]], Frieder Nake, Leslie Mezei, Georg Nees, A. Michael Noll, [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], and [[Charles Csuri]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Raimes, Jonathan. (2006 ) The Digital Canvas, Abrams. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-9236-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later, the [[Computer Arts Society]] was founded, also in London.&lt;ref&gt;Page, No. 1, April 1969, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the opening of Cybernetic Serendipity, in August 1968, a symposium was held in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, under the title "Computers and visual research".&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Klütsch: [http://www.computerkunst.org/Kluetsch_London_Zagreb.pdf ''The Summer 1968 in London and Zagreb: Starting or End Point for Computer art?''] (PDF 2,19 MB).&lt;/ref&gt; It took up the European artists movement of New Tendencies that had led to three exhibitions (in 1961, 63, and 65) in Zagreb of concrete, kinetic, and constructive art as well as op art and conceptual art. New Tendencies changed its name to "Tendencies" and continued with more symposia, exhibitions, a competition, and an international journal (bit international) until 1973.

[[Katherine Nash]] and Richard Williams published ''Computer Program for Artists: ART 1'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nash, Katherine|author2=Richard H. Williams|title=Computer Program for Artists: ART I|journal=Leonardo |volume= 3|issue=4|date=October 1970|pages=439–442|doi=10.2307/1572264|jstor=1572264|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[PARC (company)|Xerox Corporation’s Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) designed the first [[Graphical User Interface]] (GUI) in the 1970s. The first [[Macintosh computer]] is released in 1984, since then the GUI became popular. Many graphic designers quickly accepted its capacity as a creative tool.

==Output devices==
Formerly, technology restricted output and print results: early machines used pen-and-ink plotters to produce basic hard copy.

In the early 1960s, the Stromberg Carlson SC-4020 microfilm printer was used at Bell Telephone Laboratories as a plotter to produce digital computer art and animation on 35-mm microfilm. Still images were drawn on the face plate of the cathode ray tube and automatically photographed. A series of still images were drawn to create a computer-animated movie, early on a roll of 35-mm film and then on 16-mm film as a 16-mm camera was later added to the SC-4020 printer.

In the 1970s, the dot matrix printer (which was much like a [[typewriter]]) was used to reproduce varied fonts and arbitrary graphics. The first animations were created by plotting all still frames sequentially on a stack of paper, with motion transfer to 16-mm film for projection.  During the 1970s and 1980s, dot matrix printers were used to produce most visual output while microfilm plotters were used for most early animation.&lt;ref name="design.osu.edu"/&gt;

In 1976, the [[inkjet printer]] was invented with the increase in use of personal computers.  The inkjet printer is now the cheapest and most versatile option for everyday digital color output. Raster Image Processing (RIP) is typically built into the printer or supplied as a software package for the computer; it is required to achieve the highest quality output.  Basic inkjet devices do not feature RIP.  Instead, they rely on graphic software to rasterize images.  The [[laser printer]], though more expensive than the inkjet, is another affordable output device available today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Graphic software ==
[[Adobe Systems]], founded in 1982, developed the [[PostScript]] language and digital fonts, making drawing painting and image manipulation software popular. [[Adobe Illustrator]], a vector drawing program based on the [[Bézier curve]] introduced in 1987 and [[Adobe Photoshop]], written by brothers Thomas and John Knoll in 1990 were developed for use on MacIntosh computers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Bruce Wands| title=Art of the digital age| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HguVQgAACAAJ| year=2006| isbn=978-0-500-23817-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled for DOS/Windows platforms by 1993.

[[File:zanellehead.jpg|thumb|right|A robotic brush head painting on a canvas]]

== Robot painting ==
A ''robot painting'' is an artwork painted by a robot. It differs from other forms of printing that uses machinery such as [[offset printing]] and [[inkjet printing]], in that the artwork is made up of actual brush strokes and artist grade paints. Many robot paintings are indistinguishable from artist created paintings.

One of the first robot painters was [[AARON]], an artificial intelligence/artist developed by Professor [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]], UCSD, in the mid-1970s. Another pioneer in the field, [[Ken Goldberg]] of UC Berkeley created an 11' x 11' painting machine in 1992. Multiple other robotic painters exist though none are currently mass-produced.

== Neural style transfer ==
[[File:Jimmy Wales in France, with the style of Munch's "The Scream" applied using neural style transfer.jpg|thumb|A [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jimbo_Wales_in_France.jpg photo] of [[Jimmy Wales]] rendered in the style of ''[[The Scream]]'' using neural style transfer]]

Non-photorealistic rendering (using computers to automatically transform images into stylized art) has been a subject of research since the 1990s. Around 2015, ''neural style transfer'' using [[convolutional neural networks]] to transfer the style of an artwork onto a photograph or other target image became feasible&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576&lt;/ref&gt;. One method of style transfer involves using a framework such as VGG or ResNet to break the artwork style down into statistics about visual [[feature (computer vision)|features]]. The target photograph is subsequently modified to match those statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Jing, Y., Yang, Y., Feng, Z., Ye, J., &amp; Song, M. (2017).

A '''conflict of interest''' ('''COI''') is a situation in which a [[person]] or [[organization]] is involved in multiple [[wikt:interest#Noun|interests]], [[finance|financial]] or otherwise, and serving one interest could involve working against another.  Typically, this relates to situations in which the personal interest of an individual or organization might adversely affect a duty owed to [[decision-making|make decisions]] for the benefit of a third party.

The presence of a conflict of interest is independent of the occurrence of [[Inappropriateness|impropriety]]. Therefore, a conflict of interest can be discovered and voluntarily defused before any [[corruption]] occurs. A conflict of interest exists if the circumstances are reasonably believed (on the basis of past experience and objective evidence) to create a risk that a decision ''may'' be unduly influenced by other, secondary interests, and not on whether a particular individual ''is actually'' influenced by a secondary interest.

A widely used definition is: "A conflict of interest is a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest."&lt;ref&gt;Lo and Field (2009). The definition originally appeared in Thompson (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Primary interest'' refers to the principal goals of the profession or activity, such as the protection of clients, the health of patients, the integrity of research, and the duties of public officer. ''Secondary interest'' includes personal benefit and is not limited to only financial gain but also such motives as the desire for professional advancement, or the wish to do favours for family and friends. These secondary interests are not treated as wrong in and of themselves, but become objectionable when they are believed to have greater weight than the primary interests. Conflict of interest rules in the public sphere mainly focus on financial relationships since they are relatively more objective, [[fungible]], and quantifiable, and usually involve the political, legal, and medical fields.

==Related to the practice of law==
{{Professional responsibility}}
[[Judicial disqualification]], also referred to as ''recusal'', refers to the act of abstaining from participation in an official action such as a court case/legal proceeding due to a conflict of interest of the [[Judge|presiding court official]] or administrative officer. Applicable statutes or canons of [[ethics]] may provide standards for recusal in a given proceeding or matter. Providing that the judge or presiding officer must be free from disabling conflicts of interest makes the fairness of the proceedings less likely to be questioned.&lt;ref name="RepublicLost"&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 29-32&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Practice of law|legal profession]], the duty of loyalty owed to a client prohibits an attorney (or a [[law firm]]) from representing any other party with interests adverse to those of a current client. The few exceptions to this rule require informed written consent from all affected clients, ''i.e.'', an "ethical wall". In some circumstances, a conflict of interest can never be waived by a client. In perhaps the most common example encountered by the general public, the same firm should not represent both parties in a divorce or child custody matter. Found conflict can lead to denial or [[disgorgement]] of legal fees, or in some cases (such as the failure to make mandatory disclosure), criminal proceedings. In 1998, a [[Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy]] partner was found guilty of failing to disclose a conflict of interest, disbarred, and sentenced to 15 months of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cT1BOgQ2Ys8C&amp;pg=PA11370&amp;lpg=PA11370&amp;dq=john+gellene+%2215+months%22+%22conflict+of+interest%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GO9XmpZcSq&amp;sig=R9AXUOiM166xEUmIFK60uZsa0dg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyj5vt0ILZAhWpmeAKHefyBOEQ6AEIMzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20gellene%20%2215%20months%22%20%22conflict%20of%20interest%22&amp;f=false ''Congressional Record''], V. 146, Pt. 8, June 13, 2000 to June 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1148010.html ''US v. Gellene''] (Seventh Circuit, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corrine Cooper. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0gJ29QfukWkC&amp;pg=PA304&amp;lpg=PA304&amp;dq=john+gellene+%2215+months%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_8FHwD9-To&amp;sig=i-v1J7aQ569UbhiXoSbZ004mLWo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjv9IuYz4LZAhXKMd8KHdtHAiAQ6AEIRjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20gellene%20%2215%20months%22&amp;f=false ''Attorney Liability in Bankruptcy''] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a law firm usually cannot represent a client if the client's interests conflict with those of another client, even if the two clients are represented by separate lawyers within the firm, unless (in some jurisdictions) the lawyer is segregated from the rest of the firm for the duration of the conflict. Law firms often employ software in conjunction with their case management and accounting systems in order to meet their duties to monitor their conflict of interest exposure and to assist in obtaining waivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_1_7_conflict_of_interest_current_clients.html|title=Rule 1.7: Conflict of Interest: Current Clients {{!}} The Center for Professional Responsibility|website=www.americanbar.org|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generally (unrelated to the practice of law)==
More generally, conflicts of interest can be defined as any situation in which an individual or corporation (either private or governmental) is in a position to exploit a professional or official capacity in some way for their personal or corporate benefit.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics and Corporate Responsibility|last=Griseri|first=Paul|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|year=2010|isbn=9781408007433|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending upon the law or rules related to a particular organization, the existence of a conflict of interest may not, in and of itself, be evidence of wrongdoing. In fact, for many professionals, it is virtually impossible to avoid having conflicts of interest from time to time. A conflict of interest can, however, become a legal matter, for example, when an individual tries (and/or succeeds in) influencing the outcome of a decision, for personal benefit. A director or executive of a corporation will be subject to legal liability if a conflict of interest breaches his/her [[duty of loyalty]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There often is confusion over these two situations. Someone accused of a conflict of interest may deny that a conflict exists because he/she did not act improperly. In fact, a conflict of interest can exist even if there are no improper acts as a result of it. (One way to understand this is to use the term "conflict of roles". A person with two roles—an individual who owns [[stock]] and is also a [[government]] official, for example—may experience situations where those two roles conflict. The conflict can be mitigated—see below—but it still exists. In and of itself, having two roles is not illegal, but the differing roles will certainly provide an incentive for improper acts in some circumstances.)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As an example, in the sphere of business and control, according to the [[Institute of Internal Auditors]]:
{{quote|'''conflict of interest''' is a situation in which an [[internal auditor]], who is in a position of trust, has a competing professional or personal interest. Such competing interests can make it difficult to fulfill his or her duties impartially. A conflict of interest exists even if no [[unethical]] or improper act results. A conflict of interest can create an appearance of impropriety that can undermine confidence in the internal [[auditor]], the [[internal audit]] activity, and the profession. A conflict of interest could impair an individual's ability to perform his or her duties and responsibilities objectively.&lt;ref name="theiia_coi_definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiia.org/guidance/standards-and-guidance/ippf/standards/standards-items/?i=8244|title=1120-Individual Objectivity|publisher=Institute of Internal Auditors|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccsf_coi_definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsf.edu/Offices/Office_of_the_Internal_Auditor/Policies_and_Procedures.htm|title=Policies &amp; Procedures of the Internal Audit Activity|publisher=City College of San Francisco|accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Organizational==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
An organizational conflict of interest (OCI) may exist in the same way as described above, for instance where a corporation provides two types of service to the government and these services conflict (e.g.: manufacturing parts and then participating on a selection committee comparing parts manufacturers). Corporations may develop simple or complex systems to mitigate the risk or perceived risk of a conflict of interest. These risks can be evaluated by a government agency (for example, in a U.S. Government [[RFP]]) to determine whether the risks create a substantial advantage to the organization in question over its competition, or will decrease the overall competitiveness of the bidding process.

==Conflict of interest in the health care industry==
{{main|Conflict of interest in the health care industry}}
The influence of the [[pharmaceutical industry]] on medical research has been a major cause for concern. In 2009 a study found that "a number of academic institutions" do not have clear guidelines for relationships between Institutional Review Boards and industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/mgh-pri032309.php Policies regarding IRB members' industry relationships often lacking].&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to this viewpoint, an article and associated editorial in the [[New England Journal of Medicine]] in May 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drazen|first=Jeffrey M.|date=2015-05-07|title=Revisiting the Commercial–Academic Interface|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=19|pages=1853–1854|doi=10.1056/NEJMe1503623|issn=0028-4793|pmid=25946285}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of pharmaceutical industry-physician interactions for the development of novel treatments, and argued that moral outrage over industry malfeasance had unjustifiably led many to overemphasize the problems created by financial conflicts of interest.  The article noted that major healthcare organizations such as National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, the [[President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]], the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the Food and Drug Administration had encouraged greater interactions between physicians and industry in order to bring greater benefits to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Conflicts of interest: Part 1: Reconnecting the dots--reinterpreting industry-physician relations|journal= New England Journal of Medicine|volume= 372|issue= 19|pages= 1860–1864|doi=10.1056/NEJMms1502493 |pmid= 25946288|year = 2015|last1 = Rosenbaum|first1 = Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

The following are the most common forms of conflicts of interests:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/business/textbooks/boundless-business-textbook/business-ethics-and-social-responsibility-3/business-ethics-33/conflicts-of-interest-177-10244/|title=Boundless|last=|first=|date=|website=www.boundless.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Self-dealing]], in which an official who controls an organization causes it to enter into a transaction with the official, or with another organization that benefits the official only. The official is on both sides of the "deal."
* Outside employment, in which the interests of one job conflict with another.
* [[Nepotism]], in which a spouse, child, or other close relative is employed (or applies for employment) by an individual, or where goods or services are purchased from a relative or from a firm controlled by a relative. To avoid nepotism in hiring, many employment applications ask if the applicant is related to a current employee of the company. This allows recusal if the employed relative has a role in the hiring process. If this is the case, the relative could then recuse from any hiring decisions. 
* Gifts from friends who also do business with the person receiving the gifts or from individuals or corporations who do business with the organization in which the gift recipient is employed. Such gifts may include non-tangible things of value such as transportation and lodging.
* Pump and dump, in which a stock broker who owns a security artificially inflates the price by "upgrading" it or spreading rumors, sells the security and adds [[Short (finance)|short position]], then "downgrades" the security or spreads negative rumors to push the price down.

Other improper acts that are sometimes classified as conflicts of interests may have better classification. For example, accepting [[bribe]]s can be classified as corruption, use of government or corporate property or assets for personal use is [[fraud]], and unauthorized distribution of confidential information is a [[security breach]]. For these improper acts, there is no inherent conflict.

{{Anchor|Competition of interest}} COI is sometimes termed '''competition of interest''' rather than "conflict", emphasizing a [[connotation]] of natural [[competition]] between valid interests - rather than the classical definition of conflict, which would include by definition including a victim and unfair aggression. Nevertheless, this [[denotation]] of conflict of interest is not generally seen.

===Environmental hazards and human health===
Baker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Nena|title=The Body Toxic|publisher=North Point Press|year=2008|page=142|url=http://www.thebodytoxic.com |quote=cited from Lessig 2011, p. 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarized 176 studies of the potential impact of [[Bisphenol A]] on human health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Fisher's exact test]] computed using the fisher.test function in [[R (programming language)]] returned a significance probability of 2e-13, i.e., there are 200 chances in a million billion of getting a table as extreme as this with the given marginals by chance alone. In other words, it is not credible to claim that the funding source has no impact on the outcome of this many independent studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lessig&lt;ref name="RepLostAll"&gt;Lessig 2011&lt;/ref&gt; noted that this does not mean that the funding source influenced the results. However, it does raise questions about the validity of the industry-funded studies specifically, because the researchers conducting those studies have a conflict of interest; they are subject at minimum to a natural human inclination to please the people who paid for their work. Lessig provided a similar summary of 326 studies of the potential harm from cell phone usage with results that were similar but not as stark.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Self-policing}} Self-regulation===
[[Industry self-regulation|Self-regulation]] of any group may also be a conflict of interest. If an, such as a corporation or government bureaucracy, is asked to eliminate unethical behavior within their own group, it may be in their interest in the short run to eliminate the appearance of unethical behavior, rather than the behavior itself, by keeping any ethical breaches hidden, instead of exposing and correcting them. An exception occurs when the ethical breach is already known by the public. In that case, it could be in the group's interest to end the ethical problem to which the public has knowledge, but keep remaining breaches hidden.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Insurance claims adjusters===
Insurance companies retain [[claims adjuster]]s to represent their interest in adjusting claims. It is in the best interest of the insurance companies that the very smallest settlement is reached with its claimants. Based on the adjuster's experience and knowledge of the insurance policy it is very easy for the adjuster to convince an unknowing claimant to settle for less than what they may otherwise be entitled which could be a larger settlement. There is always a very good chance of a conflict of interest to exist when one adjuster tries to represent both sides of a financial transaction such as an insurance claim. This problem is exacerbated when the claimant is told, or believes, the insurance company's [[claims adjuster]] is fair and impartial enough to satisfy both theirs and the insurance company's interests. These types of conflicts could easily be avoided by the use of disclosures.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Purchasing agents and sales personnel===
A person working as the equipment purchaser for a company may get a bonus proportionate to the amount he's under budget by year end. However, this becomes an incentive for him to purchase inexpensive, substandard equipment. Therefore, this is counter to the interests of those in his company who must actually use the equipment. [[W. Edwards Deming]] listed "purchasing on price alone" as number 4 of his famous [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|14 points]], and he often said things to the effect that "He who purchases on price alone deserves to get rooked."{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Government officials===
[[File:Corrupt-Legislation-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|Conflict of interest in legislation; the interests of the poor and the interests of the rich. A personification of corrupt legislation weighs a bag of money and denies an appeal of poverty.]]
Regulating conflict of interest in government is one of the aims of [[political ethics]]. Public officials are expected to put service to the public and their constituents ahead of their personal interests. Conflict of interest rules are intended to prevent officials from making decisions in circumstances that could reasonably be perceived as violating this duty of office. Rules in the executive branch tend to be stricter and easier to enforce than in the legislative branch.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Richard (2009), ''Getting the Government America Deserves: How Ethics Reform Can Make a Difference'', Oxford University Press 978-0-19-537871-9&lt;/ref&gt; Two problems make legislative ethics of conflicts difficult and distinctive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; First, as James Madison wrote, legislators should share a "communion of interests" with their constituents. Legislators cannot adequately represent the interests of constituents without also representing some of their own. As Senator Robert S. Kerr once said, "I represent the farmers of Oklahoma, although I have large farm interests. I represent the oil business in Oklahoma...and I am in the oil business...They don't want to send a man here who has no community of interest with them, because he wouldn't be worth a nickel to them."&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Robert S. "Senator Kerr Talks about Conflict of Interest", ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', September 3, 1962, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is to distinguish special interests from the general interests of all constituents. Second, the "political interests" of legislatures include campaign contributions which they need to get elected, and which are generally not illegal and not the same as a bribe. But under many circumstances they can have the same effect. The problem here is how to keep the secondary interest in raising campaign funds from overwhelming what should be their primary interest—fulfilling the duties of office.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[Politics of the United States|Politics in the United States]] is dominated in many ways by political campaign contributions.&lt;ref name="RepublicLost"/&gt; Candidates are often not considered "credible" unless they have a campaign budget far beyond what could reasonably be raised from citizens of ordinary means. The impact of this money can be found in many places, most notably in studies of how campaign contributions affect legislative behavior. For example, the price of sugar in the United States has been roughly double the international price for over half a century. In the 1980s, this added $3 billion to the annual budget of U.S. consumers, according to Stern,&lt;ref name="BestCongress"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stern|first=Philip M.|title=Still the Best Congress Money Can Buy|publisher=Regnery Gatgeway|year=1992|pages=168–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; who provided the following summary of one part of how this happens:

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Contributions from the sugar lobby, 1983–1986
! Percent voting in 1985 against gradually reducing sugar subsidies
|-
| &gt; $5,000
| 100%
|-
| $2,500–5,000
| 97%
|-
| $1,000–2,500
| 68%
|-
| $1–1,000
| 45%
|-
| $0
| 20%
|}
This $3 billion translates into $41 per household per year. This is in essence a [[tax]] collected by a nongovernmental agency: It is a cost imposed on consumers by governmental decisions, but never considered in any of the standard data on [[tax]] collections.

Stern notes that sugar interests contributed $2.6 million to political campaigns, representing well over $1,000 return for each $1 contributed to political campaigns. This, however, does not include the cost of lobbying. Lessig cites six different studies that consider the cost of [[lobbying]] with campaign contributions on a variety of issues considered in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="RepLost2"&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 43–52, 117&lt;/ref&gt; These studies produced estimates of the anticipated return on each $1 invested in lobbying and political campaigns that ranged from $6 to $220. Lessig notes that clients who pay tens of millions of dollars to lobbyists typically receive billions.

Lessig insists that this does not mean that any legislator has sold his or her vote.&lt;ref name="RepLostAll"/&gt; One of several possible explanations Lessig gives for this phenomenon is that the money helped elect candidates more supportive of the issues pushed by the big money spent on lobbying and political campaigns. He notes that if any money perverts democracy, it is the large contributions beyond the budgets of citizens of ordinary means; small contributions from common citizens have long been considered supporting of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig 2011, pp. 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

When such large sums become virtually essential to a politician's future, it generates a substantive conflict of interest contributing to a fairly well documented distortion on the nation's priorities and policies.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Beyond this, governmental officials, whether elected or not, often leave public service to work for companies affected by legislation they helped enact or companies they used to regulate or companies affected by legislation they helped enact. This practice is called the "[[Revolving door (politics)|revolving door]]". Former legislators and regulators are accused of (a) using inside information for their new employers or (b) compromising laws and regulations in hopes of securing lucrative employment in the private sector. This possibility creates a conflict of interest for all public officials whose future may depend on the [[revolving door (politics)|revolving door]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Finance industry and elected officials===
Conflicts of interest among elected officials is part of the story behind the increase in the percent of US corporate domestic profits captured by the finance industry depicted in that accompanying figure.

[[File:USFinanceIndustry.svg|thumb|'''Finance as a percent of US Domestic Corporate Profits'''

Finance includes banks, securities and insurance. In 1932-1933, the total U.S. domestic corporate profit was negative. However, the financial sector made a profit in those years, which made its percentage negative, below 0 and off the scale in this plot.&lt;ref&gt;From Table 6.16 of the [[National Income and Product Accounts]] (NIPA) compiled by the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] of the [[federal government of the United States]]. For more information, see the US Finance Industry data set in the Ecdat package for [[R (programming language)]] available from [https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1439 R-Forge].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From 1934 through 1985, the finance industry averaged 13.8% of U.S. domestic corporate profit. Between 1986 and 1999, it averaged 23.5%. From 2000 through 2010, it averaged 32.6%. Some of this increase is doubtless due to increased efficiency from banking consolidation and innovations in new financial products that benefit consumers. However, if most consumers had refused to accept financial products they did not understand, e.g., [[negative amortization]] loans, the finance industry would not have been as profitable as it has been, and the [[Late-2000s recession]] might have been avoided or postponed. Stiglitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stiglitz|first=Joseph E.|title=Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Shrinking of the World Economy|publisher=Norton|year=2010|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the [[Late-2000s recession]] was created in part because, "Bankers acted greedily because they had incentives and opportunities to do so". They did this in part by innovating to make consumer financial products like retail banking services and home mortgages as complicated as possible to make it easy for them to charge higher fees. Consumers who shop carefully for financial services typically find better options than the primary offerings of the major banks. However, few consumers think to do that. This explains part of this increase in financial industry profits. (Note, however, that Stiglitz has been accused of a conflict of interests and violation of [[Columbia University]] transparency policies for failing to disclose his status as a paid consultant to government of Argentina at the same time he was writing articles in defense of Argentina's planned default of over $1billion in bond debt during the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression]], and for failing to disclose his paid consultancy to the government of Greece at the same time he was downplaying the risk of Greece defaulting on their debt during the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Eliana (2014).

However, it is argued that a major portion of this increase and a driving force behind [[Late-2000s recession]] has been the corrosive effect of money in politics, giving legislators and the President of the U.S. a conflict of interest, because if they protect the public, they will offend the finance industry, which contributed $1.7 billion to political campaigns and spent $3.4 billion ($5.1 billion total) on lobbying from 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig 2011, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sachs|first=Jeffrey D.

To be conservative, suppose we{{tone inline|date=September 2015}} attribute only the increase from 23.5% of 1986 through 1999 to the recent 32.6% average to governmental actions subject to conflicts of interest created by the $1.7 billion in campaign contributions. That's 9% of the $3 trillion in profits claimed by the finance industry during that period or $270 billion. This represents a return of over $50 for each $1 invested in political campaigns and lobbying for that industry. (This $270 billion represents almost $1,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.) There is hardly any place outside politics with such a high [[return on investment]] in such a short time.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Finance industry and economists===
Economists (unlike other professions such as sociologists) do not formally subscribe to a professional ethical code. Close to 300 economists have signed a letter urging the [[American Economic Association]] (the discipline’s foremost professional body), to adopt such a code. The signatories include [[George Akerlof]], a Nobel laureate, and [[Christina Romer]], who headed Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/other_publication_types/AEA_letter_Jan3b.pdf Letters from 300 economists] to the [[American Economic Association]], 3 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

This call for a code of ethics was supported by the public attention the documentary [[Inside Job (2010 film)|Inside Job]] (winner of an Academy Award) drew to the consulting relationships of several influential economists.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204294504576613032849864232 "Stung by 'Inside Job,' economists pen a code of ethics"], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary focused on conflicts that may arise when economists publish results or provide public recommendation on topics that affect industries or companies with which they have financial links. Critics of the profession argue, for example, that it is no coincidence that financial economists, many of whom were engaged as consultants by Wall Street firms, were opposed to regulating the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/17849319 "Dismal ethics, An intensifying debate about the case for a professional code of ethics for economists"], ''[[The Economist]]'', 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticism that the profession not only failed to predict the [[2007-2008 financial crisis]] but may actually have helped create it, the [[American Economic Association]] has adopted new rules in 2012: economists will have to disclose financial ties and other potential conflicts of interest in papers published in [[academic journal]]s. Backers argue such disclosures will help restore faith in the profession by increasing transparency which will help in assessing economists' advice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203436904577148940410667970 "Economists set rules on ethics"], ''Wall Street Journal'', 9 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockbrokers===
A conflict of interest is a manifestation of [[moral hazard]], particularly when a financial institution provides multiple services and the potentially competing interests of those services may lead to a concealment of information or dissemination of misleading information. A conflict of interest exists when a party to a transaction could potentially make a gain from taking actions that are detrimental to the other party in the transaction.&lt;ref name=Mehran&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mehran|first=Hamid|title=Economics of Conflicts of Interest in Financial Institutions|ssrn=943447 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.943447|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of conflicts of interest such as a [[pump and dump]] by stockbrokers. This is when a stockbroker who owns a security artificially inflates the price by upgrading it or spreading rumors, and then sells the security and adds short position. They will then downgrade the security or spread negative rumors to push the price back down. This is an example of stock fraud. It is a conflict of interest because the stockbrokers are concealing and manipulating information to make it misleading for the buyers. The broker may claim to have the "inside" information about impending news and will urge buyers to buy the stock quickly. Investors will buy the stock, which creates a high demand and raises the prices.  This rise in prices can entice more people to believe the hype and then buy shares as well. The stockbrokers will then sell their shares and stop promoting, the price will drop, and other investors are left holding stock that is worth nothing compared to what they paid for it.  In this way, brokers use their knowledge and position to gain personally at the expense of others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The [[Enron scandal]] is a major example of pump and dump. Executives participated in an elaborate scheme, falsely reporting profits, thus inflating its stock prices, and covered up the real numbers with questionable [[accounting]]; 29 executives sold overvalued stock for more than a billion dollars before the company went bankrupt.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Media===
Any [[Mass media|media]] organization has a conflict of interest in discussing anything that may impact its ability to communicate as it wants with its audience. Most media, when reporting a story which involves a [[parent company]] or a [[subsidiary]], will explicitly report this fact as part of the story, in order to alert the audience that their reporting has the potential for bias due to the possibility of a conflict of interest.

The business model of commercial media organizations (i.e., any that accept advertising) is selling behavior change in their audience to advertisers.&lt;ref name="HermChom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Edward S.|authorlink1=Edward S. Herman|last2=Chomsky|first2=Noam|authorlink2=Noam Chomsky|title=Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|year=1988|publisher=Pantheon|isbn=0-394-54926-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProblemMedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|authorlink=Robert W.

Many major advertisers [[Advertising research|test]] their ads in various ways to measure the [[return on investment]] in advertising. Advertising rates are set as a function of the size and spending habits of the audience as measured by the [[Nielsen Ratings]]. Media action expressing this conflict of interest is evident in the reaction of [[Rupert Murdoch]], Chairman of [[News Corporation]], owner of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], to changes in data collection methodology adopted in 2004 by the Nielsen Company to more accurately measure viewing habits. The results corrected a previous overestimate of the market share of Fox. Murdoch reacted by getting leading politicians to denounce the [[Nielsen Ratings]] as racists.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Brian. {{cite web| title = Fox gives Nielsen, politicos a lesson in hardball | url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/columns/fox-gives-nielsen-politicos-a-lesson-in-hardball-1117904718/}} Variety: August 16–22, 2004, Vol 395 Issue 13, p 14-16, 2p.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2015}}&lt;!-- I don't get Variety, but I got this cite from [[People meter]] which uses it to support a similar claim. --&gt;&lt;!-- source found, will let other remove verify {{cite web| title = "Fox gives Nielsen, politicos a lesson in hardball" | url=https://variety.com/2004/scene/columns/fox-gives-nielsen-politicos-a-lesson-in-hardball-1117904718/}} --&gt; [http://www.susan-whiting.com/ Susan Whiting], president and CEO of Nielsen Media Research, responded by quietly sharing Nielsen's data with her leading critics.

Commercial media organizations lose money if they provide content that offends either their audience or their advertisers. The substantial media consolidation that occurred since the 1980s has reduced the alternatives available to the audience, thereby making it easier for the ever-larger companies in this increasingly [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]] industry to hide news and entertainment potentially offensive to advertisers without losing audience. If the media provide too much information on how congress spends its time, a major advertiser could be offended and could reduce their advertising expenditures with the offending media company; indeed, this is one of the ways the market system has determined which companies won and which either went out of business or were purchased by others in this media consolidation. (Advertisers don't like to feed the mouth that bites them, and often don't. Similarly, commercial media organizations are not eager to bite the hand that feeds them.) Advertisers have been known to fund media organizations with editorial policies they find offensive if that media outlet provides access to a sufficiently attractive audience segment they cannot efficiently reach otherwise.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Election years are a major boon to commercial broadcasters, because virtually all political advertising is purchased with minimal advance planning, paying therefore the highest rates. The commercial media have a conflict of interest in anything that could make it easier for candidates to get elected with less money.&lt;ref name="ProblemMedia"/&gt;

Accompanying this trend in media consolidation has been a substantial reduction in [[investigative journalism]],&lt;ref name="ProblemMedia"/&gt; reflecting this conflict of interest between the business objectives of the commercial media and the public's need to know what government is doing in their name. This change has been tied to substantial changes in law and culture in the United States. To cite only one example, researchers have tied this decline in investigative journalism to an increased coverage of the "police blotter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Potter|editor1-first=Gary W.|editor2-last=Kappeler|editor2-first=Victor E.|title=Constructing Crime: Perspectives on Making News and Social Problems|year=1998|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=0-88133-984-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has further been tied to the fact that the United States has the [[Incarceration in the United States|highest incarceration rate in the world]].

Beyond this, virtually all commercial media companies own substantial quantities of copyrighted material. This gives them an inherent conflict of interest in any public policy issue affecting copyrights. McChesney noted that the commercial media have lobbied successfully for changes in copyright law that have led "to higher prices and a shrinking of the marketplace of ideas", increasing the power and profits of the large media corporations at public expense. One result of this is that "the people cease to have a means of clarifying social priorities and organizing social reform".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|authorlink=Robert W. McChesney|title=The Political Economy of the Media: Enduring Issues, Emerging Dilemas|year=2008|publisher=Monthly Review Pr.|isbn=978-1-58367-161-0|pages=335–337}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free market has a mechanism for controlling abuses of power by media corporations: If their censorship becomes too egregious, they lose audience, which in turn reduces their advertising rates. However, the effectiveness of this mechanism has been substantially reduced over the past quarter century by "the changes in the concentration and integration of the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lessig|first=Lawrence|authorlink=Lawrence Lessig|title=[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1-59420-006-9|pages=162ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Would the [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement]] have advanced to the point of generating substantial [[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement#Protests|protests]] without the secrecy behind which that agreement was negotiated—and would the government attempts to sustain that secrecy have been as successful if the commercial media had not been a primary beneficiary and had not had a conflict of interest in suppressing discussion thereof?

==Mitigation==

===Removal===
{{expand section|reason=frequency, efficacy|date=September 2015}}
Sometimes, people who may be perceived to have a conflict of interest resign from a position or sell a shareholding in a venture, to eliminate the conflict of interest going forward.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} For example, [[Jonathan Evans, Baron Evans of Weardale|Lord Evans of Weardale]] resigned as a non-executive director of the UK [[National Crime Agency]] after a [[tax avoidance|tax-avoidance]]-related controversy about [[HSBC]], where Lord Evans was also a non-executive director. This resignation was stated to have taken place in order to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/news-listings/563-resignation-of-non-executive-director|title=Resignation of non-executive director|publisher=[[National Crime Agency]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Blind trust"===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
A politician who owns shares in a company that may be affected by government policy may put those shares in a [[blind trust]] with themselves or their family as the beneficiary. It is disputed whether this really removes the conflict of interest, however.

Blind trusts may in fact obscure conflicts of interest, and for this reason it is illegal to fund political parties in the UK via a blind trust if the identity of the real donor is concealed.

===Disclosure===
Commonly, politicians and high-ranking government officials are required to disclose financial information—assets such as stock, [[debt]]s such as [[loan]]s, and/or corporate positions held, typically annually. To protect privacy (to some extent), financial figures are often disclosed in ranges such as "$100,000 to $500,000" and "over $2,000,000". Certain professionals are required either by rules related to their professional organization, or by [[statute]], to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. In some instances, the failure to provide full disclosure is a crime.

However, there is limited evidence regarding the effect of conflict of interest disclosure despite its widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Institute of Medicine|title=Conflict of Interest in Research, Education and Practice|journal=National Academies Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] showed that routine disclosure of conflicts of interest by American medical school educators to pre-clinical medical students were associated with an increased desire among students for limitations in some industry relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1475179 "Article"], ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were no changes in the perceptions of students about the value of disclosure, the influence of industry relationships on educational content, or the instruction by faculty with relevant conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Azalea|author2=Lawrence Mumm|author3= Deborah Korenstein|title=Routine Conflict of Interest Disclosure by Preclinical Lecturers and Medical Students' Attitudes Toward the Pharmaceutical and Device Industries|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=5 December 2012|volume=308|issue=21|pages=2187–2189|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.25315|pmid=23212492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And, an increasing line of research suggests that disclosure can have "perverse effects" or, at least, is not the panacea regulators often take it to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cain | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Destksy | first2 = A. | year = 2008 | title = Everyone's a little bit biased (even physicians) | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=182115 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 299 | issue = 24| pages = 2893–2895 | doi=10.1001/jama.299.24.2893 | pmid=18577735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recusal===
{{Missing information|section|the fact that recusal is an ''expectation'', and no solution for situations where COI can't be verified, as is the case on WP|date=September 2015}} 
Those with a conflict of interest are expected to [[Judicial disqualification|recuse]] themselves from (i.e., abstain from) decisions where such a conflict exists. The imperative for recusal varies depending upon the circumstance and profession, either as common sense ethics, codified ethics, or by [[statute]]. For example, if the governing board of a government agency is considering hiring a consulting firm for some task, and one firm being considered has, as a partner, a close relative of one of the board's members, then that board member should not vote on which firm is to be selected. In fact, to minimize any conflict, the board member should not participate in any way in the decision, including discussions.

[[Judge]]s are supposed to recuse themselves from cases when personal conflicts of interest may arise. For example, if a judge has participated in a case previously in some other judicial role he/she is not allowed to try that case. Recusal is also expected when one of the lawyers in a case might be a close personal friend, or when the outcome of the case might affect the judge directly, such as whether a car maker is obliged to recall a model that a judge drives. This is required by law under Continental [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems and by the [[Rome Statute]], organic law of the [[International Criminal Court]].

===Third-party evaluations===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}
Consider a situation where the owner of a majority of a public companies decides to buy out the minority shareholders and take the corporation private. What is a fair price? Obviously it is improper (and, typically, illegal) for the majority owner to simply state a price and then have the (majority-controlled) [[board of directors]] approve that price. What is typically done is to hire an independent firm (a third party), well-qualified to evaluate such matters, to calculate a "fair price", which is then voted on by the minority shareholders.

Third-party evaluations may also be used as proof that transactions were, in fact, fair ("[[Arm's length principle|arm's-length]]"). For example, a corporation that leases an office building that is owned by the [[CEO]] might get an independent evaluation showing what the market rate is for such leases in the locale, to address the conflict of interest that exists between the [[fiduciary]] duty of the CEO (to the stockholders, by getting the lowest rent possible) and the personal interest of that CEO (to maximize the income that the CEO gets from owning that office building by getting the highest rent possible).

A January 2018 report by the [[Public Citizen]] non-profit describes dozens of foreign governments, special interest groups and GOP congressional campaign committees that spent hundreds of thousands of dollars at [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]]'s properties during his first year in office. The study said that these groups clearly intended to win over the president by helping his business empire profit as he sat in the Oval Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/trump-properties-profit-foreign-governments-gop-782260|title=Trump Properties Earned a Fortune from GOP and Foreign Governments During President's First Year in Office: Report|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saccharum_officinarum_red_canes.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A tuft of sugarcane with red, thick stems|Culms of [[sugarcane]]]]

A '''culm''' is the aerial (above-ground) stem of a [[grass]] or [[sedge]]. It is derived from {{wikt-lang|la|culmus}}, the Latin word for "stalk", and it originally referred to the [[plant stem|stem]] of any type of [[plant]].&lt;ref&gt;MacGillavray, William ''A Manual of Botany'' London 1840. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malting==
In the production of malted grains the culms refer to the rootlets of the germinated grains. The culms are normally removed in a process known as "deculming" after kilning when producing [[barley]] malt, but form an important part of the product when making [[sorghum]] or [[millet]] malt. These culms are very nutritious and are sold off as animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGA/AGAP/FRG/AFRIS/Data/467.HTM | title=Malt culms, malt sprouts, malt coombs | publisher=Animal Feed Resources Information System | accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Department of Political Science of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University has over 50&amp;nbsp;years of history]], being one of the four departments that existed during the reestablishment of the university in Taiwan in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt; The Master program of the department was established in 1991; followed by the Doctoral program in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eGraduate&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|2003]], in a very rigorous review held by Soochow University, the Department of Political Science was evaluated excellent among the inspectors from the Evaluation and Review Committee of academic fields. The department is also awarded with financial support to help to fund many teaching and research activities and projects with unique features.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scu.edu.tw/artsoc/english2/politics.html http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The Department has also been funded by the [[Ministry of Education (Taiwan)|Ministry of Education]] under the [http://www.studyintaiwan.org/teaching_excellence.html Teaching Excellence Projects].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Shiow-Duan Hawang is the director of the department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs and goals==
The teaching program is characterized by a multidisciplinary approach of [[history of political thought]], [[Comparative Government and Politics]], [[international relations]] and [[public administration]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The international exchanges and various academic activities and lectures for teachers and students play an important role in this department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eTeacher.&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching programs of the department are particularly oriented on [[Status of Taiwan|international issues]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to basic trainings in political science, the departement offers diversified curriculum and programs open to international students.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Research==

From [[Quarterly|1999]] to [[Quarterly|2008]], teachers of the Department have conducted 90 research projects granted by the government and its [[National Science Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.scu.edu.tw/~ctl/eng-old/page-1-1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Political Science has been organized the Research Center, the Center for [[Globalization|Globalization Studies]], the Center for [[Globalization|E.U]] Studies, the Centre for Parliamentary Research, the Center for [[U.N]], Studies and the Metropolitan Governance Study Center and the Workshop of [[Human Rights]] and [[Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.scu.edu.tw/politics/default.asp?Subject=eProfile&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7772">'''Disproportionation''', sometimes called dismutation, is a [[redox reaction]] in which a compound of intermediate oxidation state converts to two different compounds, one of higher and one of lower oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;Shriver, D. F.; Atkins, P. W.; Overton, T. L.; Rourke, J. P.; Weller, M. T.; Armstrong, F. A. “Inorganic Chemistry” W. H. Freeman, New York, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7167-4878-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. "Inorganic Chemistry" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. {{ISBN|0-12-352651-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not widely accepted, disproportionation is sometimes used to describe any desymmetrizing reaction of the following type: 2 A → A'  +  A", regardless of any redox process.&lt;ref&gt;https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/D/D01799.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Mercury(I) chloride]] disproportionates upon UV-irradiation:
:Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + HgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Phosphorous acid]] disproportionates upon heating to give [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphine]]:
:4 {{chem|H|3|PO|3}} →  3 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + PH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

As mentioned above, desymmetrizing reactions are sometimes referred to as disproportionation, as illustrated by the thermal degradation of bicarbonate:
:2 {{chem|HCO|3|-}} → {{chem|CO|3|2-}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The oxidation numbers remain constant in this acid-base reaction.  This process is also called autoionization.

Another variant on disproportionation is [[radical disproportionation]], in which two radicals form an alkane and alkene.

===Reverse reaction===
The reverse of disproportionation, when a compound in an intermediate oxidation state is formed from precursors of lower and higher oxidation states, is called [[comproportionation]], also known as synproportionation.

==History==
The first disproportionation reaction to be studied in detail was:

:2 Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; → Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; + Sn

This was examined using [[tartrate]]s by [[Johan Gadolin]] in 1788. In the Swedish  version of his paper he called it 'söndring'.&lt;ref&gt;Gadolin Johan (1788) ''K. Sv. Vet. Acad. Handl.'' 1788, 186-197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gadolin Johan (1790) ''Crells Chem. Annalen'' 1790, I, 260-273.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further examples ==
*[[Chlorine]] gas reacts with dilute [[sodium hydroxide]] to form [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium chlorate]] and [[water]]. The ionic equation for this reaction is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Harding, David Arthur Johnson, Rob Janes, (2002), ''Elements of the P Block'', Published by Royal Society of Chemistry, {{ISBN|0-85404-690-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 5 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:*The chlorine gas reactant is in [[oxidation state]] 0. In the products, the chlorine in the Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion has an oxidation number of −1, having been reduced, whereas the oxidation number of the chlorine in the ClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt; ion is +5, indicating that it has been oxidized.

*Bromine fluoride undergoes disproportionation reaction for form bromine trifluoride:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non Aqueous Media|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: 3 BrF   → BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*The dismutation of [[superoxide]] [[free radical]] to [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]], catalysed in living systems by the [[enzyme]] [[superoxide dismutase]]:
: 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:The oxidation state of oxygen is −1/2 in the superoxide free radical anion, −1 in hydrogen peroxide and 0 in dioxygen.

*In the [[Cannizzaro reaction]], an [[aldehyde]] is converted into an [[alcohol]] and a [[carboxylic acid]]. In the related [[Tishchenko reaction]], the [[organic redox reaction]] product is the corresponding [[ester]]. In the [[Kornblum–DeLaMare rearrangement]], a peroxide is converted to a [[ketone]] and an alcohol.

*The disproportionation  of [[hydrogen peroxide]] into water and oxygen catalysed by either [[potassium iodide]] or the enzyme [[catalase]]:
: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*The [[Boudouard reaction]] is for example used in the [[HiPco]] method for producing [[Carbon Nanotube|carbon nanotubes]], high-pressure [[carbon monoxide]] disproportionates when catalysed on the surface of an iron particle:
: 2 CO → C + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*[[Nitrogen]] has oxidation state +4 in [[nitrogen dioxide]], but when this compound reacts with water, it forms both [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrous acid]], where nitrogen has oxidation states +5 and +3 respectively:
: 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

*[[Dithionite]] undergoes acid hydrolysis to [[thiosulfate]] and [[bisulfite]]:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
:2 {{chem|S|2|O|4|2−}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} → {{chem|S|2|O|3|2−}} + 2 {{chem|H|S|O|3|−}}
:*Dithionite also undergoes alkaline hydrolysis to [[sulfite]] and [[sulfide]]:{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}
:3 {{chem|Na|2|S|2|O|4}} + 6 {{chem|Na|O|H}} → 5 {{chem|Na|2|S|O|3}} + {{chem|Na|2|S}} + 3 {{chem|H|2|O}}

== Biochemistry ==
In 1937, [[Hans Adolf Krebs]], who discovered the [[citric acid cycle]] bearing his name, confirmed the anaerobic dismutation of [[pyruvic acid]] in [[lactic acid]], [[acetic acid]] and [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] by certain bacteria according to the global reaction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Krebs | first = H.A. | year = 1937 |title = LXXXVIII - Dismutation of pyruvic acid in gonoccus and staphylococcus | journal = Biochem. J. | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 661–671 | pmc = 1266985 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1266985/pdf/biochemj01050-0180.pdf | pmid=16746383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 pyruvic acid + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → lactic acid + acetic acid + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The dismutation of pyruvic acid in other small organic molecules (ethanol + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or lactate and acetate, depending on the environmental conditions) is also an important step in [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] reactions. Fermentation reactions can also be considered as disproportionation or dismutation [[biochemical reaction]]s. Indeed, the [[electron donor|donor]] and [[electron acceptor|acceptor]] of electrons in the [[redox reaction]]s supplying the [[chemical energy]] in these complex biochemical systems are the same organic molecules simultaneously acting as [[reductant]] or [[oxidant]].

Another example of biochemical dismutation reaction is the disproportionation of [[acetaldehyde]] into [[ethanol]] and [[acetic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jb.asm.org/cgi/reprint/173/21/7012.pdf   Biochemical basis of mitochondrial acetaldehyde dismutation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae]&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] electrons are transferred from [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] ([[electron donor]]) to an [[electron acceptor]], in fermentation part of the substrate molecule itself accepts the electrons. Fermentation is therefore a type of disproportionation, and does not involve an overall change in [[oxidation state]] of the substrate. Most of the fermentative substrates are organic molecules. However, a rare type of fermentation may also involve the disproportionation of inorganic [[sulfur]] compounds in certain [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v326/n6116/abs/326891a0.html A novel type of energy metabolism involving fermentation of inorganic sulfur compounds.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embodied cognitive science''' is an interdisciplinary field of research, the aim of which is to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior.   It comprises three main methodologies: 1) the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity, 2) the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior, and 3) the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments.

Embodied cognitive science borrows heavily from [[embodied philosophy]] and the related research fields of [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. From the perspective of neuroscience, research in this field was led by [[Gerald Edelman]] of the [[Neurosciences Institute]] at La Jolla, the late [[Francisco Varela]] of [[CNRS]] in France, and [[J. A. Scott Kelso]] of [[Florida Atlantic University]].  From the perspective of psychology, research by [[Michael Turvey]], [[Lawrence Barsalou]] and [[Eleanor Rosch]].  From the perspective of language acquisition, [[Eric Lenneberg]] and [[Philip Rubin]] at [[Haskins Laboratories]].  From the perspective of autonomous agent design, early work is sometimes attributed to [[Rodney Brooks]] or [[Valentino Braitenberg]].  From the perspective of artificial intelligence, see ''Understanding Intelligence'' by [[Rolf Pfeifer]] and Christian Scheier or ''How the body shapes the way we think'', also by Rolf Pfeifer and Josh C. Bongard. From the perspective of philosophy see [[Andy Clark]], [[Shaun Gallagher]], and [[Evan Thompson]].

[[Alan Turing|Turing]] proposed that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak:

::''It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again, I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried'' (Turing, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional cognitive theory ==

Embodied cognitive science is an alternative theory to cognition in which it minimizes appeals to [[computational theory of mind]] in favor of greater emphasis on how an organism's body determines how and what it thinks. Traditional cognitive theory is based mainly around symbol manipulation, in which certain inputs are fed into a processing unit that produces an output. These inputs follow certain rules of syntax, from which the processing unit finds semantic meaning. Thus, an appropriate output is produced. For example, a human's sensory organs are its input devices, and the stimuli obtained from the external environment are fed into the nervous system which serves as the processing unit. From here, the nervous system is able to read the sensory information because it follows a syntactic structure, thus an output is created. This output then creates bodily motions and brings forth behavior and cognition. Of particular note is that cognition is sealed away in the brain, meaning that mental cognition is cut off from the external world and is only possible by the input of sensory information.

== The embodied cognitive approach ==

Embodied cognitive science differs from the traditionalist approach in that it denies the input-output system. This is chiefly due to the problems presented by the [[Homunculus argument]], which concluded that semantic meaning could not be derived from symbols without some kind of inner interpretation. If some little man in a person's head interpreted incoming symbols, then who would interpret the little man's inputs? Because of the specter of an infinite regress, the traditionalist model began to seem less plausible. Thus, embodied cognitive science aims to avoid this problem by defining cognition in three ways.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Larry|title=The Embodied Cognition Programme|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=March 2007|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00064.x|url=http://portal.uni-freiburg.de/cognition/lehre/archiv/ss13/mat-prosem/embodiedcognition/Shapiro_EmbodiedCognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

=== Physical attributes of the body ===
The first aspect of embodied cognition examines the role of the physical body, particularly how its properties affect its ability to think. This part attempts to overcome the symbol manipulation component that is a feature of the traditionalist model. Depth perception for instance can be better explained under the embodied approach due to the sheer complexity of the action. Depth perception requires that the brain detect the disparate retinal images obtained by the distance of the two eyes. In addition, body and head cues complicate this further. When the head is turned in a given direction, objects in the foreground will appear to move against objects in the background. From this, it is said that some kind of visual processing is occurring without the need of any kind of symbol manipulation. This is because the objects appearing to move the foreground are simply appearing to move. This observation concludes then that depth can be perceived with no intermediate symbol manipulation necessary. 

A more poignant example exists through examining auditory perception. Generally speaking the greater the distance between the ears, the greater the possible auditory acuity. Also relevant is the amount of density in between the ears, for the strength of the frequency wave alters as it passes through a given medium. The brain's auditory system takes these factors into account as it process information, but again without any need for a symbolic manipulation system. This is because the distance between the ears for example does not need symbols to represent it. The distance itself creates the necessary opportunity for greater auditory acuity. The amount of density between the ears is similar, in that it is the actual amount itself that simply forms the opportunity for frequency alteration. Thus under consideration of the physical properties of the body, a symbolic system is unnecessary and an unhelpful metaphor.

=== The body's role in the cognitive process ===

The second aspect draws heavily from [[George Lakoff]]'s and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]'s work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors whenever possible to better explain their external world. Humans also have a basic stock of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include spatial orientations such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other spatial orientations such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these basic stocks of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus the point here is that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

‘[I]magine a spherical being living outside of any gravitational field, with no
knowledge or imagination of any other kind of experience. What could UP
possibly mean to such a being?'&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

While this does not mean that such beings would be incapable of expressing emotions in other words, it does mean that they would express emotions differently from humans. Human concepts of happiness and sadness would be different because human would have different bodies. So then an organism's body directly affects how it can think, because it uses metaphors related to its body as the basis of concepts.

=== Interaction of local environment ===
A third component of the embodied approach looks at how agents use their immediate environment in cognitive processing. Meaning, the local environment is seen as an actual extension of the body's cognitive process. The example of a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) is used to better imagine this. Echoing [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)]], this point claims that mental states are individuated by their role in a much larger system. So under this premise, the information on a PDA is similar to the information stored in the brain. So then if one thinks information in the brain constitutes mental states, then it must follow that information in the PDA is a cognitive state too. Consider also the role of pen and paper in a complex multiplication problem. The pen and paper are so involved in the cognitive process of solving the problem that it seems ridiculous to say they are somehow different from the process, in very much the same way the PDA is used for information like the brain. Another example examines how humans control and manipulate their environment so that cognitive tasks can be better performed. Leaving one's car keys in a familiar place so they aren't missed for instance, or using landmarks to navigate in an unfamiliar city. Thus, humans incorporate aspects of their environment to aid in their cognitive functioning.

== Examples of the value of embodied approach ==

The value of the embodiment approach in the context of cognitive science is perhaps best explained by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|title=An Embodied Cognitive Science?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=September 1999|volume=3|issue=9|pages=345–351|url=http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Lecture%20Files/AI/Secure/Download/Clark%20Andy%20-%20Embodied%20Cog%20Science%20%281999%20Trends%29.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2011|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345–351}} He makes the claim that the brain alone should not be the single focus for the scientific study of cognition

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It is increasingly clear that, in a wide variety of cases, the individual brain should not be the sole locus of cognitive scientific interest. Cognition is not a phenomenon that can be successfully studied while marginalizing the roles of body, world and action.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|350}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following examples used by Clark will better illustrate how embodied thinking is becoming apparent in scientific thinking.

=== Bluefin tuna ===

''[[Thunnus]]'', or tuna, long baffled conventional biologists with its incredible abilities to accelerate quickly and attain great speeds. A biological examination of the tuna shows it is simply not capable of such feats. However, an answer can be found when taking the tuna's embodied state into account. The [[bluefin tuna]] is able to take advantage of and exploit its local environment by finding naturally occurring currents to increase its speed. The tuna also uses its own physical body for this end as well, by utilizing its tailfin to create the necessary vortices and pressure so it can accelerate and maintain high speeds. Thus, the bluefin tuna is actively using its local environment for its own ends through the attributes of its physical body.

=== Robots ===

Clark uses the example of the hopping [[robot]] constructed by Raibert and Hodgins to demonstrate further the value of the embodiment paradigm. These robots were essentially vertical cylinders with a single hopping foot. The challenge of managing the robot's behavior can be daunting because in addition to the intricacies of the program itself, there were also the mechanical matters regarding how the foot ought to be constructed so that it could hop. An embodied approach makes it easier to see that in order for this robot to function, it must be able to exploit its system to the fullest. That is, the robot's systems should be seen as having dynamic characteristics as opposed to the traditional view that it is merely a command center that just executes actions.

=== Vision ===

Clark distinguishes between two kinds of [[Visual perception|vision]], animate and pure vision. Pure vision is an idea that is typically associated with classical [[artificial intelligence]], in which vision is used to create a rich world model so that thought and reason can be used to fully explore the inner model. In other words, pure vision passively creates the external perceivable world so that the faculties of reason can be better used introspectively. Animate vision, by contrast, sees vision as the means by which real-time action can commence. Animate vision is then more of a vehicle by which visual information is obtained so that actions can be undertaken. Clark points to animate vision as an example of embodiment, because it uses both biological and local environment cues to create an active intelligent process. Consider the Clark's example of going to the drugstore to buy some Kodak film. In one's mind, one is familiar with the Kodak logo and its trademark gold color. Thus, one uses incoming visual stimuli to navigate around the drugstore until one finds the film. Therefore, vision should not be seen as a passive system but rather an active retrieval device that intelligently uses sensory information and local environmental cues to perform specific real-world actions.

=== Affordance ===

Inspired by the work of the American psychologist [[James J. Gibson]], this next example emphasizes the importance of action-relevant sensory information, bodily movement, and local environment cues. These three concepts are unified by the concept of affordances, which are possibilities of action provided by the physical world to a given agent. These are in turn determined by the agent's physical body, capacities, and the overall action-related properties of the local environment as well. Clark uses the example of an outfielder in baseball to better illustrate the concept of affordance. Traditional computational models would claim that an outfielder attempting to catch a fly-ball can be calculated by variables such as the running speed of the outfielder and the arc of the baseball. However, Gibson's work shows that a simpler method is possible. The outfielder can catch the ball so long as they adjust their running speed so that the ball continually moves in a straight line in their field of vision. Note that this strategy uses various affordances that are contingent upon the success of the outfielder, including their physical body composition, the environment of the baseball field, and the sensory information obtained by the outfielder. 

Clark points out here that the latter strategy of catching the ball as opposed to the former has significant implications for perception. The affordance approach proves to be non-linear because it relies upon spontaneous real-time adjustments. On the contrary, the former method of computing the arc of the ball is linear as it follows a sequence of perception, calculation and performing action. Thus, the affordance approach challenges the traditional view of perception by arguing against the notion that computation and introspection are necessary. Instead, it ought to be replaced with the idea that perception constitutes a continuous equilibrium of action adjustment between the agent and the world. Ultimately Clark does not expressly claim this is certain but he does observe the affordance approach can explain adaptive response satisfactorily.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|346}} This is because they utilize environmental cues made possible by perceptual information that is actively used in the real-time by the agent.

== General principles of intelligent behavior ==
In the formation of general principles of intelligent behavior, Pfeifer intended to be contrary to older principles  given in traditional artificial intelligence.  The most dramatic difference is that the principles are applicable only to situated robotic agents in the real world, a domain where traditional artificial intelligence showed the least promise.

Principle of Cheap Design and Redundancy: Pfeifer realized that implicit assumptions made by engineers often substantially influence a control architecture's complexity.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"&gt;Pfeifer, R., Scheier, C.,  ''Understanding Intelligence'' (MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-66125-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|436}}  This insight is reflected in discussions of the scalability problem in robotics.  The internal processing needed for some bad architectures can grow out of proportion to new tasks needed of an agent.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the primary reasons for scalability problems is that the amount of programming and knowledge engineering that the robot designers have to perform grows very rapidly with the complexity of the robot's tasks. There is mounting evidence that pre-programming cannot be the solution to the scalability problem ... The problem is that programmers introduce too many hidden assumptions in the robot's code.&lt;ref&gt;Stoytchev, A. (2006). [http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~alex/papers/NIPS_Workshop_2006.pdf Five Basic Principles of Developmental Robotics] NIPS 2006 Workshop on Grounding Perception, Knowledge and Cognition in Sensori-Motor Experience.  Department of Computer Science, Iowa State U&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposed solutions are to have the agent exploit the inherent physics of its environment, to exploit the constraints of its niche, and to have agent morphology based on parsimony and the principle of Redundancy. Redundancy reflects the desire for the error-correction of signals afforded by duplicating like channels.  Additionally, it reflects the desire to exploit the associations between sensory modalities. (See [[modality (human-computer interaction)|redundant modalities]]).  In terms of design, this implies that redundancy should be introduced with respect not only to one sensory modality but to several.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"/&gt;{{rp|448}}  It has been suggested that the fusion and transfer of knowledge between modalities can be the basis of reducing the size of the sense data taken from the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Konijn, Paul (2007). [http://www.diracproject.org/workshop-2007/pdf/DIRAC-Summer-Workshop.pdf Summer Workshop on Multi-Sensory Modalities in Cognitive Science] Detection and Identification of Rare Audiovisual Cues. DIRAC EU IP IST project, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This again addresses the scalability problem.

Principle of Parallel, Loosely-coupled Processes: An alternative to hierarchical methods of knowledge and [[action selection]]. This design principle differs most importantly from the Sense-Think-Act cycle of traditional AI. Since it does not involve this famous cycle, it is not affected by the [[frame problem]].

Principle of Sensory-Motor Coordination: Ideally, internal mechanisms in an agent should give rise to things like memory and choice-making in an emergent fashion, rather than being prescriptively programmed from the beginning.   These kinds of things are allowed to emerge as the agent interacts with the environment. The motto is, build fewer assumptions into the agent's controller now, so that learning can be more robust and idiosyncratic in the future. 

Principle of Ecological Balance: This is more a theory than a principle, but its implications are widespread.  Its claim is that the internal processing of an agent cannot be made more complex unless there is a corresponding increase in complexity of the motors, limbs, and sensors of the agent. In other words, the extra complexity added to the brain of a simple robot will not create any discernible change in its behavior. The robot's morphology must already contain the complexity in itself to allow enough "breathing room" for more internal processing to develop.

The Value Principle: This was the architecture developed in the Darwin III robot of [[Gerald Edelman]]. It relies heavily on [[connectionism]].

== Critical responses ==

=== Traditionalist response to local environment claim ===
A traditionalist may argue that objects may be used to aid in cognitive processes, but this does not mean they are part of a cognitive system.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|343}} Eyeglasses are used to aid in the visual process, but to say they are a part of a larger system would completely redefine what is meant by a visual system. However, supporters of the embodied approach could make the case that if objects in the environment play the functional role of mental states, then the items themselves should not be counted among the mental states.

'''Environmental surveying''' is the title of a profession within the wider field of surveying, the practitioners of which are known as environmental surveyors. Environmental surveyors use [[surveying]] techniques to understand the potential impact of environmental factors on real estate and construction developments, and conversely the impact that [[real estate]] and construction developments will have on the environment.

== Professional activities ==

The exact activities that make up the day-to-day work of an environmental surveyor vary from surveyor to surveyor and from project to project. Two environmental surveyors could have careers that consist of quite different professional activities depending on their and their practices area of specialisation.

In the strictest sense, the field of environmental surveying is distinct from that of environmental consultancy. Environmental consultancies may have some overlap with the work of environmental surveyors, but may be members of different professional bodies and may carry out activities not involving the built environment. They may for example be involved with [[arboriculture]] the specifics of which fall out of the remit of environmental surveyors. The terms are however sometimes used interchangeably, and practices often use the term consultants if the practice is seeking a wider client base than would be attracted to a pure Environmental Surveyor practice.

== Main areas of operation ==

The main areas of operation for environmental surveyors in the UK include:

• [[Flood risk assessmen]]t- This is to assess how likely it is that a building or proposed building will flood. If a building is thought to be at risk it will receive a designation of either Band 1 (200:1 chance of flooding in a year) Band 2 (between 200:1 and 75:1 chance of flooding annually) or Band 3 (greater than  a 75:1 chance of flooding annually, currently thought to account for around 4% of flood risk properties in the UK).

• [[Contaminated land assessmen]]t- Contaminated land surveys are carried out to assess the level of threat posed to existing or proposed buildings. Land can be contaminated if it is on or near a site that is currently or has in the past been used for industrial or waste disposal purposes. Such surveys form part of the due diligence that must be carried out before construction or modification of a real estate asset can begin. Both during and after construction a contaminated land survey could be an important factor in informing risk management strategies.

• [[Environmental screenings]]- Provide a general overview of environmental risks proposed to an existing or proposed real estate development. The screening can help gain a picture of: whether or not the property in question might have been damaged by undermining, whether the property might be susceptible to ground gas, the closeness of government licensed waste disposal facilities and an assessment of a properties water resource vulnerability to contamination.

• [[Fire risk assessment]]- All work premises in the UK must have a fire risk assessment. The assessment is designed to ascertain what could start a fire, how the fire could be dealt with and ensuring that the staff will be sufficiently warned of a fire, have exits from the building and a safe place to congregate afterwards.

• [[Asbestos]] surveys- Because asbestos is extremely dangerous material to the health of humans, its use is strictly controlled. 52 countries globally have now banned the substance. The substance is banned by the [[European Union]], with the exception of its use in a very limited number of specific industrial applications. Because of its widespread use in the building industry before banning, many existing buildings contain asbestos and sites where buildings have been previously may have been contaminated with it. For this reason buildings may need an asbestos survey to ascertain the level of use of the substance and the level of contamination to the site this has resulted in.

== Techniques ==

Environmental Surveyors use a range of techniques to assess the environmental conditions of an area and compile their reports.

• Historical data is drawn from maps and older survey information to establish the exact boundaries of a property, and are also used to see if there has been any historical pollution or waste dumping on the site.

• Water Sampling allows Environmental Surveyors to gain a picture of the quality of and pollution levels in local water sources.

• In a similar way to Water Sampling, Earth Sampling can be used to analyse the level of pollutants in an area’s soil.

• Geometric data may used to establish areas that are likely to flood or monitor the spread of pollutants.

• [[Geographic information system]]s (GISs) can cross reference map data with statistical data. If an Environmental Surveyor was compiling a flood report for a building and wanted to establish the odds of a property flooding in any given year then they could cross reference the geographic location of a property with historically obtained statistical data on flooding in the area.

• Visual Inspection might be used if for example the surveyor wished to establish the level of asbestos contamination to a given property. This might be enhanced by or presented in reference to the collection

== Chartered practitioners ==

In the UK as well as in many other countries globally, recognition by the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] (RICS) is looked upon as conferring a high professional standard, and guaranteeing a level of quality in the work of its member surveyors. Environmental Surveyors form one professional group within RICS and are listed in their Land Professional Group. To achieve the status of chartered environmental surveyor, the candidate must pass an assessment of professional competencies (APC). This consists of completing structured work experience and providing written documents as evidence of the activities carried out during this work experience. Finally the candidate must pass an hour long oral exam. All surveyors regardless of their field are required to demonstrate mastery of RICS core competencies, and then move on to demonstrate knowledge of competencies in their specific fields. Competencies specific to environmental surveying include:

• sustainability 
• contaminated land 
• environmental assessment 
• environmental audit
• laboratory procedures
• management of the natural environment and landscape

Outside of the UK, other professional bodies may offer equivalent designations to signify the professional level of environmental surveyors.
&lt;!--
== Surveyors practices in the UK ==

General surveyors may perform the duties of an environmental surveyor as one of a range of services they supply. If they are a chartered surveyor, they will have completed an APC however it will not be in the specific area of environmental surveying. An example of a practice of this sort would be the London-based.&lt;ref&gt;Dunsin Surveyors&lt;/ref&gt;

A relatively small number out of the total number of surveying companies in the UK specialise in environmental surveying. Some practices such as &lt;ref&gt;Wilbourn Associates&lt;/ref&gt; are explicitly a company of Environmental Surveyors, providing the services outlined above. Other companies such as &lt;ref&gt;Kernon Countryside Consultants&lt;/ref&gt; incorporate environmental services into a wider remit of surveying work, in this case rural surveying.--&gt;

'''''Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi''''' is a [[sculpture]] created by American artist [[Richard Serra]]. Originally created in 1986 for the [[Reina Sofia Museum]], the sculpture was put into storage in 1988. In 2006, the museum admitted that they had lost the sculpture and had no idea where it was. Serra created a replicate sculpture which is currently on display in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/equal-parallel-guernica-bengasi|title=Equal-Parallel: Guernica-Bengasi |website=museoreinasofia.es |publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the [[Reina Sofia Museum]] for the exhibition 'Referencias: Un encuentro artístico en el tiempo' (''References: An artistic encounter in time''), which took place between 26 May-15 September 1986.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4626502.stm|title= Madrid 'mislays' Serra sculpture|date=19 January 2006 |website= bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News |access-date=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 January 2006 |title=El Reina Sofía ha 'perdido' una escultura de 38 toneladas que dejó en depósito hace 14 años | url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/01/18/cultura/1137601181.html |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serra was paid $200,000 for the art work, which weighed 38 tonnes.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In March 1988, the sculpture was placed into storage with the company Fluiters S.A., who specialized in the storage of works of art. In November 1990, the sculpture was taken out of storage and placed back on display briefly. On 25 November 1990 the sculpture was placed back into storage with the company Macarrón S.A. According to museum documentation, the sculpture was still in the storage through the year 1992.

In October 2005, the museum director Ana Martínez de Aguilar wanted to display the sculpture and found that it could not be located.&lt;ref name="EM" /&gt; The company it had been stored with had gone into receivership in 1998 and the sculpture could not be accounted for. The [[ABC (newspaper)|Spanish newspaper ''ABC'']] speculated that the sculpture may have been sold for scrap metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tremlett|first= Giles|date=19 January 2006 |title=Museum discovers loss of 38-tonne sculpture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/19/arts.spain|work=The Guardian |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the museum made a deal with Serra to create a [[replica]] of the original. In 2009 the replica was reinstated in the museum and is currently exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 February 2009 |title=La escultura robada de richard serra vuelve a verse desde manana en el reina sofía en una réplica gemela |url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/sociedad/noticias/1025919/02/09/La-escultura-robada-de-richard-serra-vuelve-a-verse-desde-manana-en-el-reina-sofia-en-una-replica-gemela.html |work=El Economist |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date=5 December 2017|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47298">{{short description|The reproductive physiology of fishes}}
[[Fish]] reproductive organs include [[testicle|testes]] and [[ovary|ovaries]]. In most species, [[gonad]]s are [[Bilateria|paired organs]] of similar size, which can be partially or totally fused.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt; There may also be a range of secondary organs that increase reproductive fitness. The [[genital papilla]] is a small, fleshy tube behind the [[anus]] in some fishes, from which the [[sperm]] or [[egg]]s are released; the sex of a fish often can be determined by the shape of its papilla.

==Anatomy==

===Testes===
Most male fish have two [[testes]] of similar size. In the case of [[shark]]s, the testes on the right side is usually larger{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. The primitive [[jawless fish]] have only a single testis, located in the midline of the body, although even this forms from the fusion of paired structures in the embryo.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

Under a tough membranous shell, the [[tunica albuginea (testicles)|tunica albuginea]], the testis of some [[teleost]] fish, contains very fine coiled tubes called [[seminiferous tubules]]. The tubules are lined with a layer of cells ([[germ cells]]) that from [[puberty]] into old age, develop into [[sperm]] [[cell (biology)|cells]] (also known as [[spermatozoa]] or male [[gametes]]).  The developing sperm travel through the seminiferous tubules to the [[rete testis]] located in the [[mediastinum testis]], to the [[efferent ducts]], and then to the [[epididymis]] where newly created sperm cells mature (see [[spermatogenesis]]).  The sperm move into the [[vas deferens]], and are eventually expelled through the [[urethra]] and out of the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urethral orifice]] through muscular contractions.

However, most fish do not possess seminiferous tubules. Instead, the sperm are produced in spherical structures called ''sperm ampullae''. These are seasonal structures, releasing their contents during the breeding season, and then being reabsorbed by the body. Before the next breeding season, new sperm ampullae begin to form and ripen. The ampullae are otherwise essentially identical to the seminiferous tubules in [[higher vertebrates]], including the same range of cell types.&lt;ref name=VB&gt;{{cite book |author=Romer, Alfred Sherwood|author2=Parsons, Thomas S.|year=1977 |title=The Vertebrate Body |publisher=Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 385–386|isbn= 978-0-03-910284-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[spermatogonia]] distribution, the structure of [[teleost]]s [[testes]] has two types: in the most common, spermatogonia occur all along the [[seminiferous tubule]]s, while in Atherinomorph fish they are confined to the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] portion of these structures. Fish can present cystic or semi-cystic [[spermatogenesis]] in relation to the release phase of germ cells in cysts to the seminiferous tubules [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guimaraes-Cruz, Rodrigo J.|author2=Santos, José E. dos|author3=Santos, Gilmar B.|title=Gonadal structure and gametogenesis of ''Loricaria lentiginosa'' Isbrücker (Pisces, Teleostei, Siluriformes)|journal=Rev.

===Ovaries===
[[File:Torskens indre organer.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|3. [[Ovary]] of a female [[Atlantic cod]]}}]]

Many of the features found in [[ovaries]] are common to all vertebrates, including the presence of [[follicular cell]]s and [[Tunica albuginea (ovaries)|tunica albuginea]] There may be hundreds or even millions of fertile eggs present in the ovary of a fish at any given time. Fresh eggs may be developing from the [[Germinal epithelium (female)|germinal epithelium]] throughout life. [[Corpora lutea]] are found only in mammals, and in some [[elasmobranch]] fish; in other species, the remnants of the follicle are quickly resorbed by the ovary.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; The ovary of [[teleost]]s is often contains a hollow, [[lymph]]-filled space which opens into the [[oviduct]], and into which the eggs are shed.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt; Most normal female fish have two ovaries.  In some [[elasmobranch]]s, only the right ovary develops fully. In the primitive [[jawless fish]], and some teleosts, there is only one ovary, formed by the fusion of the paired organs in the embryo.&lt;ref name=VB/&gt;

Fish ovaries may be of three types: gymnovarian, secondary gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the [[oocyte]]s are released directly into the [[coelom]]ic cavity and then enter the [[Ostium of Fallopian tube|ostium]], then through the [[oviduct]] and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed [[Ovum|ova]] into the [[coelom]] from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the [[oviduct]].&lt;ref name="Brito"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-09352003000500018|title=Reproduction of the surubim catfish (Pisces, Pimelodidae) in the São Francisco River, Pirapora Region, Minas Gerais, Brazil|last=Brito|first=M.F.G.|author2=Bazzoli, N.|journal=Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinária e Zootecnia|volume=55|issue=5|year=2003|doi=10.1590/S0102-09352003000500018|issn=0102-0935|pages=624–633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnovaries are the primitive condition found in [[lungfish]], [[sturgeon]], and [[bowfin]].

The eggs of fish and [[amphibian]]s are jellylike. [[Chondrichthyes|Cartilagenous fish]] (sharks, skates, rays, chimaeras) eggs are fertilized internally and exhibit a wide variety of both internal and external embryonic development. Most fish species spawn eggs that are fertilized externally, typically with the male inseminating the eggs after the female lays them. These eggs do not have a shell and would dry out in the air. Even air-breathing amphibians lay their eggs in water, or in protective foam as with the Coast foam-nest treefrog, ''[[Chiromantis xerampelina]]''.

}}

Male [[cartilaginous fish]]es (sharks and rays), as well as the males of some live-bearing [[ray finned fish]]es, have fins that have been modified to function as [[intromittent organ]]s, reproductive appendages which allow [[internal fertilization]]. In ray finned fish they are called ''gonopodiums'' or ''andropodiums'', and in cartilaginous fish they are called ''claspers''.

''Gonopodia'' are found on the males of some species in the [[Anablepidae]] and [[Poeciliidae]] families. They are anal fins that have been modified to function as movable intromittent organs and are used to impregnate females with [[milt]] during mating.  The third, fourth and fifth rays of the male's anal fin are formed into a tube-like structure in which the sperm of the fish is ejected.&lt;ref&gt;Kapoor BG and Khanna B (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7WhoPBdAooC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;lpg=PA498 ''Ichthyology Handbook''] pp. 497–498, Springer Science &amp; Business Media. {{ISBN|9783540428541}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When ready for mating, the gonopodium becomes erect and points forward towards the female. The male shortly inserts the organ into the sex opening of the female, with hook-like adaptations that allow the fish to grip onto the female to ensure impregnation. If a female remains stationary and her partner contacts her vent with his gonopodium, she is fertilized. The sperm is preserved in the female's oviduct. This allows females to fertilize themselves at any time without further assistance from males. In some species, the gonopodium may be half the total body length. Occasionally the fin is too long to be used, as in the "lyretail" breeds of ''[[Xiphophorus helleri]]''. Hormone treated females may develop gonopodia. These are useless for breeding.

Similar organs with similar characteristics are found in other fishes, for example the ''andropodium'' in the ''[[Hemirhamphodon]]'' or in the [[Goodeidae]].&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G, Collette BB, Facey DH and Bowen BW (2009) [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/helfman/ ''The Diversity of Fishes: Biology, Evolution, and Ecology''] p. 35, Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-2494-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Clasper]]s'' are found on the males of [[cartilaginous fish]]es. They are the posterior part of the pelvic fins that have also been modified to function as intromittent organs, and are used to channel semen into the female's [[cloaca]] during copulation. The act of mating in sharks usually includes raising one of the claspers to allow water into a siphon through a specific [[Body orifice|orifice]].  The clasper is then inserted into the cloaca, where it opens like an umbrella to anchor its position. The siphon then begins to contract expelling water and sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fishbase.org/Glossary/Glossary.php?q=clasper&amp;language=english&amp;sc=is |title=System glossary |work=FishBase |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Timetree of Life: Cartilaginous Fishes (Chondrichthyes) |last=Heinicke |first=Matthew P. |last2=Naylor |first2=Gavin J.

==Physiology==
[[Oogonia]] development in teleosts fish varies according to the group, and the determination of oogenesis dynamics allows the understanding of maturation and fertilisation processes. Changes in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], ooplasm, and the surrounding layers characterize the oocyte maturation process.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes"/&gt;

Postovulatory [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]]s are structures formed after oocyte release; they do not have [[endocrine]] function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the [[apoptosis]] of follicular cells. A degenerative process called [[follicular atresia]] reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.&lt;ref name="Guimaraes" /&gt;

Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, having both testes and ovaries either at different phases in their life cycle or, as in [[hamlet (fish)|hamlets]], have them simultaneously.

==Reproductive strategies==
{{further|Modes of reproduction|Spawning|Ichthyoplankton|Pregnancy in fish}}

In fish, fertilisation of eggs can be either external or internal.  In many species of fish, fins have been modified to allow [[Fish fin#Internal fertilization|Internal fertilisation]].  Similarly, development of the embryo can be external or internal, although some species show a change between the two at various stages of embryo development. [[Thierry Lodé]]  described reproductive strategies in terms of the development of the zygote and the interrelationship with the parents; there are five classifications - ovuliparity, oviparity, ovo-viviparity, histotrophic viviparity and hemotrophic viviparity.&lt;ref name=Lode2012&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Reproductive Biology |volume=12 |issue=3 |year=2012 |pages=259–264 |title=Oviparity or viviparity? That is the question… |author=Lodé, T. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1642431X12000022 |accessdate=November 4, 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.repbio.2012.09.001|pmid=23153695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ovuliparity===
Ovuliparity means the female lays unfertilised eggs (ova), which must then be externally fertilised.&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; Examples of ovuliparous fish include [[salmon]], [[goldfish]], [[cichlid]]s, [[tuna]] and [[eel]]s. In the majority of these species, fertilisation takes place outside the mother's body, with the male and female fish shedding their [[gamete]]s into the surrounding water.

===Oviparity===
{{main|Oviparity}}
Oviparity is where fertilisation occurs internally and so the female sheds zygotes (or newly developing embryos) into the water,&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; often with important outer tissues added. Over 97% of all known fish are [[oviparous]].&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;Peter Scott: ''Livebearing Fishes'', p. 13. Tetra Press 1997. {{ISBN|1-56465-193-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In oviparous fish, internal fertilisation requires the male to use some sort of [[Ichthyology terms#I|intromittent organ]] to deliver sperm into the genital opening of the female.  Examples include the oviparous sharks, such as the [[horn shark]], and oviparous rays, such as [[Skate (fish)|skate]]s. In these cases, the male is equipped with a pair of modified [[pelvic]] fins known as [[claspers]].

Marine fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. The eggs have an average diameter of {{convert|1|mm}}. The eggs are generally surrounded by the [[extraembryonic membrane]]s but do not develop a shell, hard or soft, around these membranes. Some fish have thick, leathery coats, especially if they must withstand physical force or desiccation. These type of eggs can also be very small and fragile.

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Oeufs002b,55.png|Egg of [[bullhead shark]]
File:Oeufs002b,56.png|Egg of [[chimaera]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called [[larva]]e. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large [[yolk sac]] (for nourishment) and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed [[metamorphosis]]) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae  must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on [[zooplankton]] prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.

===Ovoviviparity===
{{main|Ovoviviparity}}
In [[ovoviviparous]] fish the eggs develop inside the mother's body after internal fertilisation but receive little or no nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on a food reserve inside the egg, the [[yolk]].&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include [[Guppy|guppies]], [[angel shark]]s, and [[coelacanth]]s.

===Viviparity===
{{main|Viviparity}}
There are two types of [[viviparity]], differentiated by how the offspring gain their nutrients.

* Histotrophic (tissue eating) viviparity means embryos develop in the female's oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other tissues, such as ova ([[oophagy]]) or zygotes.&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; This has been observed primarily among sharks such as the [[shortfin mako]] and [[porbeagle]], but is known for a few bony fish as well such as the [[halfbeak]] ''[[Nomorhamphus ebrardtii]]''.&lt;ref name="Meisner"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meisner | first1 = A | last2 = Burns | first2 = J | year = 1997 | title = Viviparity in the Halfbeak Genera ''Dermogenys'' and ''Nomorhamphus'' (Teleostei: Hemiramphidae) | url = | journal = Journal of Morphology | volume = 234 | issue = 3| pages = 295–317 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4687(199712)234:3&lt;295::aid-jmor7&gt;3.3.co;2-p| pmid = 29852651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual mode of vivipary is adelphophagy or [[intrauterine cannibalism]], in which the largest embryos eat weaker, smaller unborn siblings. This is most commonly found among sharks such as the [[grey nurse shark]], but has also been reported for ''Nomorhamphus ebrardtii''.&lt;ref name="Meisner" /&gt;
* Hemotrophic (blood eating) viviparity means embryos develop in the female's (or male's) oviduct and nutrients are provided directly by the parent, typically via a structure similar to, or analogous to the [[placenta]] seen in [[placentalia|mammals]].&lt;ref name=Lode2012/&gt; Examples of hemotrophic fish include the [[surfperch]]es, [[Goodeidae|splitfins]], [[lemon shark]], [[seahorse]]s and [[pipefish]].

[[Fishkeeping|Aquarists]] commonly refer to ovoviviparous and viviparous fish as [[livebearers]].

{{main|Hermaphroditism}}

[[Hermaphroditism]] occurs when a given individual in a species possesses both male and female reproductive organs, or can alternative between possessing first one, and then the other. Hermaphroditism is common in invertebrates but rare in vertebrates. It can be contrasted with [[gonochorism]], where each individual in a species is either male or female, and remains that way throughout their lives. Most fish are gonochorists, but hermaphroditism is known to occur in 14 families of [[teleost]] fishes.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984"&gt;Shapiro DY (1984) "Sex reversal and sociodemographics processes in coral reef fishes" Pages 103–116 in GW Potts and RK Wootoon, eds., ''Fish reproduction: Strategies and tactics'', Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually hermaphrodites are ''[[Sequential hermaphroditism|sequential]]'', meaning they can [[Sex change|switch sex]], usually from female to male ([[protogyny]]). This can happen if a dominant male is removed from a group of females. The largest female in the harem can switch sex over a few days and replace the dominant male.&lt;ref name="Shapiro1984" /&gt; This is found amongst [[coral reef fish]]es such as [[grouper]]s, [[parrotfish]]es and [[wrass]]es. It is less common for a male to switch to a female ([[protandry]]).&lt;ref name="Moyle&amp;Cech"&gt;Moyle PB and Cech JJ (2004) ''Fishes, An Introduction to Ichthyology.'' 5th Ed, Benjamin Cummings. {{ISBN|978-0-13-100847-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|162}} As an example, most [[wrasse]]s are [[protogynous]] hermaphrodites within a haremic mating system.&lt;ref name="Robertson1978"&gt;{{Cite journal

Less commonly hermaphrodites can be ''synchronous'', meaning they simultaneously possess both ovaries and testicles and can function as either sex at any one time.

Because such egg trading is advantageous to both individuals, hamlets are typically monogamous for short periods of time–an unusual situation in fishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer EA, Peterson CW | year = 1987 | title = The evolution of sexuality in the seabasses | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 37 | issue = 7| pages = 482–489 | doi = 10.2307/1310420 | jstor = 1310420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sex of many fishes is not fixed, but can change with physical and social changes to the environment where the fish lives.&lt;ref&gt;Chan STH and Yeung WSB (1983) "Sex control and sex reversal in fish under natural conditions".

The [[mangrove rivulus]] ''Kryptolebias marmoratus'' produces both eggs and sperm by [[meiosis]] and routinely reproduces by self-fertilization.  Each individual [[hermaphrodite]] normally fertilizes itself when an egg and sperm that it has produced by an internal organ unite inside the fish's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakakura | first1 = Y. | last2 = Soyano | first2 = K. | last3 = Noakes | first3 = D.L.G. | last4 = Hagiwara | first4 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Gonadal morphology in the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10228-006-0362-2#/page-1 | journal = Ichthyological Research | volume = 53 | issue = 4| pages = 427–430 | doi=10.1007/s10228-006-0362-2| hdl = 10069/35713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In nature, this mode of reproduction can yield highly [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] lines composed of individuals so genetically uniform as to be, in effect, identical to one another.&lt;ref name=Avise&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avise JC, Tatarenkov A |title=Allard's argument versus Baker's contention for the adaptive significance of selfing in a hermaphroditic fish |journal=Proc.

Although [[inbreeding]], especially in the extreme form of self-fertilization, is ordinarily regarded as detrimental because it leads to expression of deleterious recessive alleles, self-fertilization does provide the benefit of ''fertilization assurance'' (reproductive assurance) at each generation.&lt;ref name=Avise /&gt;

===Sexual parasitism===

Sexual parasitism is a mode of [[sexual reproduction]], unique to [[anglerfish]], in which the males of a species are much smaller than the females, and rely on the females for food and protection from predators.  The males give nothing back except the [[sperm]] which the females need in order to produce the next generation.

Some anglerfish, like those of the deep sea [[Ceratiidae|ceratioid]] group, employ this unusual mating method. Because individuals are very thinly distributed, encounters are also very rare. Therefore, finding a mate is problematic. When scientists first started capturing ceratioid anglerfish, they noticed that all the specimens were female. These individuals were a few centimetres in size and almost all of them had what appeared to be [[Parasitism|parasites]] attached to them. It turned out that these "parasites" were highly reduced male ceratioid anglerfish. This indicates the anglerfish use a [[polyandry|polyandrous]] mating system.

The methods by which the anglerfish locate mates are variable. Some species have minute eyes unfit for identifying females, while others have underdeveloped nostrils, making it unlikely that they effectively find females using olfaction.&lt;ref name=Pietsch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietsch|first=Theodore W.|title=Dimorphism, parasitism, and sex revisited: modes of reproduction among deep-sea ceratioid anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes)|journal=Ichthyological Research|date=25 August 2005|volume=52|issue=3|pages=207–236|doi=10.1007/s10228-005-0286-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an [[enzyme]] that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level.&lt;ref name="gould"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes |year=1983 |publisher=W.

After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species.

One explanation for the [[evolution]] of sexual parasitism is that the relative low density of females in deep-sea environments leaves little opportunity for mate choice among anglerfish. Females remain large to accommodate [[fecundity]], as is evidenced by their large ovaries and eggs. Males would be expected to shrink to reduce metabolic costs in resource-poor environments and would develop highly specialized female-finding abilities. If a male manages to find a female parasitic attachment, then it is ultimately more likely to improve lifetime fitness relative to free living, particularly when the prospect of finding future mates is poor. An additional advantage to parasitism is that the male's sperm can be used in multiple fertilizations, as he stays always available to the female for mating. Higher densities of male-female encounters might correlate with species that demonstrate [[facultative]] parasitism or simply use a more traditional temporary contact mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miya|first=Masaki|author2=Pietsch, Theodore W |author3=Orr, James W |author4=Arnold, Rachel J |author5=Satoh, Takashi P |author6=Shedlock, Andrew M |author7=Ho, Hsuan-Ching |author8=Shimazaki, Mitsuomi |author9=Yabe, Mamoru |author10= Nishida, Mutsumi |title=Evolutionary history of anglerfishes (Teleostei: Lophiiformes): a mitogenomic perspective|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=58|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-10-58|pmid=20178642|pmc=2836326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parthenogenesis===
{{main|Parthenogenesis}}

[[Parthenogenesis]] is a form of [[asexual reproduction]] in which growth and development of [[embryos]] occur without [[fertilization]]. In animals, parthenogenesis means development of an embryo from an unfertilized [[Gametophyte|egg cell]]. The first all-female (unisexual) reproduction in [[vertebrates]] was described in the ''[[Amazon molly]]'' in 1932.&lt;ref name=Hubbs&amp;Hubbs1932&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hubbs|first=C. L.|author2=Hubbs, L. C.|title=Apparent parthenogenesis in nature, in a form of fish of hybrid origin|journal=Science|year=1932|volume=76|issue=1983|pages=628–630|doi=10.1126/science.76.1983.628|pmid=17730035|bibcode = 1932Sci....76..628H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then at least 50 species of unisexual vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders.&lt;ref name=UnisexualList&gt;Vrijenhoek, R.C., R.M. Dawley, C.J. Cole, and J.P. Bogart. 1989. A list of the known unisexual vertebrates, pp. 19-23 ''in'': Evolution and Ecology of Unisexual Vertebrates. R.M. Dawley and J.P. Bogart (eds.) Bulletin 466, New York State Museum, Albany, New York&lt;/ref&gt; As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.

Parthenogenesis in sharks has been confirmed in the [[bonnethead]]&lt;ref name=Chapman2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Demian D.|author2=Shivji, Mahmood S. |author3=Louis, Ed |author4=Sommer, Julie |author5=Fletcher, Hugh |author6= Prodöhl, Paulo A. |title=Virgin birth in a hammerhead shark|journal=Biology Letters|year=2007|volume=3|issue=4|pages=425–427|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0189|pmid=17519185|pmc=2390672}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[zebra shark]].&lt;ref name="zebra shark"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=D.

A special case of parthenogenesis is [[gynogenesis]]. In this type of reproduction, offspring are produced by the same mechanism as in parthenogenesis, however, the egg is stimulated to develop simply by the ''presence'' of [[sperm]] - the sperm cells do not contribute any genetic material to the offspring. Because gynogenetic species are all female, activation of their eggs requires mating with males of a closely related species for the needed stimulus. The [[Amazon molly]], (pictured), reproduces by gynogenesis.

===Others===
The elkhorn sculpin (''[[Alcichthys elongatus]]'') is a marine teleost with a unique reproductive mode called “internal gametic association”. Sperm are introduced into the ovary by copulation and then enter the micropylar canal of ovulated eggs in the ovarian cavity.  However, actual sperm-egg fusion does not occur until the eggs have been released into sea water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=292|issue=2|pages=145–155|year=2002|author=Koya, Y., Munehara, H. and Takano, K.|title=Sperm storage and motility in the ovary of the marine sculpin Alcichthys alcicornis (Teleostei: Scorpaeniformes), with internal gametic association|doi=10.1002/jez.1150|pmid=11754030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inbreeding==

===Inbreeding depression===

The effect of [[inbreeding]] on reproductive behavior was studied in the [[Poeciliidae|poeciliid]] fish ''Heterandria formosa''.&lt;ref name="pmid19486236"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ala-Honkola O, Uddström A, Pauli BD, Lindström K |title=Strong inbreeding depression in male mating behaviour in a poeciliid fish |journal=J. Evol. Biol. |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1396–406 |year=2009 |pmid=19486236 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01765.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One generation of full-sib mating was found to decrease reproductive performance and likely reproductive success of male progeny.  Other traits that displayed [[inbreeding depression]] were offspring viability and maturation time of both males and females.

Exposure of zebra fish to a chemical environmental agent, analogous to that caused by anthropogenic pollution, amplified the effects of inbreeding on key reproductive traits.&lt;ref name="pmid23798977"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bickley LK, Brown AR, Hosken DJ, Hamilton PB, Le Page G, Paull GC, Owen SF, Tyler CR |title=Interactive effects of inbreeding and endocrine disruption on reproduction in a model laboratory fish |journal=Evol Appl |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=279–89 |year=2013 |pmid=23798977 |pmc=3689353 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00288.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embryo viability was significantly reduced in inbred exposed fish and there was a tendency for inbred males to sire fewer offspring.

The behaviors of juvenile [[Coho salmon]] with either low or medium inbreeding were compared in paired contests.&lt;ref name="pmid16189545"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gallardo JA, Neira R |title=Environmental dependence of inbreeding depression in cultured Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch): aggressiveness, dominance and intraspecific competition |journal=Heredity (Edinb) |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=449–56 |year=2005 |pmid=16189545 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800741 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fish with low inbreeding showed almost twice the aggressive pursuit in defending territory than fish with medium inbreeding, and furthermore had a higher specific growth rate.  A significant effect of [[inbreeding depression]] on juvenile survival was also found, but only in high-density competitive environments, suggesting that intra-specific competition can magnify the deleterious effects of inbreeding.

===Inbreeding avoidance===

Inbreeding ordinarily has negative fitness consequences (inbreeding depression), and as a result species have evolved mechanisms to avoid inbreeding.  Numerous [[inbreeding avoidance]] mechanisms operating prior to mating have been described.  However, inbreeding avoidance mechanisms that operate subsequent to copulation are less well known.  In guppies, a post-copulatory mechanism of inbreeding avoidance occurs based on competition between sperm of rival males for achieving [[fertilisation]].&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitzpatrick JL, Evans JP |title=Postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance in guppies |journal=J. Evol. Biol. |volume=27 |issue=12 |pages=2585–94 |year=2014 |pmid=25387854 |doi=10.1111/jeb.12545 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In competitions between sperm from an unrelated male and from a full sibling male, a significant bias in paternity towards the unrelated male was observed.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick /&gt;

Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of [[Zygosity#Homozygous|homozygous]] deleterious recessive mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid19834483"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Charlesworth D, Willis JH |title=The genetics of inbreeding depression |journal=Nat.

==Examples==
[[File:Frai de poissons rouges anim.gif|thumb|right|Female [[goldfish]] spawn (discharge) eggs into the water, encouraged by male goldfish who simultaneously discharge sperm which externally fertilizes the eggs]]
[[File:Goldfishfry.JPG|thumb|right|Within two or three days, the vulnerable goldfish eggs hatch into [[larva]]e, and rapidly develop into fry]]

;Goldfish
[[Goldfish]], like all [[cyprinid]]s, are egg-layers. They usually start breeding after a significant temperature change, often in spring. Males chase females, prompting them to release their eggs by bumping and nudging them. As the female goldfish spawns her eggs, the male goldfish stays close behind fertilizing them. Their eggs are adhesive and attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch within 48 to 72 hours. Within a week or so, the fry begins to assume its final shape, although a year may pass before they develop a mature goldfish colour; until then they are a metallic brown like their wild ancestors. In their first weeks of life, the fry grow quickly—an adaptation born of the high risk of getting devoured by the adult goldfish.

;Carp

A member of the Cyprinidae, carp spawn in times between April and August, largely dependent upon the climate and conditions they live in. Oxygen levels of the water, availability of food, size of each fish, age, number of times the fish has spawned before and water temperature are all factors known to effect when and how many eggs each carp will spawn at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.carp.me.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321205019/http://www.carp.me.uk/ |date=2011-03-21 }} Carp Spawning Information&lt;/ref&gt;

;Siamese fighting fish
Prior to spawning, male [[Siamese fighting fish]] build [[bubble nest]]s of varying sizes at the surface of the water. When a male becomes interested in a female, he will flare his gills, twist his body, and spread his fins. The female darkens in colour and curves her body back and forth. The act of spawning takes place in a "nuptial embrace" where the male wraps his body around the female, each embrace resulting in the release of 10-40 eggs until the female is exhausted of eggs. The male, from his side, releases [[milt]] into the water and fertilization takes place externally. During and after spawning, the male uses his mouth to retrieve sinking eggs and deposit them in the bubble nest (during mating the female sometimes assists her partner, but more often she will simply devour all the eggs that she manages to catch). Once the female has released all of her eggs, she is chased away from the male's territory, as it is likely that she'll eat the eggs due to hunger.&lt;ref&gt;Leong, Paul (2004). {{cite web |url=http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302133251/http://www.cbsbettas.org/doc/articles/Tips_on_Spawning_Bettas.htm |archivedate=2009-03-02 |df= }}. Retrieved on March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The eggs then remain in the male's care. He keeps them in the bubble nest, making sure none fall to the bottom and repairing the nest as needed. Incubation lasts for 24–36 hours, and the newly hatched larvae remain in the nest for the next 2–3 days, until their yolk sacs are fully absorbed. Afterwards the fry leave the nest and the free-swimming stage begins.&lt;ref&gt;Rainwate FL and Miller EJ (1967) [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/oas/oas_pdf/v47/p98_114.pdf "Courtship and reproductive behavior of the Siamese fighting fish, ''Betta splendens Regan''"] ''Proceedings of the Oklahoma  Academy of Science'', Oklahoma State University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''fruitless'' gene''' (''fru'') is a ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' [[gene]] that encodes several variants of a putative [[transcription factor]] [[protein]]. Normal ''fruitless'' function is required for proper development of several anatomical structures necessary for courtship, including [[motor neurons]] which innervate [[muscles]] needed for fly sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt; The gene does not have an obvious mammalian homolog, but appears to function in sex determination in species as distant as the mosquito ''Anopheles gambiae''.&lt;ref name="pmid16319090"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gailey DA, Billeter JC, Liu JH, Bauzon F, Allendorfer JB, Goodwin SF | title = Functional conservation of the fruitless male sex-determination gene across 250 Myr of insect evolution | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–43 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16319090 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msj070 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''fruitless'' serves as an example of how a gene or a group of genes may regulate the development and/or function of neurons involved in innate behavior.  Research on ''fruitless'' has received attention in the popular press, since it provokes discussion on [[Biology and sexual orientation|genetics of human sexual orientation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Atlantic  | url = https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199706/homosexuality-biology/4 | title = Homosexuality and Biology, The Genetic Quest | date = June 1997 | first = Chandler | last = Burr | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The New York Times | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E1D9173EF930A25751C1A960958260 | title = Mating Game of Fruit Fly Is Traced to a Single Gene | date = December 13, 1996 | first = Nicholas | last = Wade | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and behaviors such as gender-specific [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = The Guardian | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,1952198,00.html | title = Flies reveal gene that makes girls fight like boys | date = November 20, 2006 | first = Ian | last = Sample }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
[[Male]] flies with mutations in the ''fruitless'' gene display altered sexual behavior. Fruitfly courtship, which involves a complex male-initiated [[ritual]], may be disrupted in many ways by mutated ''fru'' [[alleles]]; ''fru'' is necessary for every step in the ritual. Some alleles prevent courting entirely, while others disrupt individual components. Notably, some [[loss-of-function]] alleles change or remove [[sexual orientation|sexual preference]].&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Demir E, Dickson BJ | title = fruitless splicing specifies male courtship behavior in Drosophila | journal = Cell | volume = 121 | issue = 5 | pages = 785–94 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15935764 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.04.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many genes are known to be involved in male courtship behavior, the ''fruitless'' gene has been considered noteworthy because it exhibits sex-specific [[alternative splicing]]. When females produce the male-spliced gene product, they behave as males. Males that do not produce the male-specific product do not court females and are infertile.&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt; In the brain, a subset (ca. 2,000) of neurons express ''fruitless''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cachero S, Ostrovsky AD, Yu JY, Dickson BJ, Jefferis GS | title = Sexual dimorphism in the fly brain | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 18 | pages = 1589–601 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20832311 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.07.045 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''fruitless'' expression is sufficient to instruct sexually dimorphic connectivity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kohl J, Ostrovsky AD, Frechter S, Jefferis GS | title = A bidirectional circuit switch reroutes pheromone signals in male and female brains | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 7 | pages = 1610–23 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24360281 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.11.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruta V, Datta SR, Vasconcelos ML, Freeland J, Looger LL, Axel R | title = A dimorphic pheromone circuit in Drosophila from sensory input to descending output | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7324 | pages = 686–90 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21124455 | doi = 10.1038/nature09554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''fruitless'' has at least four [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], each encoding proteins containing both a BTB (Broad complex/tramtrack/bric-a-brac) domain and a [[zinc finger]] [[Structural motif|motif]]. Alternative splicing occurs at both the 5' and 3' ends, and there are several variants (other than the male- and female-specific splicing patterns).&lt;ref name="Demir_Dickson_2005"/&gt;  The fruitless gene locus also controls the expression of hundreds of other genes,&lt;ref name="pmid18039034"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman TD, Arbeitman MN | title = Genomic and functional studies of Drosophila sex hierarchy regulated gene expression in adult head and nervous system tissues | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = e216 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18039034 | pmc = 2082469 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; any subset of which may actually regulate behavior.

==Name==
Early work refers to the gene as ''fruity'', an apparent pun on both the common name of ''D. melanogaster'', the ''fruit fly'', as well as a [[slang]] word for [[homosexual]]. As [[social]] attitudes towards homosexuality changed, ''fruity'' came to be regarded as offensive, or at best, not [[politically correct]]. Thus, the gene was re-dubbed ''fruitless'', alluding to the lack of offspring produced by flies with the mutation.&lt;ref name="pmid2542123"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gailey DA, Hall JC | title = Behavior and cytogenetics of fruitless in Drosophila melanogaster: different courtship defects caused by separate, closely linked lesions | journal = Genetics | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 773–85 | date = April 1989 | pmid = 2542123 | pmc = 1203660 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, despite the original name and a continuing history of misleading inferences by the popular media, fruitless mutants primarily show defects in male-female courtship, though certain mutants cause male-male or female-female courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = GeneBrief - fruitless | work = InteractiveFly | publisher = Society for Developmental Biology | url = http://www.sdbonline.org/sites/fly/dbzhnsky/frutles1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''grave field''' is a prehistoric [[cemetery]], typically of [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age Europe]].

Grave fields are distinguished from [[necropolis|necropoleis]] by the former's lack of above-ground structures, buildings, or grave markers.

==Types==
Grave fields can be classified by type of [[burial custom]]:
*[[tumulus]] ([[kurgan]]) fields
*[[flat grave]]s
*row graves: grave fields arranged in rows
*[[ossuary|ossuaries]]
*[[shaft tomb]]s
*[[urnfield]]s

==Alemannic grave fields==

[[Alemanni]]c grave fields date to the 5th to 8th century. Before the middle of the 5th century, grave fields are small, often including less than five graves, probably corresponding to a single homestead or family. The sparsity of graves in the early period may suggest partial [[cremation]]. In the mid- to late 5th century, burial customs appear to change, with the introduction of larger row-grave fields.

Grave fields are often arranged on elevated ground outside settlements. The arrangement of graves is often east to west &amp;mdash; the head of the body placed on the western end, looking east.&lt;ref name="Gerhard Fingerlin:"&gt;Gerhard Fingerlin: ''Zur alamannischen Siedlungsgeschichte des 3.-7. Jahrhunderts''. In: Wolfgang Hübner (Hrsg.): ''Die Alamannen in der Frühzeit.'' in: ''Veröffentlichung des Alemannischen Instituts Freiburg/Br.'' Kuhn, Villingen-Schwenningen 1974,34, S.47ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the beginning of the 6th century, these row graves are accompanied by more prestigious single graves including precious [[grave good]]s. Quast (1997) assumes that the 5th-century change in burial practice was due to a renewed influx of [[Elbe Germanic]] settlers ([[Danube Swabians]] displaced by [[Goths|Gothic]] migration).

Male graves often include weapons &amp;mdash; in the mid-5th century typically a [[Francisca]] axe, besides [[Migration Period sword|spathas]] and [[seax]]es. Female graves often include jewellery, such as bracelets, ear-rings and [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]].

[[Image:Biigabe Kette.jpg|thumb|300px|6th- to 7th-century jewellery found in the [[Freiburg (region)|Freiburg district]].]]

Large Alemannic row grave fields have been excavated at [[Lauchheim]], [[Gammertingen]], [[Weingarten (Württemberg)|Weingarten]], [[Ravensburg]], all in [[Swabia]], the one in Ravensburg including over 1,000 graves dating to between 450 and 710. The field in [[Sasbach (Ortenau)|Sasbach]] includes over 2,000 graves. [[Mengen, Germany|Mengen]] has over 1,000 graves.

Alemannic graves appear south of the Rhine, in the [[Swiss Plateau]], from the 6th century. Alemannic colonization of the Swiss plateau apparently took place from the [[Basel]] area, since the number of graves there declines simultaneously. Significant influx of Alemannic settlers to the Swiss plateau begins only in the 7th century. Grave fields from this period include one at [[Elgg]]-Ettenbühl near [[Winterthur]]; with 340 graves it is the largest field south of the [[High Rhine]].

[[Germanic Christianity|Christianization]] of the Alemanni during the 7th century brings about the end of the grave field traditions. The dead from this period were buried in [[graveyard]]s near churches. Prestigious graves of local nobility appears to have resisted the Christianization of burial customs into the 8th century, possibly until the 786 decree of [[Charlemagne]] outlawing pagan burial.

'''Gynecologic cytology''', also '''Gynecologic cytology''', is a field of [[pathology]] concerned with the investigation of disorders of the female [[genital tract]].  

The most common investigation in this field is the [[Pap test]], which is used to [[screening (medicine)|screen]] for potentially precancerous lesions of the [[cervix]].  Cytology can also be used to investigate disorders of the [[ovary|ovaries]], [[uterus]], [[vagina]] and [[vulva]].

'''Habitat fragmentation''' describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] ([[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]), causing [[population fragmentation]] and  [[ecosystem decay]]. Causes of habitat fragmentation include [[geological]] processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;

[[Image:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Deforestation]] and increased [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest |road-building in the Amazon Rainforest]] are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource-extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]

==Definition==
The term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena:
* Reduction in the total area of the habitat
* Decrease of the interior: [[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat
* Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches
* Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat

"fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat, but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat" (van den Berg et al. 2001){{Failed verification|date=April 2018}}. Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation and population size. Biol. Conserv. 101:217-28
&lt;/ref&gt;

In scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term "habitat fragmentation" applies in cases of habitat loss, or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of "habitat fragmentation" per se&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; would refer to loss of habitat area as "habitat loss" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.

== Causes ==

===Natural causes===
Evidence of [[habitat destruction]] through natural processes such as [[volcanism]], fire, and [[climate change]] is found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} For example, [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica]] 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

===Human causes===
Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when [[native plant]]s is cleared for human activities such as [[agriculture]], [[Subdivision (land)|rural development]], [[urbanization]] and the creation of [[hydroelectric]] reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of [[slash and burn]] farming in [[tropical forest]]s. In the wheat belt of central western [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the [[tall grass prairie]] of [[North America]] has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.

=== Endogenous vs. exogenous  ===
There are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous are process that develop as a part of a species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|date=February 7, 2007|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications ==

=== Habitat Loss and Biodiversity ===
One of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects [[biodiversity]] is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms. Habitat fragmentation often involves both [[habitat destruction]] and the subdivision of previously continuous habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahrig|first1=Lenore|title=Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=November 2003|volume=34|issue=1|pages=487–515|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of habitat fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lienert|first1=Judit|title=Habitat fragmentation effects on fitness of plant populations – a review|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|date=July 2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–72|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2003.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat loss, which can occur through the process of habitat fragmentation, is considered to be the greatest threat to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = David S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Quantifying Threats to Imperiled Species in the United States | jstor = 1313420 | journal = BioScience | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 607–615 | doi=10.2307/1313420}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the effect of the configuration of habitat patches within the landscape, independent of the effect of the amount of habitat within the landscape (referred to as fragmentation per se&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 487–515 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt;), has been suggested to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking patch size and isolation effects: the habitat amount hypothesis | url = | journal = J. Biogeogr. | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1649–1663 | doi = 10.1111/jbi.12130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of empirical studies found that, of the 381 reported significant effect of habitat fragmentation per se on species occurrences, abundances or diversity in the scientific literature, 76% were positive whereas 24% were negative.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2017 | title = Ecological Responses to Habitat Fragmentation Per Se | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these results, the scientific literature tends to emphasize negative effects more than positive effects.&lt;ref&gt;Fahrig, L. (2018) Forty years of biais in habitat fragmentation research, In: Effective Conservation Science: Data Not Dogma (Edited by Kareiva, Marvier and Silliman), Oxford University Press, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; Positive effects of habitat fragmentation per se imply that several small patches of habitat can have higher conservation value than a single large patch of equivalent size.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017" /&gt; Land sharing strategies could therefore have more positive impacts on species than land sparing strategies.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017" /&gt;[[File:Indiana Dunes Habitat Fragmentation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Habitat fragmented by numerous roads near the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]].]]
Area is the primary determinant of the number of species in a fragment&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenzweig | first = Michael L. | authorlink = Michael Rosenzweig | title = Species diversity in space and time | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Find the weakest link. A comparison between demographic, genetic and demo-genetic metapopulation extinction times | url = | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 260 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-11-260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor fluctuations in climate, resources, or other factors that would be unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations can be catastrophic in small, isolated populations. Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction.&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig/&gt; Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be "rescued" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of [[Colonisation (biology)|immigrants]] by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the [[Columbia spotted frog]] are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.&lt;ref name = Funk&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Funk W.C. |author2=Greene A.E. |author3=Corn P.S. |author4=Allendorf F.W. | year = 2005 | title = High dispersal in a frog species suggests that it is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation | url = | journal = [[Biology Letters|Biol. Lett.]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 13–6 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, habitat fragmentation leads to [[edge effect]]s. Microclimatic changes in light, temperature and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. [[wildfire|Fires]] become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species which require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation.  Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% [[biodiversity loss]].&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, David (1997), "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction" (Scribner)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informed Conservation===
Habitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming [[threatened]] or [[endangered]]. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible continuous piece of land. In rare cases a [[conservation reliant species]] may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats.  This ongoing debate is often referred to as [[SLOSS debate|SLOSS]] (Single Large or Several Small).

One solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting [[Habitat corridor|corridors]] of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife Crossings: Animals survive with bridges and tunnels|url=http://www.wilderutopia.com/environment/wildlife/wildlife-crossings-animals-survive-bridges-tunnels/|publisher=Wilder Eutopia|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat.

Another mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants in order to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.

The best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of [[metapopulation]]s [[island biogeography]].

=== Genetic Risks ===
As the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|date=1 January 1998|title=Small and Declining Populations|journal=Conservation Science and Action|language=en|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|pages=116–134|doi=10.1002/9781444313499.ch6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last1=Frankham|first1=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Briscoe|first3=David A.|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the [[genetic diversity]] found in the previously continuous habitat.  Processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity such as [[adaptation]] have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change.

==== Gene Flow and Inbreeding ====
[[Gene flow]] occurs when individuals of the same species exchange genetic information through reproduction. Populations can maintain genetic diversity through [[Animal migration|migration]]. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration is typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KRAMER|first=ANDREA T.|last2=ISON|first2=JENNIFER L.|last3=ASHLEY|first3=MARY V.|last4=HOWE|first4=HENRY F.|date=2008-06-09|title=The Paradox of Forest Fragmentation Genetics|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=878–885|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Reduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in [[inbreeding]] between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called [[inbreeding depression]]. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of [[homozygosity]] increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlova|first=Alexandra|last2=Beheregaray|first2=Luciano B.|last3=Coleman|first3=Rhys|last4=Gilligan|first4=Dean|last5=Harrisson|first5=Katherine A.|last6=Ingram|first6=Brett A.|last7=Kearns|first7=Joanne|last8=Lamb|first8=Annika M.|last9=Lintermans|first9=Mark|date=2017-05-11|title=Severe consequences of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of an endangered Australian freshwater fish: A call for assisted gene flow |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=531–550|doi=10.1111/eva.12484|issn=1752-4571|pmc=5469170|pmid=28616062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=W|last2=Qiao|first2=Y|last3=Li|first3=S|last4=Pan|first4=W|last5=Yao|first5=M|date=2017-02-15|title=Low genetic diversity and strong population structure shaped by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation in a critically endangered primate, Trachypithecus leucocephalus|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy20172|journal=Heredity |volume=118|issue=6|pages=542–553|doi=10.1038/hdy.2017.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding depression is associated with conservation risks, like local extinction.

==== Genetic Drift ====
Small populations are more susceptible to [[genetic drift]]. Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic make up of populations and always leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Adaptation ====
In order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift. Recent studies on the impacts of habitat fragmentation on adaptation in some plant species have suggested that organisms in fragmented landscapes may be able to adapt to fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matesanz|first=Silvia|last2=Teso|first2=Rubio|last3=Luisa|first3=María|last4=García-Fernández|first4=Alfredo|last5=Escudero|first5=Adrián|date=2017|title=Habitat Fragmentation Differentially Affects Genetic Variation, Phenotypic Plasticity and Survival in Populations of a Gypsum Endemic|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00843/full|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.00843|issn=1664-462X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Jonathan|last2=Cheptou|first2=Pierre-Olivier|date=2017-01-19|title=Effects of fragmentation on plant adaptation to urban environments|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1712/20160038|journal=Phil.

=== Effect on Animal Behaviours===
Although the way habitat fragmentation affects the genetics and extinction rates of species has been heavily studied, fragmentation has also been shown to affect species' behaviours and cultures as well. This is important because social interactions have the ability to determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator prey relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Predation Behaviours ====
Habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the amount of species and the members of those species. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so called "behavioral space race" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its resulting effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to a species extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
===== Boreal Woodland Caribous =====
In the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia the effects of fragmentation are clearly demonstrated. The species refuge area is peatland bog which has been interrupted by linear features such as roads and pipelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These features have allowed their natural predators, the wolf and the black bear to more efficiently travel over landscapes and between patches of land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Since their predators can more easily access the caribous' refuge, the females of the species attempt to avoid the area, affecting their reproductive behaviours and offspring produced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
==== Communication Behaviours ====
Fragmentation affecting the communication behaviours of birds has been well studied in Dupont's Lark. The Larks primarily reside in regions of Spain and are a small passerine bird which use songs as a means of cultural transmission between members of the species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Larks have two distinct vocalizations, the song and the territorial call. The territorial call is used by males to defend and signal territory from other male Larks and is shared between neighbouring territories when males respond to a rivals song &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Occasionally it is used as a threat signal to signify an impending attack on territory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A large song repertoire can enhance a males ability to survive and reproduce as he has a greater ability to defend his territory from other males, and a larger number of males in the species means a larger variety of songs being transmitted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fragmentation of the Dupont's Lark territory from agriculture, forestry and urbanization appears to have a large effect on their communication structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Males only perceive territories of a certain distance to be rivals and so isolation of territory from others due to fragmentation leads to a decrease in territorial calls as the males no longer have any reason to use it or have any songs to match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Forest fragmentation ==
{{Commons category|Forest fragmentation}}
Forest fragmentation is a form of habitat fragmentation where forests are reduced (either naturally or man-made) to relatively small, isolated patches of forest known as forest fragments or forest remnants.&lt;ref name= "SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; The intervening matrix that separates the remaining woodland patches can be natural open areas, [[farmland]], or developed areas. Following the principles of [[island biogeography]], remnant woodlands act like islands of forest in a sea of pastures, fields, subdivisions, shopping malls, etc. These fragments will then begin to undergo the process of [[ecosystem decay]].

Forest fragmentation also includes less subtle forms of discontinuities such as utility right-of-ways (ROWs). Utility ROWs are of ecological interest because they have become pervasive in many forest communities, spanning areas as large as 5 million acres in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=K.

* the inability of individual forest fragments to support viable populations, especially of large vertebrates
* the local [[extinction]] of species that do not have at least one fragment capable of supporting a viable population
* [[edge effect]]s that alter the conditions of the outer areas of the fragment, greatly reducing the amount of true forest interior habitat.&lt;ref name = Harris&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Larry D. | year = 1984 | title =  The Fragmented Forest: Island Biogeography Theory and the Preservation of Biotic Diversity | publisher = The University of Chicago Press |isbn = 0-226-31763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of fragmentation on the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of a forest patch depends on a) the size of the patch, and b) its degree of isolation.  Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas.  For example, if a cleared area is [[reforestation|reforested]] or allowed to [[natural regeneration|regenerate]], the increasing [[structural diversity]] of the [[vegetation]] will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments.  However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.

Forest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated.  A large number of small forest "islands" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands.

== Approaches to understanding habitat fragmentation ==
Two approaches that are typically used to understand habitat fragmentation and its ecological impacts.

=== Species-oriented approach ===
The species-oriented approach focuses specifically on individual species and how they each respond to their environment and habitat changes with in it.
This approach can be limited because it does only focus on individual species and does not allow for a broad view of the impacts of habitat fragmentation across species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=February 7, 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pattern-oriented approach ====

The pattern-oriented approach is based on land cover and its patterning in correlation with species occurrences. One model of study for landscape patterning is the patch-matrix-corridor model developed by [[Richard Forman]] The pattern-oriented approach focuses on land cover defined by human means and activities. This model has stemmed from [[island biogeography]] and tries to infer causal relationships between the defined landscapes and the occurrence of species or groups of species within them. The approach has limitations in its collective assumptions across species or landscapes which may not account for variations amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Joern &amp; B. Lindenmayer, David. (2007). Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation: a synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography. 16. 265-280. 10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variegation Model ====

The other model is the variegation model. Variegated landscapes retain much of their natural vegetation but are intermixed with gradients of modified habitat &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape Ecology and Landscape Change|url=http://www.veac.vic.gov.au/reports/Chapter%202%20-%20Landscape%20Ecology%20and%20Landscape%20Change.pdf|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model of habitat fragmentation typically applies to landscapes that are modified by agriculture. In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat. In between these patches are a matrix of grassland that are often modified versions of the original habitat. These areas do not present as much of a barrier to native species.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, S., and G. W. Barrett. “Habitat Variegation, An Alternative to Fragmentation.” Conservation Biology, vol. 6, no. 1, 1992, pp. 146–147. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2385863.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helicopter dynamics''' is a field within [[aerospace engineering]] concerned with theoretical and practical aspects of [[helicopter]] flight. Its purpose is the knowledge of forces and [[torque]]s which appear in helicopter flight.

==History==
The development of helicopter dynamics arose from the necessity to improve the first helicopters.
Measuring dynamics of helicopter rotors is very challenging due to wiring and data transmission problems. Researchers have recently used [[stereophotogrammetry]] to measure dynamics of a helicopter rotor during hover &lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-6546-1_44 Using Stereophotogrammetry to Measure Dynamics of a Robinson R44 rotor]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fats}}
'''Interesterified fat''' is a type of oil where the fatty acids have been moved from one [[triglyceride]] molecule to another. This is generally done to modify the [[melting point]], slow [[rancidification]] and create an oil more suitable for [[deep frying]] or making [[margarine]] with good taste and low saturated fat content. It is not the same as [[Hydrogenated oil|partial hydrogenation]] which produces [[trans fatty acid]]s, but interesterified fats used in the food industry can come from hydrogenated fat, for simplicity and [[frugality]].

==Chemistry==

Fats such as [[soybean oil]] consist mainly of various [[triglycerides]] which are made up of a [[glycerol]] backbone esterified to three fatty acid molecules.  The triglycerides contain a mixture of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Interesterification is carried out by blending the desired oils and then rearranging the fatty acids over the glycerol backbone with, for instance, the help of catalysts or [[lipase]] enzymes.&lt;ref name=ISEO /&gt; [[Polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (PUFAs) decrease the melting point of fats significantly.  A triglyceride containing three saturated fatty acids is generally solid at room temperature and not very desirable for many applications. Rearranging these triglycerides with oils containing unsaturated fatty acids lowers the melting point and creates fats with properties better suited for target food products. In addition, blending interesterified oils with liquid oils allows the reduction in saturated fatty acids in many trans fatty acid free food products.  The interesterified fats can be separated through controlled crystallization, also called fractionation.&lt;ref name= Kellens&gt;

In vegetable polyunsaturated oils, the PUFA is commonly found at the middle position (sn2) on the glycerol.  Stearic acid is not usually found at sn2 in vegetable oils used in the human diet.&lt;ref name=ISEO&gt;{{cite web|title= Food Fats and oils

===Reviews===

===Hypotheses===
{{technical|date=March 2014}}
In most vegetable dietary fats, the [[Palmitic acid|palmitic]] (C16:0) and [[stearic acid]] (C18:0) saturated fats mainly occupy the 1- and 3-positions of the [[triacylglycerol]] molecule, whereas an unsaturated fatty acid such as [[oleic acid]] (18:1ω9) or [[linoleic acid]] (18:2ω6) usually occupies the 2-position. In animal fats, this is not the case. Interesterification of vegetable oils will enhance the amount of saturated fatty acids at the 2-position. Fatty acids at the 2-position are biologically different from fatty acids at the 1 and 3 position because they are handled differently during digestion and metabolism, and a relevant scientific question is whether there are health effects following from this. Although this question has received relatively little attention in dietary fats and health research, there are a number of good controlled human intervention studies that have addressed it.

In studies addressing the health effects of interesterification as such, a diet high in interesterified fat should be compared with a diet high in a noninteresterified fat with the same fatty acid composition. If the two diets show similar changes in the resulting blood lipid profiles (i.e. not different from each other), this indicates interesterification has no effect on metabolism or biological effects.
Conversely, effects of interesterification cannot be properly addressed if the interesterified fat and the noninteresterified fat being compared have different fatty acid compositions.

===Individual studies===
Zock et al.&lt;ref name=Zock&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/61/1/48.pdf |vauthors=Zock PJ, de Vries JH, de Fouw NJ, Katan MB |title= Positional distribution of fatty acids in dietary triglycerides: effects on fasting blood lipoprotein concentrations in humans.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1995 |volume=61|pages=48–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared the effects of an IE (interesterfied) test fat with 40% C16:0 on the 2-position with a noninteresterified test fat with only 6.5% C16:0 on the 2-position in a 3-week diet study. Despite the very high intakes and the marked difference in positional distribution, no statistically significant effects on fasting blood lipids were observed in the group as a whole. Nestel et al.&lt;ref name=Nestel&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/62/5/950.pdf  |vauthors=Nestel PJ, Noakes M, Belling GB, etal |title= Effect on plasma lipids of interesterifying a mix of edible oils.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1995 |volume= 62 |pages= 950–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of an IE fat blend with 25% C16:0 on the 2-position with a native fat blend with only 9% C16:0 on the 2-position. Again, despite a high intake level and the clear difference in positional distribution of the fats fed, no effects were observed on fasting blood lipids. Meijer and Weststrate&lt;ref name=Meijer&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v51/n8/pdf/1600437a.pdf |vauthors=Meijer GW, Weststrate JA |title=Interesterification of fats in margarine: effect on blood lipids, blood enzymes and hemostasis parameters. |journal=Eur J Clin Nutr |year=1997 |volume= 51 |pages=527–34 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1600437}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of interesterification, using a 'real' hardstock as applied in foods. The control was the same fat blend with a similar fatty acid composition, but not interesterified. The IE fat blend contained more C16:0 on the 2-position (18%) than the control blend (7%). None of the fasting levels of blood lipids measured after 3 weeks showed any change related to treatment of the fat blend. Fasting glucose level was also not affected.

In 1970, Grande et al.&lt;ref name= Grande&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/23/9/1184.pdf |vauthors=Grande F, Anderson JT, Keys A |title= Comparison of effects of palmitic and stearic acids in the diet on serum cholesterol in man. |journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 1970 |volume=23 | issue=9 |pages= 1184–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; used interesterification to prepare a blend of fats and oils mimicking the fatty acid composition of cocoa butter. No difference between the interesterified fat blend and cocoa butter was observed in levels of total cholesterol in fasting blood.

Recently, in a study funded by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, Sundram et al.&lt;ref name=NutrMetab&gt;{{cite journal
 | url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-4-3.pdf
 |vauthors=Sundram K, Karupaiah T, Hayes K |title= Stearic acid-rich interesterified fat and trans-rich fat raise the LDL/HDL ratio and plasma glucose relative to palm olein in humans |journal= Nutr Metab |year= 2007|doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-3|accessdate=2007-01-19 |volume= 4 |pages= 3
 | pmid=17224066
 | pmc=1783656}}&lt;/ref&gt;  compared the effects of three types of fat: native palm olein, a blend with partially hydrogenated soybean oil and an interesterified mixture of oils. They concluded both the IE blend and the partially hydrogenated fat blend increased the fasting ratio of [[low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] to [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL]] cholesterol, indicating an adverse effect on CVD risk. Sundram et al. also found that fasting plasma glucose levels were higher after 4 weeks on the interesterified fat than after the other diets. For the postprandial study the glucose incremental area under the curve (IAUC) following the IE meal was 40% greater than after either other meal (p&lt;0.001), and was linked to relatively depressed insulin and C-peptide (p&lt;0.05). As was pointed out in a letter to the Editor by Destaillats et al.,&lt;ref name=Dest&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/4/1/10 |vauthors=Destaillats F, Moulin J, Bezelgues JB |title= Letter to the editor: healthy alternatives to trans fats |journal=Nutr and Metab|year=2007 |volume= 4 |pages= 10 |doi=10.1186/1743-7075-4-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; a major limitation of the Sundram study is that the diets differed in overall fatty acid composition. The interesterified fat had 30% more saturated and 57% less monounsaturated fatty acids than the untreated palm olein. The direction of the effects on blood lipids are in line with what can be predicted based on these differences in fatty acid content between the study diets (Mensink 2003).&lt;ref name=Mensink&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/77/5/1146.pdf |vauthors= Mensink RP, Zock PL, Kester AD, Katan MB |title= Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials.|journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 2003 |volume=77| issue=5 |pages= 1146–1155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent study by Berry et al.&lt;ref name=berry1&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/85/6/1486.pdf |vauthors=Berry SE, Miller GJ, Sanders TA |title= The solid fat content of stearic acid-rich fats determines their postprandial effects. |journal= Am J Clin Nutr |year= 2007 |volume= 85 |pages=1486–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared shea butter (3% C18:0 on the 2-position) and interesterified shea butter (23% C18:0 on the 2-position), while keeping overall fatty acid composition of the diets constant. This study found no effects of interesterification on fasting levels of blood lipids, glucose and insulin. This is line with a number of other human intervention studies.&lt;ref name=Zampelas&gt;{{citation |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1812280&amp;jid=&amp;volumeId=&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=1812272&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=  |vauthors=Zampelas A, Williams CM, Morgan LM, etal |title= The effect of triacylglycerol fatty acids positional distribution on postprandial plasma metabolite and hormone responses in normal adult men. |journal= Br J Nutr |year=1994 |volume= 71 |pages=401–10 |doi=10.1079/bjn19940147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yli&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/42/10/1618.pdf  |vauthors=Yli-Jokipii K, Kallio H, Schwab U, etal |title= Effects of palm oil and transesterified palm oil on chylomicron and VLDL triacylglycerol structures and postprandial lipid response.|journal= J Lipid Res |year= 2001 |volume= 42 |pages=1618–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=berry2&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p5475646700v5114/fulltext.html |vauthors=Berry SE, Woodward R, Yeoh C, Miller GJ, Sanders TA |title=Effect of interesterification of palmitic-acid rich tryacylglycerol on postprandial lipid and factor VII response |journal= Lipids |year=2007|volume=42|pages=315–323 |doi=10.1007/s11745-007-3024-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=summer&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.jlr.org/cgi/reprint/40/10/1890.pdf  |vauthors=Summers LK, Fielding BA, Herd SL, etal |title=Use of structured triacylglycerols containing predominantly stearic and oleic acids to probe early events in metabolic processing of dietary fat|journal=J Lipid Res|year= 1999|volume= 40|pages=1890–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christophe et al. have studied the effect of interesterification of butter oil.

The '''International IUPAC Conferences on Green Chemistry''' (ICGCs) gather several hundreds scientists, technologists, and experts from all over the world with the aim to exchange and disseminate new ideas, discoveries, and projects on [[green chemistry]] and a [[sustainable development]]. After mid twentieth century, an increasingly general consensus acknowledges that these subjects play a unique role in mapping the way ahead for the humankind progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview/post-2015-development-agenda.html|title=Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical topics discussed in these IUPAC Conferences are: 
* bio-based [[Renewable resource|renewable chemical resources]], bio-inspired materials and [[nanomaterials]], bio-based [[polymer]]s; 
* polymer composites and natural surfactants;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00221139/177|title=C. Pigliacelli, A. D'Elicio, R. Milani, G. Terraneo, G.

* green solvents, catalysts, and synthetic methodologies (e.g., microwaves, ultrasounds, solid state synthesis), [[biocatalysis]] and [[biotransformation]]s; 
* [[biofuel]]s and chemistry for improved energy harvesting; 
* materials for sustainable construction and [[cultural heritage]];

== History ==

In 2006 the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) promoted the organization of the 1st International IUPAC Conference on Green-Sustainable Chemistry (ICGC-1). This conference, started in collaboration with the [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker|German Chemical Society]] (GDCh), was a major acknowledgement by IUPAC of the relevance of green chemistry. The Special Topic Issue on Green Chemistry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/72/7/|title=''Pure Appl. Chem.'' 2000, 72(7), 1207-1403}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Pure and Applied Chemistry'' and the starting of a [https://iupac.org/who-we-are/committees/committee-details/?body_code=303 Subcommittee on Green Chemistry,]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/nc/home/about/members-and-committees/db/division-committee.html?tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Btitle%5D=Subcommittee%20on%20Green%20Chemistry&amp;tx_wfqbe_pi1%5Bpublicid%5D=303|title=Division III, Subcommittee on Green Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; operating in the IUPAC Division of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, were two important landmarks towards that acknowledgement. 
ICGC-1 registered the presence of over 450 participants from 42 countries and proceedings were published in ''[https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/conferences/family/ICGC/index.html Pure and Applied Chemistry]''. This Conference then became a biannual appointment that continuously attracted several hundreds scientists and technologists from academia, research institutes, and industries.

On 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of July 2017, IUPAC established the '''[https://iupac.org/body/041 Interdivisional Committee on Green Chemistry for Sustainable Development ICGCSD]''' that supersedes the former Subcommittee on Green Chemistry and has the aim to assist IUPAC in initiating, promoting, and coordinating the work of the Union in the area of green and sustainable chemistry. 

ICGCSD will continue to organize the ICGCs Series. The next 8th Conference will take place in Bangkok, Thailand, in September 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15268">The '''Knowledge Based Software Assistant (KBSA)''' was a research program funded by the [[United States Air Force]]. The goal of the program was to apply concepts from [[artificial intelligence]] to the problem of designing and implementing [[computer software]]. Software would be described by models in very high level languages (essentially equivalent to [[First Order Logic|first order logic]]) and then [[rule of inference|transformation rules]] would transform the specification into efficient code. The air force hoped to be able to generate the software to control [[Weapon systems|weapons systems]] and other [[command and control]] systems using this method. As software was becoming ever more critical to USAF weapons systems it was realized that improving the quality and productivity of the software development process could have significant benefits for the military, as well as for [[Information Technology|information technology]] in other major US industries.

==History==
In the early 1980s the United States Air Force realized that they had received significant benefits from applying artificial intelligence technologies to solving expert problems such as the diagnosis of faults in aircraft. The air force commissioned a group of researchers from the [[artificial intelligence]] and [[formal methods]] communities to develop a report on how such technologies might be used to aid in the more general problem of software development.

The report described a vision for a new approach to software development. Rather than define specifications with diagrams and manually transform them to code as was the current process, the KBSA vision was to define specifications in very high level languages and then to use transformation rules to gradually refine the specification into efficient code on heterogeneous platforms.

Each step in the design and refinement of the system would be recorded as part of an integrated repository. In addition to the artifacts of software development the processes, the various definitions and transformations, would also be recorded in a way that they could be analyzed and also replayed later as needed. The idea was that each step would be a transformation that took into account various non-functional requirements for the implemented system. For example, requirements to use specific programming languages such as Ada or to harden code for real time mission critical fault tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Cordell |author2=D. Luckham |author3=R. Balzer |author4=T. Cheatham |author5=C. Rich|title=Report on a Knowledge-Based Software Assistant|journal=Kestrel Institute|date=Aug 1983|volume=A996431|pages=78|url=ftp://ftp.kestrel.edu/pub/papers/green/KBSA.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The air force decided to fund further research on this vision through their [[Rome Air Development Center]] laboratory at [[Griffiss Air Force Base|Griffiss air force base]] in New York. The majority of the early research was conducted at the Kestrel Institute in Northern California (with [[Stanford University]]) and the [[Information Sciences Institute]] (ISI) in Southern California (with [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[UCLA]]). The Kestrel Institute focused primarily on the provably correct transformation of logical models to efficient code. ISI focused primarily on the front end of the process on defining specifications that could map to logical formalisms but were in formats that were intuitive and familiar to systems analysts. In addition, Raytheon did a project to investigate informal requirements gathering and Honeywell and Harvard University did work on underlying frameworks, integration, and activity coordination.

Although not primarily funded by the KBSA program the [[MIT]] Programmer's Apprentice project also had many of the same goals and used the same techniques as KBSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rich|first=Charles|author2=Richard C. Waters |title=The Programmer's Apprentice Project: A Research Overview|journal=IEE Expert Special Issue on the Interactions between Expert Systems and Software Engineering|date=November 1987|url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-1004.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later stages of the KBSA program (starting in 1991) researchers developed prototypes that were used on medium to large scale software development problems. Also, in these later stages the emphasis shifted from  a pure KBSA approach to more general questions of how to use knowledge-based technology to supplement and augment existing and future [[Computer Aided Software Engineering|computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) tools. In these later stages there was significant interaction between the KBSA community and the object-oriented and software engineering communities. For example, KBSA concepts and researchers played an important role in the mega-programming and user centered software engineering programs sponsored by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Christine Haapala |title=User-Centric Software Engineering|journal=IEEE Expert|date= February 1995|volume=10|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these later stages the program changed its name to Knowledge-Based Software Engineering (KBSE). The name change reflected the different research goal, no longer to create a totally new all encompassing tool that would cover the complete software life cycle but to gradually work knowledge-based technology into existing tools. Companies such as [[Andersen Consulting]] (one of the largest system integrators and at the time vendor of their own CASE tool) played a major role in the program in these later stages.

==Key concepts==

=== Transformation rules ===
The transformation rules that KBSA used were different than traditional rules for expert systems. Transformation rules matched against specification and implementation languages rather than against facts in the world. It was possible to specify transformations using patterns, wildcards, and recursion on both the right and left hand sides of a rule. The left hand expression would specify patterns in the existing knowledge base to search for. The right hand expression could specify a new pattern to transform the left hand side into. For example, transform a set theoretic data type into code using an Ada set library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Doug|title=Automating Software Design|year=1991|publisher=AAAI/MIT Press|isbn=978-0262620802|pages=483–514|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.6955&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=ps|editor=Michael Lowry, Robert McCartney|chapter=KIDS - A Knowledge-Based Software Development System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial purpose for transformation rules was to refine a high level logical specification into well designed code for a specific hardware and software platform. This was inspired by early work on theorem proving and automatic programming. However, researchers at the Information Sciences Institute (ISI) developed the concept of ''evolution transformations''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=M.S. Feather |title=Using Evolution Transformations to Construct Specifications|journal=Automating Software Design|year=1991|pages=65–92|publisher=AAAI Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rather than transforming a specification into  code an evolution transformation was meant to automate various stereotypical changes at the specification level, for example developing a new superclass by extracting various capabilities from an existing class that can be shared more generally. Evolution transformations were developed at approximately the same time as the emergence of the software patterns community and the two groups shared concepts and technology. Evolution transformations were essentially what is known as [[refactoring]] in the object-oriented software patterns community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fowler|first=Martin|title=Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley|isbn=0201485672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Knowledge-based repository ===
A key concept of KBSA was that all artifacts: requirements, specifications, transformations, designs, code, process models, etc. were represented as objects in a [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] [[Repository (version control)|repository]]. The original KBSA report describes what was called a Wide Spectrum Language. The requirement was for a [[knowledge representation]] framework that could support the entire life cycle: requirements, specification, and code as well as the software process itself. The core representation for the knowledge base was meant to utilize the same framework although various layers could be added to support specific presentations and implementations.

These early knowledge-base frameworks were developed primarily by ISI and Kestrel building on top of Lisp and Lisp machine environments. The Kestrel environment was eventually turned into a commercial product called Refine which was developed and supported by a spin-off company from Kestrel called Reasoning Systems Incorporated.

The Refine language and environment also proved to be applicable to the problem of software reverse engineering: taking legacy code that is critical to the business but that lacks proper documentation and using tools to analyze it and transform it to a more maintainable form. With the growing concern of the [[Y2K problem]] reverse engineering was a major business concern for many large US corporations and it was a focus area for KBSA research in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boehm|first=Barry|author2=Prasanta Bose |title=KBSA Life Cycle Evaluation: Final Technical Report|journal=Contract No: F30602-96-C-0274|date=1998-08-15|volume=I|url=http://csse.usc.edu/csse/event/1999/ARR/volumeI.pdf|accessdate=4 January 2014|publisher=USC Center for Software Engineering|quote=As the program has proceeded toward its ultimate objectives, it has spawned a number of productivity-enhancing spinoffs such as the Refine-based software reengineering and testing tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Welty|first=Chris|title=Summary of KBSE-93: The Eighth Annual Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Conference|url=http://ase-conferences.org/ase/past/kbse-8.txt|work=ase-conferences.org|accessdate=4 January 2014|quote=REFINE/COBOL Object Modeling Workbench provides a set of reengineering tools, Refine is the language of the KBSA concept demo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was significant interaction between the KBSA communities and the [[Frame language]] and [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] communities. The early KBSA knowledge-bases were implemented in [[object-based]] languages rather than [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]]. Objects were represented as classes and sub-classes but it was not possible to define methods on the objects. In later versions of KBSA such as the Andersen Consulting Concept Demo the specification language was expanded to support message passing as well.

=== Intelligent Assistant ===
KBSA took a different approach than traditional expert systems when it came to how to solve problems and work with users. In the traditional expert system approach the user answers a series of interactive questions and the system provides a solution. The KBSA approach left the user in control. Where as an expert system tried to, to some extent replace and remove the need for the expert the intelligent assistant approach in KBSA sought to re-invent the process with technology. This led to a number of innovations at the user interface level.

An example of the collaboration between the object-oriented community and KBSA was the architecture used for KBSA user interfaces. KBSA systems utilized a model-view-controller (MVC) user interface. This was an idea incorporated from Smalltalk environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Dave|author2=A. Czuchry |title=The Knowledge-Based Requirements Assistant|journal=IEEE Expert|year=1988|volume=3|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MVC architecture was especially well suited to the KBSA user interface.  KBSA environments featured multiple heterogeneous views of the knowledge-base. It might be useful to look at an emerging model from the standpoint of entities and relations, object interactions, class hierarchies, dataflow, and many other possible views. The MVC architecture facilitated this. With the MVC architecture the underlying model was always the knowledge base which was a [[Metaobject|meta-model]] description of the specification and implementation languages. When an analyst made some change via a particular diagram (e.g. added a class to the class hierarchy) that change was made at the underlying model level and the various views of the model were all automatically updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Lewis|author2=David R. Harris |author3=Kevin M. Benner |author4=Martin S. Feather |title=Aries: The Requirements/Specification Facet for KBSA|journal=Rome Laboratory Final Technical Report|date=October 1992|volume=RL-TR-92-248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the benefits of using a transformation was that many aspects of the specification and implementation could be modified at once. For small scale prototypes the resulting diagrams were simple enough that basic layout algorithms combined with reliance on users to clean up diagrams was sufficient. However, when a transformation can radically redraw models with tens or even hundreds of nodes and links the constant updating of the various views becomes a task in itself. Researchers at Andersen Consulting incorporated work from the University of Illinois on graph theory to automatically update the various views associated with the knowledge base and to generate graphs that have minimal intersection of links and also take into account domain and user specific layout constraints.

Another concept used to provide intelligent assistance was automatic text generation. Early research at ISI investigated the feasibility of extracting formal specifications from informal natural language text documents. They determined that the approach was not viable. Natural language is by nature simply too ambiguous to serve as a good format for defining a system.  However, natural language generation was seen to be feasible as a way to generate textual descriptions that could be read by managers and non-technical personnel. This was especially appealing to the air force since by law they required all contractors to generate various reports that describe the system from different points of view. Researchers at ISI and later Cogentext and Andersen Consulting demonstrated the viability of the approach by using their own technology to generate the documentation required by their air force contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeBellis|first=Michael|author2=Kanth Miriyala |author3=Sudin Bhat |author4=William C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2819">'''Luminosity distance''' ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined in terms of the relationship between the [[absolute magnitude]] ''M'' and [[apparent magnitude]] ''m'' of an astronomical object.

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 (\log_{10}{D_L} - 1)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

which gives:

:&lt;math&gt; D_L = 10^{\frac{(m - M)}{5}+1}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is measured in [[parsec]]s. For nearby objects (say, in the [[Milky Way]]) the luminosity distance gives a good approximation to the natural notion of distance in [[Euclidean space]].

The relation is less clear for distant objects like [[quasar]]s far beyond the [[Milky Way]] since the apparent magnitude is affected by [[spacetime]] [[curvature]], [[redshift]], and [[time dilation]]. Calculating the relation between the apparent and actual luminosity of an object requires taking all of these factors into account. The object's actual luminosity is determined using the inverse-square law and the proportions of the object's apparent distance and luminosity distance.

Another way to express the luminosity distance is through the flux-luminosity relationship. Since,

:&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{L}{4\pi D_L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F'' is flux (W·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;), and ''L'' is luminosity (W). From this the luminosity distance can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt; D_L = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4\pi F}}&lt;/math&gt;

The luminosity distance is related to the "comoving transverse distance" &lt;math&gt;D_M&lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt; D_L = (1 + z) D_M&lt;/math&gt;

and with the [[angular diameter distance]] &lt;math&gt;D_A&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Etherington's reciprocity theorem]]:

:&lt;math&gt;D_L = (1 + z)^2 D_A&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the [[redshift]]. &lt;math&gt;D_M&lt;/math&gt; is a factor that allows calculation of the [[comoving distance]] between two objects with the same redshift but at different positions of the sky; if the two objects are separated by an angle &lt;math&gt;\delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;, the comoving distance between them would be &lt;math&gt;D_M \delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;. In a spatially flat universe, the comoving transverse distance &lt;math&gt;D_M&lt;/math&gt; is exactly equal to the radial comoving distance &lt;math&gt;D_C&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the comoving distance from ourselves to the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Andrea Gabrielli|author2=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2977">'''Metanoetics''' (from {{lang-el|μετανόησις}} "conversion, repentance" from μετανοῶ "I repent"; {{lang-ja| zangedō 懺悔道, dō 道 (path) and zange 懺悔 (metanoia}})) is a neologism coined by [[Hajime Tanabe]] in ''Philosophy as Metanoetics'' to denote a way of doing philosophy that understands the limits of reason and the power of [[radical evil]]. Though the method used by Tanabe to reach this conclusion relies on the transcendental analysis developed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Tanabe aligns the method with the Buddhist concept of Absolute Nothingness and the preaching of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], [[Zen]], and Christianity.

Tanabe states that Kant did not take the critique of reason far enough. By this Tanabe means that a radical critique of reason should question whether reason itself can understand its ability to embody self-awareness and ultimate reality. The individual exercising reason should remain aware of the crisis of reason and see the [[antinomies|antinomy]], those rationally unsolveable contradictions that reason unearths, as the basis for personal renewal.

The crisis of reason is not just a disruption of thought; it also involves a crisis of will. As the individual understands the radical limits of reason in facing the antinomies, they become aware of what Kant called [[radical evil]]. This is the will to act according to desires beyond those presented by rational reflection. With this realization comes further crisis and thereby the possibility of metanoia.

In this state of crisis, the individual gains the perspective required to see another source of enlightenment. Tanabe uses the Shin Buddhist term of "Other-power" to denote this source, also called Absolute Nothingness. This metanoia realizes the inadequacy of human efforts to discover the source of self-awareness and surrenders to it. This surrender provides the power to continue the search for meaning within the midst of everyday life and to act in a compassionate and charitable way to bring others to self-realization.

The '''monsoon of South Asia''' is among several geographically distributed [[monsoon|global monsoon]]s. It affects the [[Indian subcontinent]], where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated [[weather]] phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.

The unique [[Geography of India|geographical features of the Indian subcontinent]], along with associated [[atmospheric]], [[ocean]]ic, and [[geophysical]] factors, influence the behavior of the monsoon. Because of its effect on [[agriculture]], on [[flora and fauna]], and on the climates of nations such as [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]] — among other [[economic]], [[social]], and [[Natural environment|environmental]] effects — the monsoon is one of the most anticipated, tracked,&lt;ref name="Frater2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Frater|title=Chasing the Monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5I7AAme3yfUC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-330-43313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied weather phenomena in the region.

==Definition==
The word ''monsoon'' (derived from the Arabic "mausam," meaning "season"), although generally defined as a system of [[winds]] characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction,&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; lacks a consistent, detailed definition. Some examples are:

* The [[American Meteorological Society]] calls it a name for seasonal winds, first applied to the winds blowing over the [[Arabian Sea]] from the northeast for six months and from the southwest for six months.&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|author=Glossary of Meteorology|date=June 2000|url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|title=Monsoon|accessdate=2008-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322122025/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?p=1&amp;query=monsoon&amp;submit=Search|archivedate=22 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has since been extended to similar winds in other parts of the world.
* The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) describes a monsoon as a tropical and subtropical seasonal reversal in both surface winds and associated [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], caused by differential heating between a continental-scale land mass and the adjacent ocean.&lt;ref name=IPCCdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007, Glossary|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/annex1sglossary-e-o.html|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Indian Meteorological Department]] defines it as the seasonal reversal of the direction of winds along the shores of the [[Indian Ocean]], especially in the Arabian Sea, which blow from the southwest for half of the year and from the northeast for the other half.&lt;ref name=IMDdef&gt;{{cite web|title=IMD terminologies &amp; glossary|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colin Stokes Ramage, in ''Monsoon Meteorology'', defines the monsoon as a seasonal reversing wind accompanied by corresponding changes in precipitation.&lt;ref name="Ramage1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin S. Ramage|title=Monsoon meteorology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YA1ezydaPecC|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1971|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-576650-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Observed initially by sailors in the Arabian Sea&lt;ref name="Selin1997"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA766|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=766–}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling between [[Africa]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]], the monsoon can be categorized into two ''branches'' based on their spread over the subcontinent:
* Arabian Sea branch
* [[Bay of Bengal]] branch
[[File:Monsoon season beach Tamil Nadu India.jpg|thumb|200px|Southwest monsoon clouds over [[Tamil Nadu]].]]
Alternatively, it can be categorized into two ''segments'' based on the direction of rain-bearing winds:
* Southwest (SW) monsoon 
* Northeast (NE) monsoon&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The name of the wind is based on the direction that it blows ''from''. Southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest. Northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest, onto the land.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to India, the monsoon can also be categorized into two ''periods'':
* Summer monsoon (May to September)
* Winter monsoon (October to November)

The complexity of the monsoon of South Asia is not completely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity, timing, and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation. These are the most monitored components of the monsoon, and they determine the water availability in India for any given year.&lt;ref name=IMD1/&gt;

==Changes of the Monsoon==

{{Main article|Monsoon#South Asian Monsoon}}

[[File:Aug2011monsoon.JPG|Monsoon over India|thumb|350px]]
Monsoons typically occur in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Class 9 CBSE Geography Climate The Mechanism of Monsoons - Wiki|url = http://www.learnnext.com/nextgurukul/wiki/concept/CBSE/IX/Geography/The-Mechanism-of-Monsoons.htm|website = www.learnnext.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area that monsoons impact greatly is India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds. The first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water. This creates low pressure on the landmass, while high pressure is created over the seas during daytime, but is reversed during the night time.

The second condition is the shift in the position of [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). In summer, the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator moves over the Ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season.

The third condition is the presence of the high-pressure area that develops east of Madagascar. It is approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon.

The fourth condition develops during the summer. The Tibetan Plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9&amp;nbsp;km above sea level. The fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian Peninsula.

Changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. In certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions. This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation, or SO.

The Southern Oscillation is connected to la nina, which is a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast. It flows every two to five years in place of the cold Peruvian current. The phenomenon is, referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations). In India, the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early June and to mid-September. The monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature, and not steady.

The monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon.

The rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and reverse winds from the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onset onset] of the monsoon occurs over the [[Bay of Bengal]] in May,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Characteristics, evolution and mechanisms of the summer monsoon onset over Southeast Asia|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1082/abstract|journal = International Journal of Climatology|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 1097-0088|pages = 1461–1482|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/joc.1082|language = en|first = Zuqiang|last = Zhang|first2 = Johnny C. L.|last2 = Chan|first3 = Yihui|last3 = Ding|bibcode = 2004IJCli..24.1461Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian Peninsula]] by June,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and then the winds move towards the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By early September, the monsoon starts to withdraw or retreat and is a more gradual process. By mid-October, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula. The withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January. This is the start of the winter season.

The retreating monsoon winds move over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and collect moisture on the way. These monsoon winds reach the southern states of India by October, and are responsible for a second round of rainfall. These are called the winter monsoons. The winter monsoon is experienced in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the first week of January.

===Effect of geographical relief features===
Although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible, they do not cause precipitation on their own.
{{Main article|Rain#Formation}}
Two factors are essential for [[Rain#Formation|rain formation]]:
# [[Rain#Water-saturated air|Moisture-laden winds]]
# [[Rain#Coalescence|Droplet formation]]

Additionally, one of the [[Rain#Causes|causes of rain]] must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is primarily [[Rain#Orographic effects|orographic]], due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds. Orographic barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic cooling]] and condensation of the moist rising air.
{{Main article|Orographic lift}}

The unique [[Geography of India|geographic relief]] features of the Indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously. The relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows:
# The presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent: the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Indian Ocean]]. These help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season.
# The presence of abundant highlands like the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Himalayas]] right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds. These are the main cause of the substantial [[Orographic lift#Precipitation|orographic precipitation]] throughout the subcontinent.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] Mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not ''across'' them, causing no [[orographic lift]] of the winds.&lt;/ref&gt;
## The Western Ghats are the first highlands of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Other major highlands, like the [[Cardamom Hills]], [[Anaimalai Hills]], and [[Nilgiri Mountains]], that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the Western Ghats and are thus not discussed separately.&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the [[Western Coastal Plains]] of the subcontinent, making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds.
## The Himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon. They also help confine it to the subcontinent. Without them, the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the Indian subcontinent into [[Tibet]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Russia]] without causing any rain.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;First, the Himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds. Second, they help confine the winds to the subcontinent, hampering their northward progress. Third, they contribute to the convergence of the Bay of Bengal branch and Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds, increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent. Fourth, they are a major factor in the ''bursting'' of the monsoon under the jet stream theory. Fifth, they help determine the direction of the Bay of Bengal branch of the northeast monsoon. Their role is still a matter of active study, and understanding of them is evolving regularly.&lt;/ref&gt;
## For the northeast monsoon, the highlands of the [[Eastern Ghats]] play the role of orographic barrier.

==Features of monsoon rains==
There are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the Indian subcontinent.

===''"Bursting"''===

In some years, it rains too much, causing floods in parts of India; in others, it rains too little or not at all, causing droughts. In some years, the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary. Sometimes, despite average annual rainfall, the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed. In the recent past, rainfall variability in short time periods (about a week) were attributed to desert dust over the Arabian Sea and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n4/full/ngeo2107.html|title=Short-term modulation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall by West Asian dust|first1=V.|last1=Vinoj|first2=Philip J.|last2=Rasch|first3=Hailong|last3=Wang|first4=Jin-Ho|last4=Yoon|first5=Po-Lun|last5=Ma|first6=Kiranmayi|last6=Landu|first7=Balwinder|last7=Singh|date=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=308–313|accessdate=20 April 2018|doi=10.1038/ngeo2107|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..308V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal and normal monsoon rains==
[[File:India annual rainfall map en.svg|thumb|200px|Annual average rainfall in India.]]

Normally, the southwest monsoon can be expected to "burst" onto the western coast of India (near [[Thiruvananthapuram]]) at the beginning of June and to cover the entire country by mid-July.&lt;ref name=IMD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Meteorological Department|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|publisher=imd.gov.in|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224191959/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDMOK&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Onset Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/MOK.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon Onset dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/newnormalonset.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its withdrawal from India typically starts at the beginning of September and finishes by the beginning of October.&lt;ref name=IMDwith&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Withdrawal Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_criteria.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDwithjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon withdrawal dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_normal.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeast monsoon usually "bursts" around 20 October and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Wang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bin Wang|title=The Asian monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRT57TENzT8C&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-40610-5|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon — that is, one that performs close to [[statistical average]]s calculated over a long period. A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the ''average quantity'' of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (''mean spatial distribution'') and over the entire expected time period (''mean temporal distribution''). Additionally, the ''arrival date'' and the ''departure date'' of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates. The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables.&lt;ref name=IMDavgMonsoon&gt;{{cite web|title=Met. Terminologies and Glossary - Monsoon|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=[[Indian Meteorological Department]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A monsoon with excess rain can cause floods, and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought, [[famine]], and economic losses. Therefore, a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon.

==Theories for mechanism of monsoon==
Theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal.

===Traditional theory===
{{Main article|Sea breeze}}
Because of differences in the [[specific heat capacity]] of land and water, [[continents]] heat up faster than [[sea]]s. Consequently, the [[air]] above [[coast]]al lands heats up faster than the air above seas. These create areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as [[sea breeze]].

====Process of monsoon creation====
{{Main article|Monsoon#Process}}
[[File:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|200px|A: sea breeze; B: land breeze.]]
Also known as the ''thermal theory'' or the ''differential heating of sea and land theory'', the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale [[sea breeze]]. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive [[landmass]] of the [[Indian Peninsula]] heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a [[pressure gradient]] from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically]] and leading to orographic rains. This is the ''southwest monsoon''.
The reverse happens during the winter, when the land is colder than the sea, establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over the Indian subcontinent toward the [[Indian Ocean]] in a northeasterly direction, causing the ''northeast monsoon''. Because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land, it carries more moisture, and therefore causes more rain, than the northeast monsoon. Only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the Bay of Bengal picks up moisture, causing rain in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] during the winter months.

However, many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire [[Tropics|tropical zone]] of [[Earth]]. This criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds, but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one.

===Dynamic theory===
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.svg|thumb|300px|The atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes.]]
{{Main article|Prevailing winds}}
{{Main article|Atmospheric circulation}}
The [[prevailing winds]] of the [[atmospheric circulation]] arise because of the difference in pressure at various [[latitudes]] and act as means for distribution of [[thermal energy]] on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in [[solar insolation]] received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the [[planet]]. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the [[equator]], the two [[tropics]], the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] circles, and the two [[polar region]]s, giving rise to the [[trade wind]]s, the [[westerlies]], and the [[polar easterlies]]. However, geophysical factors like [[Earth's orbit]], its rotation, and its [[axial tilt]] cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the [[Sun]]'s seasonal shifts.

====Process of monsoon creation====
The ''dynamic theory'' explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the [[Inter Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) under the influence of the [[Solar equator|vertical sun]]. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]] during the [[summer]] of the respective hemispheres ([[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the [[trade wind]]s of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;When the southeast trade winds cross the equator, they are perceived in the Northern Hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the Tropic Of Cancer. Similarly, when the ITCZ is at the Tropic of Cancer, the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the Tropic of Cancer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[Coriolis effect]] (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], transforming into southwest trades.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; These pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.

The dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the traditional theory (based on the heating of sea and land), it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers.

===Jet stream theory===
{{Main article|Jet stream}}
[[File:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|300px|Jet streams of Earth]]
This theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons, as well as unique features like "bursting" and variability.

The jet streams are systems of upper-air westerlies. They give rise to slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-[[knots|knot]] winds in some air streams. First observed by [[World War II]] pilots, they develop just below the [[tropopause]] over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the ''polar jets'', the ''subtropical westerly jets'', and the less common ''tropical easterly jets''. They follow the principle of [[geostrophic wind]]s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Geostrophic winds blow parallel to the [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and keep low-pressure zones to their left in the Northern Hemisphere and to their right in the Southern Hemisphere. The reversal is a result of the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process of monsoon creation====
[[File:Tibet Karte Topograpisch.png|thumb|250px|The [[Tibetan Plateau]] lies north of the [[Himalayas]].]]
Over India, a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season. The high temperature during the summer over the [[Tibetan Plateau]], as well as over [[Central Asia]] in general, is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over India.

The mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated [[terrain]] features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|northern Indian plains]], influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

==Theories for "bursting"==
The "bursting"&lt;ref name=Allaby2002/&gt; of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory.

===Dynamic theory===
According to this theory, during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts north, pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However, the huge landmass of the Himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the Himalayas themselves. It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.
The reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds, leading to a second, minor burst of rainfall over the eastern Indian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere winter months.

===Jet stream theory===
According to this theory, the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up, the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon.

==Theories for monsoon variability==

===The jet stream effect===
The jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon.

'''Timing:''' A timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over India. If the shift is delayed, so is the southwest monsoon. An early shift results in an early monsoon.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strength:''' The strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central India. A strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central India, and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon.

===El Niño-Southern Oscillation effect===
{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|righ|300px|Effects of [[El Niño]] on the weather of the subcontinent.]]
[[El nino|''El Niño'']] is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of [[Peru]] that replaces the usual cold [[Humboldt Current]]. The warm surface water moving toward the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed west by the trade winds, thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean. The reverse condition is known as [[La Niña]].

''Southern oscillation'', a phenomenon first observed by [[Gilbert Walker|Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker]], director general of observatories in India, refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia.&lt;ref name=IODhindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopal Raj|first=N|title=El Nino &amp; the Indian Ocean Dipole|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2004050401861000.htm&amp;date=2004/05/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that when pressure was high in Tahiti, it was low in Darwin, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;  A ''Southern Oscillation Index'' (SOI), based on the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, has been formulated by the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] to measure the strength of the oscillation.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|title=Climate glossary - Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/soi.shtml|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the Indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over Darwin (and low pressure over Tahiti). Conversely, low pressure over Darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in India. Thus, Walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

Ultimately, the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the El Niño/La Niña effect, which happens in the ocean.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Therefore, in the context of the monsoon, the two together came to be known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect. The effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over India, with the monsoon being weak (causing droughts) during El Niño years, while La Niña years bring particularly strong monsoons.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

===Indian Ocean dipole effect===
{{Main article|Indian Ocean Dipole}}
Although the ENSO effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in recent decades, its relationship with the Indian monsoon seemed to weaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=K. K.|author2=Balaji Rajagopalan |author3=Mark A. Cane |title=On the Weakening Relationship Between the Indian Monsoon and ENSO|journal=Science|date=25 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5423|pages=2156–2159|doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2156|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5423/2156.abstract|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the strong ENSO of 1997 did not cause drought in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; However, it was later discovered that, just like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the [[Indian Ocean]] was also in play. This system was discovered in 1999 and named the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD). An index to calculate it was also formulated. IOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May and peaks in October.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; With a positive IOD, winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west. This makes the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African coast) much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia colder and drier.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; In negative dipole years, the reverse happens, making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.

A positive IOD index often negates the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983, 1994, and 1997.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Further, the two poles of the IOD — the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

====Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation====
As with ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named ''Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation'' (EQUINOO).&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; When EQUINOO effects are factored in, certain failed forecasts, like the acute drought of 2002, can be further accounted for.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; The relationship between extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, along with ENSO and EQUINOO,&lt;ref name=EQgadgil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|author2=P.

Since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land, higher ocean temperatures in the Indian Ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land. The reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central India because at least 60% of the agriculture in this region is still largely [[Rainfed agriculture|rain-fed]]. 

A recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014, possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|date=|title=Land warming revives monsoon|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nclimate3356|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=7|issue=8|pages=549–550|doi=10.1038/nclimate3356|via=|bibcode=2017NatCC...7..549R}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and ocean—on which is warming faster than the other.

The [[Centre for Development of Advanced Computing]] (CDAC) at [[Bengaluru]] facilitated the Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM) experiment on the [[PARAM]] Padma supercomputing system.&lt;ref name=CDADspim&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon(SPIM)|url=http://www.cdacb.in/html/spim.aspx|publisher=Centre for Development of Advanced Computing|accessdate=5 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302113845/http://www.cdacb.in/html/spim.aspx|archivedate=2 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This project involved simulated runs of historical data from 1985 to 2004 to try to establish the relationship of five ''atmospheric general circulation models'' with monsoon rainfall distribution.&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt;

===Indian Meteorological Department model===
The department has tried to forecast the monsoon for India since 1884,&lt;ref name=MOL1/&gt; and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity, distribution, and timing of the monsoon rains. Its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt; by the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology (DST)]], [[New Delhi]].

==Significance==
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 May in dry season]]
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 August in rainy season]]

The monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for [[fresh water]] in the Indian subcontinent. As such, it affects the [[Natural environment|environment]] (and associated flora, fauna, and [[ecosystem]]s), agriculture, society, hydro-power production, and geography of the subcontinent (like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table), with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries.

The monsoon turns large parts of India from semi-deserts into green grasslands. See photos taken only three months apart in the Western Ghats.

===Geographical (wettest spots on Earth)===
[[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]], both in the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]], alternate as the wettest places on Earth given the quantity of their rainfall,&lt;ref name=Wettest&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip|first=A J|title=Cherrapunji no longer wettest Challenge comes from nearby village|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/main8.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011|newspaper=The Tribune|date=24 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there are other cities with similar claims. They receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon.

===Agricultural===
In India, which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy, the [[services sector]] recently overtook the [[farm sector]] in terms of [[GDP]] contribution. However, the [[agriculture]] sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP&lt;ref name=Rediff1&gt;{{cite web|title=How monsoon impacts the Indian economy|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jun/02/slide-show-1-how-monsoon-impacts-indian-economy.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated [[wetlands]], [[dryland farming]] areas, etc., are included. Because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life.

Despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation, agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution, or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.

===Economic===
The economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s remark that the monsoon is the "real finance minister of India".&lt;ref name="HT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNlive1/&gt;
A good monsoon results in better agricultural yields, which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports, thus reducing [[food inflation]] overall.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; Better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;
All of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of India.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;

The down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak, crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsoon affects economy, health in India|url = http://monsoon.yale.edu/monsoon-affects-economy-health-in-india/|website = WORLD MONSOONS|access-date = 2016-02-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation's meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Social===
[[D. Subbarao]], [[List of Governors of the Reserve Bank of India|former governor of the Reserve Bank of India]], emphasized during a quarterly review of India's [[monetary policy]] that the lives of Indians depend on the performance of the monsoon.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite news|last=IANS|title=All Indians ‘chasing the monsoon’|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/all-indians-chasing-the-monsoon_100402650.html|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Thaindia.com|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own career prospects, his emotional well-being, and the performance of his monetary policy are all "a hostage" to the monsoon, he said, as is the case for most Indians.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; Additionally, farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities. This crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life.&lt;ref name=IEtme&gt;{{cite news|last=MITRA|first=SUBHANKAR|title=The monsoon effect|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-monsoon-effect/508510/0|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=IndianExpress|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
In the past, Indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons. But with the advent of globalization, such travel is gaining popularity. Places like [[Kerala]] and the Western Ghats get a large number of tourists, both local and foreigners, during the monsoon season. Kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] treatments and massage therapy. One major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed. Also, some mountainous areas, especially in Himalayan regions, get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains.&lt;ref name=ift&gt;{{cite web|title=Traveling in India during monsoons|url=http://indiafoodtour.com/traveling-in-india-during-monsoons|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
The monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area. The [[Geography of South India#Water bodies|peninsular/Deccan rivers of India]] are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature, depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers-Profile-Know India|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=6 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204154938/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php |archivedate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[List of rivers of India#Rivers flowing into Arabian Sea|coastal rivers of Western India]] are also rain-fed and monsoon-dependent.&lt;ref name=IG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Geography|url=http://www.indiabook.com/india-information/indian-geography.html|publisher=IndiaBook.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the flora, fauna, and entire [[ecosystem]]s of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

'''''Nineteen Eighty-Four''''', often published as '''''1984''''', is a [[dystopia]]n novel by English author [[George Orwell]] published in June 1949.&lt;ref name=BenetReader&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35572906|title=Benét's reader's encyclopedia|last=Murphy|first=Bruce|date=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0061810886|location=New York|language=en|page=734}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aaron&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21337504|title=1984: George Orwell's road to dystopia|last=Aaronovitch|first=David|date=8 February 2013|publisher=BBC News|access-date=8 February 2013|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is set in the year 1984 when most of the world population have become victims of [[perpetual war]], [[Global surveillance|omnipresent government surveillance]] and [[propaganda]].

In the novel, Great Britain ("Airstrip One") has become a province of a superstate named [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]]. Oceania is ruled by the "Party", who employ the "[[Thought Police]]" to persecute [[individualism]] and independent thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/334011745|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=5th|last=Chernow|first=Barbara|last2=Vallasi|first2=George|date=1993|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|oclc=334011745|page=2030|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party's leader is [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who enjoys an intense [[cult of personality]] but may not even exist.

Smith rebels by entering a forbidden relationship with fellow employee [[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]].

As literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is a classic novel in content, plot, and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as ''[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]'', ''[[doublethink]]'', ''[[thoughtcrime]]'', ''[[Newspeak]]'', ''[[Room 101]]'', ''[[telescreen]]'', ''[[2 + 2 = 5]]'', and ''[[memory hole]]'', have entered into common usage since its publication in 1949. ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' popularised the adjective ''[[Orwellian]]'', which connotes official deception, secret surveillance, brazenly misleading terminology and manipulation of recorded history by a [[totalitarian]] or [[authoritarian]] state. In 2005, the novel was chosen by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[[Lev Grossman|Grossman, Lev]]; Lacayo, Richard (6 October 2005).

==History and title==
[[File:Nineteen Eighty-Four manuscript.jpg|thumb|A 1947 draft manuscript of the first page of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', showing the editorial development.]]

Orwell "encapsulate[d] the thesis at the heart of his unforgiving novel" in 1944, the implications of dividing the world up into zones of influence, which had been conjured by the [[Tehran Conference]]. Three years later, he wrote most of it on the [[Scotland|Scottish]] island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] from 1947 to 1948 despite being seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Roger Senhouse, 26 December 1948, reprinted in ''Collected Works:It Is What I Think, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, Chapter 18. "thesis": pp. 368–69&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December 1948, he sent the final manuscript to the publisher [[Secker and Warburg]], and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was published on 8 June 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowker|2003|pp=383, 399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984.htm|title=Charles' George Orwell Links|publisher=Netcharles.com|accessdate=4 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718093026/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/books/1984.htm|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, it had been translated into 65 languages, more than any other novel in English until then.&lt;ref name=translations&gt;John Rodden. ''The Politics of Literary Reputation: The Making and Claiming of "St. George" Orwell''&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the novel, its themes, the ''[[Newspeak]]'' language and the author's surname are often invoked against control and intrusion by the state, and the adjective ''[[wikt:Orwellian|Orwellian]]'' describes a totalitarian dystopia that is characterised by government control and subjugation of the people.

Orwell's invented language, Newspeak, satirises hypocrisy and evasion by the state: the [[Ministry of Love]] (Miniluv) oversees torture and brainwashing, the [[Ministry of Plenty]] (Miniplenty) oversees shortage and rationing, the [[Ministry of Peace]] (Minipax) oversees war and atrocity and the [[Ministry of Truth]] (Minitrue) oversees propaganda and historical revisionism.

''The Last Man in Europe'' was an early title for the novel, but in a letter dated 22 October 1948 to his publisher [[Fredric Warburg]], eight months before publication, Orwell wrote about hesitating between that title and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref&gt;CEJL, iv, no. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Warburg suggested choosing the main title to be the latter, a more commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Bernard. Introduction to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1978 novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', English author [[Anthony Burgess]] suggests that Orwell, disillusioned by the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1945–91), intended to call the book ''1948''. The introduction to the [[Penguin Books]] Modern Classics edition of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' reports that Orwell originally set the novel in 1980 but that he later shifted the date to 1982 and then to 1984. The introduction to the [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] edition of ''Animal Farm and 1984'' (2003) reports that the title ''1984'' was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed, and that the date was meant to give an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule.&lt;ref name=harcourt&gt;Introduction to ''Animal Farm and 1984'' by Christopher Hitchens, {{ISBN|978-0-15-101026-4}}; p. x (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its publication history, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' has been either banned or legally [[challenge (literature)|challenged]], as subversive or ideologically corrupting, like the [[Dystopian fiction|dystopian]] novels ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' (1924) by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) by [[Aldous Huxley]], ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' (1940) by [[Arthur Koestler]], ''[[Kallocain]]'' (1940) by [[Karin Boye]] and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953) by [[Ray Bradbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marcus |first1=Laura |last2=Nicholls |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Nicholls (writer) |year=2005 |title=The Cambridge History of Twentieth-Century English Literature |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-82077-4 |page=226 |quote=Brave New World [is] traditionally bracketed with Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' as a dystopia&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers consider the Russian dystopian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by Zamyatin to have influenced ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorwellprize.co.uk/george-orwell/by-orwell/essays-and-other-works/freedom-and-happiness-review-of-we-by-yevgeny-zamyatin "Freedom and Happiness"] (a review of ''We'' by Yevgeny Zamyatin) by Orwell, ''The Express Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/jun/08/george-orwell-1984-zamyatin-we "1984 thoughtcrime?

==Background==

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is set in [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], one of three inter-continental [[superstates]] that divided the world after a global war.

Smith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by [[Emmanuel Goldstein]], reveal that after the [[Second World War]], the [[United Kingdom]] became involved in a war fought in [[Europe]], [[European Russia|western Russia]], and [[North America]] during the early 1950s. [[Nuclear weapons]] were used during the war, leading to the destruction of [[Colchester]]. [[London]] would also suffer widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a [[London Underground]] station. Britain fell to civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as [[Ingsoc]], emerged victorious and formed a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in Britain. The [[British Commonwealth]] was absorbed by the [[United States]] to become Oceania. Eventually Ingsoc emerged to form a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian government]] in the country.

Simultaneously, the [[Soviet Union]] conquered [[continental Europe]] and established the second superstate of [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]]. The third superstate of [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] would emerge in the [[Far East]] after several decades of fighting. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in "a rough quadrilateral with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], and [[Hong Kong]]" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues in order to maintain ideological control over the people.

However, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of history, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unclear. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, airplanes and trains, while Julia theorizes that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a [[false-flag operation]] designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring "confused street fighting in London itself" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls "the Revolution".

Most of the plot takes place in London, the "chief city of [[Airstrip One]]", the Oceanic province that "had once been called England or Britain".&lt;ref&gt;Part I, Ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Posters of the Party leader, [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], bearing the caption "BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU", dominate the city (Winston states it can be found on nearly every house), while the ubiquitous ''telescreen'' ([[transceiver|transceiving]] television set) monitors the private and public lives of the party members. Military parades, propaganda films, and [[public executions]] are said to be commonplace.

The class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:
* (I) the upper-class [[Inner Party]], the elite ruling minority, who make up 2% of the population.
* (II) the middle-class [[Outer Party]], who make up 13% of the population.
* (III) the lower-class [[Proles|Proletariat]], who make up 85% of the population and represent the uneducated working class.
As the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries:
* the [[Ministry of Peace]] deals with war and defense.
* the [[Ministry of Plenty]] deals with economic affairs (rationing and starvation).
* the [[Ministry of Love]] deals with law and order (torture and brainwashing).
* the [[Ministry of Truth]] deals with news, entertainment, education and art (propaganda).

The protagonist [[Winston Smith]], a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising historical records]], to make the past conform to the ever-changing [[party line (politics)|party line]] and deleting references to ''[[unperson]]s'', people who have been "vaporised", i.e., not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory.

The story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: "It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen." Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.&lt;ref&gt;"striking thirteen" (1:00&amp;nbsp;pm). In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the [[24-hour clock]] is modern, the [[12-hour clock]] is old-fashioned, Part I, Ch. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In the year 1984, civilization has been damaged by war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly [[United Kingdom|Britain]]) is a province of [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four|Oceania]], one of the three [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] super-states that rule the world. It is ruled by the "Party" under the ideology of "[[Ingsoc]]" and the mysterious leader [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]], who has an intense [[cult of personality]]. The Party stamps out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime using the [[Thought Police]] and constant surveillance through devices such as [[Telescreen]]s (two-way televisions).

Winston Smith is a member of the middle class [[Outer Party]]. He works at the [[Ministry of Truth]], where he [[historical negationism|rewrites historical records]] to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become "unpersons", disappearing with all evidence of their existence removed. Winston revises past editions of ''[[The Times]]'', while the original documents are destroyed by fire in a "[[memory hole]]". He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion. He realizes that he is already a "[[Thoughtcrime|thoughtcriminal]]" and likely to be caught one day.

While in a proletarian neighbourhood, he meets Mr. Charrington, the owner of an antiques shop, and buys a diary. He uses an alcove to hide it from the Telescreen in his room, and writes thoughts criticising the Party and Big Brother. In the journal, he records his sexual frustration over a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry named [[Julia (1984)|Julia]], whom Winston is attracted to but suspects is an informant. He also suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]], is a secret agent for an enigmatic underground [[resistance movement]] known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival [[Emmanuel Goldstein]].

The next day, Julia secretly hands Winston a note confessing her love for him, which simply reads, ''"I love you."'' Winston and Julia begin a torrid affair, an act of the rebellion as the Party insists that sex may only be used for reproduction. Winston realizes that she shares his loathing of the Party. They first meet in the country, and later in a rented room above Mr. Charrington's shop. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his terse relationship with his ex-wife Katharine. Winston also interacts with his colleague Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the [[English language]] called [[Newspeak]]. After Syme admits that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston speculates that Syme will disappear. Not long after, Syme disappears and no one acknowledges his absence.

Weeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien, who offers Winston a chance to join the Brotherhood. They arrange a meeting at O'Brien's luxurious flat where both Winston and Julia swear allegiance to the Brotherhood. He sends Winston a copy of ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]'' by Emmanuel Goldstein. Winston and Julia read parts of the book, which explains more about how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans and the concept of [[perpetual war]]. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if "proles" (proletarians) rise up against it.

Mr. Charrington is revealed to be an agent of the Thought Police. Winston and Julia are captured in the shop and imprisoned in the [[Ministry of Love]]. O'Brien reveals that he is actually loyal to the Party, and was simply part of a special [[sting operation]] to catch "thoughtcriminals". Over many months, Winston is tortured and forced to "cure" himself of his "insanity" by changing his own perception to fit the Party line, even if it requires believing that "[[2 + 2 = 5]]". O'Brien openly admits that the Party "is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power." He says that once Winston is brainwashed into loyalty, he will be released back into society for a period of time, before they execute him. O'Brien states that Winston and others who do not love the party will be shot in the back of the head after being released.  Winston points out that the Party has not managed to make him betray Julia.

O'Brien then takes Winston to [[Room 101]] for the final stage of re-education. The room contains each prisoner's worst fear, in Winston's case rats. As a wire cage holding hungry rats is fitted onto his face, Winston shouts "Do it to Julia!", thus betraying her. After being released, Winston meets Julia in a park. She says that she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. Winston realizes that he and Julia no longer feel for one another and that the Party has even managed to take away their love. Later, Winston sits alone in a café as Oceania celebrates a supposed victory over [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasian]] armies in Africa, and, successfully brainwashed, realizes that "He loved Big Brother."

==Characters==
===Main characters===
[[File:Constellation of characters.png|thumb|A constellation of characters Winston interacts with in the book ''1984''.]]
* [[Winston Smith]]&amp;nbsp;– the protagonist who is a phlegmatic [[everyman]] and is curious of the past before the Revolution.
*[[Julia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Julia]]&amp;nbsp;– Winston's lover who is a covert "[[Insurrectionist|rebel]] from the waist downwards" who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League.
* [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]]&amp;nbsp;– a member of the Inner Party who poses as a member of The Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, in order to deceive, trap, and capture Winston and Julia. O'Brien has a servant named Martin.

===Secondary characters===
* Aaronson, Jones, and Rutherford&amp;nbsp;– former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into a [[memory hole]]. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.
* Ampleforth&amp;nbsp;– Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word "God" in a Kipling poem as he could not find another rhyme for "rod";{{refn|This may be a reference to "[[McAndrew's Hymn]]", which includes the lines "From coupler-flange to spindle-guide I see Thy Hand, O God— / Predestination in the stride o' yon connectin'-rod".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/george-orwell-weighs-scottish-independence/#! |title=George Orwell Weighs In on Scottish Independence |magazine=[[LA Review of Books]] |first=Nina |last=Martyris |date=18 September 2014 |accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }} Winston encounters him at the [[Ministry of Love|Miniluv]]. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.
* Charrington&amp;nbsp;– an officer of the [[Thought Police]] posing as a sympathetic antiques dealer amongst the Proles.
* Katharine Smith&amp;nbsp;– the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston "can't get rid of". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their "duty to the Party". Although she was a "goodthinkful" ideologue, they separated because she could not have children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be "got rid of" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.
* Tom Parsons&amp;nbsp;– Winston's naïve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing a [[slingshot|catapult]] at Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons is in the Ministry of Love, as his daughter had reported him to the Thought Police, hearing him speak against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen his belief in the Party, and he states he could do "good work" in the hard labour camps.
* Mrs. Parsons&amp;nbsp;– Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.
** The Parsons children&amp;nbsp;– members of the Party Youth League, representing the new generation of Oceanian citizens, without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment; the model society envisioned by the Inner Party.
* Syme&amp;nbsp;– Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth. He was a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] who helped develop the language and the dictionary of [[Newspeak]]. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes that "He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly." Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.

===Unseen characters===
Whether these characters are real or fabrications of Party propaganda is something that neither Winston nor the reader is permitted to know:
* [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]&amp;nbsp;– the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania.
* [[Emmanuel Goldstein]]&amp;nbsp;– ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of The Book, ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''. Goldstein is the symbolic [[enemy of the state]]—the national [[Archenemy|nemesis]] who ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during the [[Two Minutes Hate]] and other fearmongering.

==World in novel==
===Ingsoc===
{{Main article|Ingsoc}}
Ingsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and [[pseudophilosophy]] of Oceania, and [[Newspeak]] is the official language of official documents.

===Ministries of Oceania===
{{Main article|Ministries of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}
In London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the façades of which display the Party's three slogans. The ministries' names are the opposite ([[doublethink]]) of their true functions: "The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation." (Part II, Chapter IX&amp;nbsp;– ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'')

====Ministry of Peace====
The [[Ministry of Peace]] supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Ministry of Plenty====
The [[Ministry of Plenty]] rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability, and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates the Ministry of Plenty's claims by [[historical revisionism (negationism)|revising]] historical records to report numbers supporting the current, "increased rations".

====Ministry of Truth====
The [[Ministry of Truth]] controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), "rectifying" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.

====Ministry of Love====
The [[Ministry of Love]] identifies, monitors, arrests, and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to [[Room 101]] to face "the worst thing in the world"—until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.

===Doublethink===
{{Main article|Doublethink}}
{{quotation|The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in Newspeak as doublethink. Doublethink is basically the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.|Part II, Chapter IX&amp;nbsp;– ''[[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism]]''|}}

===Political geography===
{{Main article|Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four}}
[[File:1984 fictitious world map v2 quad.svg|thumb|Fictitious map illustrating the political landscape of the novel]]
Three perpetually warring [[totalitarian]] super-states control the world:&lt;ref name="Part II, Ch. 9"&gt;Part II, Ch. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Oceania|Oceania]] (ideology: [[Ingsoc]], i.e. [[English Socialism]]), whose core territories are the [[Western Hemisphere]], the [[British Isles]], [[Australasia]], [[Polynesia]] and [[Southern Africa]]
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eurasia|Eurasia]] (ideology: [[Neo-Bolshevism]]), whose core territories are [[Continental Europe]] and [[Russia]], including [[Siberia]]
* [[Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four#Eastasia|Eastasia]] (ideology: [[Obliteration of the Self]] or [[Death Worship]]), whose core territories are [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Indochina]]

The perpetual war is fought for control of the "disputed area" lying "between the frontiers of the super-states", which forms "a rough parallelogram with its corners at [[Tangier]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] and [[Hong Kong]]",&lt;ref name="Part II, Ch. 9"/&gt; and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in [[Manchuria]], Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.

Goldstein's book, ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', explains that the superstates' ideologies are alike and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing in the detestability of the opposing ideologies. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in "the war".

===The Revolution===
{{Main article|The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism}}
Winston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the [[Soviet Union]] conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]] does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]], the last superstate established, emerged only after "a decade of confused fighting". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although [[Eastasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eastasia]] is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.

The annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of [[Colchester]] is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.

While the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganization occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack "thirty years" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the "fourth quarter of 1983" was "also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.

===The War===
{{See also|Perpetual war}}
In 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the [[Malabar Coast]].

That alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from "Eurasia" to "Eastasia" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured Africa.

Goldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with [[V-weapons|rocket bombs]], helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).

===Living standards===
The society of Airstrip One and, according to "The Book", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly [[false flag]]) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality "luxuries" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the "Victory" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made "Victory" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the [[War of the Atlantic]].)

Winston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include [[telescreens]] that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.

In contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/198423.asp|title=Barron's Booknotes-1984 by George Orwell|last=Reed|first=Kit|year=1985|publisher=[[Barron's Educational Series]]|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winston is astonished that the [[elevator|lifts]] in O'Brien's building work, the [[telescreens]] can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and "The Book" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, "The Book" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only "relatively" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary élite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/16.html|title=1984}}Part 2, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. "The Book" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or "reintegration" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that "the future belonged to the proles".&lt;ref&gt;Lines 29–35, p. 229, Chapter X, Part II of the Penguin paperback edition of 1984: "The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party did not share and could not kill".&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and "The Book" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

===Nationalism===
''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay "[[Notes on Nationalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/nationalism.html|title=George Orwell: "Notes on Nationalism"|date=May 1945|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces. In ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', the Party's artificial, minimalist language 'Newspeak' addresses the matter.
* Positive nationalism: Oceanians' perpetual love for Big Brother; Neo-Toryism and [[Celtic nationalism]] are, as Orwell argues, defined by love.
* Negative nationalism: Oceanians' perpetual hatred for Emmanuel Goldstein; [[Stalinism]] and  [[Anglophobia]] are, as Orwell argues, defined by hatred.
* Transferred nationalism: Oceania's enemy changes, and an orator changes mid-sentence. The crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another (for example, Communism, [[Pacifism]], Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.

O'Brien concludes: "The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power."

===Futurology===
In the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: {{Quote|There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.|Part III, Chapter III, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''}}

===Censorship===
[[File:Nineteen Eighty-Four cover by Penguin.jpg|alt=|thumb|A 21st-century printing by [[Penguin Books]] with an intentionally censored cover]]
A major theme of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is censorship, especially in the Ministry of Truth, where photographs are modified and public archives rewritten to rid them of "unpersons" (persons who are erased from history by the Party). On the telescreens, figures for all types of production are grossly exaggerated or simply invented to indicate an ever-growing economy, when the reality is the opposite. One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about Comrade Ogilvy, a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.

===Surveillance===
The inhabitants of [[Oceania (Ninteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]], particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way [[telescreen]]s so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.

==Newspeak appendix==
{{Main article|Newspeak|List of Newspeak words}}
"The Principles of Newspeak" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making "all other modes of thought impossible". (A linguistic theory about how language may direct thought is the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]].)

Whether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the [[past tense]]: "Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised" p.&amp;nbsp;422).

==Sources for literary motifs==
''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' uses themes from life in the Soviet Union and wartime life in Great Britain as sources for many of its motifs. Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, producer [[Sidney Sheldon]] wrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[''Nineteen Eighty-Four''] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Russian Foreign Office]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon, Sidney (2006) ''The Other Side of Me'', Grand Central Publishing, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement "[[2 + 2 = 5]]", used to torment Winston Smith during his interrogation, was a communist party slogan from the second [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plan]], which encouraged fulfillment of the five-year plan in four years. The slogan was seen in electric lights on Moscow house-fronts, billboards and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="The Forsaken"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Forsaken: An American Tragedy in Stalin's Russia | publisher=Penguin Press | last=Tzouliadis |first=Tim | year=2008 | location=New York | isbn=978-1-59420-168-4 | pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The switch of Oceania's allegiance from Eastasia to Eurasia and the subsequent rewriting of history ("Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Treaty of Non-Aggression]]. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped—including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] for supporting the Treaty in his essays for ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' (1941). "The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveller]]s like [[Victor Gollancz|Gollancz]] [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction [[Popular Front]] governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Matt.

The description of Emmanuel Goldstein, with a "small, goatee beard", evokes the image of [[Leon Trotsky]]. The film of Goldstein during the Two Minutes Hate is described as showing him being transformed into a bleating sheep. This image was used in a propaganda film during the [[Kinoks|Kino-eye]] period of Soviet film, which showed Trotsky transforming into a goat.&lt;ref name="Kino-eye"&gt;{{cite book | title=Kino-Eye: The Writings of Dziga Vertov | publisher=University of California Press | last=Vertov |first=Dziga | year=1985 | isbn=978-0-520-05630-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein's book is similar to Trotsky's highly critical analysis of the USSR, ''[[The Revolution Betrayed]]'', published in 1936.

The omnipresent images of Big Brother, a man described as having a moustache, bears resemblance to the cult of personality built up around [[Joseph Stalin]].

The news in Oceania emphasised production figures, just as it did in the Soviet Union, where record-setting in factories (by "[[Hero of Socialist Labour|Heroes of Socialist Labor]]") was especially glorified. The best known of these was [[Alexey Stakhanov]], who purportedly set a record for coal mining in 1935.

The tortures of the Ministry of Love evoke the procedures used by the [[NKVD]] in their interrogations,&lt;ref name="NKVD tortures"&gt;{{cite book | last=Senyonovna |first=Eugenia | title=Journey into the Whirlwind | year=1967 | publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, Inc | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of rubber truncheons, being forbidden to put your hands in your pockets, remaining in brightly lit rooms for days, torture through the use of their greatest fear, and the victim being shown a mirror after their physical collapse.

The random bombing of Airstrip One is based on the [[V-1 flying bomb|Buzz bombs]] and the [[V-2 rocket]], which struck England at random in 1944–1945.

The [[Thought Police]] is based on the [[NKVD]], which arrested people for random "anti-soviet" remarks.&lt;ref name="Everyday_Stalinism"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fitzpatrick |first=Sheila |title=Everyday Stalinism |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-505001-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Thought Crime motif is drawn from [[Kempeitai]], the Japanese wartime secret police, who arrested people for "unpatriotic" thoughts.

The confessions of the "Thought Criminals" Rutherford, Aaronson and Jones are based on the [[show trial]]s of the 1930s, which included fabricated confessions by prominent Bolsheviks [[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev]] to the effect that they were being paid by the Nazi government to undermine the Soviet regime under [[Leon Trotsky]]'s direction.

The song "[[Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree]]" ("Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me") was based on an old English song called "Go no more a-rushing" ("Under the spreading chestnut tree, Where I knelt upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree."). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing "chest", and touching your head when you sing "nut"). [[Glenn Miller]] recorded the song in 1939.&lt;ref name="go-no-more--a-rushing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniff.numachi.com/pages/tiGONORUSH;ttGONORUSH.html |title=Go No More a-Rushing (Riddle Song) |publisher=Sniff.numachi.com |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Hates" (Two Minutes Hate and Hate Week) were inspired by the constant rallies sponsored by party organs throughout the Stalinist period. These were often short pep-talks given to workers before their shifts began (Two Minutes Hate), but could also last for days, as in the annual celebrations of the anniversary of the [[October revolution]] (Hate Week).

Orwell fictionalized "newspeak", "doublethink", and "Ministry of Truth" as evinced by both the Soviet press and that of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUl3Od-xWn8C&amp;pg=PA9|title=Thank you, comrade Stalin!

Winston Smith's job, "revising history" (and the "unperson" motif) are based on the Stalinist habit of airbrushing images of 'fallen' people from group photographs and removing references to them in books and newspapers.&lt;ref name="commisar_vanishes"&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=David |title=The Commissar Vanishes: The Falsification of Photographs and Art in Stalin's Russia |publisher=Metropolitan / Holt |year=1997 |isbn=0-8050-5294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one well-known example, the Soviet encyclopaedia had an article about [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

Big Brother's "Orders of the Day" were inspired by Stalin's regular wartime orders, called by the same name. A small collection of the more political of these have been published (together with his wartime speeches) in English as "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union" By Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref name="on_the_patriotic_war"&gt;{{cite book | title=On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union | publisher=Foreign Languages Press |last=Stalin |first=Joseph | year=1944 | location=Moscow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sample_Order_of_the_day"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1942/05/01.htm | title=Order of the Day, No. 130, May 1st, 1942 | accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Big Brother's Orders of the day, Stalin's frequently lauded heroic individuals,&lt;ref name="Beijing_edition"&gt;{{cite book | title=On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union | publisher=Foreign Language Press&amp;nbsp;– Peking | last=Stalin |first=Joseph | year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Comrade Ogilvy, the fictitious hero Winston Smith invented to 'rectify' (fabricate) a Big Brother Order of the day.

The Ingsoc slogan "Our new, happy life", repeated from telescreens, evokes Stalin's 1935 statement, which became a [[CPSU]] slogan, "Life has become better, Comrades; life has become more cheerful."&lt;ref name="Everyday_Stalinism"/&gt;

In 1940 Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] published [[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]] which described the invention by a "benevolent secret society" of a world that would seek to remake human language and reality along human-invented lines. The story concludes with an appendix describing the success of the project. Borges' story addresses similar themes of [[epistemology]], language and history to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHnFubqgiyoC&amp;pg=PA206&amp;lpg=PA206|title=Twentieth-century Spanish American Literature to 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
During [[World War II]], Orwell believed that [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British democracy]] as it existed before 1939 would not survive the war. The question being "Would it end via Fascist ''coup d'état'' from above or via Socialist revolution from below"?{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} Later, he admitted that events proved him wrong: "What really matters is that I fell into the trap of assuming that 'the war and the revolution are inseparable'."&lt;ref&gt;"London Letter to Partisan Review, December 1944, quoted from vol. 3 of the Penguin edition of the ''Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters''.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) share themes of the betrayed revolution, the person's subordination to the collective, rigorously enforced class distinctions (Inner Party, Outer Party, Proles), the [[cult of personality]], [[concentration camp]]s, [[Thought Police]], compulsory regimented daily exercise, and youth leagues. [[Oceania (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Oceania]] resulted from the US annexation of the British Empire to counter the Asian peril to Australia and New Zealand. It is a naval power whose militarism venerates the sailors of the floating fortresses, from which battle is given to recapturing India, the "Jewel in the Crown" of the British Empire. Much of Oceanic society is based upon the USSR under [[Joseph Stalin]]—[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]. The televised [[Two Minutes Hate]] is ritual demonisation of the [[enemy of the state|enemies of the State]], especially [[Emmanuel Goldstein]] (''viz'' [[Leon Trotsky]]). Altered photographs and newspaper articles create [[unperson]]s deleted from the national historical record, including even founding members of the regime (Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford) in the 1960s purges (''viz'' the [[Great Purges|Soviet Purges]] of the 1930s, in which [[Old Bolshevik|leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution]] were [[Moscow Trials|similarly treated]]). A similar thing also happened during the French Revolution in which many of the original leaders of the Revolution were later put to death, for example [[Georges Danton|Danton]] who was put to death by [[Robespierre]], and then later Robespierre himself met the same fate.

In his 1946 essay "[[Why I Write]]", Orwell explains that the serious works he wrote since the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–39) were "written, directly or indirectly, against [[totalitarianism]] and for [[democratic socialism]]".&lt;ref name=aaron/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resort.com/~prime8/Orwell/whywrite.html|title=George Orwell: Why I Write|publisher=Resort.com|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' is a [[cautionary tale]] about revolution betrayed by totalitarian defenders previously proposed in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938) and ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945), while ''[[Coming Up for Air]]'' (1939) celebrates the personal and political freedoms lost in ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' (1949). Biographer Michael Shelden notes Orwell's [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] childhood at [[Henley-on-Thames]] as the golden country; being bullied at [[St Cyprian's School]] as his empathy with victims; his life in the [[Indian Imperial Police]] in Burma and the techniques of violence and censorship in the [[BBC]] as capricious authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shelden|first=Michael|year=1991|title=Orwell&amp;nbsp;– The Authorized Biography|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092161-7|pages=430–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other influences include ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' (1940) and ''The Yogi and the Commissar'' (1945) by [[Arthur Koestler]]; ''[[The Iron Heel]] ''(1908) by [[Jack London]]; ''1920: Dips into the Near Future''&lt;ref&gt;John A. Hobson, [http://ariwatch.com/VS/1920.htm ''1920: Dips into the Near Future'']&lt;/ref&gt; by [[John A. Hobson]]; ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) by [[Aldous Huxley]]; ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' (1921) by Yevgeny Zamyatin which he reviewed in 1946;&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell, [http://www.orwelltoday.com/weorwellreview.shtml "Review"], ''Tribune'', 4 January 1946.&lt;br /&gt; paraphrasing [[Rayner Heppenstall]], he reportedly said "that he was taking it as the model for his next novel". Bowker, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Managerial Revolution'' (1940) by [[James Burnham]] predicting perpetual war among three totalitarian superstates. Orwell told [[Jacintha Buddicom]] that he would write a novel stylistically like ''[[A Modern Utopia]]'' (1905) by [[H. G. Wells]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Extrapolating from World War II, the novel's [[pastiche]] parallels the politics and rhetoric at war's end—the changed alliances at the "[[Cold War]]'s" (1945–91) beginning; the [[Ministry of Truth]] derives from the BBC's overseas service, controlled by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]; [[Room 101]] derives from a conference room at BBC [[Broadcasting House]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The real room 101|publisher=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105132434/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/room-101.shtml|archivedate=5 January 2007|accessdate=9 December 2006}}&lt;br /&gt;[[#References|Meyers (2000)]], p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] of the University of London, containing the Ministry of Information is the architectural inspiration for the Minitrue; the post-war decrepitude derives from the socio-political life of the UK and the US, i.e., the impoverished Britain of 1948 losing its Empire despite newspaper-reported imperial triumph; and war ally but peace-time foe, Soviet Russia became [[Eurasia (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Eurasia]].

The term "English Socialism" has precedents in his wartime writings; in the essay "[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]" (1941), he said that "the war and the revolution are inseparable...&amp;nbsp;the fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy"&amp;nbsp;– because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeat [[Adolf Hitler]]. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which "will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word."&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, Sonia and Angus, Ian (eds). ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', Volume 2: "My Country Right or Left" (1940–43; Penguin)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', "English Socialism"&amp;nbsp;(or "[[Ingsoc]]" in [[Newspeak]]) is a [[totalitarian]] ideology unlike the English revolution he foresaw. Comparison of the wartime essay "The Lion and the Unicorn" with ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' shows that he perceived a Big Brother regime as a perversion of his cherished socialist ideals and English Socialism. Thus Oceania is a corruption of the British Empire he believed would evolve "into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orwell |first=George |authorlink=George Orwell |editor1-last=Orwell |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Angus |editor2-first=Ian |title=George Orwell: the Collected Essays, Journalism &amp; Letters |year=2000 |publisher=Nonpareil Books |location=Boston |isbn=978-1-56792-134-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEgxAJr1REUC&amp;lpg=PA91 |edition=1st Nonpareil |page=91 |quote=The third was to develop a ''positive'' imperial policy, and aim at transforming the Empire into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=August 2013}}

==Critical reception==
When it was first published, ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' received critical acclaim. [[V. S. Pritchett]], reviewing the novel for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' stated: "I do not think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down."&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Howe]],  ''Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four : Text, Sources, Criticism''. New York : Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982. {{ISBN|0-15-565811-5}} pp.&amp;nbsp;290–93.&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. H. Newby]], reviewing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' for ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]'' magazine, described it as "the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman since [[Rex Warner]]'s ''The Aerodrome.''"&lt;ref name="nf"&gt;"First Bites: ''Nineteen Eighty-Four.'' Nigel Fountain, ''The Guardian'', June 14, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' was also praised by [[Bertrand Russell]], [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Harold Nicolson]].&lt;ref name="nf" /&gt; On the other hand, [[Edward Shanks]], reviewing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', was dismissive; Shanks claimed ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' "breaks all records for gloomy vaticination".&lt;ref name="nf" /&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was "odious rather than tragic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Clive Staples|title=''On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature.''

The effect of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' on the English language is extensive; the concepts of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)#Response to Big Brother today|Big Brother]], [[Room 101]], the [[Thought Police]], [[thoughtcrime]], [[unperson]], [[memory hole]] (oblivion), [[doublethink]] (simultaneously holding and believing contradictory beliefs) and [[Newspeak]] (ideological language) have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority. [[Doublespeak]] and [[groupthink]] are both deliberate elaborations of ''doublethink'', and the adjective "Orwellian" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. The practice of ending words with {{nowrap|"-speak"}} (such as ''mediaspeak'') is drawn from the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keyes |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Keyes (author) |title=I Love It When You Talk Retro |year=2009 |publisher=St Martins |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, [[11020 Orwell|an asteroid]] was discovered by [[Antonín Mrkos]] and named after Orwell.

References to the themes, concepts and plot of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' have appeared frequently in other works, especially in popular music and video entertainment. An example is the worldwide hit reality television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', in which a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world but continuously watched by television cameras.

* In November 2011, the [[US government]] argued before the [[US Supreme Court]] that it wants to continue [[United States v. Jones (2012)|utilizing GPS tracking of individuals]] without first seeking a warrant. In response, Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] questioned what that means for a democratic society by referencing ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''. Justice Breyer asked, "If you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States. So if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like Nineteen Eighty-Four...&amp;nbsp;"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/192445-justice-breyer-warns-of-orwellian-government|title=Justice Breyer warns of Orwellian government|work=The Hill|date=8 November 2011|accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book touches on the invasion of privacy and ubiquitous surveillance. From mid-2013 it was publicized that the [[NSA]] has been secretly monitoring and storing global internet traffic, including the bulk data collection of email and phone call data. Sales of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' increased by up to seven times within the first week of the [[2013 mass surveillance scandal|2013 mass surveillance leaks]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jOAd-NuDmmE_yftnuljYBx5k0wIw?docId=CNG.17664a09cc7362136060bb3f7731dc65.141 '1984' sales skyrocket in wake of US spy scandal], [[Agence France-Presse]], 11 June 2013.

The book also shows mass media as a catalyst for the intensification of destructive emotions and violence. Since the 20th century, news and other forms of media have been publicizing violence more often.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Savage |first=Robert |year= 1989 |title=The Orwell Moment |url= |location= London |publisher= University Arkansas Press |pages= |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gleason,"On Nineteen Eighty Four"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Nottingham Playhouse]], the [[Almeida Theatre]] and [[Headlong (theatre company)|Headlong]] staged a successful [[1984 (play)|new adaptation]] (by Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan), which twice toured the UK and played an extended run in London's West End. The play opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2017.

==''Brave New World'' comparisons==
In the decades since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', there have been numerous comparisons to [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', which had been published 17 years earlier, in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/11859761/1984-Brave-New-World-Why-I-love-a-little-dystopia.html|title=1984?

However, members of the ruling class of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' use brutal force, torture and [[mind control]] to keep individuals in line, while rulers in ''Brave New World'' keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions.

In October 1949, after reading ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', Huxley sent a letter to Orwell and wrote that it would be more efficient for rulers to stay in power by the softer touch by allowing citizens to self-seek pleasure to control them rather than brute force and to allow a false sense of freedom:

{{quote|
Within the next generation I believe that the world's rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/03/1984-v-brave-new-world.html Letter from Aldous Huxley to George Orwell]. Retrieved 6 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Elements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictators in ex-communist countries, as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's own ''Brave New World Revisited''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huxley.net/bnw-revisited/ Aldous Huxley;s ''Brave New World Revisited'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/books/review/which-dystopian-novel-got-it-right-orwells-1984-or-huxleys-brave-new-world.html|title=Which Dystopian Novel Got It Right: Orwell’s ‘1984’ or Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’?|date=2017-02-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/orwells-1984-and-trumps-america|title=Orwell’s “1984” and Trump’s America|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="conway" /&gt;

'''The oldest profession in the world''' (or '''the world's oldest profession''') is a phrase that, unless another meaning is specified, refers to [[prostitution]].  However, it did not acquire that meaning universally until after World War I. Formerly, various professions vied for the reputation of being the oldest.

==Earlier sense==
The claim to be the oldest profession was made on behalf of farmers,&lt;ref&gt;"The farmer, therefore, can boast of being a member of the oldest profession" (Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, Michigan, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; [[droving|cattle drovers]],&lt;ref&gt;"He reminded his audience that theirs was the very oldest profession in the world" (Bury and Norwich Post, Suffolk, 19 June 1883, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[horticulture|horticulturalists]],&lt;ref&gt;"… certainly we are representatives of the oldest profession of which we have any knowledge" (Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Ohio State Horticultural Society, 1890, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt; engineers,&lt;ref&gt;"… we belong to the oldest profession in the world" (The Stevens indicator, vol. 9, 1892, p.167).&lt;/ref&gt; [[landscape gardener]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"I need hardly speak of its antiquity, the oldest profession in the world" (Preston Chronicle, Lancashire, 9 November 1889, p.2.)&lt;/ref&gt; the military,&lt;ref&gt;Speech by Lord Wolseley, Morning Post, 21 December 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; doctors,&lt;ref&gt;''The Clinic: A Weekly Journal of Practical Medicine'', 1875, p.245.&lt;/ref&gt; [[nurses]],&lt;ref&gt;''Nursing World'', vols 21–22, 1898, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers,&lt;ref&gt;''The Ohio Educational Monthly'', vol 57, 1908, p.294.&lt;/ref&gt; [[priests]],&lt;ref&gt;''Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers'', 1902.&lt;/ref&gt; and even lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;"A lawyer, then, is a member of the oldest profession extant; for as he lives upon the rottenness of human nature, the first human crime made room for a lawyer"  (Alfred Butler, ''Elphinstone'', vol 1, 1841, p.189).&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the earliest recorded claim to be the world's oldest profession was made on behalf of [[tailors]].  The ''Song in Praise of the Merchant-Taylors'', attested from 1680, which was routinely performed at [[procession|pageants]] at the [[Lord Mayor's Show]], [[London]], if the current mayor happened to belong to the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|
tailors' guild]],&lt;ref&gt;Percy Society, ''Early English Poetry, Ballads and Popular Literature of the Middle Ages'', vol. XIX (London, 1846), p.74.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Of all the professions that ever were nam'd,
The taylor's, though slighted, is much to be fam'd':
For various invention, and antiquity,
No trade with the tayler's comparèd may be:
&lt;/poem&gt;
After pointing out that [[Adam and Eve]] made garments for themselves, and were therefore tailors, it continued:
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;Then judge if a tayler was not the first trade.
The oldest profession, and they are but raylers,&lt;ref&gt;Bitter deriders or scoffers.&lt;/ref&gt;
Who scoff and deride men that be merchant-taylers.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Acquisition of opprobrious sense==
The phrase began to acquire its opprobrious sense in the last decade of the nineteenth century following [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story about an Indian prostitute, ''On the City Wall'' (January 1889).  Kipling, after citing a biblical reference,&lt;ref&gt;Joshua ii. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; began:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lalun is a member of the most ancient profession in the world. [[Lilith]] was her very-great-grandmamma, and that was before the days of Eve as every one knows.  In the West, people say rude things about Lalun's profession, and write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young persons in order that Morality may be preserved.  In the East where the profession is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes lectures or takes any notice; and that is a distinct proof of the inability of the East to manage its own affairs.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a scathing article on the morals of the aristocracy in the mass circulation ''Reynold's Newspaper'', 22 July 1894,&lt;ref&gt;Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; the reference was repeated:&lt;blockquote&gt;
In ancient Rome, under the empire, ladies used to go to baths to meet a certain class of men, while men resorted thither to meet a certain class of ladies.  The ladies belonged to what has been called “the oldest profession in the world", a profession which is carried on in Piccadilly, Regent street, and other parts of London with great energy every night …&lt;/blockquote&gt;  In the same year the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;12 November 1894, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; reported a speech in which "Mrs. Ormiston Chant … implored us to stand shoulder to shoulder and destroy what Kipling has called 'the oldest profession in the world'".

The phrase was frequently used as a [[euphemism]] when delicacy forbade direct reference to prostitution.

Kipling was not the first to employ the phrase "the most ancient profession" in an opprobrious sense.  The Irish poet [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] (1701–1783) wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''The Works of English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper'', vol 17, p.428.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
Of all trades and arts in repute or possession,
[[Humbug]]ging is held the most ancient profession.
&lt;/poem&gt;
The phrase had also been applied to murderers.  In  ''The Secret Societies of All Ages and Countries'' (1875),&lt;ref&gt;(London, Richard Bentley and Son), vol 2, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles William Heckethorn, describing the [[Thuggee|Thugs]] of India, said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[hierophant]], on initiating the candidate, says to him: "Thou hast chosen, my son, the most ancient profession, the most acceptable to the deity.  Thou hast sworn to put to death every human being fate throws into thy hand..."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Residual usage of the phrase in its reputable sense==
There is some evidence that unworldly speakers (e.g. of the older generation) or unsophisticated audiences (e.g. in small towns or rural areas) were not at first aware of the phrase's newly acquired meaning.  Thus for some time the following could be said in English newspaper reports without apparent embarrassment: “A certain proportion of the cadets were now leaving to enter the oldest profession in the world” (1895).&lt;ref&gt;(The profession of arms.)  Speech of Lord Wolseley to the Royal Military Academy, ''Morning Post'', 21 December 1895, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; “This gentleman's name often figures high in local prize lists, and he is considered an enthusiast in 'the oldest profession in the world'" (1902).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener.)  ''Folkestone, Hythe, Sandgate &amp; Cheriton Herald'', 17 May 1902, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Mr Petrie heard the voice of God and observed the working of His hand in ways that are denied to most of us.  His speech, and especially his prayers, exhibited a rare consciousness of the beauty of holiness, and were fragrant with phrases of singular charm.  As you all know, Mr Petrie followed the oldest profession in the world” (1915).&lt;ref&gt;(Gardener).  ''Stirling Observer'', 12 November 1915, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, those 'innocent' uses of the phrase tended to die out as awareness of the newly acquired meaning increased; as did the appreciation that antiquity, of itself, did not make a profession respectable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3607">The '''pluripotency''' of biological compounds describes the ability of certain substances to produce several distinct biological responses. Pluripotent is also described as something that has no fixed developmental potential, as in being able to differentiate into different cell types in the case of pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pluripotent|title = Pluripotent|date = |accessdate = 14 March 2015|website = Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of pluripotent cell, called a hematopoietic stem cell, can differentiate into a large variety of cells with different functions. This stem cell can produce red blood cells, platelets, mast cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Each of these cells have a different function, but they all work together as part of the immune system. 
[[Monocytes]] can differentiate into either dendritic cells or macrophages. [[Macrophages]] are covered with chemical receptors and phagocytose foreign particles, but are specific about what immune responses to be involved in. [[Dendritic cells]] phagocytose invaders; then they present the antigen on their surface to stimulate the acquired immune system (lymphocytes) as backup.&lt;ref name="Prescott"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Prescott's microbiology |last = Willey, J., Sherwood, L., &amp; Woolverton, C. |first = |publisher = McGraw Hill |year = 2014|isbn = 0073402400|location = Innate Host Resistance and Adaptive Immunity |pages = 723&amp;ndash;788|work = |editor-last =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example are lymphocytes called naïve T-helper cells. These cells can differentiate into many subtypes once activated by [[antigen presenting cells]] (APCs) like dendrites. They divide into memory cells, TH1, TH17, and TH2 cells, to name a few. Memory cells are made solely for the purpose of having a template to use in the case of reinfection so the body has a jump start instead of starting over as if never infected. TH17 cells do a variety of tasks including recruiting [[neutrophils]], creating [[defensins]], and mediating inflammation in the intestinal epithelium and skin. TH2 cells produce cytokines that will trigger certain B cells. [[B cells]] can differentiate into memory cells or plasma cells. The B plasma cells produce the [[antibodies]] that are used to tag invading cells so they can be attacked, among other functions. TH1 cells are created to make cytokines, like interferon gamma, that activate macrophages and [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTLs).&lt;ref name="Prescott"/&gt;

[[Interferon gamma]] represents an example of pluripotency in itself. Many cytokines are pluripotent, in that each of these compounds can activate specific behavior in some cell types and inhibit other behavior in other cell types.  Once activated by T lymphocytes or Natural Killer cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Ikeda, H., Old, L., &amp; Schreiber, R. | title= The roles of IFN in protection against tumor development and cancer immunoediting| journal= Cytokine &amp; Growth Factor Reviews | volume= 13|issue= 2| pages=95–109| year= 2002| doi= 10.1016/S1359-6101(01)00038-7 | pmid= 11900986}}&lt;/ref&gt; interferon gamma upregulates expression of macrophages and both types of [[Major Histocompatibility Complex]] (MHC) antigens. In [[B lymphocytes]] (B cells), interferon gamma stimulates antibody class switching. All of these cells have different, specialized functions, but they all came from one pluripotent cell.

October 29 - November 3, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[balloon]]-borne [[astroparticle physics]] experiment which is to measure polarisation in hard X-rays and soft gamma-rays. It is sensitive to photons with an energy range of 25-80 keV. PoGOLite contains 217 [[phoswich detector]] cells (PDC) which are surrounded by a ring of side anticoincidence shield (SAS) detectors.

==PoGOLite Pathfinder mission==
The pathfinder instrument containing 61 PDCs and 30 SAS detectors was scheduled to be launched from the [[Esrange]] facility in northern [[Sweden]] during summer 2011. The flight was to be the first westward circumpolar balloon flight in the northern hemisphere in 20 years and was expected to take 17–25 days.

The main targets of the pathfinder experiment are the [[Crab Pulsar]] and the [[high-mass X-ray binary]] system [[Cygnus X-1]], which are two of the brightest objects in the energy range of PoGOLite.

The mission was launched at 1:57am Thursday 7 July 2011 (23h57 GMT Wednesday 6 July 2011) from [[Esrange]], Sweden. However, it was brought back down by 7:00am from an altitude of 35&amp;nbsp;km, because of a helium leak.&lt;ref&gt;SpaceDaily, [http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Giant_Swedish_space_balloon_fizzes_out_space_centre_999.html "Giant Swedish space balloon fizzes out: space centre"], '''AFP''', ''7 July 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; The payload landed near [[Nikkaluokta]] just before the mountains around the Sweden-Norway border where a landing would have caused more potential damage. The payload was returned to the Esrange site on 8 July 2011 after which initial tests showed only minor damage to the payload. A second attempt was scheduled for July 2012 but was cancelled because of bad weather. The mission's third and final attempt is scheduled for July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://okc.albanova.se/blog/bad-news-for-pogolite-once-again/ Bad news for PoGOLite once again, blog post at Oskar Klein Center by Mark Pearce]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharia''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|r|iː|ə}}), '''Sharia law''', or '''Islamic law''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|شريعة}}}} {{IPA-ar|ʃaˈriːʕa|}}) is a [[religious law]] forming part of the [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref name=oxforddic&gt;{{cite web |title=British &amp; World English: sharia |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=4 December 2015 |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the term ''sharīʿah'' refers to [[God in Islam|God]]'s immutable [[divine law]] and is contrasted with ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It has been described as "one of the major intellectual achievements of Islam"&lt;ref name="Lewis-ME-223"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Middle East, a brief history of the last 2000 years|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=NY|isbn=978-0684832807|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its importance in Islam has been compared to that of [[theology]] in [[Christianity]].{{refn|group=note|"What theology is for the Christian, law is for the Muslim."&lt;ref name="Smith-1957-57"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=W|title=Islam in Modern History|date=1957|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced in &lt;ref name="Forte-1978-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht|journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|date=1978|volume=1|page=2|url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;

Traditional [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|theory of Islamic jurisprudence]] recognizes four [[sources of sharia]]: the Quran, ''[[sunnah]]'' (authentic hadith), ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical reasoning), and ''[[ijma]]'' (juridical consensus).&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L. Esposito]], [[Natana J. DeLong-Bas]] (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOmaDq8HKCgC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women in Muslim family law]'', p. 2. [[Syracuse University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}. Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; Different [[Madhhab|legal schools]]—of which the most prominent are [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]]—developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ''[[ijtihad]]''.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Islamic Law |editor=John L. Esposito |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2014 |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/print/opr/t125/e1107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}  [[Fiqh|Traditional jurisprudence]] distinguishes two principal branches of law, ''[[Ibadah|ʿibādāt]]'' (rituals) and ''[[Muamalat|muʿāmalāt]]'' (social relations), which together comprise a wide range of topics.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Its rulings assign actions to one of [[Ahkam|five categories]]: [[Fard|mandatory]], [[Mustahabb|recommended]], [[Mubah|neutral]], [[Makruh|abhorred]], and [[Haram|prohibited]].&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Thus, some areas of sharia overlap with the Western notion of law while others correspond more broadly to living life in accordance with God’s will.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

Historically, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists ([[mufti]]s). Their legal opinions ([[fatwa]]s) were taken into account by ruler-appointed [[Qadi|judges]] who presided over ''[[qāḍī]]'s'' courts, and by ''maẓālim'' courts, which were controlled by the ruler's council and administered criminal law.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman rulers]] achieved additional control over the legal system by promulgating their own legal code (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') and turning muftis into state employees.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Non-Muslim ([[dhimmi]]) communities had legal autonomy, except in cases of interconfessional disputes, which fell under jurisdiction of qadi's courts.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=19}} Judicial procedures and legal education in the Muslim world were likewise brought in line with European practice.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in [[Status (law)|personal status]] (family) laws.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Legislative bodies which codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Islamic revival]] of the late 20th century brought along calls by [[Islamist]] movements for full implementation of sharia, including reinstatement of ''[[hudud]]'' corporal punishments, such as [[stoning]].{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} In some cases, this resulted in traditionalist legal reform,{{refn|group=note|While the advocacy of ''hudud'' punishments has gained symbolic importance, and in theory often involved rejection of the stringent traditional restrictions on their application, in practice, in those few countries where they have been reintroduced, they have often been used sparingly or not at all. Their application has varied depending on local political climate.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}}}} while other countries witnessed juridical reinterpretation of sharia advocated by progressive reformers.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}}

The role of sharia has become a contested topic around the world. Attempts to impose it on non-Muslims have caused [[Religious violence in Nigeria|intercommunal violence in Nigeria]]&lt;ref&gt;Staff (January 3, 2003).

==Etymology and usage==

=== Contemporary usage ===

The word ''sharīʿah'' is used by Arabic-speaking peoples of the Middle East to designate a prophetic religion in its totality.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} For example, ''sharīʿat Mūsā'' means law or religion of Moses and ''sharīʿatu-nā'' can mean "our religion" in reference to any monotheistic faith.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} Within Islamic discourse, ''šarīʿah'' refers to religious regulations governing the lives of Muslims.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} For many Muslims, the word merely means "justice," and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to sharia.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

Jan Michiel Otto distinguishes four senses conveyed by the term ''sharia'' in religious, legal and political discourse:{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=9–10}}
* ''Divine, abstract sharia'': God's plan for mankind and the norms of behavior which should guide the Islamic community. Muslims of different perspectives agree in their respect for the abstract notion of sharia, but they differ in how they understand the practical implications of the term.
* ''Classical sharia'': the body of rules and principles elaborated by Islamic jurists during the first centuries of Islam.
* ''Historical sharia(s)'': the body of rules and interpretations developed throughout Islamic history, ranging from personal beliefs to state legislation and varying across an ideological spectrum. Classical sharia has often served as a point of reference for these variants, but they have also reflected the influences of their time and place.
* ''Contemporary sharia(s)'': the full spectrum of rules and interpretations that are developed and practiced at present.

A related term ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qānūn al-islāmī}}'' ({{lang|ar|{{large|القانون الإسلامي}}}}, Islamic law), which was borrowed from European usage in the late 19th century, is used in the Muslim world to refer to a legal system in the context of a modern state.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=323}}

=== Etymology ===

The primary range of meanings of the Arabic word ''šarīʿah'', derived from the root ''š-r-ʕ'', is related to religion and religious law.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The lexicographical tradition records two major areas of use where the word ''šarīʿah'' can appear without religious connotation.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} In texts evoking a pastoral or nomadic environment, the word, and its derivatives refer to watering animals at a permanent water-hole or to the seashore, with special reference to animals who come there.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} Another area of use relates to notions of stretched or lengthy.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} This range of meanings is cognate with the Hebrew ''saraʿ'' and is likely to be the origin of the meaning "way" or "path".{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} Both these areas have been claimed to have Within rise to aspects of the religious meaning.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}}

=== Use in religious texts ===

In the Quran, ''šarīʿah'' and its cognate ''širʿah'' occur once each, with the meaning "way" or "path".{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The word ''šarīʿah'' was widely used by Arabic-speaking Jews during the Middle Ages, being the most common translation for the word ''torah'' in the 10th-century Arabic Old Testament known as Saʿadya Gaon.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} A similar use of the term can be found in Christian writers.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The Arabic expression ''Sharīʿat Allāh'' (&lt;span lang="ar" dir="ltr"&gt;شريعة الله&lt;/span&gt; "God’s Law") is a common translation for תורת אלוהים (‘God’s Law’ in Hebrew) and νόμος τοῦ θεοῦ (‘God’s Law’ in Greek in the New Testament [Rom. 7: 22]).&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, M. (2002), Wörterbuch der griechisch-arabischen Übersetzungen des neunten Jahrhunderts, Wiesbaden, p. 437. Rom. 7: 22: ‘συνήδομαι γὰρ τῷ νόμῳ τοῦ θεοῦ’ is translated as ‘أني أفرح بشريعة الله’&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim literature, ''šarīʿah'' designates the laws or message of a prophet or God, in contrast to ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to a scholar's interpretation thereof.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=322}}

[[File:Ibnhanbal.jpg|thumb|Juristic exchange between [[Abu Dawood]] and [[Ibn Hanbal]]. One of the oldest literary manuscripts of the Islamic world, dated October 879.]]

According to the traditional Muslim view, there was no "historical development" of Islamic law and its major precepts were all known and passed down directly from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht| journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|date=1978|volume=1|page=8|url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (''fiqh'') also goes back to the lifetime of Muhammad.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In this view, his [[Sahaba|companions]] and followers took what he did and approved of as a model ([[sunnah]]) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of [[hadith]].{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists [[Abu Hanifah]], [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Al-Shafi‘i]], and [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], who are viewed as the founders of the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafiʿi]], and [[Hanbali]] legal schools (''[[madhhab]]s'') of Sunni jurisprudence.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}

Modern historians have presented alternative theories of the formation of fiqh.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At first Western scholars accepted the general outlines of the traditional account.{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} In the late 19th century, an influential [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] hypothesis was advanced by [[Ignac Goldziher]] and elaborated by [[Joseph Schacht]] in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Schacht and other scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown |first1=Daniel W.|title=Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521570770 |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/116836545/Rethinking-Traditions-in-Modern-Islamic-Thought-Daniel-w-Brown |accessdate=10 May 2018 |ref=DWBRTMIT1996 |pages=18–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the local practices of early Muslim communities (which Schacht calls the `living tradition` of the `ancient schools of law`) and earliest efforts at Islamic jurisprudence{{refn|group=note|“... the essential features of old Muhammadan jurisprudence, such as the idea of the `living tradition` of the ancient schools of law; a body of common doctrine expressing the earliest effort to systematize;  legal maxims which often reflect a slightly later stage, and an important nucleus of legal traditions ... it is safe to say that [this] Muhammadan legal science started in the later part of the Umaiyad period, taking the legal practice of the time as its raw material and endorsing, modifying, or rejecting it, ...” ,&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-190&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} were based on a variety of sources, not just the ahadith of Muhammad.{{refn|group=note|“In the time of Shafi’i, traditions from the Prophet were already recognized as one of the material bases of Muhammadan law.

Furthermore, most hadith and their [[Hadith studies#Sanad and matn|chains of transmission]] were actually created at a later date {{refn|group=note|”a great many traditions in the classical and other collections were put into circulation only after Shafi'i's time;

and extended back to Muhammad's companions (despite the efforts of hadith scholars to uncover fabricated isnads), when it became accepted that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was al-Shafi'i, who formulated this and other elements of classical legal theory in his work ''[[Al-Risala (Al-Shafi‘i)|al-risala]]'',{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of ahadith of  Muhammad. (Muhammad died in 632 CE while Al-Shafi’i began to establish an independent line of legal speculation in 810.) These accounts gave rise to objections, and modern historians generally adopt more cautious, intermediate positions.{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}}

While the origin of hadith remains a subject of scholarly controversy, it is generally accepted that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the [[Early Muslim conquests|early conquests]] and modified other aspects, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the early Muslim communities.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}} Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}} At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school's founder.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=130}}

== Traditional jurisprudence (''fiqh'') ==

{{Main|Fiqh}}

Fiqh is traditionally divided into the fields of ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]'' (lit. the roots of fiqh), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and ''furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}

=== Principles of jurisprudence (''uṣūl al-fiqh'') ===

{{Main|Principles of Islamic jurisprudence}}

Classical jurists held that human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}} However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}}

Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] by a passage revealed at a later date.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (''[[Ijma|ijmaʿ]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of [[ijtihad]], which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The theory of [[Twelver Shia]] jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (''[['Aql|ʿaql]]'') as a source of law in place of ''qiyas'' and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the [[The Twelve Imams|imams]].{{sfn|Kamali|1999|pp=121–22}}

==== Sources of sharia ====

{{Main|Sources of sharia}}
* ''[[Quran]]'': In Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation, which is known as "recurrence" or "concurrent transmission" (''tawātur'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Only several hundred verses of the Quran have direct legal relevance, and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance, though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}}
* ''[[Hadith]]'': The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Early Islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} These criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand "sound" hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}
* ''Consensus ([[ijma]])'' could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}} This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Kamali|1999|p=146}} However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}
* ''Analogical reasoning ([[qiyas]])'': Qiyas is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the "cause"  (''ʿilla'') shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=23–24}} Twelver Shia jurisprudence does not recognize the use of qiyas, but relies on reason (''ʿaql'') in its place.{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}

==== Ijtihad ====

{{Main|Ijtihad}}

[[File:Türkischer Mufti.jpg|thumb|Turkish mufti (17th-century Spanish drawing)]]

The classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as ''[[istihsan]]'' (juristic preference), ''[[istislah]]'' (consideration of public interest) and ''[[istishab]]'' (presumption of continuity).{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} A jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a ''mujtahid''.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} The use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation), which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}} From the 18th century on, leading Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vitality of early Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}}

==== Decision types (''aḥkām'') ====

{{Main|Ahkam}}

Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as “the five decisions” (''al-aḥkām al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''farḍ'' or ''wājib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mandūb'' or ''mustaḥabb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mubāḥ''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makrūh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''ḥarām'').{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[Halal|ḥalāl]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''ḍarūra'').{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

==== Aims of sharia and public interest ====

{{Main|Maqasid|Maslaha}}

''Maqāṣid'' (aims or purposes) of sharia  and ''maṣlaḥa'' (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} They were first clearly articulated by [[al-Ghazali]] (d. 1111), who argued that ''maslaha'' was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.{{sfn|Opwis|2007|p=65}} Although most classical-era jurists recognized ''maslaha'' and ''maqasid'' as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=66–68}} Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=68–69}} While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}} These scholars expanded the inventory of ''maqasid'' to include such aims of sharia as reform and women's rights ([[Rashid Rida]]); justice and freedom ([[Mohammed al-Ghazali]]); and human dignity and rights ([[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]).{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}

===Branches of law===
{{Fiqh}}
{{Further|Topics of sharia law}}
The domain of ''furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into ''ʿibādāt'' (rituals or acts of worship) and ''muʿāmalāt'' (social relations).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into "the four quarters", called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a "book" (''kitab'').{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} The special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}}

Some historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as ''[[hudud]]''.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of ''[[lex talionis]]'' that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (''[[qisas]]''), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'') or pardon the perpetrator instead; only ''diya'' is imposed for non-intentional harm.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} Other criminal cases belong to the category of ''[[Tazir|taʿzīr]]'', where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}

The two major genres of ''furūʿ'' literature are the ''mukhtasar'' (concise summary of law) and the ''mabsut'' (extensive commentary).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}  ''Mukhtasars'' were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} A ''mabsut'', which usually provided a commentary on a ''mukhtasar'' and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} Other juristic genres include the ''qawāʿid'' (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

===Schools of law===
{{main article|Madhhab}}
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Predominant madhhab by region of the Muslim world]]

The main Sunni schools of law (''madhhabs'') are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] madhhabs.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The [[Zahiri]] school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the [[Twelver]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Ismaili]] madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The [[Ibadi]] legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}  Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question).{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}

===Social context===
{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}

From the 9th century onward, the power to interpret law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars ([[ulema]]). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Basim Musallam |title=The Ordering of Muslims Societies |encyclopedia=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |editor=[[Francis Robinson]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 105–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of many centuries, imperial, political and technological change, including the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, ushered in an era of European world [[hegemony]] that gradually included the domination of many of the lands which had previously been ruled by Islamic empires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Ansari, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson''.

Most Muslim-majority countries incorporate sharia at some level in their legal framework, with many calling it the highest law or the source of law of the land in their constitution.&lt;ref name=tjmas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034 |title=Islam: Governing under Sharia |first1=Toni |last1=Johnson |first2=Mohammed Aly |last2=Sergie |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amanat &amp; Griffel (2007), ''Shari'a: Islamic Law in the Contemporary Context'', Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0804756396}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most use sharia for personal law (marriage, divorce, domestic violence, child support, family law, inheritance and such matters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schenker |first1=J G |title=Women's reproductive health: monotheistic religious perspectives |journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |year=2000 |pmid=10884536 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7292(00)00225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Khadduri|Liebesny|1955|p={{page needed|date=April 2016}}}} Elements of sharia are present, to varying extents, in the criminal justice system of many Muslim-majority countries.&lt;ref name=nabiad/&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Brunei]], [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sudan]] and [[Mauritania]] apply the code predominantly or entirely while it applies in some parts of [[Pakistan]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=nabiad&gt;Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, {{ISBN|978-1905221417}}{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Otto|2010|p=28}}

Since the 1970s, most Muslim-majority countries have faced vociferous demands from their religious groups and political parties for immediate adoption of sharia as the sole, or at least primary, legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Abdullahi Ahmed |last1=An-Na'im |title=Human Rights in the Muslim World: Socio-Political Conditions and Scriptural Imperatives |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |volume=3 |year=1990 |pages=13–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some moderates and liberal scholars within these Muslim-majority countries have argued for limited expansion of sharia.{{sfn|Otto|2010|pp=29–33}}

===Enforcement===
{{main article|Islamic religious police|Hisbah}}
Sharia is enforced in Muslim-majority nations in a number of ways, including ''mutaween'' (police enforcement) and ''hisbah''. [[mutaween]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|المطوعين، مطوعية}}}} ''{{transl|ar|muṭawwiʿīn, muṭawwiʿiyyah}}'')&lt;ref&gt;''muṭawiʿin''; variant English spellings: mutawwain, muttawa, mutawallees, mutawa’ah, mutawi’, mutawwa' most literally means "volunteers" in the Arabic language, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' by Hans Wehr, edited by J. M. Cowan, 4th edition (1994, {{ISBN|0879500034}}), p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt; are the government-authorized or government-recognized religious police (or clerical [[police]]) of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Elsewhere, enforcement of Islamic values in accordance with sharia is the responsibility of the ''Polisi Perda Syariah Islam'' in Aceh province of [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;Fealy &amp; White (2008), ''Regional Sharia Regulations in Indonesia: Anomaly or Symptom?'', Chapter: Expressing Islam: Religious life and politics in Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9812308511}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Gaza Strip)]] in parts of Palestine, and the [[Basij]]i Force in Iran.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Irans_Basij_Force_Mainstay_Of_Domestic_Security/1357081.html |title=Iran's Basij Force&amp;nbsp;– The Mainstay Of Domestic Security|date= January 15, 2009 |work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hisbah]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|حسبة}}}} ''ḥisb(ah)'', or hisba) is a historic Islamic doctrine which means "accountability".&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Sami Zubaida (2005), Law and Power in the Islamic World, {{ISBN|978-1850439349}}, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Hisbah doctrine holds that it is a religious obligation of every Muslim that he or she report to the ruler (Sultan, government authorities) any wrong behavior of a neighbor or relative that violates sharia or insults Islam. The doctrine states that it is the divinely sanctioned duty of the ruler to intervene when such charges are made, and coercively "command right and forbid wrong" in order to keep everything in order according to sharia.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Lorenzo Vidino (2013), [http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/Hisba_in_Europe.pdf Hisba in Europe?], European Foundation for Democracy, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]: ''Commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought.''

The doctrine of Hisbah in Islam may allow a Muslim to accuse another Muslim, ex-Muslim or non-Muslim for beliefs or behavior that harms Islamic society. This principle has been used in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and others to bring blasphemy charges against [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]].&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Gallagher (2005), Apostasy, Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics, Editors: Suad Joseph and Afsāna Naǧmābād, {{ISBN|978-9004128187}}, pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Egypt]], sharia was enforced on the Muslim scholar Nasr Abu Zayd, through the doctrine of Hisbah for [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=Maurits |title=Apostasy and Public Policy in Contemporary Egypt: An Evaluation of Recent Cases from Egypt's Highest Courts |journal=Human Rights Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=3 |year=2003 |pages=720–40 |jstor=20069684 |doi=10.1353/hrq.2003.0026|hdl=1887/13673 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olsson |first1=Susanne |title=Apostasy in Egypt: Contemporary Cases of Ḥisbah |journal=The Muslim World |volume=98 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=95–115 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2008.00212.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Nigeria, after twelve northern Muslim-majority states such as [[Kano State|Kano]] adopted a sharia-based penal code between 1999 and 2000, hisbah became the allowed method of sharia enforcement where Muslim citizens could police compliance of moral order based on sharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olaniyi |first1=Rasheed Oyewole |title=Hisbah and Sharia Law Enforcement in Metropolitan Kano |journal=Africa Today |volume=57 |issue=4 |year=2011 |pages=71–96 |doi=10.2979/africatoday.57.4.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aceh province of Indonesia, Islamic vigilante activists have invoked Hisbah doctrine to enforce sharia on fellow Muslims as well as demanding that non-Muslims respect sharia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uddin |first1=Asma |title=Religious Freedom Implications of Sharia Implementation in Aceh, Indonesia |journal=University of St. Thomas Law Journal |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=603–48 |year=2010 |ssrn=1885776 |url=http://ir.stthomas.edu/ustlj/vol7/iss3/8/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://play.hbogo.com/episode/urn:hbo:episode:GWKN9LQUn0Ym4wwEAAAAQ |title=VICE News Season 5 Episode 7 |last= |first= |date=April 7, 2017 |website=|access-date=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hisbah has been used in many Muslim-majority countries to enforce sharia restrictions on [[blasphemy]] and criticism of Islam over internet and [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;Helmi Noman (2013), "In the name of God – Faith based internet censorship in majority Muslim countries", in ''Routledge Handbook of Media Law'' (Editors: Monroe E.

===Legal and court proceedings===
{{anchor|Courts}}
[[File:Malacca State Syariah Court.JPG|thumb|Shariah Court in [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]].]]

Sharia judicial proceedings have significant differences from other legal traditions, including those in both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; [[plaintiffs]] and [[defendants]] represent themselves. Trials are conducted solely by the judge, and there is no jury system. There is no pre-trial [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] process, and no [[cross-examination]] of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding [[precedents]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7816/Law-Islamic.html Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– Legal Literature And Institutions, Jurisprudence: The "Sources" of the Law, The Modern Period].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/qatar.html |title=Qatar: The Duality of the Legal System |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/493-2003.pdf ''Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corp. v. Mobil Yanbu Petrochemical Co.'', Supreme Court of Delaware, January 14, 2005 p. 52]. "The Saudi law system differs in critically important respects from the system of legal thought employed by the common law countries, including the United States. Perhaps most significant is that Islamic law does not embrace the common law system of binding precedent and ''stare decisis''. In Saudi Arabia, judicial decisions are not in themselves a source of law, and with minor exceptions, court decisions in Saudi Arabia are not published or even open to public inspection."&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally [[Codification (law)|codified]] universal statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Tetley (1999), Mixed Jurisdictions: Common Law v. Civil Law (Codified and Uncodified), La. Law Review, 60, 677&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rules of evidence]] in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Fortna, Benjamin C. (March 2011). "Education and Autobiography at the End of the Ottoman Empire". ''[[Die Welt des Islams]]''. New Series, Vol. 41, Issue 1. p. 131. "the literacy rate in the Ottoman Empire in 1900 was between five and ten percent".&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim.&lt;ref name=av1&gt;Antoinette Vlieger (2012), Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, {{ISBN|978-1610271288}}, Chapter 4{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court.&lt;ref&gt;Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004172258}}, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etannibi E. O. Alemika (2005), "Human Rights and Shariah Penal Code in Northern Nigeria", ''UN Human Rights Monitor'', pp. 110–27&lt;/ref&gt; In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness.&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfdl1/&gt; In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in [[Hanbali]] madhhab.&lt;ref name=av1/&gt;

====Criminal cases====
A confession, an oath, or the oral testimony of Muslim witnesses are the main evidence admissible, in sharia courts, for hudud crimes, that is the religious crimes of adultery, fornication, rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], drinking intoxicants and theft.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed S. El-Awa (1993), Punishment In Islamic Law, American Trust Publications, {{ISBN|978-0892591428}}, pp. 1–68{{nonspecific|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Reichel and Jay Albanese (2013), Handbook of Transnational Crime and Justice, SAGE publications, {{ISBN|978-1452240350}}, pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=663}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=31}} Testimony must be from at least two free Muslim male witnesses, or one Muslim male and two Muslim females, who are not related parties and who are of sound mind and reliable character. Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, fornication or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some [[fiqh]]s allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male.&lt;ref&gt;Ajijola, Alhaji A.D. (1989). ''Introduction to Islamic Law''. Karachi: International Islamic Publishers. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic identification|Forensic evidence]] (''i.e.'', fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other [[circumstantial evidence]] is likewise rejected in [[hudud]] cases in favor of eyewitnesses, a practice which can cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamali |first1=Mohammad Hashim |authorlink=Mohammad Hashim Kamali |year=1998 |title=Punishment in Islamic Law: A Critique of the Hudud Bill of Kelantan, Malaysia |jstor=3382008 |journal=[[Arab Law Quarterly]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=203–34 |doi=10.1163/026805598125826102}}{{qn|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohd Noor |first1=Azman |last2=Ibrahim |first2=Ahmad Basri |year=2008 |title=The rights of a rape victim in Islamic Law |journal=IIUM Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=65–83 |url=http://irep.iium.edu.my/id/eprint/5699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim jurists have debated whether and when coerced confession and coerced witnesses are acceptable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In the Ottoman Criminal Code, the executive officials were allowed to use torture only if the accused had a bad reputation and there were already indications of his guilt, such as when stolen goods were found in his house, if he was accused of grievous bodily harm by the victim or if a criminal during investigation mentioned him as an accomplice.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rudolph |last1=Peters |title=Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521796705 |date=2006 |pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confessions obtained under torture could not be used as a ground for awarding punishment unless they were corroborated by circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

====Civil cases====
{{cite quran|2|282 |s=nosup}} recommends written financial contracts with reliable witnesses, although there is dispute about equality of female testimony.&lt;ref name=mfdl1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fadel |first1=Mohammad |title=Two Women, One Man: Knowledge, Power, and Gender in Medieval Sunni Legal Thought |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=185–204 |ssrn=1113891 |jstor=164016 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800064461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage is solemnized as a written financial contract, in the presence of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice ([[Mahr]]) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman. The brideprice is considered by a sharia court as a form of debt. Written contracts are paramount in sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul Powers |date=2005 |title=Intent in Islamic Law: Motive and Meaning in Medieval Sunnī Fiqh |publisher=Brill Academic |isbn=978-9004145924 |pages=97–110, 125–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.&lt;ref name=remes1/&gt;

In commercial and civil contracts, such as those relating to exchange of merchandise, agreement to supply or purchase goods or property, and others, oral contracts and the testimony of Muslim witnesses triumph over written contracts. Sharia system has held that written commercial contracts may be forged.&lt;ref name=remes1&gt;Reem Meshal (2014), ''Sharia and the Making of the Modern Egyptian'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-9774166174}}, pp. 96–101 and Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timku1&gt;Timur Kuran (2012), The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691156415}}, pp. 246–49 and Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timur Kuran]] states that the treatment of written evidence in religious courts in Islamic regions created an incentive for opaque transactions, and the avoidance of written contracts in economic relations. This led to a continuation of a "largely oral contracting culture" in Muslim-majority nations and communities.&lt;ref name=timku1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/ierc/conference_registration/papers/Kuran.pdf "Explaining the Economic Trajectories of Civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Musings on the Systemic Approach"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020235639/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/ierc/conference_registration/papers/Kuran.pdf |date=2014-10-20 }} pp. 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of written evidence, oaths are accorded much greater weight; rather than being used simply to guarantee the truth of ensuing testimony, they are themselves used as evidence. Plaintiffs lacking other evidence to support their claims may demand that defendants take an oath swearing their innocence, refusal thereof can result in a verdict for the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, Matthew Ross; McConville, Seán; Yerushalmi, Mordechai (1988). ''Islamic Criminal Law and Procedure&amp;nbsp;– An Introduction''. New York City: [[Praeger Publishers]]. p. 71. {{ISBN|978-0275930097}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an oath for Muslims can be a grave act; one study of courts in Morocco found that lying litigants would often "maintain their testimony right up to the moment of oath-taking and then to stop, refuse the oath, and surrender the case."&lt;ref name="frank"&gt;Frank, Michael J. (April 2006). "Trying Times&amp;nbsp;– The Prosecution of Terrorists in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq". ''[[Florida Journal of International Law]]''.{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, defendants are not routinely required to swear before testifying, which would risk casually profaning the Quran should the defendant commit perjury;&lt;ref name="frank"/&gt; instead oaths are a solemn procedure performed as a final part of the evidence process.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

====Diya====
{{main article|Diya (Islam)}}

In classical jurisprudence monetary compensation for bodily harm (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' or blood money) is assessed differently for different classes of victims.

==Support and opposition==

===Support===
A 2013 survey based on interviews of 38,000 Muslims, randomly selected from urban and rural parts in 39 countries using area probability designs, by the [[Pew Forum|Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] found that a majority—in some cases "overwhelming" majority—of Muslims in a number of countries support making sharia the [[law of the land]], including Afghanistan (99%), Iraq (91%), Niger (86%), Malaysia (86%), Pakistan (84%), Morocco (83%), Bangladesh (82%), Egypt (74%), Indonesia (72%), Jordan (71%), Uganda (66%), Ethiopia (65%), Mali (63%), Ghana (58%), and Tunisia (56%).&lt;ref name=pewssp15/&gt; In Muslim regions of Southern-Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the support is less than 50%: Russia (42%), Kyrgyzstan (35%), Tajikistan (27%), Kosovo (20%), Albania (12%), Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%), Azerbaijan (8%). Regarding specific averages, in South Asia, Sharia had 84% favorability rating among the respondents; in Southeast Asia 77%; in the Middle-East/North Africa 74%; in Sub-Saharan Africa 64%; in Southern-Eastern Europe 18%; and in Central Asia 12%.&lt;ref name=pewssp15/&gt;

However, while most of those who support implementation of sharia favor using it in family and property disputes, fewer supported application of severe punishments such as whippings and cutting off hands, and interpretations of some aspects differed widely.&lt;ref name=pewssp15&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Sandra |editor-last=Stence |year=2013 |others=Research: Alan Cooperman, Neha Sahgal, Jessica Hamar Martinez, et al. |title=The World's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society |publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |pages=15–19, 46, 147–48 |ref=harv |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf |accessdate=31 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030223449/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf# |archive-date=2014-10-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pew poll, among Muslims who support making sharia the law of the land, most do not believe that it should be applied to non-Muslims.
In the Muslim-majority countries surveyed this proportion varied between 74% (of 74% in Egypt) and 19% (of 10% in Kazakhstan), as percentage of those who favored making sharia the law of the land.{{sfn|Stence|2013|p=48}} Polls demonstrate that for Egyptians, the 'Shariah' is associated with notions of political, social and gender justice.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C.

[[Islamic fundamentalism|Fundamentalists]], wishing to return to basic Islamic religious values and law, have in some instances imposed harsh sharia punishments for crimes, curtailed civil rights and violated human rights. Extremists have used the Quran and their own particular version of sharia to justify acts of war and terror against Muslim as well as non-Muslim individuals and governments, using alternate, conflicting interpretations of sharia and their notions of jihad.&lt;ref name=aenexeter/&gt;{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=100}}

The sharia basis of arguments advocating terrorism is controversial. According to [[Bernard Lewis]], "[a]t no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis (with Buntzie Ellis Churchill) 'Islam: The Religion and the People' (2008). Pearson Prentice Hall. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; and the terrorist practice of suicide bombing "has no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law or tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis (with Buntzie Ellis Churchill) 'Islam: The Religion and the People' (2008). Pearson Prentice Hall p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wael B.

Some scholars of Islam, such as  [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] and [[Sulaiman Al-Alwan]], have supported suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, arguing that they are army reservists and hence should be considered as soldiers, while [[Hamid bin Abdallah al-Ali]] declared that suicide attacks in Chechnya were justified as a "sacrifice".&lt;ref name=aenexeter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3874893.stm Controversial preacher with 'star status'] BBC article, by agdi Abdelhadi on 7 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent Islamic scholars, including al-Qaradawi himself, have issued condemnations of terrorism in general terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kurzman.unc.edu/islamic-statements-against-terrorism/ |title=Islamic Statements Against Terrorism |author=Charles Kurzman |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah Al ash-Sheikh]], the [[Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia]] has stated that "terrorizing innocent people [...] constitute[s] a form of injustice that cannot be tolerated by Islam", while [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]] and former [[Grand Mufti]] of Egypt has stated that "attacking innocent people is not courageous; it is stupid and will be punished on the Day of Judgment".&lt;ref name=aenexeter&gt;Anisseh Engeland-Nourai, [https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10036/3417/VanEngeland_THE%20CHALLENGE%20OF%20FRAGMENTATION%20OF%20INTERNATIONAL%20HUMANITARIAN%20LAW.pdf?sequence=6 The Challenge of Fragmentation of International Humanitarian Law Regarding the Protection of Civilians – An Islamic Perspective] School of Law, University of Bedfordshire, pp. 18–25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ira Lapidus, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson''.

According to Jan Michiel Otto, Professor of Law and Governance in Developing Countries at [[Leiden University]], "[a]nthropological research shows that people in local communities often do not distinguish clearly whether and to what extent their norms and practices are based on local tradition, tribal custom, or religion. Those who adhere to a confrontational view of sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture, even if high-ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite."{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=30}}

===Human rights===
Several major, predominantly Muslim countries have criticized the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries. Iran declared in the UN assembly that UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Forsythe (2009), Encyclopedia of Human Rights: Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, pp. 239–45&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and of Islam.&lt;ref name=as1999&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amyn B |last1=Sajoo |date=Spring 1990 |title=Islam and Human Rights: Congruence or Dichotomy |journal=Temple International and Comparative Law Journal |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=23–34 |oclc=81814299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kecia |last1=Ali |chapter=Progressive Muslims and Islamic jurisprudence: the necessity for critical engagement with marriage and divorce law |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MCcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT189 |pages=163–87 |editor1-first=Omid |editor1-last=Safi |year=2003 |title=Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism |publisher=Oneworld |isbn=978-1780740454}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], a group representing all Muslim-majority nations, met in Cairo to respond to the UDHR, then adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Heiner |last1=Bielefeldt |title='Western' versus 'Islamic' Human Rights Conceptions?: A Critique of Cultural Essentialism in the Discussion on Human Rights |journal=Political Theory |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=90–121 |jstor=192285 |doi=10.1177/0090591700028001005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anver M.

[[Ann Elizabeth Mayer]] points to notable absences from the Cairo Declaration: provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Article 24 of the Cairo declaration states that "all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic ''shari'a''".&lt;ref name=mayer&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ann Elizabeth |last1=Mayer |chapter=Islamic Law and Human Rights: Conundrums and Equivocations |editor1-first=Carrie |editor1-last=Gustafson |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor2-last=Juviler |year=2016 |title=Religion and Human Rights: Competing Claims?: Competing Claims? |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1315502557}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Syria, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters&amp;nbsp;– in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Patrick Glenn]] states that sharia is structured around the concept of mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people).&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, H.

According to the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], every human has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change their religion or belief. Sharia has been criticized for not recognizing this human right. According to scholars&lt;ref name=naim96&gt;{{cite book |first1=Abdullahi A |last1=An-Na'im |chapter=Islamic Foundations of Religious Human Rights |chapterurl={{Google books|aqyWwF5YA1gC |page=337 |plainurl=yes}} |title=Religious Human Rights in Global Perspective: Religious Perspectives |pages=337–59 |editor1-first=John |editor1-last=Witte |editor2-first=Johan D. |editor2-last=van der Vyver |year=1996 |isbn=978-9041101792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/malaysia/religious-conversion-sharia-law/p13552 |title=Religious conversion and sharia law, Lionel Beehner (2007), Council on Foreign Relations (Washington DC) |work=Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Noah |last1=Feldman |year=2008 |title=The Fall and Rise of the Islamic State |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0691120454}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Islamic law, the applicable rules for religious conversion under sharia are as follows:
* If a person converts to Islam, or is born and raised as a Muslim, then he or she will have full rights of citizenship in an Islamic state.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* Leaving Islam is a sin and a religious crime. Once any man or woman is officially classified as Muslim, because of birth or religious conversion, he or she will be subject to the death penalty if he or she becomes an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]], that is, abandons his or her faith in Islam in order to become an atheist, agnostic or to convert to another religion. Before executing the death penalty, sharia demands that the individual be offered one chance to return to Islam.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* If a person has never been a Muslim, and is not a [[kafir]] (infidel, unbeliever), he or she can live in an Islamic state by accepting to be a [[dhimmi]], or under a special permission called ''aman''. As a dhimmi or under aman, he or she will suffer certain limitations of rights as a subject of an Islamic state, and will not enjoy complete legal equality with Muslims.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* If a person has never been a Muslim, and is a kafir (infidel, unbeliever), sharia demands that he or she should be offered the choice to convert to Islam and become a Muslim; if he or she rejects the offer, he or she may become a dhimmi. Failure to pay the tax may lead the non-Muslim to either be enslaved, killed or ransomed if captured.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;

According to sharia theory, conversion of disbelievers and non-Muslims to Islam is encouraged as a religious duty for all Muslims, and leaving Islam (apostasy), expressing contempt for Islam (blasphemy), and religious conversion of Muslims is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stahnke |first1=Tad |title=Proselytism and the Freedom to Change Religion in International Human Rights Law |journal=Brigham Young University Law Review |volume=1999 |issue=1 |date=January 1999 |pages=251–350 |url=http://digitalcommons.law.byu.edu/lawreview/vol1999/iss1/3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na’Im, ''Islam and the Secular State: Negotiating the Future of Shari'ajar'' (2008){{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all Islamic scholars agree with this interpretation of sharia theory.

Some scholars claim sharia allows religious freedom because a Qur'anic verse teaches, "there is no compulsion in religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Arzi |first1=Donna E. |title=The Role of Compulsion in Islamic Conversion: Jihad, Dhimma and Ridda |journal=Buffalo Human Rights Law Review |volume=8 |year=2002 |pages=15–44 |oclc=781621291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim sharia recognizes only one proper religion, considers apostasy as sin punishable with death, and members of other religions as kafir ([[infidel]]);&lt;ref&gt;Shafi'i: Rawda al-talibin, 10.7, Hanafi: Ibn 'Abidin: Radd al-muhtar 3.287, Maliki: al-Dardir: al-Sharh al-saghir, 4.435, and Hanbali: al-Bahuti: Kashshaf al-qina', 6.170 (see The Struggle to Constitute and Sustain Productive Orders: Vincent Ostrom's Quest to Understand Human Affairs), Mark Sproule-Jones et al (2008), Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-0739126288}}){{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or hold that sharia demands that all apostates and kafir must be put to death, enslaved or be ransomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Siddiqui |first1=Muhammad Iqbal |year=1979 |title=The Penal Law of Islam |location=Tahore |publisher=Kazi |pages=40–59 |oclc=928154348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;RAHIM, ABDUR.

In the end, then, what is being applied is not sharia, but what a particular group of clerics and government decide is sharia. It is these differing interpretations of sharia that explain why many Muslim-majority countries have laws that restrict and criminalize apostasy, proselytism and their citizens' freedom of conscience and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Asma |last1=Uddin |year=2010 |title=Religious Freedom Implications of Sharia Implementation in Aceh, Indonesia |volume=7 |issue=3 |journal=University of St Thomas Law Journal |pages=603–48 |ssrn=1885776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saeed, Abdullah, and Hassan Saeed, eds.

Many claim sharia law encourages domestic violence against women, when a husband suspects ''[[nushuz]]'' (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Farid |last1=Esack |chapter=Islam and Gender Justice: Beyond Simplistic Apologia |chapterurl={{Google books|riz_cIdSq0gC |page=187 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=187–210 |editor1-first=John C. |editor1-last=Raines |editor2-first=Daniel C. |editor2-last=Maguire |year=2014 |title=What Men Owe to Women: Men's Voices from World Religions |publisher=SUNY |isbn=978-0791491553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim wife beating, for ''nashizah'', is not consistent with modern perspectives of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hamid R. |last1=Kusha |chapter=Qur'anic Perspectives on Wife Abuse |pages=595–602 |editor1-first=Nicky Ali |editor1-last=Jackson |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal status laws and child marriage====
Shari'a is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic-majority nations. These personal status laws determine [[women's rights|rights of women]] in matters of marriage, divorce and child custody. A 2011 [[UNICEF]] report concludes that sharia law provisions are discriminatory against women from a human rights perspective. In legal proceedings under sharia law, a woman’s testimony is worth half of a man’s before a court.&lt;ref name=unicef2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/REGIONAL-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf |title=MENA Gender Equality Profile – Status of Girls and Women in the Middle East and North Africa, UNICEF (October 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for Iran{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, Lebanon{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and Bahrain{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} which allow child marriages{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, the civil codes in Islamic majority countries do not allow [[child marriage]] of girls. However, with sharia personal status laws, sharia courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code. The religious courts permit girls less than 18 years old to marry. As of 2011, child marriages are common in a few Middle Eastern countries, accounting for 1 in 6 of all marriages in Egypt and 1 in 3 marriages in Yemen. [[UNICEF]] and other studies state that the top five nations in the world with highest observed child marriage rates – Niger (75%), Chad (72%), Mali (71%), Bangladesh (64%), Guinea (63%) – are Islamic-majority countries where the personal laws for Muslims are sharia-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09-CountryExample-Mali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Child Marriage is a Death Sentence for Many Young Girls |publisher=UNICEF |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nour |first=Nawal M. |title=Health Consequences of Child Marriage in Africa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1644–49 |year=2006 |pmid=17283612 |doi=10.3201/eid1211.060510 |pmc=3372345}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Cairo speech]], President Obama spoke out against child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=B0lwiInZG1E#t=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape is considered a crime in all countries, but sharia courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow a rapist to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of ''[[Zina]]'' (adultery).&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/challenges_to_women_security_mena_region.pdf |title=Kendra Heideman and Mona Youssef, Challenges to Women's Security in the MENA Region, Wilson Center (March, 2013) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/new-survey-assesses-womens-freedom-middle-east |title=Sanja Kelly (2010) New Survey Assesses Women's Freedom in the Middle East, Freedom House (funded by US Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative) |publisher=|date=2005-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharia grants women the [[right to property|right to inherit property]] from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran.{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=49}} A woman's inheritance is unequal and less than a man's, and dependent on many factors.{{Quran-usc|4|12}}&lt;ref name=davidpowers/&gt; For instance, a daughter's inheritance is usually half that of her brother's.{{Quran-usc|4|11}}&lt;ref name=davidpowers&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powers |first1=David S. |title=The Islamic Inheritance System: a Socio-Historical Approach |journal=Arab Law Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=13–29 |jstor=3381490 |doi=10.1163/157302593X00285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, such as the right to own property received as [[Mahr]] (brideprice) at her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Badawi |first=Jamal A. |title=The Status of Women in Islam |journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |date=September 1971}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Noah Feldman |last=Feldman |first=Noah |title=Why Shariah? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 16, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&amp;em=&amp;en=5c1b8de536ce606f&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Islamic law does not grant non-Muslim women the same legal rights as the few it did grant Muslim women. Sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, between Believers and non-Believers, as well as their unequal rights.&lt;ref name=blbr&gt;

Starting with the 20th century, Western legal systems evolved to expand women's rights, but women's rights under Islamic law have remained tied to the Quran, hadiths and their fundamentalist interpretation as sharia by Islamic jurists.&lt;ref name=alik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hafez, Mohammed |title=Why Muslims Rebel |journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=September 2006 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels with Western legal systems==

Early Islamic law developed a number of legal concepts that anticipated similar such concepts that later appeared in English [[common law]].&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|year=1999|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devichand&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mukul Devichand|title=Is English law related to Muslim law?|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7631388.stm|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities exist between the royal English [[contract]] protected by the action of [[debt]] and the Islamic ''Aqd'', between the English [[assize of novel disseisin]] and the Islamic ''Istihqaq'', and between the English [[jury]] and the Islamic ''Lafif'' in classical Maliki jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jamila|last=Hussain|title=Book Review: ''The Justice of Islam'' by Lawrence Rosen|journal=[[Melbourne University Law Review]]|volume=30|year=2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[law school]]s known as [[Inns of Court]] also parallel [[Madrasah]]s.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt; The methodology of legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]'') are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521864145|page=16|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the English [[Trust law|trust]] and [[Agency (law)|agency]] institutions to the Islamic ''[[Waqf]]'' and ''[[Hawala]]'' institutions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gaudiosi |first=Monica M. |title=The Influence of the Islamic Law of Waqf on the Development of the Trust in England: The Case of Merton College |journal=[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]] |volume=136 |issue=4 |date=April 1988 |pages=1231–1261 |doi=10.2307/3312162 |jstor=3312162 |ref=harv|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol136/iss4/6 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667|jstor=839667|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devichand/&gt;

Elements of Islamic law also have other parallels in Western legal systems. For example, the influence of Islam on the development of an international law of the sea can be discerned alongside that of the Roman influence.&lt;ref name=Tai&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tai |first1=Emily Sohmer |title=Book Reviews: Hassan S. Khalilieh, ''Admiralty and Maritime Laws in the Mediterranean Sea (ca. 800–1050): The "Kitāb Akriyat al-Sufun" vis-à-vis the "Nomos Rhodion Nautikos"'' |journal=Medieval Encounters |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2007 |pages=608–12 |doi=10.1163/157006707X222812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makdisi states Islamic law also parallels the legal scholastic system in the West, which gave rise to the modern university system.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt; He writes that the triple status of ''[[faqih]]'' ("[[Master of Laws|master of law]]"), ''[[mufti]]'' ("professor of [[Fatwā|legal opinions]]") and ''mudarris'' ("teacher"), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms ''[[Magister (degree)|magister]]'', ''[[professor]]'' and ''[[Doctor (title)|doctor]]'', respectively, although they all came to be used synonymously in both East and West.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Makdisi |first1=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |year=1989 |pages=175–82 |jstor=604423 |doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makdisi suggests that the medieval European doctorate, ''licentia docendi'' was modeled on the Islamic degree ''ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta’'', of which it is a word-for-word translation, with the term ''ifta’'' (issuing of fatwas) omitted.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Devin J. |last=Stewart |title=Degrees, or Ijaza |editor=Josef W. Meri |encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |p=203 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MypbfKdMePIC&amp;pg=PA203 |isbn=978-0415966917}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that these systems shared fundamental freedoms: the freedom of a professor to profess his personal opinion and the freedom of a student to pass judgement on what he is learning.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt;

There are differences between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, sharia classically recognizes only [[natural persons]], and never developed the concept of a [[legal person]], or [[corporation]], i.e., a legal entity that [[Limited liability|limits the liabilities]] of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Timur |last1=Kuran |authorlink1=Timur Kuran |date=Fall 2005 |title=The Absence of the Corporation in Islamic Law: Origins and Persistence |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=785–834 |jstor=30038724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuran |first1=Timur |title=The logic of financial westernization in the Middle East |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |volume=56 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=593–615 |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2004.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have played a significant role in retarding economic development in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0895330042162421 "Why the Middle East Is Economically Underdeveloped&amp;nbsp;– Historical Mechanisms of Institutional Stagnation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

"http://www.sens.org/research/introduction-to-sens-research". ''SENS Research Foundation website''&lt;/ref&gt; for the periodical repair of all age-related damage to human tissue with the ultimate purpose of maintaining a state of [[negligible senescence]] in the patient, thereby postponing [[age-associated disease]] for as long as the therapies are reapplied.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

The term "[[negligible senescence]]" was first used in the early 1990s by professor [[Caleb Finch]] to describe organisms such as [[lobsters]] and [[hydra (genus)|hydra]]s, which do not show symptoms of aging. The term "engineered negligible senescence" first appeared in print in [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'',&lt;ref name="isbn1587061554"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2003). ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging.'' Austin, Texas: Landes Bioscience. {{ISBN|1-58706-155-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was later prefaced with the term "strategies" in the article ''Time to Talk SENS: Critiquing the Immutability of Human Aging''&lt;ref name="pmid11976218"&gt;de Grey AD, Ames BN, Andersen JK, Bartke A, Campisi J, Heward CB, McCarter RJ, Stock G (April 2002).

==Framework==

[[File:Aging treatment approaches.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The arrows with flat heads are a notation meaning "inhibits," used in the literature of gene expression and gene regulation.]]

The ultimate objective of SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing the state of senescence in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, in order to avoid debilitation and death from age-related causes.&lt;ref name=EndingAging/&gt;

De Grey defines aging as "the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us", and, more specifically, as follows: "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an [[adult]] [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death."&lt;ref name="pmid12844502"&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (January 8, 2003). "[http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/manu16.pdf An engineer's approach to the development of real anti-aging medicine]". ''Sci Aging Knowledge Environ''. 2003 (1): VP1. {{doi|10.1126/sageke.2003.1.vp1}}. {{PMID|12844502}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds: "[[geriatrics]] is the attempt to stop damage from causing pathology; traditional [[gerontology]] is the attempt to stop [[metabolism]] from causing damage; and the SENS (engineering) approach is to eliminate the damage periodically, so keeping its abundance below the level that causes any pathology." The SENS approach to biomedical [[gerontology]] is thus distinctive because of its emphasis on tissue rejuvenation rather than attempting to slow the aging process.

By enumerating the various differences between young and old tissue identified by the science of [[biogerontology]], a 'damage' report was drawn, which in turn formed the basis of the SENS strategy. The results fell into seven main categories of 'damage', seven alterations whose reversal would constitute [[negligible senescence]]:

For each of these areas SENS offers at least one strategy, with a research and a clinical component. The clinical component is required because in some of the proposed therapies, feasibility has already been proven, but not completely applied and approved for human trials. These strategies do not presuppose that the underlying metabolic mechanisms of aging be fully understood, only that we take into account the form senescence takes as directly observable to science, and described in scientific literature..

==Types of aging damage and treatment schemes==

===Nuclear mutations/epimutations—OncoSENS===
These are changes to the nuclear DNA ([[nDNA]]), or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain mutations can lead to [[cancer]].

This would need to be corrected in order to prevent or [[cure for cancer|cure cancer]]. SENS focuses on a strategy called "whole-body interdiction of lengthening [[telomere]]s" (WILT), which would be made possible by periodic [[regenerative medicine]] treatments.

===Mitochondrial mutations—MitoSENS===

[[Mitochondria]] are components in our [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for [[energy]] production. Because of the highly [[Oxidative stress|oxidative]] environment in mitochondria and their lack of the sophisticated repair systems, mitochondrial mutations are believed to be a major cause of progressive cellular degeneration.

This would be corrected by [[allotopic expression]]—copying the [[DNA]] for mitochondria completely within the cellular [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], where it is better protected. De Grey argues that experimental evidence demonstrates that the operation is feasible, however, a 2003 study showed that some mitochondrial proteins are too [[hydrophobic]] to survive the transport from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria.&lt;ref&gt;Oca-Cossio, J. et al., 2003. Limitations of Allotopic Expression of Mitochondrial Genes in Mammalian Cells. Genetics, 165(2), 707–720.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular junk—LysoSENS===
{{tone|date=January 2018}}
Our cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can’t be digested accumulate as junk inside our cells, which is detected in the form of [[lipofuscin]] granules. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]], [[liver spot]]s on the skin and all kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as [[Alzheimer's]] disease) are associated with this problem.

Junk inside cells might be removed by adding new [[enzymes]] to the cell's natural [[digestion]] organ, the [[lysosome]]. These enzymes would be taken from [[bacteria]], [[mold]]s and other organisms that are known to completely digest animal bodies.

===Extracellular junk—AmyloSENS===

Harmful junk protein can accumulate outside of our cells. Junk here means useless things accumulated by a body, but which cannot be digested or removed by its processes, such as the amyloid plaques characteristic of [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other [[amyloidosis|amyloidoses]].

Junk outside cells might be removed by enhanced [[phagocytosis]] (the normal process used by the immune system), and small drugs able to break chemical beta-bonds. The large junk in this class can be removed surgically.

===Cell loss and atrophy—RepleniSENS===

Some of the cells in our bodies cannot be replaced, or can be only replaced very slowly—more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number affects some of the most important tissues of the body.  Muscle cells are lost in [[skeletal muscle]]s and the heart, causing them to become frailer with age.  Loss of neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] causes [[Parkinson's disease]], while loss of immune cells impairs the [[immune system]].

This can be partly corrected by therapies involving [[exercise]] and [[growth factor]]s, but [[stem cell therapy]], [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] are almost certainly required for any more than just partial replacement of lost cells.

===Cell senescence—ApoptoSENS===

[[Cellular senescence#Cellular senescence|Senescence]] is a phenomenon where the cells are no longer able to divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of [[joint]]s, immune senescence, accumulation of [[visceral fat]] and [[diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called [[apoptosis]], to instruct cells to destroy themselves.

Cells in this state could be eliminated by forcing them to apoptose (via [[suicide gene]]s, [[vaccine]]s, or recently discovered [[senolytics|senolytic agents]]), and healthy cells would multiply to replace them.

===Extracellular crosslinks—GlycoSENS===

Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many [[cross-links]] form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including arteriosclerosis, presbyopia and weakened skin texture. These are chemical bonds between structures that are part of the body, but not within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]]. In senescent people many of these become brittle and weak.

SENS proposes to further develop small-molecular drugs and [[enzyme]]s to break links caused by sugar-bonding, known as [[advanced glycation endproduct]]s, and other common forms of chemical linking.

==Scientific controversy==
While some fields mentioned as branches of SENS are broadly supported by the medical research community, e.g., [[stem cell research]] (RepleniSENS), [[Alzheimer's disease clinical research|anti-Alzheimers research]] (AmyloSENS) and [[oncogenomics]] (OncoSENS), the SENS programme as a whole has been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the SENS agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for SENS to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future&lt;ref name="pmid16264422" /&gt;. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an [[Aging-associated diseases|aging-associated disease]] (OncoSENS), but the SENS claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Best, BP | title=Nuclear DNA damage as a direct cause of aging 
| journal=Rejuvenation Research  | volume=12 | issue=3 | date=2009 | pages=199–208  
| url=http://www.benbest.com/lifeext/Nuclear_DNA_in_Aging.pdf | format= [[PDF]]  
| doi = 10.1089/rej.2009.0847 |  pmid=19594328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by material in the article [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists published a statement of criticism in ''[[EMBO Journal|EMBO Reports]]'', "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"&gt;Warner H ''et al.'' (November 2005). "Science fact and the SENS agenda. What can we reasonably expect from ageing research?". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1006–1008. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}. {{PMID|16264422}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; and that some of the specific proposals "will take decades of hard work [to be medically integrated], if [they] ever prove to be useful."&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; The researchers argue that while there is "a rationale for thinking that we might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree,"&lt;ref name="pmid16264422"/&gt; increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 ''EMBO Reports'' article previously published by de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (July 2005). "Resistance to debate on how to postpone ageing is delaying progress and costing lives". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (S1): S49–S53. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400399}}. {{PMID|15995663}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (November 2005). "Like it or not, life-extension research extends beyond biogerontology". ''EMBO Reports''. 6 (11): 1000. {{doi|10.1038/sj.embor.7400565}}. {{PMID|16264420}}.&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey summarizes these events in "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," published on the [[Methuselah Foundation]] website.&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey. "[http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/Gandhi3.htm The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS]". 
Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Colin Blakemore]] criticised Aubrey de Grey, but not SENS specifically, in a debate hosted at the [[Oxford University]] Scientific Society.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

More recently, biogerontologist [[Marios Kyriazis]] has sharply criticised the clinical applicability of SENS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M |title=The impracticality of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: translational and pharmacological barriers |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=390–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25072550 |pmc=4142774 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyriazis |first1=Marios |title=Translating laboratory anti-aging biotechnology into applied clinical practice: Problems and obstacles |journal=World Journal of Translational Medicine |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2015 |pages=51–4 |doi=10.5528/wjtm.v4.i2.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that such therapies, even if developed in the laboratory, would be practically unusable by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kyriazis M, Apostolides A |title=The Fallacy of the Longevity Elixir: Negligible Senescence May be Achieved, but Not by Using Something Physical |journal=Current Aging Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=227–34 |year=2015 |pmid=26135528 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/132663/article |doi=10.2174/1874609808666150702095803}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Grey responded to one such criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Grey AD |title=The practicality or otherwise of biomedical rejuvenation therapies: a response to Kyriazis |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=397–400 |year=2014 |pmid=25072964 |doi=10.1089/rej.2014.1599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Technology Review'' controversy===

In February 2005, ''[[Technology Review]]'', which is owned by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], published an article by [[Sherwin Nuland]], a Clinical Professor of Surgery at [[Yale University]] and the author of "How We Die",&lt;ref&gt;Nuland, Sherwin (1994). ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter''. New York: Knopf Random House. {{ISBN|0-679-41461-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that drew a skeptical portrait of SENS, at the time de Grey was a computer associate in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100108033304/http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/Research/flybase.htm Flybase Facility] of the [http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Genetics] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The April 2005 issue of ''Technology Review'' contained a reply by Aubrey de Grey&lt;ref&gt;de Grey, Aubrey (April2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14097&amp;ch=infotech Aubrey de Grey Responds]", ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous comments from readers.&lt;ref&gt;TR Readers (April 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=14310&amp;ch=infotechReaders LETTERS: Our February cover story on Aubrey de Grey and antiaging science lives on]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

During June 2005, [[David Gobel]], CEO and Co-founder of Methuselah Foundation offered Technology Review $20,000 to fund a prize competition to publicly clarify the viability of the SENS approach. In July 2005, Pontin announced a $20,000 prize, funded 50/50 by Methuselah Foundation and MIT Technology Review, open to any molecular biologist, with a record of publication in biogerontology, who could prove that the alleged benefits of SENS were "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate."&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (July 28, 2005). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/pontin/14968/ The SENS Challenge]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Technology Review'' received five submissions to its Challenge. In March 2006, ''Technology Review'' announced that it had chosen a panel of judges for the Challenge: [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], and [[Craig Venter]].&lt;ref&gt;Pontin, Jason (March 14, 2006). "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/16593/ We've picked the judges for our biogerontology prize]". ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the five submissions met the terms of the prize competition. They were published by ''Technology Review'' on June 9, 2006. Accompanying the three submissions were rebuttals by de Grey, and counter-responses to de Grey's rebuttals. On July 11, 2006, ''Technology Review'' published the results of the SENS Challenge.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606111748/http://www.mprize.com/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=0104 SENS Withstands Three Challenges : $20,000 Remains Unclaimed]". Methuselah Foundation. Retrieved on July 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, no one won the $20,000 prize. The judges felt that no submission met the criterion of the challenge and discredited SENS, although they unanimously agreed that one submission, by [[Preston Estep]] and his colleagues, was the most eloquent. [[Craig Venter]] succinctly expressed the prevailing opinion: "Estep et al. ... have not demonstrated that SENS is unworthy of discussion, but the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for it."&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt; Summarizing the judges' deliberations, Pontin wrote that SENS is "highly speculative" and that many of its proposals {{clarify|text=could not be reproduced with the scientific technology of that period.|date=April 2016}} Myhrvold described SENS as belonging to a kind of "antechamber of science" where they wait until technology and scientific knowledge advance to the point where it can be tested.&lt;ref name="PontinJuly112006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invincible Man"/&gt; In a letter of dissent dated July 11, 2006 in Technology Review, Estep et al. criticized the ruling of the judges.

==Social and economic implications==

Of the roughly 150,000 people who die each day across the globe, about two thirds—100,000 per day—die of age-related causes.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = Aubrey de Grey | title = Life Span Extension Research and Public Debate: Societal Considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | date = 2007 | url = http://www.sens.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrialized nations, the proportion is much higher, reaching 90%.&lt;ref name="doi10.2202/1941-6008.1011"/&gt;

De Grey and other scientists in the general field have argued that the costs of a rapidly growing aging population will increase to the degree that the costs of an accelerated pace of aging research are easy to justify in terms of future costs avoided. Olshansky ''et al.'' 2006 argue, for example, that the total economic cost of [[Alzheimer's disease]] in the US alone will increase from $80–100 billion today to more than $1 trillion in 2050.&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend&gt;Olshansky, S. Jay; Perry, Daniel; Miller, Richard A.; Butler, Robert N. (March 2006). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160110004616/http://www.edmontonagingsymposium.com/files/eas/Longevity_Dividend.pdf In Pursuit of the Longevity Dividend: What Should We Be Doing To Prepare for the Unprecedented Aging of Humanity?]". ''The Scientist''. 20 (3): 28–36.&lt;/ref&gt; "Consider what is likely to happen if we don't [invest further in aging research]. Take, for instance, the impact of just one age-related disorder, Alzheimer disease (AD). For no other reason than the inevitable shifting demographics, the number of Americans stricken with AD will rise from 4 million today to as many as 16 million by midcentury. This means that more people in the United States will have AD by 2050 than the entire current population of the Netherlands. Globally, AD prevalence is expected to rise to 45 million by 2050, with three of every four patients with AD living in a developing nation. The US economic toll is currently $80–$100 billion, but by 2050 more than $1 trillion will be spent annually on AD and related dementias. The impact of this single disease will be catastrophic, and this is just one example."&lt;ref name=TheLongevityDividend/&gt;

== SENS Research Foundation ==
{{Main|SENS Research Foundation}}

The SENS Research Foundation is a [[non-profit organization]] co-founded by Michael Kope, [[Aubrey de Grey]], Jeff Hall, Sarah Marr and Kevin Perrott, which is based in [[California]], [[United States]]. Its activities include SENS-based research programs and [[public relations]] work for the acceptance of and interest in related research.

Before March 2009, the SENS research programme was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], co-founded by Aubrey de Grey and David Gobel.  The [[Methuselah Foundation]] is most notable for establishing the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]], a monetary prize awarded to researchers who extend the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths.&lt;ref name=MFMission&gt;

{{Marxism|Variants}}

'''Structural Marxism''' was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s. Other proponents of structural Marxism were the [[sociologist]] [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and the [[anthropologist]] [[Maurice Godelier]].  Many of Althusser's students broke with structural Marxism in the late 1960s and 1970s.

==Overview==
Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures,&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he believed that [[Marxist humanism|humanistic]], [[Historicism#Karl Marx|historistic]] and [[Open Marxism|phenomenological Marxism]], which was based on Marx's early works, was caught in a "pre-scientific humanistic ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Heine Andersen and L. B. Kaspersen (ed.). ''Classical and Modern Social Theory'', Blackwell publishers, Oxford, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the middle of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Marxist theorists began to develop structuralist Marxist accounts of the state, law, and crime. Structuralist Marxism disputes the [[Instrumental Marxism|instrumentalist]] view that the state can be viewed as the direct servant of the capitalist or ruling class. Whereas the instrumentalist position argues that the institutions of the state are under the direct control of those members of the capitalist class in positions of state power, the structuralist perspective takes the position that the institutions of the state must function in such a way as to ensure ongoing viability of capitalism more generally. Another way that Marxists put this is that the institutions of the state must function so as to reproduce capitalist society as a whole. The [[Miliband-Poulantzas debate]] between instrumentalist [[Ralph Miliband]] and structuralist [[Nicos Poulantzas]] characterized the debate between structural and instrumental Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Poulantzas, N. &amp; Miliband R. (1972). The Problem of the Capitalist State. In R. Blackburn (ed.) Ideology in Social Science: Readings in Critical Social Theory. NY: Pantheon Books, pp. 238–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralists view the state in a [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] as taking a specifically capitalist form, not because particular individuals are in powerful positions, but because the state reproduces the logic of capitalist structure in its economic, legal, and political institutions. Hence, from a structuralist perspective one would argue that the institutions of the state (including its legal institutions) function in the long-term interests of capital and capitalism, rather than in the short term interests of members of the capitalist class. Structuralists would thus argue that the state and its institutions have a certain degree of independence from specific elites in the ruling or capitalist class.

==Long- versus short-term class interests==
Structural Marxism posits that the state functions to serve the long-term interests of the [[Bourgeosie|capitalist class]]. Building upon the works of [[Engels]] and [[Lenin]], structural Marxists posit the idea that the state is a mechanism for regulating [[class conflict]], the irreconcilable tension between the [[proletariat]] and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=Lenin&gt;Lenin, V.I. (2004/1917). ''The State and Revolution''. Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Offe&gt;Offe, Claus (1974). ''Structural Problems of the Capitalist State: Class Rule and the Political System''. In [[Klaus von Beyme]] (ed.) ''German Political Studies, vol. 1''. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; By regulating these antagonisms rather than eliminating them—which Lenin thought was impossible without violent revolution&lt;ref name=Lenin /&gt;—the state serves to stabilize the capitalist system as a whole and preserve its existence.

Structuralists differentiate between the long-term and short-term interests of the capitalist class in order to describe the necessity of the state to the capitalism system. Short-term interests of the bourgeoisie include policies that affect capital accumulation in the immediate future such as tax breaks, reduced minimum wages, government subsidies, etc. They maintain that when the state is not benefiting the bourgeois class’ short-term interests, it is acting on the behalf of its future interests. Accordingly, when the state seems to act on behalf of the proletariat rather than the bourgeoisie (raising minimum wages, increasing rights of workers’ unions, etc.) it is serving capitalist interests by meeting the demands of workers only enough to prevent an uprising that could threaten the system as a whole. Because the interests of the proletariat and the capitalist classes are counter to one another, the state is necessary to regulate the capitalist system and assure its preservation by forcing capitalists to agree to demands of workers to which they otherwise would not succumb.&lt;ref name=Offe /&gt;

==Criticism==
In a 1971 paper for ''[[Socialist Register]]'', Polish philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Kołakowski, Leszek (1971), "[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5334/2235 Althusser's Marx]". ''Socialist Register'' 1971, pp. 111–28.&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed critique of structural Marxism, arguing that the concept was seriously flawed on three main points:

:I will argue that the whole of Althusser's theory is made up of the following elements : 1. common sense banalities expressed with the help of unnecessarily complicated [[neologisms]]; 2. traditional Marxist concepts that are vague and ambiguous in [[Marx]] himself (or in Engels) and which remain, after Althusser's explanation, exactly as vague and ambiguous as they were before; 3. some striking historical inexactitudes.

Kołakowski further argued that, despite Althusser's claims of scientific rigor, structural Marxism was [[unfalsifiable]] and thus unscientific, and was best understood as a quasi-religious [[ideology]]. In 1980, sociologist Axel van den Berg&lt;ref&gt;Van den Berg, Axel (1980). "Critical Theory: Is There Still Hope?" ''The American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 86 No. 3 (Nov 1980), pp. 449–478.&lt;/ref&gt; described Kołakowski's critique as "devastating," proving that "Althusser retains the orthodox radical rhetoric by simply severing all connections with verifiable facts."

Similar arguments have been made concerning structural theories  of the capitalist nature of the state. [[Claus Offe]] averred that the class-character of the state could only be observed in an ''ex post'' perspective. In other words, the class character of the state can only be shown after policies are put in place and the outcome is observed. Because of this, he criticizes structural theories which attempt to prove the capitalist character of the state, claiming they do so on an unfounded basis: because outcomes of the state's policies are empirically capitalist, it does not make the State a capitalist enterprise in its nature.&lt;ref name=Offe /&gt;{{rp| 45–46}}

== History ==
The term "transhumanism" with its present meaning was popularised by [[Julian Huxley]]'s 1957 essay of that name.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1957"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Huxley, Julian| title = Transhumanism| year = 1957| url = http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley/| accessdate = February 24, 2006| authorlink = Julian Huxley| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160625132722/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley| archivedate = June 25, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Natasha Vita-More]] was elected as a Councilperson for the 28th Senatorial District of Los Angeles in 1992. She ran with the Green Party, but on a personal platform of "transhumanism". She quit after a year, saying her party was "too neurotically geared toward environmentalism".&lt;ref name=rothman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/10/08/transhumanism-gets-political/|title=Transhumanism Gets Political|last=Rothman|first=Peter|date=8 October 2014|accessdate=7 July 2015|publisher=hplusmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hughes|first1=James|title=The Politics of Transhumanism|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/TranshumPolitics.htm#_ftn2|website=changesurfer.com|accessdate=18 August 2016|quote=Ironically, Natasha Vita-More was actually elected to Los Angeles public office on the Green Party ticket in 1992. However her platform was “transhumanism” and she quit after one year of her two year term because the Greens were “too far left and too neurotically geared toward environmentalism.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] identifies the "neoliberal" [[Extropy Institute]], founded by philosopher [[Max More]] and developed in the 1990s, as the first organized advocates for transhumanism.  And he identifies the late-1990s formation of the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), a European organization which later was renamed to [[Humanity+]] (H+), as partly a reaction to the free market perspective of the "Extropians". Per Hughes, "[t]he WTA included both social democrats and neoliberals around a liberal democratic definition of transhumanism, codified in the Transhumanist Declaration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=James|title=Transhumanist politics, 1700 to the near future|publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=10 April 2009|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes20090409/|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hughes-zygon&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=James|title=The Politics of Transhumanism and the Techno-Millennial Imagination, 1626-2030|publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=1 May 2013|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/hughes20130501|accessdate=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes has also detailed the political currents in transhumanism, particularly the shift around 2009 from socialist transhumanism to [[Libertarian transhumanism|libertarian]] and [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] transhumanism.&lt;ref name=hughes-zygon/&gt; He claims that the [[Left-wing politics|left]] was pushed out of the [[Humanity+|World Transhumanist Association]] Board of Directors, and that libertarians and [[Singularitarianism|Singularitarians]] have secured a hegemony in the transhumanism community with help from [[Peter Thiel]], but Hughes remains optimistic about a [[Techno-progressivism|techno-progressive]] future.&lt;ref name=hughes-zygon/&gt;

== Core values ==
According to a 2006 study by the [[European Parliament]], transhumanism is the political expression of the ideology that technology should be used to enhance human abilities.&lt;ref name="European Parliament 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[European Parliament]]|title=Technology Assessment on Converging Technologies|year=2006|at=ii|quote="On the one side are the true believers in the potential of technology to make individuals ever more perfect.

According to Amon Twyman of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] (IEET), political philosophies which support transhumanism include social futurism, [[techno-progressivism]], [[techno-libertarianism]], and anarcho-transhumanism.&lt;ref name=amon&gt;{{cite web|last=Twyman|first=Amon|title=Transhumanism and Politics|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/twyman20141007|website=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]|date=7 October 2014|quote=I would suggest that the way forward is to view transhumanism as a kind of political vector, axis, or hub rather than a single party or philosophy.

While raising objections both to [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] and [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Techno-progressivism#Contrasting stance|bioconservatism]], and [[libertarian transhumanism]], Hughes aims to encourage democratic transhumanists and their potential [[progressivism|progressive]] allies to unite as a [[new social movement]] and influence [[biopolitical]] [[public policy]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt;

His central thesis is that [[emerging technologies]] and [[radical democracy]] can help [[citizen]]s overcome some of the ''root causes'' of inequalities of [[Power (philosophy)|power]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 2002"/&gt;

According to Hughes, the terms techno-progressivism and democratic transhumanism both refer to the same set of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values and principles; however, the term technoprogressive has replaced the use of the word democratic transhumanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Self-identified libertarian transhumanists, such as [[Ronald Bailey]] of [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'' magazine]] and [[Glenn Reynolds]] of [[Instapundit]], are advocates of the asserted "right to [[human enhancement]]" who argue that the [[free market]] is the best guarantor of this right, claiming that it produces greater prosperity and personal freedom than other economic systems.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 LB"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bailey, Ronald|title=Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case For the Biotech Revolution|publisher=Prometheus Books|year=2005|isbn=1-59102-227-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reynolds 2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reynolds, Glenn |title=[[An Army of Davids]]: How Markets and Technology Empower Ordinary People to Beat Big Media, Big Government, and Other Goliaths|publisher=Thomas Nelson|year=2006|isbn=1-59555-054-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles ===
Libertarian transhumanists believe that the principle of [[self-ownership]] is the most fundamental idea from which both libertarianism and transhumanism stem. They are [[Rational egoism|rational egoists]] and [[Ethical egoism|ethical egoists]] who embrace the prospect of using [[emerging technologies]] to enhance human capacities, which they believe stems from the self-interested application of [[reason]] and [[will (philosophy)|will]] in the context of the individual [[Freedom (philosophy)|freedom]] to achieve a [[posthuman]] state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. They extend this rational and ethical egoism to advocate a form of "[[biolibertarianism]]".&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 LB"/&gt;

As strong [[Civil libertarianism|civil libertarians]], libertarian transhumanists hold that any attempt to limit or suppress the asserted right to human enhancement is a violation of [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]]. However, as strong [[Economic liberalism|economic libertarian]]s, they also reject proposed [[public policy|public policies]] of [[regulation of science|government-regulated]] and -[[universal health care|insured]] [[human enhancement technologies]], which are advocated by [[Democratic transhumanism|democratic transhumanists]], because they fear that any [[Interventionism (politics)|state intervention]] will steer or limit their choices.&lt;ref name="Bailey 2005 THE"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bailey, Ronald | title = Trans-Human Expressway: Why libertarians will win the future | year = 2005 | url = http://www.reason.com/news/show/34971.html | accessdate=2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Dale Carrico|Carrico, Dale]] | title = Bailey on the CybDemite Menace | year = 2005 | url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2005/05/bailey-on-cybdemite-menace.html | accessdate = 2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey 2009"/&gt;

[[Extropianism]], the earliest [[Transhumanism#Currents|current of transhumanist thought]] defined in 1988 by philosopher [[Max More]], initially included an [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalist]] interpretation of the concept of  "[[spontaneous order]]" in its principles, which states that a free market economy achieves a more efficient allocation of societal resources than any [[Planned economy|planned]] or [[mixed economy]] could achieve. In 2000, while revising the principles of Extropy, More seemed to be abandoning libertarianism in favor of [[Social liberalism|modern liberalism]] and [[anticipatory democracy]]. However, many Extropians remained libertarian transhumanists.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2001"/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
Critiques of the [[techno-utopianism]] of libertarian transhumanists from progressive [[cultural critic]]s include [[Richard Barbrook]] and Andy Cameron's 1995 essay ''The Californian Ideology''; [[Mark Dery]]'s 1996 book ''Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century''; and [[Paulina Borsook]]'s 2000 book ''Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech''.

Barbrook argues that libertarian transhumanists are proponents of the [[Californian Ideology]] who embrace the goal of [[reactionary modernism]]: [[economic growth]] without [[social mobility]].&lt;ref name="Barbrook and Cameron 1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Barbrook, Richard |author2=Cameron, Andy | title = The Californian Ideology |  year = 2000 |  url = http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/theory-californianideology.html | accessdate = 2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Barbrook, libertarian transhumanists are unwittingly appropriating the theoretical legacy of [[Stalinism|Stalinist communism]] by substituting, among other concepts, the "[[vanguard party]]" with the "[[digerati]]", and the "[[new Soviet man]]" with the "[[posthuman]]".&lt;ref name="Barbrook"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Barbrook, Richard | title = Cyber-Communism: How the Americans Are Superseding Capitalism in Cyberspace | year = 2007 | url = http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/cyber-communism-how-the-americans-are-superseding-capitalism-in-cyberspace/ | accessdate = 2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dery coined the dismissive phrase "body-loathing" to describe the attitude of libertarian transhumanists and those in the [[cyberculture]] who want to escape from their "[[Human body|meat puppet]]" through [[mind uploading]] into [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref name="Dery 1996"&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Mark Dery|Dery, Mark]] | title = Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century | publisher = Grove Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-8021-3520-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borsook asserts that libertarian transhumanists indulge in a [[subculture]] of [[selfishness]], [[elitism]], and [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="Borsook 2000"&gt;{{cite book| author = Borsook, Paulina | title = Cyberselfish: A Critical Romp Through the Terribly Libertarian Culture of High-Tech |publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | year = 2000 | url = https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2000/11/cyberselfish-redux | isbn = 1-891620-78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] is the most militant critic of libertarian transhumanism. While articulating "democratic transhumanism" as a sociopolitical program in his 2004 book ''[[Citizen Cyborg]]'',&lt;ref name="Hughes 2004"/&gt; Hughes sought to convince libertarian transhumanists to embrace [[social democracy]] by arguing that:
# [[State (polity)|State]] action is required to address [[existential risk|catastrophic threats]] from transhumanist technologies;
# Only believable and effective [[public policy|public policies]] to prevent adverse consequences from new technologies will reassure skittish publics that they do not have to be [[ban (law)|banned]];
# [[Social policy|Social policies]] must explicitly address public concerns that transhumanist biotechnologies will exacerbate [[social inequality]];
# [[Monopoly|Monopolistic]] practices and overly restrictive [[intellectual property]] law can seriously delay the development of transhumanist technologies, and restrict their access;
# Only a strong [[liberal democratic]] state can ensure that posthumans are not [[persecution|persecuted]]; and
# Libertarian transhumanists (who are [[antinaturalism (politics)|anti-naturalists]]) are inconsistent in arguing for the free market [[appeal to nature|on the grounds that it is a natural phenomenon]].

Klaus-Gerd Giesen, a German political scientist specializing in the [[philosophy of technology]], wrote a critique of the libertarianism he imputes to all transhumanists. While pointing out that the works of [[Austrian School]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] figure in practically all of the recommended reading lists of [[Extropians]], he argues that transhumanists, convinced of the sole virtues of the free market, advocate an unabashed [[social Darwinism|inegalitarianism]] and merciless [[meritocracy]] which can be reduced in reality to a biological [[fetishism|fetish]]. He is especially critical of their promotion of a science-fictional [[liberal eugenics]], virulently opposed to any political regulation of [[human genetics]], where the [[consumerism|consumerist]] model presides over their ideology. Giesen concludes that the despair of finding social and political solutions to today's sociopolitical problems incites transhumanists to [[genetic determinism|reduce everything to the hereditary gene]], as a fantasy of [[omnipotence]] to be found within the individual, even if it means transforming the subject ([[human]]) to a new draft (posthuman).&lt;ref name="Giesen 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giesen, Klaus-Gerd | title = Transhumanisme et génétique humaine | year = 2004 | url = http://www.ircm.qc.ca/bioethique/obsgenetique/cadrages/cadr2004/c_no16_04/c_no16_04_01.html | accessdate = 2006-04-26 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310224959/http://www.ircm.qc.ca/bioethique/obsgenetique/cadrages/cadr2004/c_no16_04/c_no16_04_01.html | archivedate = 2007-03-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Transpersonal anthropology''' is a subdiscipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[transpersonal studies]]. It studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and [[culture]].

==Definition and context==
According to Walsh and Vaughan,&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt;Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. On transpersonal definitions. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psvchology'', 25:199-207, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed several definitions of the transpersonal field in the early 1990’s, «Transpersonal anthropology is the cross-cultural study of transpersonal phenomena and the relationship between consciousness and culture.» Charles Laughlin,&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"&gt; Laughlin, C. D. (2013). The ethno-epistemology of transpersonal experience: The view from transpersonal anthropology. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 32(1), 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of the field of Transpersonal anthropology, has defined the discipline as «the cross-cultural study of transpersonal experiences, including the sociocultural evocation, interpretation, and utility of transpersonal experiences, and their involvement in defining social roles».

As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref name="Young &amp; Goulet 1994"&gt;Young, David E. and J.-G. Goulet (1994) ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences''. Peterborough: Broadview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"&gt; Sheppard, E. (2006) "Our worlds beyond." ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 10 ,(1):63-70. &lt;/ref&gt; has noted how transpersonal anthropology can be said to have begun in the USA in the 1970s. By the mid-eighties the discipline was described as a «young and growing field» by commentators.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'' 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; There was, by this time, also a development at the organizational level, in the form of the ''Association of Transpersonal Anthropology'', with  its supporting publication, the ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt; According to Hunter,&lt;ref name="Hunter 2015"&gt; Hunter, Jack. "Between Realness and Unrealness": Anthropology, Parapsychology and the Ontology of Non-Ordinary Realities. ''DISKUS'' 17.2 (2015), 4-20 (The Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions)&lt;/ref&gt; the parallel field of [[Anthropology of Consciousness]] grew out of the transpersonal perspective, including Transpersonal anthropology.

Central to the development of the field has been the work of anthropologist [[Charles D. Laughlin]], who is considered to be one of the primary founders of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "&gt; Hartelius, Glenn. The Imperative for Diversity in a Transpersonal Psychology of the Whole Person. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 33(2), 2014, pp. iii-iv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shepard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; also notes the contributions of Ihsan Al-Issa, &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"&gt;Al-Issa, Ihsan . (1995). "The Illusion of Reality and Reality of Illusion." ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' 166 (3)368-373.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Turner (anthropology)|Edith Turner]],&lt;ref name="Turner 1996"&gt;Turner, Edith (1996) ''The Hands Feel It: Healing and Spirit Presence Among a Northern Alaskan People''. DeKalb, IL: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; wife of the anthropologist  [[Victor Turner]].

==Contributions to academic theory==
One of the  contributions of Laughlin to anthropological theory is a differentiation between so-called monophasic and polyphasic cultures. According to this theory polyphasic cultures are open to altered states of consciousness, and tries to integrate these experiences into their worldview, while monophasic cultures, typical  of technocratical societies, are largely closed to these alternative states of mind.&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "/&gt; Laughlin has published extensively on the topic of Transpersonal anthropology, and has addresses several issues within the field, including methodology.&lt;ref name="Laughlin MacManus Shearer 1983"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D., McManus, John and Shearer, Jon  (1983) "Dreams, Trance and Visions: What a Transpersonal Anthropology Might Look Like".  ''Phoenix:  Journal of Transpersonal Anthropology'' 7 (1/2):141-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1988"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1988) "Transpersonal Anthropology: Some Methodological Issues."  ''Western Canadian Anthropology'' 5:29-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994a"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Psychic Energy and Transpersonal Experience: A Biogenetic Structural Account of the Tibetan Dumo Practice," in ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences'' (ed. by D.E. Young and J.-G. Goulet).  Peterborough: Broadview Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994b"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Transpersonal Anthropology, Then and Now."  ''Transpersonal Review'' 1(1): 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994c"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Apodicticity:  The Problem of Absolute Certainty in Transpersonal Anthropology."  ''Anthropology &amp; Humanism'' 19(2): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Al-Issa &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"/&gt; has dealt with the topic of hallucinations, and the cultural aspects of them. Here, Al-Issa notes how not all cultures have negative views on hallucinations. Cross-cultural differences are noted by Al-Issa in sensory modalities most commonly encountered in hallucinations.

The field also includes the theories of anthropologist Dennis Gaffin whose contribution is a re-conceptualization of fairyology and the [[fairy]]-faith within the context of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Leykam 2013"&gt; Leykam, A. E. Book Review: Running with the fairies: towards a transpersonal anthropology of religion. ''Choice'' ; Middletown  Vol. 50, Iss. 6,  (Feb 2013): 1099. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 2015"&gt; Butler, Jenny. Book Review: Gaffin, Dennis. 2013. Running with the Fairies: Towards a Transpersonal Anthropology of Religion. ''Fieldwork in Religion'', 10.2 (2015), 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheppard&lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; explains how Edith Turner's interpretations of her husband's field studies among the [[Ndembu]] in [[Zambia]] also can be interpreted as belonging to transpersonal anthropology, insofar as her interpretations of their [[healing ritual]]s were transpersonal.

==Criticism==

Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2007"&gt;Sheppard, E. (2007). Anthropology and the development of the transpersonal movement: Finding the transpersonal in transpersonal anthropology. ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 11(1) 59-69 {{ISSN|1366-6991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has published an article criticising transpersonal anthropology, at least as it has typically been practiced in contemporary scholarship. Her criticisms include its lack of a systematic conceptual base; its over-emphasis on shamanism; the difficulty in studying non-Western cultures that have been truly immune to Western influences and the question of the extent to which transpersonal anthropology has really addressed [[altered states of consciousness]].

Classical authors such as [[Aeschines (disambiguation)|Aeschines]] and [[Plutarch]] condemned the ''tryphé'' of Romans such as [[Crassus]] and [[Lucullus]], which included lavish dinner parties and ostentatious buildings.&lt;ref name=wright2006&gt;{{citation | last = Knust | first = Jennifer Wright | title=Abandoned to lust: sexual slander and ancient Christianity |chapter=Extravagant excess |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dK4GffW0s-EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9780231136624&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=joBNTcjGLoL0vwOYjvAr&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tryphe&amp;f=false 32] |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-231-13662-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
But there was more to Ptolemaic ''tryphé'' than dissipative excess, which after all can be pursued in residential or geographical seclusion, and for purely private purposes. It was a component of a calculated political strategy, in that it deployed not just [[conspicuous consumption]] but also conspicuous magnificence, beneficence and feminine delicacy, as a self-reinforcing cluster of signal propaganda concepts in the Ptolemaic dynasty.&lt;ref name=Ager2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=chaveau2000/&gt;

== Background ==
A [[Turing machine]] is a basic model of [[computation]].  Some [[Turing machine]]s might be specific to doing particular calculations.  For example, a Turing machine might take input which comprises two numbers and then produce output which is the product of their [[multiplication]].  Another Turing machine might take input which is a list of numbers and then give output which is those numbers [[sorting|sorted]] in order.

A [[Turing machine]] which has the ability to simulate any other Turing machine is called [[Computationally universal|universal]] - in other words, a Turing machine (TM) is said to be a [[universal Turing machine]] (or UTM) if, given any other TM, there is a some input (or "header") such that the first TM given that input "header" will forever after behave like the second TM.

An interesting [[mathematical]] and [[philosophical]] question then arises.  If a [[universal Turing machine]] is given random input (for suitable definition of [[random]]), how probable is it that it remains universal forever?

Given a [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] [[Turing machine]], the '''universality probability''' of it is the [[probability]] that it remains [[universal Turing machine|universal]] even when every input of it (as a [[binary string]]) is prefixed by a random binary string. More formally, it is the [[probability measure]] of reals (infinite binary sequences) which have the property that every initial segment of them preserves the [[universal Turing machine|universality]] of the given Turing machine. This notion was introduced by the computer scientist [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Chris Wallace]] and was first explicitly  discussed in print in an article by Dowe&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |author=Dowe, D.L. |title=Foreword re C. S. Wallace |journal=Computer Journal |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=523–560 |date=5 September 2008 |doi=10.1093/comjnl/bxm117 |url=http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/51/5/523 }} (and [http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dld/Publications/2008/DLDowe_ForewordReCSWallace_CompJVol51Num5Sept2008pp523-560.pdf here])&lt;/ref&gt; (and a subsequent article&lt;ref&gt;*Dowe, D. L. (2011), "[http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dld/Publications/2010/Dowe2010_MML_HandbookPhilSci_Vol7_HandbookPhilStat_MML+hybridBayesianNetworkGraphicalModels+StatisticalConsistency+InvarianceAndUniqueness_pp901-982.pdf MML, hybrid Bayesian network graphical models, statistical consistency, invariance and uniqueness"], Handbook of the Philosophy of Science - (HPS Volume 7) Philosophy of Statistics, P.S. Bandyopadhyay and M.R. Forster (eds.), Elsevier, pp901-982&lt;/ref&gt;). However, relevant discussions also appear in an earlier article by Wallace and Dowe.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, C. S. &amp; Dowe, D. L. 1999 ''[http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/4/270 Minimum message length and Kolmogorov complexity]'' Computer J. 42, 270–283&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universality probabilities of prefix-free UTMs are non-zero ==
Although the universality probability of a [[Universal Turing Machine|UTM]] (UTM) was originally suspected to be zero, relatively simple proofs exist that the [[supremum]] of the set of universality probabilities is equal to 1, such as a proof based on [[random walk]]s&lt;ref&gt;*Hernandez-Orallo, J. &amp; Dowe, D. L. (2013), "On Potential Cognitive Abilities in the Machine Kingdom", [https://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/11023 Minds and Machines], Vol. 23, Issue 2, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-012-9299-6 pp179-210]&lt;/ref&gt; and a proof in Barmpalias and Dowe (2012).
Once one has one [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] UTM with a non-zero universality probability, it immediately follows that all [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] [[Universal Turing Machine|UTM]]s have non-zero universality probability.
Further, because the [[supremum]] of the set of universality probabilities is 1 and because the set {{math|{ {{sfrac|''m''| 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} {{!}} 0 &amp;lt; ''n'' &amp;amp; 0 &amp;lt; ''m'' &amp;lt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;} }}
is [[dense set|dense]] in the interval [0, 1],
suitable constructions of UTMs
(e.g., if ''U'' is a UTM, define a
UTM ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0''s'') halts for all strings ''s'',
U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(1''s'') = ''U''(''s'') for all s) gives that the set of universality probabilities is
[[dense set|dense]] in the open interval (0, 1).

== Characterization and randomness of universality probability ==
Universality probability was thoroughly studied and characterized by Barmpalias and Dowe in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barmpalias, G. and Dowe D.L. |title=Universality probability of a prefix-free machine |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume=370 |issue=1 | pages=3488–3511 |date=2012 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0319|pmid=22711870 |bibcode=2012RSPTA.370.3488B }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Seen as [[real number]]s, these probabilities were completely characterized in terms of notions in [[computability theory]]
and [[algorithmic information theory]].
It was shown that when the underlying machine is universal, these numbers are highly [[Algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random]]. More specifically, it is [[Per Martin-Löf|Martin-Löf]] random relative to the third iteration of the [[halting problem]]. In other words, they are random relative to null sets that can be defined with four quantifiers in [[Peano arithmetic]]. Vice versa, given such a highly random number{{clarify|date=August 2015}} (with appropriate approximation properties) there is a Turing machine with universality probability that number.

== Relation with Chaitin's constant ==
Universality probabilities are very related to the [[Chaitin's constant|Chaitin constant]], which is the halting probability of a universal prefix-free machine. In a sense, they are complementary to the halting probabilities of universal machines relative to the third iteration of the [[halting problem]]. In particular, the universality probability can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem. Vice versa, the non-halting probability of any prefix-free machine with this highly non-computable oracle is the universality probability of some prefix-free machine.

== Probabilities of machines as examples of highly random numbers ==
Universality probability provides a concrete and somewhat natural example of a highly random number (in the sense of [[algorithmic information theory]]). In the same sense, Chaitin's constant provides a concrete example of a random number (but for a much weaker notion of algorithmic randomness).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6602">The '''Wilhelmine Ring''' is the name for a belt of distinctive multi-occupancy rental housing blocks constructed in the second half of the 19th century around the [[Berlin Customs Wall|historic city center]] of [[Berlin]]. It is characterized by a dense settlement pattern with four- to five-story residential buildings with side and rear wings around an inner courtyard. The designation reflects the period of origin of this town planning solution under the German monarchs [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]].

==Location==
[[File:Berliner Ringbahn1885.jpg|thumb|left|The railway line around Berlin on a 1885 map. The dark area at center right is the developed part of the city, which was long constricted by the customs wall]]
The Wilhelmine Ring comprises large parts of the Berlin subdistricts [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Gesundbrunnen (Berlin)|Gesundbrunnen]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Friedrichshain]], [[Kreuzberg]], [[Neukölln (locality)|Neukölln]], [[Schöneberg]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], [[Moabit]] and [[Charlottenburg]]. It arose primarily in the still undeveloped area between the [[Berlin Customs Wall]], which was removed in the 1860s, and a [[Berlin Ringbahn|railway line]] constructed between 1867 and 1877 to encircle the city.&lt;ref&gt;Die Stadtbahn in Berlin: Planung, Bau, Auswirkung, Falko Krause, Diplomica Verlag Hamburg 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preconditions and features==
The commencement of large-scale German industrialization in the latter part of the 19th century led to a pressing need for labor, which was met by a strong rural exodus favoring Berlin, where abundant jobs could be found. Living accommodations for this rapid influx of workers were needed in the immediate vicinity of the new factories, for which there was no space within the old city limits.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Bodenschatz, Auf dem Weg zur Mietkasernenstadt?, pp 297-308 in Berlin, 19. Jahrhundert: Ein Metropolen-Kompendium, Roland Berbig et al., Akademie Verlag Berlin 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861 a large scale incorporation of neighboring settlements had expanded the area of Berlin by some 70 percent. According to census figures, 547,571 people lived in the city in that year. This population almost tripled in the course of the ensuing 30 years, without significant area growth of the city. The planning for the necessary housing was undertaken in 1862 by [[Hobrecht-Plan|James Hobrecht]], whose “Plan for developing the surroundings of Berlin”, as its name indicates, included an area far exceeding the limits of the just-enlarged city. It specified a network of ring and radial streets with relatively large block sizes, which facilitated the rapid construction of large adjoining buildings in which multi-family rental accommodations were planned.&lt;ref&gt;James Hobrecht und Berlin, Hans Stimmann, in 150 Jahre Metropole Berlin,Susanne Kähler et al., Elsengold Verlag Berlin 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berlin-Wedding Postkarte 005.jpg|thumb|Typical Wilhelmine Ring building with shops on the ground floor and apartments in the upper storeys, from a postcard featuring Wedding around 1900]]

A decisive factor was a regulation passed in 1853 by city planning authorities obligating property developers to little more than adhering to a specified street frontage and a minimal size for the inside courtyards of 5.34 × 5.34 meters, at that time the turning circle of city wagons with fire-fighting equipment. Therefore, in the following decades private developers building in the area to be known as the Wilhelmine Ring used each land parcel to the maximum possible extent, filling it with five- to six-story buildings containing many, often very small, [[Tenement#Berlin|rental units]]. Since the developers had to co-finance the street-access infrastructure, with costs calculated on the basis of the width of the street frontage, this part of the building was relatively narrow, the rest being taken up by the side and rear wings. The front apartments were frequently large and spacious and intended for the middle class, containing, particularly in the desirable first upper floor (the ''bel étage'' or ''piano nobile''), decorative stucco ceilings and parquetry flooring and commanding high rents. The rear wing apartments, by contrast, were much smaller and plainer, harder to ventilate, without views, and usually only offering shared toilet facilities in the hallways or courtyard. These back apartments were primarily rented by working-class families, who in turn sublet rooms to supplement their modest income. In the Wilhelmine Ring the population density was over 1000 per hectare. Over 20 percent of the workers were so-called “sleepers-in” without the resources to rent even a single room, renting a bed on an hourly basis in an apartment that was, even without them, frequently very overcrowded.

Only in 1887 did a new regulation impose stricter constraints on property developers. For example, the eaves or lower edge of the roof could not be higher than 22 meters and the number of storeys was limited to five.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Current situation==
Wherever it was not badly destroyed in [[World War II]] the Wilhelmine Ring is still very present in today’s Berlin and a distinctive feature of the city. Although the ring is still characterized by high density construction and a scarcity of open spaces, the flats are popular because of their historic character and nearness to the city center. In the course of urban redevelopment, renovation and modernization, inner courtyards were sometimes expanded by removing rear or side wings. In other cases the size of the rear apartments was considerably increased by combining them into larger units.
