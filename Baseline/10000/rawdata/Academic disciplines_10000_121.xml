'''3-Nitrooxypropanol''', abbreviated '''3NOP''', is an [[organic compound]] with the formula HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ONO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is the mono[[nitrate ester]] of [[1,3-Propanediol|1,3-propanediol]].  The compound is an [[enzyme inhibitor| inhibitor]] of the enzyme [[Coenzyme-B sulfoethylthiotransferase|methyl coenzyme M reductase]] (MCR). MCR catalyzes the final step in [[methanogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hristov, A.

Typically, a scholarly article has a section in which the authors acknowledge entities such as funding, technical staff, colleagues, etc. that have contributed materials or knowledge or have influenced or inspired their work. Like a [[citation index]], it measures influences on scientific work, but in a different sense; it measures institutional and economic influences as well as informal influences of individual people, ideas, and artifacts.
Unlike the [[impact factor]], it does not produce a single overall metric, but analyses the components separately. However, the total number of acknowledgements to an acknowledged entity can be measured and so can the number of citations to the papers in which the acknowledgement appears. The ratio of this total number of citations to the total number of papers in which the acknowledge entity appears can be construed as the impact of that acknowledged entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |doi=10.1145/1088622.1088627 |title=Automatic acknowledgement indexing: expanding the semantics of contribution in the CiteSeer digital library |book-title=Proceedings of the 3rd international conference on Knowledge capture |conference=K-CAP '05 |pages=19–26 |year=2005 |last1=Councill |first1=Isaac G. |last2=Giles |first2=C.

[[File:Adastral Park.jpg|thumb|The main complex at Adastral Park.]]
'''Adastral Park''' is a science campus based on part of the old [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Royal Air Force Station]] at [[Martlesham Heath]] near [[Ipswich]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Suffolk]].

When the site opened it was known as the [[Post Office Research Station]], but it was subsequently renamed '''BT Research Laboratories''' or '''BT Labs''' and later '''Adastral Park''' to reflect an expansion in the organisations and activities co-located with [[BT Labs]] at the campus.

==History==
The original laboratories (when BT was part of the [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]]) were first opened by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1975.  Prior to this the [[Post Office Research Station]] was located at [[Dollis Hill]]. 

Martlesham Heath was originally chosen as the location for a research facility because the surrounding countryside was relatively flat and therefore ideal for testing the radio-based communication systems in vogue at the time.

Initially research was carried out into postal sorting and delivery technology and telecommunications. After the Post Office was split apart and prior to British Telecom's privatisation in the early 1980s, the research concentrated on telecommunications.

In keeping with the stellar theme of the site name, buildings on site are named after stars or constellations (an example being the Main Laboratory Block now named the Orion building). The Orion building is easily recognisable from the nearby [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12 road]] with its {{convert|200|ft|m}} radio  tower, now named Pegasus tower, dominating the skyline.

The change to the current name occurred in the late 1990s with the aim of turning the site into a high technology business park no longer exclusively for the use of BT. The name was created by Stewart Davies, the CEO of the BT business (BT Exact Technologies) headquartered at the site at that time. It is derived from the motto of the [[Royal Air Force]]—''per ardua ad astra'' ("through adversity to the stars"). The Royal Air Force were prior residents of the site, as [[RAF Martlesham Heath]]. Experimental aircraft test flights flew from the airfield and the name was meant to reflect this. In March 2001, [[University College London]], Faculty of Engineering Sciences, chose Adastral Park to set up the first-ever postgraduate research and teaching centre on an industrial campus which existed until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/ucl_set_to_leave_suffolk_research_park_1_202294|title=UCL set to leave Suffolk research park}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the transformation of the business park many of the old buildings were removed and during the landscaping, car parks were moved to the perimeter of the site with the centre being transformed with open park land and a water feature to provide a 'park' feel to the complex. The site accommodates approximately 4000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BT Celebrates 40 years of innovation at Adastral Park|url=https://atadastral.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/bt-celebrates-40-years-of-innovation-at-adastral-park.pdf|website=www.atadastral.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Use==

Companies based at Adastral Park besides [[British Telecom]] ([[BT Research]]) include:

*[[Juniper_Networks]]
*[[Alcatel-Lucent]]
*[[GENBAND]]
*[[Cisco]]
*[[Fujitsu]]
*[[Huawei]]
*[[O2 plc]]
*[[Arqiva]]
*[[Centre for Integrated Photonics (CIP)|CIP]]

There is also a satellite earth station (operated by Arqiva)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqiva.com/products-and-services/satellite-solutions/contact-us-489 Contact Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217130210/http://www.arqiva.com/products-and-services/satellite-solutions/contact-us-489 |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; - the location was chosen for the visibility of satellites on the eastern horizon.  In total there are currently 98 high-tech companies based at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atadastral.co.uk/|title=Home - BT Adastral Park|author=|date=|website=atadastral.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adastral New Town==
Over many years BT has put forward various proposals and plans to expand the business park activities. In June 2001, a framework for expanding the business park was created, but it was not linked to building any residential housing on the site. At the time BT forecast 3000–3500 additional jobs by about 2010. As recently as 2007, BT said that they could develop the business park without the need for the income from selling land for housing.

In 2006, [[Suffolk Coastal|Suffolk Coastal District Council]] (SCDC) rejected a planning application for 120 log cabins on a site next to Waldringfield Road. The rejection was on the grounds that it was too near the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] amongst other reasons, and would result in an unacceptable increase in visitor numbers to a sensitive areas. BT initially objected on the grounds that it would interfere with their radio test area, although BT subsequently withdrew their objection provided the developer created a protective earth bund, rejected by SCDC.

BT subsequently lodged a planning application for 2000 houses to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redevelopment of Adastral Park|url=http://www.suffolkcoastal.gov.uk/yourdistrict/planning/devcontrol/adastralpark/default.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its closest the site comes within {{convert|88|m}} of an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adastral Park Redevelopment Project: Greenfields under threat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/18/7|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 November 2010 &lt;!-- 15.54 GMT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are several sites of special status close by, such as Newbourne Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suffolk Wildlife Trust " Reserves &amp; Visitor Centres " Newbourne Springs |url=http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/reserves-and-visitor-centres/newbourne-springs/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327085344/http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/reserves-and-visitor-centres/newbourne-springs |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Amphiaraos krater''' is a [[Corinthian vase painting|Late Corinthian]] [[red-ground vase painting|red-ground]] [[column krater]]. It is considered the masterpiece of the [[Amphiaraos Painter]] (whose [[name vase]] it is) and one of the major specimens of the red-ground vase painting of [[Corinth]].

Dated to ''circa'' 560 BC, the Amphiaraos [[Krater]] depicts on the front a frieze of horsemen and above it the departure of [[Amphiaraos]]. The back was decorated with a battle frieze, above it again Amphiaraos, this time as a participant in the funeral games of [[Pelias]]. Below one of the handles, a wrestling match is depicted. The paintings on the vessel are considered especially colourful and detailed. Thus, the anger in Amphiaraos eye, looking at [[Eriphyle]], his only family member not to wish for his safe return, is visible. A sorrowful seer indicates the imminent death of the hero. The same scene was depicted on the Kypselos chest in Olympia, as described by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 5, 17, 5ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The krater used to be on display in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]], but disappeared at the end of the [[Second World War]].

[[Image:Male anatomy en.svg|right|thumb|The male sexual organs]]

'''Anal masturbation''' is an [[masturbation|erotic stimulation]] focusing on the [[anus]] and [[rectum]]. For humans, common methods of anal masturbation include manual stimulation of the anal opening, and the insertion of an object or objects such as fingers, tongue, phallic-shaped items, water play, or sex toys such as [[anal beads]], [[butt plug]]s, [[dildo]]s, [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]], or specially designed [[Prostate massage#Equipment|prostate massagers]].

==Method==
Pleasure can be derived from anal masturbation due to the [[nerve ending]]s in the anal and rectal areas.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|author=Barry R.

Anal masturbation can be especially pleasurable for those with a functioning prostate because it often stimulates the area, which also contains sensitive nerve endings.&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Male hot spot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html|title=The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|date=March 28, 2008|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329122100/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2246.html|archivedate=29 March 2010|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 21, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some men find the quality of their orgasm to be significantly enhanced by the use of a butt plug or other anally inserted item during sexual activity. It is typical for a man to not reach orgasm as a receptive partner solely from anal sex.&lt;ref name="W. Ross"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael W. Ross|title=Psychopathology and Psychotherapy in Homosexuality|isbn =978-0866564991|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|year=1988|pages=49–50|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWN2-QpbvY8C&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McConaghy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel McConaghy|title=Sexual Behavior: Problems and Management|isbn=978-0306441776|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|year=1993|page=186|accessdate=March 25, 2018|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t31pR2FybjMC&amp;pg=PA186|quote=In homosexual relations, most men do not reach orgasm in receptive anal intercourse, and a number report not reaching orgasm by any method in many of their sexual relationships, which they nevertheless enjoy.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506053119/https://books.google.com/books?id=t31pR2FybjMC&amp;pg=PA186|archivedate=May 6, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enema]]s or anal [[douche]]s can, for hygienic reasons, be taken prior to anal masturbation if desired, but they can also be a form of anal masturbation themselves: see [[klismaphilia]].

Commonly inserted objects include butt plugs, anal beads, dildos, vibrators and fingers.

==Safety==
Insertion of foreign objects into the anus is not without dangers. This area is fragile, the intestinal walls do not feel pain and for objects pushed too far, surgery may be necessary for removal (even without injury). Unsafe anal masturbation methods cause harm and a potential trip to the hospital emergency room. However, anal masturbation can be carried out in greater safety by ensuring that the bowel is emptied before beginning, the anus and rectum are sufficiently lubricated and relaxed throughout, and the inserted object is not of too great a size.

===Objects===
[[Image:Buttplug.png|upright|thumb|Butt plugs often have a flared base and are free of seams.]]

Some anal stimulators are purposely ribbed or have a wave pattern in order to enhance pleasure and simulate intercourse. Stimulating the rectum with a rough-edged object or a finger (for the purposes of medically stimulating a bowel movement or other reasons) may lead to rectum wall tearing, especially if the fingernail is left untrimmed. Vegetables have rough edges and most have [[microorganism]]s on the surface, and thus could lead to infection if not sanitized before use.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Risks associated with bleeding===
Minor injuries that cause some bleeding to the rectum pose measurable risk, and often need treatment. Injury can be contained by cessation of anal stimulation at any sign of injury, bleeding, or pain. While minor bleeding may stop of its own accord, individuals with serious injury, clotting problems, or other medical factors could face serious risk and require medical attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Prolonged or heavy bleeding can indicate a life-threatening situation, as the intestinal wall can be damaged, leading to internal injury of the [[peritoneal cavity]] and [[peritonitis]], which can be fatal. Carefully using implements without sharp edges or rough surfaces carries a lower risk of damage to the intestinal wall.

The treatment for persistent or heavy bleeding will require a visit to an emergency room for a [[sigmoidoscopy]] and [[cauterization]] in order to prevent further loss of blood. Apart from the volume of blood that is lost into the rectum, other easily observable indications that medical intervention is urgently needed as a result of blood loss are an elevated heart rate, a general feeling of faintness or weakness, and a loss of pleasure from the act.

===Rectal foreign bodies===
{{see also|Rectal foreign body}}
Butt plugs normally have a flared base to prevent complete insertion and should be carefully sanitized before and after use. Sex toys, including objects for rectal insertion, should not be shared in order to minimize the risk of disease. Objects such as lightbulbs or anything breakable such as glass or wax candles cannot safely be used in anal masturbation, as they may break or shatter, causing highly dangerous medical situations.

Some objects can become lodged above the lower colon and could be seriously difficult to remove. Such foreign bodies should not be allowed to remain in place. Medical help should be sought if the object does not emerge on its own. Immediate assistance is recommended if the object is not a proper rectal toy, like a plug or something soft, for example if it is either too hard, too large, has projections, slightly sharp edges, or if any trace of injury happens (bleeding, pain, cramps). Small objects with dimensions similar to small stools are less likely to become lodged than medium-sized or large objects as they can usually be expelled by forcing a bowel movement. It is always safest if a graspable part of the object remains outside the body.

==Hygiene==
The biological function of the anus is to expel [[intestinal gas]] and [[feces]] from the body; therefore, when engaging in anal masturbation, hygiene is important. One may wish to cover butt plugs or other objects with a [[condom]] before insertion and then dispose of the condom afterwards. To minimize the potential transfer of germs between sexual partners, there are practices of [[safe sex]] recommended by healthcare professionals. Oral or vaginal infection may occur similarly to penile [[Ass to mouth|anus-to-mouth]] or [[anilingus]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Morin, Jack | title = Anal Pleasure and Health | edition = 3rd | publisher = Down There Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-940208-20-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzRpRcMQjkYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}

'''Andrew Newberg, M.D.''' is an American [[neuroscientist]] who is the Director of Research at the Myrna Brind Center for Integrative Medicine at [[Thomas Jefferson University Hospital]],&lt;ref name="Jefferson University Physician Profile"&gt;Jefferson University Physician Profile. "[http://hospitals.jefferson.edu/find-a-doctor/n/newberg-andrew-b/]",  [[Jefferson University Physician Profile]], 2016-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; an Adjunct Professor of [[Religious Studies]] and an Associate Professor of Radiology at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="University of Pennsylvania Staff/Faculty"&gt;Staff/Faculty. "[https://www.med.upenn.edu/stc/staff1.html]",  [[Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Staff/Faculty]], 2016-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been a prominent researcher in the field of [[nuclear medicine|nuclear medical]] [[brain imaging]] and [[neurotheology]]. In particular, his research has focused on the development of neurotransmitter tracers for the evaluation of [[Religion|religiosity]] as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders including [[clinical depression]], [[head injury]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[Parkinson's disease]].

His book Principles of Neurotheology gives a basic understanding on the research done so far on Neurotheology.

==Professional career==
Newberg graduated from [[Haverford College]] in 1988 with a degree in chemistry and then received his medical degree in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania. He then completed postgraduate training in [[Internal Medicine]] with a Residency at the Graduate Hospital from 1993 to 1996, and then did a Fellowship in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology from 1996 to 1998. He was certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1997 and certified in Nuclear Medicine by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine in 1998.

Because of his work in the intersection between religion and the brain, he has become an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 to 2010 he was also the Director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind.

==Academic research==
In the early 1990s, he began to research the intersection between the brain and [[Religious experience|religious and spiritual experiences]]. In this work, also sometimes referred to as “[[neurotheology]]”, Newberg described the possible neurophysiological mechanisms associated with religious and spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name="religionandbrain"&gt;Begley, Sharon. "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/79341/output/print Religion And The Brain]",  [[Newsweek]], 2001-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  His initial research included the use of functional brain imaging to study [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist meditators]]&lt;ref&gt;Newberg AB, Alavi A, Baime M, Pourdehnad M, Santanna J, d'Aquili EG.  The measurement of regional cerebral blood flow during the complex cognitive task of meditation: A preliminary SPECT study.  Psychiatry Research:  Neuroimaging 106: 113-122, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Franciscan]] [[nun]]s in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg A, Pourdehnad M, Alavi A, d’Aquili E. Cerebral blood flow during meditative prayer: Preliminary findings and methodological issues. Perceptual and Motor Skills 97: 625-630, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was eventually published in three books, ''The Mystical Mind'', ''Why God Won’t Go Away'', and ''Why We Believe What We Believe''.

Newberg's research has been featured in ''[[Newsweek]],'' the ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' and the ''[[New Scientist]].''  He has been a guest speaker at the Forum at Grace Cathedral&lt;ref name="NewbergHerzfeldForum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010506.shtml |title=God in Our Minds? |authors=Guests: Andrew Newberg, [[University of Pennsylvania Health System]] researcher in [[neurophysiology]], and Noreen Herzfeld, [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|St. John's University]] professor of [[theology]] and [[computer science]] |work=The Forum at [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]] |date=6 May 2001 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129171706/http://www.gracecathedral.org/enrichment/forum/for_20010506.shtml |archivedate=29 January 2008 }} (Includes [[RealAudio]] links).&lt;/ref&gt;  and appeared in the films ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' and ''[[Religulous]]''. He has continued to study religious and spiritual phenomena including topics related to forgiveness, meditation, prayer, spiritual development, morality, and belief.  This work has been incorporated more recently into a new Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;“New Center for Spirituality and the Mind at Penn Unites Intellectual Resources” Newswise (April 25, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary activities==
Newberg is the author of six books, and numerous articles on neuroimaging in neuropsychiatric disorders and also on [[neuroscience and religion]]. His book, ''Why God Won’t Go Away'', is a popularized account of this topic which describes some of the brain imaging studies and his theories regarding the nature of religious and spiritual experiences. ''Why We Believe What We Believe'', co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman (Executive MBA Faculty, Loyola Marymount University) describes the relationship between the brain and beliefs and also describes brain imaging studies of an [[atheist]] and individuals speaking in tongues (or [[glossolalia]]).&lt;ref&gt;“Tongues on the Mind”. Science (November 10, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent book, ''How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain'', also co-authored with Waldman, is a scientific and practical look at how faith and meditation can enhance brain function. Steering away from the topic of faith, his latest book, co-authored with Mark Waldman, ''Words Can Change Your Brain'' describes how a research-based communication practice, "compassionate communication", can be used to improve brain health and interpersonal communication. The book and communication strategies are now part of the NeuroLeadership course offered in the EMBA program at Loyola Marymount University. The communication strategies have been documented and published in the ''Journal of Executive Education''.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.kennesaw.edu/jee/vol11/iss1/3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{expand section|date=December 2015}}
Newberg’s research has been criticized from two main perspectives.{{non sequitur|date=July 2016}}  From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised that the study of practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena.&lt;ref name="religionandbrain"/&gt; However, Newberg tends to agree with this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for a better understanding of how human beings think and behave in a global context.

== History of the Concept ==

''Biofact'' was introduced as early as 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Biologisch, natürlich, nachhaltig. Philosophische Aspekte des Naturzugangs im 21. Jahrhundert.'' Tuebingen: A. Francke Publisher; chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; although her book ''Biofakte'' published in 2003 is commonly used as reference for the introduction of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis (Hg.), ''Biofakte. Versuch über den Menschen zwischen Artefakt und Lebewesen'', Mentis: Paderborn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karafyllis, the word '''biofact''' first appeared in a German article (entitled 'Biofakt und Artefakt') in 1943, written by the Austrian protozoologist Bruno M. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Maria Klein: Artefakt und Biofakt, in: Mikrokosmos 1943/44&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing both microscopy and philosophy, Klein named a [[Biofact (biology)|biofact]] something that is a visible dead product emerging from a living being while this being is still alive (e.g. a shell). However, Klein's distinction operated with the difference biotic/abiotic and dead/alive, not with nature/technology and growth/man-made. For her part, Karafyllis described biofact as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic concept]] that allows the comparison between nature and [[technology]] in the domain of the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Genetics &amp; Society: Mapping the New Genomic Era|last=Atkinson|first=Paul|last2=Glasner|first2=Peter|last3=Lock|first3=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=0203927389|location=Oxon|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly 

== Philosophy of the Concept ==

With the term ''biofact'', Karafyllis wants to emphasize that living entities can be highly artificial due to methods deriving from agriculture, gardening (e.g. breeding) or [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[genetic engineering]], [[cloning]]).  Biofacts show signatures of [[culture]] and technique.
Primarily, the concept aims to argue against the common philosophical tradition to summarize all kinds of living beings under the category [[nature]]. The concept ''biofact'' questions if the phenomenon of growth is and was a secure candidate for differentiating between nature and technology.

For the [[philosophy of technology]] the questions arise if a) biotechnology and [[agriculture]] should not be an integral part of ''reflexion'', thereby adding new insights to the common focus on the [[machine]] and the artifact, and if b) established concepts of technique and technology which stress artificiality should not be modified. Karafyllis regards the inclusion of biofacts into a theory of techniques as a chance, to reformulate classic concepts of [[design]] and [[construction]] for defining the making of artifacts. In her view, biofacts depend on the method of provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Karafyllis, N. C.: Provokation als Methode der biotechnischen Evolution, in: Volker Gerhardt, Klaus Lucas and Günter Stock (Eds.): ''Evolution. Theorie, Formen und Konsequenzen eines Paradigmas in Natur, Technik und Kultur''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[philosophy of nature]], biofacts highlight a need to clarify if nature is self-explanatory in every case. [[Biophilosophy]] is challenged to newly reflect upon the categories organism and [[living being]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schark: ''Lebewesen versus Dinge'', De Gruyter 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[philosophy of science]], approaches are challenged which only focus on the category thing (or epistemic thing) without historizing the technicality, mediality and materiality of its emerging as a living object. For the [[sociology of science]] the biofact concept is fruitful to discuss the exclusiveness of scientific knowledge (the role of the [[expert]]) while making scientific objects which are released into the [[lifeworld]] or public sphere.  Particularly because the biofact concept deals with the [[phenomenon]] of growth and the establishing of a [[self]], it is also influential in the philosophical disciplines phenomenology, [[anthropology]] and [[ontology]]. It was [[Jürgen Habermas]] who recently stressed the anthropological consequences if mankind gives up the differentiation of "coming into being" and "making".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas: ''Die Zukunft der menschlichen Natur'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts are artificial, i.e. man-made objects. Contrary to biofacts, they cannot be found in nature. Therefore, biofacts demarcate an ontological intersection. They are partially man-made, but growing. Like artifacts, they have been made for a certain [[utility]]. Biofacts can be seen as biotic artifacts which show their character as hybrids in multifold perspectives.

The term is also enabling philosophers to criticize some concepts in [[technoscience]], where the union of scientific knowledge about nature and the technical creation of technonature is seen as progress in the political sense.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bruno Latour: ''Politics of Natur. How to bring the Sciences into Democracy'', Harvard University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted in the new [[BioArt]], not rarely without using its critical impacts.

As Karafyllis complemented the growth and reproduction of organisms with technical entities, she established a typology of different kinds of organisms according to their uses and these are:

* Natural life form
* Unaltered biofacts
* Reshaped biofacts
* Genetically reproduced biofacts
* Genetically modified biofacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology: Metaphors, Worldviews, Ethics, and Law|last=Boldt|first=Joachim|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783658109875|location=Wiesbaden|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Philosophy of Science''' is an academic center located at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] dedicated to research in the [[philosophy of science]]. The Center was founded by [[Adolf Grünbaum]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Philosophy at Pitt: Three Sites of Inquiry|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/philosophy-pitt-three-sites-inquiry|publisher=Pitt Chronicle|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Director of the Center is [http://www.edouardmachery.com/ Edouard Machery].

==History==
[[File:PhilofSciOfficePitt.jpg|thumb|right|Home of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Philosophy of Science on the eighth floor of the [[Cathedral of Learning]]]]
Throughout its history, the Center has been associated with a number of notable individuals from philosophy of science, including nearly 300 visiting professors from more than 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Philosophy at Pitt: Three Sites of Inquiry|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/philosophy-pitt-three-sites-inquiry|publisher=Pitt Chronicle|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center's inaugural Annual Lecture Series included lectures from the noted philosophers [[Paul K. Feyerabend]], [[Adolf Grünbaum]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Michael Scriven]], and [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. Later Annual Lecture Series participants include [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Philip Morrison]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[George Wald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=a brief history|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/history/history_1.htm|publisher=Center for Philosophy of Science|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nobel Prize]]–winning economist [[Alvin E. Roth]] once served as a fellow in the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/12289/1269336-298.stm | title=Professor with Pitt ties wins Nobel economics prize | first=Eleanor | last=Chute | newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=2012-10-15 | accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Currently, the Center hosts the Visiting Fellows Program, the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, the Senior Visiting Fellows program, and the Annual Lecture Series. Additionally, every four years the Center hosts the International Fellows Conference for current and former fellows. In conjunction with the [[Hillman_Library#University Library System| University Library System]], the Center created and operates philsci-archive.pitt.edu, a preprint server for professional work in philosophy of science. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy at Pitt: Three Sites of Inquiry|url=http://www.chronicle.pitt.edu/story/philosophy-pitt-three-sites-inquiry|publisher=Pitt Chronicle|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has international partnerships with the [[University of Konstanz]], the [[University of Athens]], the [[National Technical University of Athens]], the [[University of A Coruña]], the [[University of Catania]], and [[Tsinghua University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/international_partnerships/international_partnerships.htm Center for Philosophy of Science ::: international partnerships&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, John D. Norton stepped down after a ten year tenure as the Director of the Center. The current Director is Edouard Machery.

'''[[Climate change mitigation]] scenarios''' are possible futures in which [[global warming]] is reduced by deliberate actions, such as a comprehensive switch to [[alternative energy|energy sources other than fossil fuels]].  A typical mitigation scenario is constructed by selecting a long-range target, such as a desired atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and then fitting the actions to the target, for example by placing a cap on net global and national emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.

An increase of global temperature by more than 2{{nbsp}}[[°C]] has come to be the majority definition of what would constitute intolerably dangerous [[climate change]] with efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5{{nbsp}}°C above pre-industrial levels per the [[Paris Agreement]].   Some climate scientists are increasingly of the opinion that the goal should be a complete restoration of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]'s preindustrial condition, on the grounds that too protracted a [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from those conditions will produce irreversible changes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ==

{{Importance section|reason=Target levels of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are a '''target''' of mitigation, not a "mitigation scenario" or related to one.|date=March 2012}}
Contributions to climate change, whether they cool or warm the [[Earth]], are often described in terms of the [[radiative forcing]] or imbalance they introduce to the planet's [[energy budget]]. Now and in the future, [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] carbon dioxide is believed to be the major component of this forcing, and the contribution of other components is often quantified in terms of "parts-per-million CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent" ([[Parts per million|ppm]] [[CO2e|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e]]), or the increment/decrement in carbon dioxide concentrations which would create a radiative forcing of the same magnitude.

At present, non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributions to climate change, positive and negative, are believed to roughly cancel out, so that the net radiative forcing being experienced at present, expressed in ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-e, is more or less the same as the actual current level of carbon dioxide (406.75 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as of December 2017). To some extent this legitimates the statement of targets just in terms of ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as is usually the case. However, the positive and negative non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will not necessarily balance in future, and so a target stated in terms of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e is less ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Stabilization wedges ===

A '''[[Climate stabilization wedge|stabilization wedge]]''' (or simply "wedge") is an action which incrementally reduces projected emissions. The name is derived from the triangular shape of the gap between reduced and unreduced emissions trajectories when graphed over time. For example, a reduction in electricity demand due to increased efficiency means that less electricity needs to be generated and thus fewer emissions need to be produced. The term originates in the [[Stabilization Wedge Game]]. As a reference unit, a stabilization wedge is equal to the following examples of mitigation initiatives: deployment of two million 1 MW [[Wind turbine|wind turbines]]; completely halting the [[deforestation]] and planting of 300 million hectares of trees; the increase in the average energy efficiency of all the world's buildings by 25 percent; or the installation of [[carbon capture and storage]] facilities in 800 large coal-fired power plants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Guide to Climate Change|last=Dawson|first=Brian|last2=Spannagle|first2=Matt|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=0415477891|location=Oxon|pages=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacala and Socolow proposed in their work, ''Stabilization Wedges'', that seven wedges are required to be delivered by 2050 - at current technologies - to make a significant impact on the mitigation of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pacala|first=S.|last2=Socolow|first2=R.|date=2004-08-13|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|journal=Science|language=en|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15310891}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, sources that estimate the need for 14 wedges because Pacala and Socolow's proposal would only stabilize carbon dioxide emissions at current levels but not the atmospheric concentration, which is increasing by more than 2 ppm/year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2011, Socolow revised their earlier estimate to nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebulletin.org/2011/09/wedges-reaffirmed/|title=Wedges reaffirmed - Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|last=Socolow|first=Robert|date=September 27, 2011|work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 350 ppm ===

This is the target level advocated in a 2008 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0804.1126|title=Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?|first1=J.|last1=Hansen|first2=M.|last2=Sato|first3=P.|last3=Kharecha|first4=D.|last4=Beerling|first5=R.|last5=Berner|first6=V.|last6=Masson-Delmotte|first7=M.|last7=Pagani|first8=M.|last8=Raymo|first9=D.

A mitigation scenario modeled by Malte Meinshausen ''et al.'' suggested in 2006 that to stabilize CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 350 ppm, we would have needed to reduce emissions by slightly more than 5%  per year.&lt;ref name="multigas"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Meinshausen | first1 = M. | last2 = Hare | first2 = B. | last3 = Wigley | first3 = T.

From an "energy technology and policy perspective", [[Joe Romm]] says a 350-ppm target will require eight wedges, each saving 1 gigaton of carbon per year, by 2030, and another ten by 2060.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/2008/11/23/an-open-letter-to-james-hansen-on-the-real-truth-about-stabilizing-at-350-ppm/|title=An open letter to James Hansen on the real truth about stabilizing at 350 ppm|author=|date=|website=climateprogress.org|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern]] of the [[Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change]], called the  "world’s top climate economist", endorses 350 ppm as “a very sensible long-term target.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climateprogress.org/2009/09/09/nicholas-stern-worlds-top-climate-economist-endorses-350-ppm-long-term-target/|title=Nicholas Stern, world’s top climate economist, endorses 350 ppm as "a very sensible long-term target."|author=|date=|website=climateprogress.org|accessdate=12 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118134131/http://climateprogress.org/2009/09/09/nicholas-stern-worlds-top-climate-economist-endorses-350-ppm-long-term-target/|archive-date=2010-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 report, [[Johan Rockström]] states 350 ppm is one of the [[planetary boundaries]] for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name="Rockström a"&gt;[[Johan Rockström|Rockström J]], [[William L.

DeCanio]], [[Eban Goodstein]], Richard B. Howarth, [[Richard B. Norgaard]] and  Catherine S. Norman, stressing " the need for immediate, direct intervention".

[[Blue Ocean Institute]] authors Marah J. Hardt and [[Carl Safina]] support 350 ppm as the maximum upper limit of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for [[marine life]] [[health]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific American]] August 2010 [[ocean acidification]] article [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=threatening-ocean-life Threatening Oceans from the Inside Out: How Acidification Affects Marine Life] page 72 in print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 450 ppm ===

The BLUE scenarios in the IEA's [[Energy Technology Perspectives]] publication of 2008 describe pathways to a long-range concentration of 450 ppm. [[Joseph Romm]] has sketched how to achieve this target through the application of 14 wedges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://climateprogress.org/2008/04/22/is-450-ppm-or-less-politically-possible-part-2-the-solution/ Is 450 ppm (or less) politically possible? Part 2: The Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;

''World Energy Outlook 2008'', mentioned above, also describes a "450 Policy Scenario", in which extra energy investments to 2030 amount to [[United States dollar|$]]9.3 trillion over the Reference Scenario. The scenario also features, after 2020, the participation of major economies such as [[PRC|China]] and [[India]] in a global cap-and-trade scheme initially operating in [[OECD]] and [[European Union]] countries. Also the less conservative 450 ppm scenario calls for extensive deployment of [[negative carbon dioxide emission|negative emissions]], i.e. the removal of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. According to the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) and OECD, "Achieving lower concentration targets (450 ppm) depends significantly on the use of [[BECCS]]".&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;{{cite web

  |year=2011
  |accessdate=2012-01-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 550 ppm ===

This is the target advocated (as an upper bound) in the [[Stern Review]]. As approximately a doubling of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels relative to [[industrial society|preindustrial]] times, it implies a temperature increase of about three degrees, according to conventional estimates of [[climate sensitivity]]. [[Mitigation of global warming#Pacala and Socolow|Pacala and Socolow]] list 15 "wedges", any 7 of which in combination should suffice to keep CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels below 550 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/968|title=Stabilization Wedges: Solving the Climate Problem for the Next 50 Years with Current Technologies|first1=S.|last1=Pacala|first2=R.|last2=Socolow|date=13 August 2004|publisher=|journal=Science|volume=305|issue=5686|pages=968–972|accessdate=12 April 2018|via=www.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.1100103|pmid=15310891|bibcode=2004Sci...305..968P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]]'s [[World Energy Outlook]] report for 2008 describes a "Reference Scenario" for the world's energy future "which assumes no new government policies beyond those already adopted by mid-2008", and then a "550 Policy Scenario" in which further policies are adopted, a mixture of "[[cap-and-trade]] systems,  [[economic sector|sectoral]] agreements and national measures". In the Reference Scenario, between 2006 and 2030 the world invests $26.3 trillion in energy-supply infrastructure; in the 550 Policy Scenario, a further $4.1 trillion is spent in this period, mostly on [[efficient energy use|efficiency]] increases which deliver fuel cost savings of over $7 trillion.&lt;ref name="weo08"&gt;http://www.iea.org/weo/docs/weo2008/fact_sheets_08.pdf [[World Energy Outlook]] 2008 Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other greenhouse gases ==

Greenhouse gas concentrations are aggregated in terms of [[Carbon dioxide equivalent#Equivalent carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide equivalent]]. Some multi-gas mitigation scenarios have been modeled by Meinshausen ''et al.''&lt;ref name="multigas" /&gt;

=== As a short-term focus ===

In a 2000 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first2=Makiko|last2=Sato|first3=Reto|last3=Ruedy|first4=Andrew|last4=Lacis|first5=Valdar|last5=Oinas|date=29 August 2000|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=97|issue=18|pages=9875–9880|bibcode=2000PNAS...97.9875H|doi=10.1073/pnas.170278997|doi-access=free|pmc=27611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen argued that the 0.75{{nbsp}}°C{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} rise in average global temperatures over the last 100 years has been driven mainly by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, since warming due to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; had been offset by cooling due to [[aerosols]], implying the viability of a strategy initially based around reducing emissions of non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gases and of [[black carbon]], focusing on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; only in the longer run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ucsusa.wsm.ga3.org/ssi/archive/ucs-review-for-alternative-scenario.html Review of Hansen et al.: Global Warming in the Twenty-First Century: An Alternative Scenario]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was also argued by [[Veerabhadran Ramanathan]] and Jessica Seddon Wallack the September/October 2009 [[Foreign Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65238/jessica-seddon-wallack-and-veerabhadran-ramanathan/the-other-climate-changers Why Black Carbon and Ozone Also Matter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2595">In [[mathematics]], '''computational group theory''' is the study of
[[group (mathematics)|group]]s by means of computers. It is concerned
with designing and analysing [[algorithm]]s and
[[data structure]]s to compute information about groups. The subject
has attracted interest because for many interesting groups
(including most of the [[sporadic groups]]) it is impractical
to perform calculations by hand.

Important algorithms in computational group theory include:
* the [[Schreier–Sims algorithm]] for finding the order of a [[permutation group]]
* the [[Todd–Coxeter algorithm]] and [[Knuth–Bendix algorithm]] for [[coset enumeration]]
* the [[product-replacement algorithm]] for finding random elements of a group

Two important [[computer algebra system]]s (CAS) used for group theory are
[[GAP computer algebra system|GAP]] and [[Magma computer algebra system|Magma]]. Historically, other systems such as CAS (for [[character theory]]) and [[Cayley computer algebra system|Cayley]] (a predecessor of Magma) were important.

Some achievements of the field include:
* complete enumeration of [[List of small groups|all finite groups of order less than 2000]]
* computation of representations for all the [[sporadic groups]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8235">'''Cytotoxicity''' is the quality of being [[toxicity|toxic]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Examples of toxic agents are an [[immune cell]] or some types of [[venom]], e.g. from the [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]] (''Bitis arietans'') or [[brown recluse spider]] (''Loxosceles reclusa'').

==Cell physiology==
Treating cells with the cytotoxic compound can result in a variety of cell fates. The cells may undergo [[necrosis]], in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly as a result of [[cell lysis]]. The cells can stop actively growing and dividing (a decrease in cell viability), or the cells can activate a genetic program of controlled cell death ([[apoptosis]]).

Cells undergoing necrosis typically exhibit rapid swelling, lose membrane integrity, shut down metabolism and release their contents into the environment. Cells that undergo rapid necrosis in vitro do not have sufficient time or energy to activate apoptotic machinery and will not express apoptotic markers. Apoptosis is characterized by well defined cytological and molecular events including a change in the [[refractive index]] of the cell, cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation and cleavage of DNA into regularly sized fragments. Cells in culture that are undergoing apoptosis eventually undergo secondary necrosis. They will shut down metabolism, lose membrane integrity and lyse.&lt;ref name=riss1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riss TL, Moravec RA |title=Use of multiple assay endpoints to investigate the effects of incubation time, dose of toxin, and plating density in cell-based cytotoxicity assays |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |date=February 2004 |pmid=15090210 |doi=10.1089/154065804322966315 |url=|last2=Moravec }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

Cytotoxicity assays are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries. Researchers can either look for cytotoxic compounds, if they are interested in developing a therapeutic that targets rapidly dividing cancer cells, for instance; or they can screen "hits" from initial high-throughput drug screens for unwanted cytotoxic effects before investing in their development as a pharmaceutical.

Assessing cell membrane integrity is one of the most common ways to measure cell viability and cytotoxic effects. Compounds that have cytotoxic effects often compromise cell membrane integrity. Vital dyes, such as [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] are normally excluded from the inside of healthy cells; however, if the cell membrane has been compromised, they freely cross the membrane and stain intracellular components.&lt;ref name="riss1"/&gt; Alternatively, membrane integrity can be assessed by monitoring the passage of substances that are normally sequestered inside cells to the outside. One molecule, [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), is commonly measured using [[LDH assay]]. LDH reduces NAD to NADH which elicits a colour change by interaction with a specific probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Decker T, Lohmann-Matthes ML |title=A quick and simple method for the quantitation of lactate dehydrogenase release in measurements of cellular cytotoxicity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity |journal=J. Immunol. Methods |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=61–9 |date=November 1988 |pmid=3192948 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1759(88)90310-9|url=|last2=Lohmann-Matthes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protease biomarkers have been identified that allow researchers to measure relative numbers of live and dead cells within the same cell population. The live-cell protease is only active in cells that have a healthy cell membrane, and loses activity once the cell is compromised and the protease is exposed to the external environment. The dead-cell protease cannot cross the cell membrane, and can only be measured in culture media after cells have lost their membrane integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niles AL, Moravec RA, Eric Hesselberth P, Scurria MA, Daily WJ, Riss TL  |title=A homogeneous assay to measure live and dead cells in the same sample by detecting different protease markers |journal=Anal. Biochem. |volume=366 |issue=2 |pages=197–206 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17512890 |doi=10.1016/j.ab.2007.04.007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxicity can also be monitored using the 3-(4, 5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide ([[MTT assay|MTT]]) or with 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT), which yields a water-soluble product, or the MTS assay. This assay measures the reducing potential of the cell using a colorimetric reaction. Viable cells will reduce the MTS reagent to a colored [[formazan]] product. A similar redox-based assay has also been developed using the fluorescent dye, [[resazurin]]. In addition to using dyes to indicate the redox potential of cells in order to monitor their viability, researchers have developed assays that use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] content as a marker of viability.&lt;ref name=riss1/&gt; Such ATP-based assays include bioluminescent assays in which ATP is the limiting reagent for the [[luciferase]] reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fan F, Wood KV |title=Bioluminescent assays for high-throughput screening |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=127–36 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17355205 |doi=10.1089/adt.2006.053 |url=|last2=Wood }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxicity can also be measured by the [[sulforhodamine B]] (SRB) assay, WST assay and [[clonogenic assay]].

Suitable assays can be combined and performed sequentially on the same cells in order to reduce assay-specific false positive or false negative results. A possible combination is LDH-XTT-NR (Neutral red assay)-SRB  which is also available in a kit format.

A label-free approach to follow the cytotoxic response of adherent animal cells in real-time is based on electric impedance measurements when the cells are grown on gold-film electrodes. This technology is referred to as [[electric cell-substrate impedance sensing]] (ECIS). Label-free real-time techniques provide the kinetics of the cytotoxic response rather than just a snapshot like many colorimetric endpoint assays.

==Prediction==
A highly important topic is the prediction of cytotoxicity of chemical compounds based on 
previous measurements, i.e. in-silico testing.&lt;ref name="Reisfeld2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 13677480| year = 2003| author1 = Dearden| first1 = J. C.| title = In silico prediction of drug toxicity| journal = Journal of computer-aided molecular design| volume = 17| issue = 2–4| pages = 119–27| doi=10.1023/A:1025361621494}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For this purpose many
[[QSAR]] and [[virtual screening]] methods have been suggested. An independent comparison
of these methods has been done within the "Toxicology in the 21st century" project.&lt;ref name="TOX21"&gt;"Toxicology in the 21st century Data Challenge" https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/leaderboard.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cancer==
[[Chemotherapy]] as a treatment of [[cancer]] often relies on the ability of cytotoxic agents to kill or damage cells which are reproducing; this preferentially targets rapidly dividing cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Ramin Zibaseresht, Photoactivated Cytotoxins, University of Canterbury, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemotherapy Principles|url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002995-pdf.pdf|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immune system==

''[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]'' (''ADCC'') describes the cell-killing ability of certain [[lymphocyte]]s, which requires the target cell being marked by an [[antibody]]. ''Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity'', on the other hand, does not have to be mediated by antibodies; nor does ''[[complement-dependent cytotoxicity]]'' (''CDC''), which is mediated by the [[complement system]].

Three groups of cytotoxic [[lymphocyte]]s are distinguished:
* [[Cytotoxic T cell]]s
* [[Natural killer cell]]s
* [[Natural killer T cell]]s

[[File:Root digging stick at Rocky Reach Dam Museum 2.jpg|alt=|thumb|A digging stick]]
In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], a '''digging stick''', or sometimes '''yam stick''', is a wooden implement used primarily by [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence-based]] cultures to dig out underground food such as roots and tubers or [[burrowing animals]] and anthills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/digging-stick The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Retrieved July 24, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The stick may also have other uses in hunting or general domestic tasks.

They are common to the [[Indigenous Australians]] but also other peoples worldwide. The tool normally consists of little more than a sturdy stick which has been shaped or sharpened and perhaps hardened by being placed temporarily in a fire. Fashioned with handles for pulling or pushing, it forms a prehistoric [[plow]], and is also a precursor of most modern agricultural handtools.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. Retrieved March 26, 2015, from Britannica.com website: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/163245/digging-stick&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a simple [[tool|device]], and has to be tough and hardy in order not to break.

== By region ==

=== Mexico and the Mesoamerican region ===
In Mexico and the [[Mesoamerican region]], the digging stick was the most important agricultural tool throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;tab=two&amp;typ=reg&amp;id=377 Study the Digging Stick] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/index.php?one=azt&amp;two=art&amp;id=320&amp;typ=reg Uictli] Mexicolore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''coa'' stick normally flares out into a triangle at the end and is used for cultivating maize. It is still used for agriculture in some indigenous communities, with some newer 20th-century versions having the addition of a little metal tip.

Other digging sticks, according to Native Americans of the Columbia Plateau, have been used since time immemorial to gather edible roots like balsamroot, bitterroot, camas, and varieties of biscuitroot. Typical digging sticks were and are still about 2 to 3 feet in length, usually slightly arched, with the bottom tip shaved off at an angle. A 5 to 8 inch cross-piece made of antler, bone, or wood was fitted perpendicularly over the top of the stick, allowing the use of two hands to drive the tool into the ground. Since contact with the Europeans in the 19th century, Native Americans have also adapted the use of a metal in making digging sticks.

=== Ethiopia and the Harar region ===

The most common digging stick found in [[Ethiopia]] is the ''ankassay'' in [[Amharic]], a [[Semitic language]] spoken in [[Ethiopia]] and the second-most spoken Semitic language in the world. The ''ankassay'' is a single shaft that is about 4–5 feet in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip.&lt;ref name="Simoons"&gt;Simoons, Frederick J. "The Forked Digging Stick of the Gurage", "[[Zeitschrift für Ethnologie]]", Berlin, Retrieved February 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other digging sticks are unique to the Harar region located in East-Central [[Ethiopia]], which are considered to be unusual due to their function beyond the basic use of other digging sticks, and the use of one as a plow.

The ''deungora'' is a particularly long digging stick is about 110 centimeters, or approximately 3.6 feet, in length with a socket-hafted pointed iron blade as the tip. What's unique about this digging stick is that a bored stone, about 15 centimeters in diameter, is attached at the opposing end. This stone shares the same form as other bored stones that have been discovered in archaeological sites in [[Africa]].&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

''Maresha'' is the [[Gurage]] name, also the same word used by the [[Amhara people|Amhara]], for a digging stick that differs in construction because of its forked form. It is used primarily to dig holes for construction, planting, and harvesting roots and tubers. This tool is used as a plow to turn over the soil of an entire field before planting. It is used to break clods of soil in areas where the soil is hard or in areas that may be too steep for plowing, and to dig holes for construction or to transplant domestic plants. When compared to the ''ankassay'', this digging stick can perform the same duties and in addition can be used as a hoe.&lt;ref name="Simoons"/&gt;

=== East-Central New Guinea ===

The Kuman people of this region were horticulturists who used basic tools such as the digging stick, wooden hoe, and wooden spade in their daily lives. Eventually they started to use more sophisticated tools such as iron spades and pick-axes.&lt;ref name="Nilles"&gt;Nilles, John. "The Kuman people: A study of cultural change in a primitive society in the Central Highlands of New Guinea." Oceania (1953): 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main types of digging sticks both shared a similar shape but differed in size:

* A larger and heavier digging stick with a diameter of about 4 centimeters and 2 meters in length, used for the purpose of turning over the soil surface for new gardens
* A smaller and lighter digging stick with a diameter of about 2 centimeters and 1 meter (or less) in length, mainly used for basic horticulture tasks&lt;ref name="Nilles"/&gt;

The current official goal of the Marine Laboratory is to study marine [[environmental systems]] and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] utilizing the resources of the facility's proximity to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/DukeMarineLab|title=Description of Duke Marine Lab (@DukeMarineLab) {{!}} Twitter|last=|first=|date=|website=twitter.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a member of the National Association of Marine Laboratories&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the Marine Sciences Education Consortium.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/biology/undergrad-dukeuniversity.shtml|title=Duke University &gt; Biological Sciences &gt; Marquette University|website=www.marquette.edu|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The main campus of Duke University is not in close proximity to the ocean, but with the Marine Laboratory campus, the University is able to conduct hands-own oceanographic studies.

The site for the laboratory was selected  in the early 1930s, with the first building completed by 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://today.duke.edu/2013/10/archivesmarinelab|title=From the Archives: Marine Lab 'Then and Now'|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original intention of the facility was to be a summer training facility and research facility for the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.duke.edu/rubenstein/findingaids/uansoe/|title=Guide to the Nicholas School of the Environment Records, 1916-ongoing|website=David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1963, the facility had reached national recognition for its resources. At the time 75% of students and 40% of researchers came from other universities than Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bookhout|first=C.G.|date=1963|title=DUKE UNIVERSITY MARINE LABORATORY|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article-pdf/3/3/270/5936741/3-3-270.pdf|journal=Marine Laboratories|volume=|pages=270-272|via=OUP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sylvia Earle]], a renowned oceanographer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/last-dive-funding-human-expeditions-ocean-may-have-run-aground-63201|title=The Last Dive?|date=2013-01-14|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneer of [[Jacques Cousteau]]'s AquaLung [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] device, received her M.S. and Ph.D. from [[Duke University|Duke]] in 1956 and 1966, and has a connection to the Marine Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gradschool.duke.edu/about/news/sylvia-earle-face-marine-biology-receives-distinguished-alumni-award|title=Sylvia Earle, “Face of Marine Biology,” Receives Distinguished Alumni Award {{!}} Duke Graduate School|website=gradschool.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the laboratory assumed much of the research of [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s West Indies Laboratory for Underwater Research in [[Saint Croix|St. Croix]], [[Virgin Islands]] after [[Hurricane Hugo]] damaged the St. Croix facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/02/us/education-year-of-classes-canceled-at-marine-lab.html|title=EDUCATION;   Year of Classes Canceled at Marine Lab|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/20/us/education-fairleigh-dickinson-closing-laboratory-on-virgin-islands.html|title=EDUCATION;   Fairleigh Dickinson Closing Laboratory On Virgin Islands|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cindy Lee Van Dover]] was named the first female-director of the center in 2007. She has initially worked at the laboratory in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/16/science/16conv.html|title=Deep in the Sea, Imagining the Cradle of Life on Earth|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2017, the Marine Laboratory participated in a green-illumination protest with other buildings at [[Duke University|Duke]] in support of the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Accords]] along with similar actions at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/education/article154448114.html|title=Duke’s environment school joins list of buildings being lit green|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4899">'''Half maximal effective concentration''' ('''EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''') refers to the concentration of a drug, antibody or toxicant which induces a response halfway between the baseline and maximum after a specified exposure time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graphpad.com/curvefit/introduction89.htm Introducing dose response curves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219185355/http://www.graphpad.com/curvefit/introduction89.htm |date=2007-02-19 }}, Graphpad Software&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly used as a measure of a drug's potency. EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in [[Molar concentration|molar units]] (M), where 1&amp;nbsp;M is equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;[[Mole (unit)|mol]]/[[Liter|L]].

The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of a ''graded'' [[dose response curve]] therefore represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of its maximal effect is observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-E/EC50.html EC50 definition]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of a ''quantal'' dose response curve represents the concentration of a compound where 50% of the population exhibit a response,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/190116.htm definition of EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for quantal dose response curve]&lt;/ref&gt; after a specified exposure duration.

It is also related to [[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] which is a measure of a compound's inhibition (50% inhibition).  For competition binding assays and functional antagonist assays [[IC50|IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the most common summary measure of the dose-response curve.  For agonist/stimulator assays the most common summary measure is the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html Assay Operations for SAR Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129102848/http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html |date=2006-11-29 }} NIH Chemical Genomics Center&lt;/ref&gt; The half maximal effective concentration is sometimes also expressed as &lt;!-- pEC50 redirects here - the following term is bolded per MOS:BOLD --&gt;'''pEC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;''' instead of EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, where:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\ce{pEC50} = -\log_{10} (\ce{EC50}) &lt;/math&gt;

A small change in [[ligand]] concentration typically results in rapid changes in response in the biological system, following a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]]al function. The [[inflection point]] at which the increase in response with increasing ligand concentration begins to slow is the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, which can be mathematically determined by derivation of the best-fit line. While relying on a graph for estimation is more convenient, this typical method yields less accurate results and less precise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html Assay Operations for SAR Support] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129102848/http://www.ncgc.nih.gov/guidance/section3.html |date=2006-11-29 }} NIH Chemical Genomics Center&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equation ==
Many different equations can be used to derive an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;. One possible function is:

:&lt;math chem&gt;Y = (\ce{Bottom}) + \frac\ce{(Top) - (Bottom)}{1 + \left(\frac\ce{X}\ce{EC50}\right)^{-(\text{Hill coefficient})} }&lt;/math&gt;

where Y is the observed value, Bottom is the lowest observed value, Top is the highest observed value, and the [[Hill coefficient]] gives the largest absolute value of the slope of the curve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaplot.com/products/sigmaplot/Standard_Curves_Analysis.pdf EC50 equation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417121807/http://www.sigmaplot.com/products/sigmaplot/Standard_Curves_Analysis.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }} - see page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

The effects of a stressor or drug generally depend on the exposure time. Therefore, the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (and similar statistics) will be a function of exposure time. The exact shape of this time function will depend upon the stressor (e.g., the specific toxicant), its mechanism of action, the organism exposed, etc. This time dependency hampers the comparison of [[Potency (pharmacology)|potency]] or [[toxicity]] between compounds and between different organisms.

'''Engineering education research (EER)''' is the field of inquiry that creates knowledge which aims to define, inform, and improve the education of engineers. It achieves this through research on topics such as: epistemology, policy, assessment, pedagogy, diversity, amongst others, as they pertain to engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nazempour |first1=Arshan |title=Assessments of Ultra-Low-Cost Venturi Nozzle in Undergraduate Engineering Classes |journal=American Society For Engineering Education |date=2015 |url=https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/56/papers/12706/view |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052137/https://www.asee.org/public/conferences/56/papers/12706/view |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==

Engineering education research gained visibility during the 1980s, although the formal education of engineers in the [[United States]] traces back to as early as 1802, with the establishment of the United States Military Academy at West Point for the purpose of training the U.S. Army's corps of engineers.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, D. F. (1979). America by design: Science, technology, and the rise of corporate capitalism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Terry S. (1992). "The Education of Engineers in America Before the Morrill Act of 1862," History of Education Quarterly, 32 (Winter): 459-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rensselaer School (now Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) was founded in 1824 and conferred degrees in civil engineering upon four students in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education. (1930). "Report of the Investigation of Engineering Education 1923-1929." Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spurred by concerns of national competitiveness and the insufficient number of graduating engineers&lt;ref&gt;A Nation at Risk (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; the Neal Report called for research to improve teaching and learning in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields.&lt;ref&gt;Neal Report (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to other disciplines, the 1990s brought a focus on the scholarship of teaching as demonstrated by the 1995 NRC Report,&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council Board on Engineering Education. 1995. Engineering education: Designing an adaptive system. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; "Engineering education: Designing an adaptive system", influenced by Ernst Boyer.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, E.L. 1990. Scholarship reconsidered: Priorities of the professoriate. Princeton, NJ: Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus was primarily motivated by the need to improve the quality of engineers produced by universities in the US. Additionally, 1993 marked the relaunch of the ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'', which served as a clearinghouse for scholarly research.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brent K. Jesiek |author2=Lynita K. Newswander |author3=Maura Borrego |last-author-amp=yes |year=2009 |title=Engineering education research: discipline, community, or field? |journal=[[Journal of Engineering Education]] |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=39–52 |doi=10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01004.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As concerns regarding globalization and the need for innovation increased during the late 1990s and 2000s, engineering education research was influenced by calls of reform to produce the quantity and diversity of engineers needed to address global problems.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"/&gt;

Continuing the development of the field, centers for engineering education research emerged in the early 2000s. The NAE formed a Committee on Engineering Education (CEE) in 1999, NAE’s Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE) was established in 2002 and the Center for the Advancement of Engineering in 2003.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"/&gt;

During the mid-2000s, dedicated funding, specialized publications, centers for research, academic preparation and conferences which connected the distributed community supplied the infrastructure necessary for the burgeoning field of research.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2009"/&gt;

== Core research areas ==

The 2006 Report of the Steering Committee of the National Engineering Education Research Colloquies outlined the 5 key topic areas of engineering education research as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Colloquies. (2006). The Research Agenda for the New Discipline of Engineering Education. ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'' (October), 259-261.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Engineering Epistemologies: Research on what constitutes engineering thinking and knowledge within [[social context]]s now and into the future
# Engineering Learning Mechanisms: Research on engineering learners’ developing knowledge and competencies in context.
# Engineering Learning Systems: Research on the [[instructional culture]], [[institutional infrastructure]], and [[epistemology]] of engineering educators.
# Engineering Diversity and Inclusiveness:  Research on how diverse human talents contribute solutions to the social and global challenges and relevance of our [the engineering] profession.
# Engineering Assessment:  Research on, and the development of, assessment methods, instruments, and metrics to inform [[engineering education]] practice and learning.

== Other research areas ==

=== Globalization ===
According to Borrego and Bernhard,&lt;ref name="Borrego_Bernhard"&gt;Borrego, M., &amp; Bernhard, J. (2011) "The emergence of engineering education research as an internationally connected field of inquiry." ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]''. 100 (1): 14–47.&lt;/ref&gt; international collaborations are developing in an effort to create global competencies in engineering students. Engineering global competency is the possession of "the knowledge, ability, and predisposition to work effectively with people who define and solve problems differently than they do." &lt;ref&gt;Downey et al., "The Globally Competent Engineer: Working Effectively with People Who Define Problems Differently," ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Educational programs that emphasize global engineering competencies research the development and assessment of global competency within the engineering practice.&lt;ref&gt;https://engineering.purdue.edu/GEP&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://globalhub.org/resources/4427/download/GE3_April_2011_bkj_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of programs in global engineering competency include:
*The Global Engineering Program at Purdue University
*[[Erasmus mundus]] (student centric global program)&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/external-relation-programmes/doc72_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

R&amp;D departments in transnational companies also contribute to international educational research.

===Global engineering cultures===

In 2008, a project titled "The Engineering Cultures Multimedia Project" was approved by the NSF. It was done by combine effort of "Virginia Tech and Colorado School of Mines to produce CD-based modules exploring how what counts as an engineer and engineering knowledge varies from country to country". https://globalhub.org/topics/AboutEngineeringCultures
The main goal of this project was "To develop, disseminate, and assess learning experiences that will help students to identify, understand, and value perspectives other than their own."&lt;ref&gt;https://globalhub.org/topics/EngineeringCultures&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-college engineering education ===

Studies indicate that engineers will be better prepared for rigorous study in the engineering sciences if exposed to engineering concepts in the years prior to university study.  The following resources have been listed to provide primary- and secondary-level educators with information and online programs that will aide them in bringing engineering material to their classrooms.

== Methodology ==
“Rigorous” research in engineering education is defined as adherence to the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]’s six guiding principles for [[scientific inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;Borrego, M. (2007). "Conceptual difficulties experienced by trained engineers learning educational research methods." ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]''. 96(2): 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The six guiding principles for scientific inquiry are:&lt;ref&gt;Shavelson, R., and L. Towne, Scientific Research in Education, Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, 2002. Scientific Research in Education, Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pose significant questions that can be investigated empirically.
# Link research to relevant theory.
# Use methods that permit direct investigation of the question.
# Provide explicit, coherent chain of reasoning.
# Replicate and generalize across studies.
# Disclose research to encourage professional scrutiny and critique.

== Connection to practice ==

Engineering education research is conducted based on the demands and patterns of engineering in industry, policy, and education. Globally, emphasis of research focuses on educational application. Research into industry and practice have yet to gain greater attention.&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2010"&gt;Jesiek, B. K., Borrego, M., &amp; Beddoes, K. (2010) "Advancing global capacity for engineering education research (AGCEER): relating research to practice, policy, and industry." ''[[Journal of Engineering Education]]''. 99 (2): 107-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Industry ===

=== Policy ===

In the [[United States]], there has been a greater push for development of formal policy for educating engineers.  In 1918, the [http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rlz=1T4GGLL_enUS374US374&amp;q=Mann%2c+C.+%281918%29.+Study+of+Engineering+Education Mann Report] noted an imminent lack of qualified engineers that could rapidly enter the workforce.  There should be more hands-on experience, engineering educators should have practical work experience, and teaching should be more prominent even though research is also important. In 1955, the Grinter report specifically outlined undergraduate and graduate level engineering studies.  Since then, some of these suggestions, including the senior capstone design course, have been implemented in public and private engineering institutions.

Engineering education policy is externally driven to some degree.  [[ABET]] accreditation has incorporated industrial demands as part of the accreditation process.  ABET EC 2000 emphasizes both technical (design, problem solving) and professional skills (teamwork, communication, ethical/global thinking).

''P-12 Educational Standards:''

National policies such as [[No Child Left Behind]] and [[Race to the Top]] have influenced the recruitment and retention of future engineers.

In April 2013, the Next Generation Science Standards were released as the science standards for K-12 science education in the [[United States]] to replace the [[National Science Education Standards]]. These include engineering-based standards embedded within the science standards. The National Assessment Governing Board has created a Technology and Literacy Framework for the 2014 National Assessment of Educational Progress. This will be a pilot test and may turn into a permanent fixture of future testing.

=== Educational ===

There is a disconnect between engineering education research findings and implementation of the findings into the classroom. Research findings are published in a variety of journals primarily read by other researchers, not P-12 teachers or university faculty outside of the Education field. This breakdown of transfer between research and practice prevents the desired outcomes at the heart of the research&lt;ref&gt;American Society for Engineering Education, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borrego_Bernhard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesiek_etal_2010"/&gt;

There have been proposals to connect Engineering Education practice and Engineering Education research. A cyclical model of transfer between research and practice has been proposed by Jesiek et al. (2010) and Borrego &amp; Bernhard (2011).  This model allows research and practice to continuously influence and develop one another.

== Organizations and publications ==
There are several professional organizations devoted to engineering education, including: 
* [[American Society for Engineering Education]]
* [[European Society for Engineering Education]] 
* [[International Technology and Engineering Educators Association]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26058">'''Female copulatory vocalizations''', also called '''female copulation calls''' or '''coital vocalizations''', are produced by female [[primate]]s, including [[woman|human females]], and female non-primates. Copulatory vocalizations usually occur during [[sexual intercourse]] and are hence related to [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|last2=Gangestad|first2=S. W.|title=The Evolutionary Biology of Human Female Sexuality|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIE8DwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=vocalizations%20OR%20%22copulation%20calls%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalizations that occur before intercourse, for the purpose of attracting mates, are known as [[mating call]]s.

In [[primate]]s, copulation calling is typically observed at the end of [[mating]]&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pradhan|first1=Gauri|last2=Engelhardt|first2=Antje|last3=van Schaik|first3=Carel|last4=Maestripieri|first4=Dario|title=The evolution of female copulation calls in primates: a review and a new model|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=January 2006|volume=59|issue=3|pages=333–343|doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0075-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are vast variations between species regarding its occurrence, frequency and form. It is agreed that coital vocalizations fulfill an [[evolution]]ary purpose&lt;ref name="Dixson 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixson|first1=A.|title=Primate Sexuality: Comparative Studies of the Prosimians, Monkeys, Apes, and Humans|date=2013|publisher=Oxford: UOP}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that they serve as adaptive solutions to problems that the females face, such as [[infanticide]], as well as [[sperm competition|obtaining high quality sperm]].&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;

In non-primates, copulatory calling predominantly occurs before copulation in order to attract mates ([[mating call]]). Calls vary in [[frequency]] (14&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;) and function. One of the main purposes of females vocalizing is the induction of [[mate guarding]] behavior in males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Conversely, calls may also be used in order to attract high ranking mates who can prevent intercourse with the initial partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is done to incite [[sexual selection|male mate competition]].

In humans, coital vocalizations are linked to [[orgasm]],&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"&gt;Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, ‘’[[Sex at Dawn|Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships]]’’ (Harper Perennial, 2011), pp. 255-57.&lt;/ref&gt; hence occurring during [[sexual intercourse|copulation]] and serving as an expression of sexual pleasure. Vocalizations can be used intentionally by women in order to boost the self-esteem of their partner and to cause quicker [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = Gayle | last2 = Hendrie | first2 = Colin A. | year = 2011 | title = Evidence to Suggest that Copulatory Vocalizations in Women Are Not a Reflexive Consequence of Orgasm | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 559–64 | pmid = 20480220 | doi=10.1007/s10508-010-9632-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In non-human primates==

===Occurrence, frequency and form===

[[File:Vocalization sonograms.jpg|thumb|Sonograms of female copulatory vocalizations of a human female (top), female baboon (middle), and female gibbon (bottom),&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = J. | last2 = Arrowood | first2 = P. C. | year = 1978 | title = Copulatory Vocalizations of Chacma Baboons (Papio Ursinus), gibbons (Hylobates Hoolock) and Humans | url = | journal = Science | volume = 200 | issue = 1405| pages = 1406–07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with time being plotted on the x-axis and the [[Audio frequency|pitch]] being represented on the y-axis.]]In non-human primates, copulatory vocalizations begin towards the end of the copulatory act or even after copulation.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The percentage of vocalizations after copulation varies dependent on the non-human primate species studied. In long-tail macaques, for instance, 80% of copulations are followed by [[Sexual intercourse|copulation]] calls. In contrast, the percentage for [[chimpanzee]]s and [[Tonkean macaque]]s has been found to be 78.8% and 6%, respectively.&lt;ref name="Maestripieri 106–113"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Primate copulation calls and postcopulatory female choice|url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/1/106|journal = Behavioral Ecology|date = 2005-01-01|issn = 1045-2249|pages = 106–113|volume = 16|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/beheco/arh120|language = en|first = Dario|last = Maestripieri|first2 = James R.|last2 = Roney}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little consensus on what causes these inter-specific differences, given the lack of consistent findings within the literature.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The typical quantity of specimen that are tested in [[experiment|experimental settings]] is often too low in order to allow any [[inference|general conclusions]] about the species as a whole.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;
Another aspect of [[Sexual intercourse|coital]] vocalization that varies according to species is the form of the call: in [[macaque]]s and [[baboon]]s they manifest themselves as [[Guttural|grunts]], whereas other species such as [[talapoin]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s typically emit [[screaming]] sounds.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; The quality and structure of copulatory calls are analyzed by comparing their respective [[spectrogram]]s in terms of their frequency. Accordingly, some species produce calls that are structurally more complex than that of others. This is linked to the amount of [[Animal sexual behavior#Promiscuity|promiscuity]] exhibited, in a way that more promiscuous species emit more faceted calls in order to convey more information about themselves and hence render [[Signalling theory|self-advertisement]] more efficient.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt;

===Adaptive function===

[[File:World 06 temp-1416046030-546725ce-620x348.jpg|thumb|A male Chacma baboon shows aggression towards a female and her offspring.]]Copulatory calls in primates serve an [[Adaptation|adaptive function]] and are [[sexual selection|sexually selected]].&lt;ref name="Dixson 2013"/&gt; Calling signals sexual receptivity of the female and therefore affects [[mate choice]]. There are many different hypotheses as to the exact adaptive function of female copulatory calls in primates and research on the subject is still in its early stages.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt;

There is general agreement that copulatory calls are the adaptive solution to problems with [[reproductive success]]. In other words, copulatory vocalizations address issues that stand in the way of successfully producing [[offspring]] and guaranteeing its survival, such as the occurrence of infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maestripieri|first1=Dario|title=Post-Copulatory Sexual Selection and Female Mating Vocalizations in Primates|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhVRetJZrkM|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the killing of their offspring, female baboons employ copulatory calls in order to attract other males, allowing multiple mating acts and creating parental confusion among the males involved. The resulting uncertainty of who the father is hence reduces the occurrence of attacks, given the newly incited risk of potentially harming their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infanticide avoidance, sperm competition and mate choice: the function of copulation calls in female baboons|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347284712887|journal = Animal Behaviour|date = 1994-09-01|pages = 687–694|volume = 48|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/anbe.1994.1288|first = Sanjida M.|last = O'Connell|first2 = Guy|last2 = Cowlishaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, mating in rapid successions also entails sperm competition, and therefore fulfills the additional function of obtaining high quality sperm.&lt;ref name="stockley"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Stockley |first1= P|year= 1997|title= Sexual conflict resulting from adaptations to sperm competition |volume= 12|pages= 154–159|journal= Trends Ecol. Evol.|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01000-8 |issue= 4 |pmid= 21238013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important in species that do not openly advertise good genes via [[honest signal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maestripieri|first1=Dario|last2=Roney|first2=James|title=Primate copulation calls and post-copulatory female choice|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2005|volume=16|pages=106–113|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By attracting other males through post-copulatory calls, the female might provoke mate guarding behavior in their initial mate. This 'parental concentration',&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; has two outcomes. Firstly, the male might be of high [[Fitness (biology)|quality]], allowing him to fend off those that were attracted by the call. In that case the female has not only gained someone who can protect her and who prevents infanticide through other males, but this also means that she was [[insemination|inseminated]] by a specimen with potentially good genes. Secondly, if the male fails to successfully guard her, she will mate with the newly arrived males, hence inciting sperm competition and paternity confusion (again preventing [[infanticide|attacks on her offspring]], as well as increasing her likelihood of obtaining high quality sperm). The calls produced by the female also carries information about the [[Dominance hierarchy|status]] of the male with whom she was copulating, thus allowing her to influence the likelihood of other males approaching.&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"/&gt;

Accordingly, copulatory calls serve more than a single adaptive function. There is no [[mutual exclusivity]] when it comes to addressing the two problems described, namely that of infanticide and receiving high quality sperm. However, by taking the female's [[menstrual cycle|cycle stage]] into account, sperm competition can be ruled out as the primary underlying cause of copulatory calling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Townsend|first1=Simon|last2=Deschner|first2=T|last3=Zuberbühler|first3=K|title=Female chimpanzees use copulation calls flexibly to prevent social competition|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2008|volume=3 | issue = 6 |page=e2431|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002431|pmid=22423311|pmc=3278306}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, females produce coital vocalizations also when they mate during non-fertile periods, which is therefore primarily aimed at attracting as many males as possible and to create parental confusion rather than obtaining high quality sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lukas|first1=Dieter|last2=Huchard|first2=Elise|title=The evolution of infanticide by males in mammalian societies|journal=Science|date=2014|volume=346|issue=6211|pages=841–843|doi=10.1126/science.1257226|pmid=25395534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females have no interest in advertising their periods of [[fertility]], given that males would pick up on these patterns, reducing paternal confusion and causing an increase in [[infanticide|aggressive behavior towards her offspring]] from other males.&lt;ref name="Pradhan et al. (2006)"/&gt; Such hidden fertility has been coined [[concealed ovulation]], and is part of [[extended female sexuality]].

=== Alternative benefits ===

In addition to the incitement of parental confusion in order to avoid infanticide, female primates that exhibit [[promiscuity|promiscuous behavior]] also reap non-genetic material benefits. A female that uses vocalizations after copulating with her mate attracts other males, with whom she is also likely to engage in multiple acts of mating.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt; As a consequence male mates provide non-genetic benefits, such as food, to the female they mated with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodrı́guez-Gironés|first1=M. A.|last2=Enquist|first2=M.|title=The evolution of female sexuality|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=2001|volume=61|issue=4|pages=695–704|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocalization-facilitated promiscuity heightens the female's [[reproductive success]]. The strategy to mate with multiple partners in order to obtain material benefits can equally be observed in non-primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=P. B.|title=Female promiscuity and male reproductive success in social birds and mammals.|journal=American Naturalist|date=1982|pages=51–64|doi=10.1086/283969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In non-primates ==

=== Occurrence ===

In addition to emitting copulatory vocalizations during and after copulation (as it is mostly seen in primates), non-primate species also vocalize before engaging in mating. Vocalizations that are made prior to copulation are named [[mating call]]s.

In regard to the calling properties, frequency analysis is typically used in research to look at the complexity of the vocalization and to distinguish between calls, which is important in determining their function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerhardt|first1=C.|title=Mating call recognition in the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea): importance of two frequency bands as a function of sound pressure level.|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1981|volume=144 | issue = 1 |pages=9–16|doi=10.1007/bf00612792}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large frequency variations have been noted between species, ranging from 14&amp;nbsp;Hz to 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz. [[Mice]], for instance, use 70,000&amp;nbsp;Hz calls continuously prior to copulation. They then lower the frequency down to 40,000&amp;nbsp;Hz during the copulatory act, therefore two qualitatively different calls are used for attracting mates as compared to the actual act of mating.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = N.

They use these [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] calls (&gt; 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz and hence not discernible by the human ear) to attract females, with the quantity of calls being related to the male's mating success, making these vocalizations a [[sexual selection|sexually selected]] trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pomerantz | first1 = S.

On the other end of the spectrum, female [[African elephant]]s use very low frequency calls of 14–35&amp;nbsp;Hz prior to, as well as during, copulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poole | first1 = J.

The vocalizations of female elephants are also used in order to incite [[mate guarding]] behavior in the male,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=J.|title=Mate guarding, reproductive success and female choice in African elephants|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1989|volume=37|pages=842–849|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which manifests itself in the form of fighting off any newly arriving mates. Not only females make use of this, as male [[Columbian ground squirrel]]s have been observed to use copulatory vocalizations in order to announce their post-copulatory mate guarding to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Manno | first1 = T. G. | last2 = Nesterova | first2 = A. P. | last3 = Debarbieri | first3 = L. M. | last4 = Kennedy | first4 = S. E. | last5 = Wright | first5 = K. S. | last6 = Dobson | first6 = F.

[[Red junglefowl]]s, for instance, utilize calls in order to prevent or end unwanted copulations by attracting another high-ranking male fowl.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Løvlie | first1 = H. | last2 = Zidar | first2 = J. | last3 = Berneheim | first3 = C. | year = 2014 | title = A cry for help: Female distress calling during copulation is context dependent | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 151–157 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further effects of female calling on male's behavior are illustrated by [[spider]]s that have been shown to [[Stridulation|stridulate]] before copulation to inform males of sexual receptivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dutto | first1 = M.

Moreover, attracting new mates by calling out during copulation can entail many benefits for the female. Female [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s which mate with multiple partners receive a greater number of [[nuptial gift]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tregenza|first1=T.|last2=Wedell|first2=N.|title=Benefits of Multiple Mates in the Cricket Gryllus bimaculatus|journal=Evolution|date=1998|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1726–1730|doi=10.2307/2411345|jstor=2411345}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing them to lay a larger quantity of eggs, hence increasing their [[reproductive success]].

==In humans==

Theories are more diverse in regard to women’s sexual vocalizing. On the one hand, researchers have noted some apparently communicative patterns in women’s copulatory vocalizations that suggest some parallels with those of other primates (including an invitation to sperm competition, given that female sexual vocalizations, like those of other primates, serve as "copulation calls" noticeable to other men and exciting to them if overheard&lt;ref name="Sex at Dawn"/&gt;). One study, for instance, has noted that female sexual vocalizations tend to become more intense as she approaches orgasm; at orgasm her vocalization tends to become very rapid, with a regular rhythm that includes equal note lengths and intervals between notes, which male vocalization typically lacks.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07" /&gt; This is especially frequent when her orgasm occurs during penile-vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer" /&gt; By exciting her partner with her vocalizations and bringing about his orgasm at that point, she helps ensure that the [[semen|seminal pool]] is available for her [[cervix]] to dip into as her [[vagina]] relaxes after her orgasm.&lt;ref name="Hamilton_1406-07"/&gt; Copulatory vocalizations may also be a type of mate retention behaviour. One study found that women who perceived a high risk of [[infidelity]] in their relationship were more likely to utilize copulatory vocalizations in order to [[Fake orgasm|fake an orgasm]], along with other mate retention behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaighobadi|first=Farnaz|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|last3=Weekes-Shackelford|first3=Viviana A.|date=2011-11-17|title=Do Women Pretend Orgasm to Retain a Mate?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-011-9874-6|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|language=en|volume=41|issue=5|pages=1121–1125|doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9874-6|issn=0004-0002|pmc=3563256|pmid=22089325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, recent studies have indicated that most copulatory vocalizations in women do not accompany their own orgasm, but rather their partner’s ejaculation. The study showed that the man typically finds the woman’s vocalization arousing and highly exciting, and that the woman herself is aware of this. Most women in the study, furthermore, indicated that they vocalized during intercourse to make their man ejaculate more quickly, or to boost his enjoyment or [[self-esteem]], or both.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer"/&gt; A correlation has been found between the frequency of vocalizations and sexual satisfaction for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Babin | first1 = E. A. | year = 2013 | title = An examination of predictors of nonverbal and verbal communication of pleasure during sex and sexual satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 270–292 | doi=10.1177/0265407512454523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons that women gave for wanting to force a quick ejaculation include the alleviation of the female's pain, fatigue, or even boredom, or simply to stay within some imposed time restriction for sexual activity. Reasons for wanting to boost the male self-esteem included reinforcing the [[pair bond]] that intercourse helps to strengthen, and thus reducing emotional and sexual infidelity and abandonment.&lt;ref name="GayleBrewer" /&gt; The researchers note that all of these goals are apparently congruent with female copulatory vocalizations in non-human primates.

It is also possible that some vocalizations are due to [[hyperventilation]]. Both men and women can experience hyperventilation during sexual arousal,&lt;ref&gt;Masters W. H., Johnson V. E. Human Sexual Response. Boston: Little Brown and Co, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; which can involve involuntary vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Passie | first1 = T. | last2 = Hartman | first2 = U. | last3 = Schneider | first3 = U. | last4 = Emrich | first4 = H.M. | year = 2003 | title = On the function of groaning and hyperventilation during sexual intercourse: Intensification of sexual experience by altering brain metabolism through hypercapnia | url = | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 60 | issue = 5| pages = 660–663 | doi=10.1016/s0306-9877(03)00010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genopolitics''' is the study of the genetic basis of political behavior and attitudes. It combines [[behavior genetics]], [[psychology]], and [[political science]] and it is closely related to the emerging fields of [[neuropolitics]] (the study of the neural basis of political behavior and attitudes) and political physiology (the study of biophysical correlates of political attitudes and behavior).

In 2008, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reported on the increase in academicians' recognition of and engagement in genopolitics as a discrete field of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Monastersky |first=Richard |date=September 19, 2008 |work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |title=The Body Politic: Biology May Shape Political Views |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Biology-May-Shape-Political/1173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' included genopolitics in its "Eighth Annual Year in Ideas" for the same year, noting that the term was originally coined by [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14Ideas-Section2-B-t-007.html |last=Biuso |first=Emily |title=Genopolitics |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of genopolitics have argued that it is "a fundamentally misguided undertaking", and that it is inconsistent with evidence in the fields of [[genetics]], [[neuroscience]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |last2=English |first2=William |date=May 2013 |title=Genopolitics and the Science of Genetics |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/genopolitics-and-the-science-of-genetics/3743ED789015701CDD2F256F78A91B85 |journal=American Political Science Review |language=en |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=382–395 |doi=10.1017/S0003055413000099 |issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin studies of political attitudes==
Psychologists and behavior geneticists began using twin studies in the 1980s to study variation in social attitudes, and these studies suggested that both genes and environment played a role. In particular, [[Nick Martin (scientist)|Nick Martin]] and his colleagues published an influential [[twin study]] of social attitudes in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in 1986.

However, this early work did not specifically analyze whether or not political orientations were heritable, and political scientists remained mostly unaware of the heritability of social attitudes until 2005.  In that year, the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a reanalysis of political questions on Martin's social attitude survey of twins in that the suggested liberal and conservative ideology is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=307695 |title=Are Political Orientations Genetically Transmitted? |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=99 |pages=153–167 |year=2005 |last=Alford |first=John |author2=Carolyn Funk |author3=John Hibbing  |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1017/s0003055405051579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article sparked considerable debate between critics, the authors and their defenders.&lt;ref name=Charney08-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charney|first=Evan|title=Genes and Ideologies|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=299–319|doi=10.1017/S1537592708080626|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFH08-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=John R.|author2=Funk, Carolyn L. |author3=Hibbing, John R. |title=Beyond Liberals and Conservatives to Political Genotypes and Phenotypes|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=321–328|doi=10.1017/S1537592708080638|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&amp;context=poliscifacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hannagan08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hannagan|first=Rebecca J.|author2=Hatemi, Peter K.|title=The Threat of Genes: A Comment on Evan Charney's "Genes and Ideologies"|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=329–335|doi=10.1017/S153759270808064X|url=http://ussc.edu.au/ussc/assets/media/docs/publications/04_Hannagan_Hatemi_PoP_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charney08-2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |date=June 2008 |title=Politics, Genetics, and "Greedy Reductionism" |url=http://www.sanford.duke.edu/research/papers/Perpectives-GeneticsJune2008.pdf#page=37 |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=337–343 |doi=10.1017/S1537592708080651 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308002322/http://www.sanford.duke.edu/research/papers/Perpectives-GeneticsJune2008.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beckwith08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckwith|first=Jon|author2=Morris, Corey A.|title=Twin Studies of Political Behavior: Untenable Assumptions?|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=December 2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=785–791|doi=10.1017/S1537592708081917|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/morris-singer/files/perspectives_on_politics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFH08-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=John R.|author2=Funk, Carolyn L. |author3=Hibbing, John R. |title=Twin Studies, Molecular Genetics, Politics, and Tolerance: A Response to Beckwith and Morris|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=December 2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=793–797|doi=10.1017/S1537592708081929|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=poliscifacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin studies of political behavior==
Initial twin studies suggested that predispositions toward espousal of certain political ideas are heritable, but they said little about political behavior (patterns of voting and/or activism) or predispositions toward it. A 2008 article published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' matched publicly available voter registration records to a [[twin registry]] in Los Angeles, analyzed self-reported [[voter turnout]] in the [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] (Add Health), and studied other forms of [[political participation]]. In all three cases, both genes and environment contributed significantly to variation in political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic Variation in Political Participation |last=Fowler |first=James H. |author2=Laura A. Baker |author3=Christopher T. Dawes  |journal=American Political Science Review |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/genetic_basis_of_political_cooperation.pdf |issue=2 |volume=102 |pages=233–248 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0003055408080209 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional studies showed that genes did not play a direct role in the choice of a political party, supporting a core finding in the study of American politics that the choice to be a Democrat or a Republican is largely shaped by parental socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Genetics of Voting: An Australian Twin Study |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=435–448 |year=2007 |last=Hatemi |first=Peter K. |pmid=17221311 |author2=Sarah E.

==Gene association studies==

===Candidate genes===
Scholars therefore recently turned their attention to specific genes that might be associated with political behaviors and attitudes. In the first-ever research to link specific genes to political phenotypes, a direct association was established between voter turnout and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and a gene–environment interaction between turnout and the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene among those who frequently participated in religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Two Genes Predict Voter Turnout |last=Fowler |first=James H. |author2=Christopher T. Dawes |journal=Journal of Politics |date=July 2008 |url= http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/two_genes_predict_voter_turnout.pdf |issue=3 |volume=70 |pages=579–594 |format=PDF |doi=10.1017/S0022381608080638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research scholars have also found an association between voter turnout and a dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene that is mediated by a significant association between that gene and the tendency to affiliate with a political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Partisanship, Voting, and the Dopamine D2 Receptor Gene |last=Dawes |first=Christopher T. |author2=James H. Fowler |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/partisanship_voting_and_drd2.pdf | doi = 10.1017/S002238160909094X |year=2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Please state specific conclusion of study, i.e., relationship between specific gene variant and specific ideology.|date=November 2015}} More recent studies show an interaction between friendships and the dopamine receptor (DRD4) gene that is associated with political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Friendships Moderate an Association Between a Dopamine Gene Variant and Political Ideology |last=Settle |first=Jaime E. |author2=Christopher T. Dawes |author3=Peter K. Hatemi |author4=Nicholas A. Christakis |author5=James H. Fowler  |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/friends_drd4_and_political_ideology.pdf |year=2008 |format=PDF}}{{clarify|reason=Please state specific conclusion of study, i.e., relationship between specific gene variant and specific ideology.|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this work is preliminary and needs replication, it suggests that neurotransmitter function has an important effect on political behavior.

The candidate genes approach to genopolitics received substantial criticism in a 2012 article, published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', which argued that many of the candidate genes identified in the above research are associated with innumerable traits and behaviors. The degree to which these genes are associated with so many outcomes thus undermines the apparent important of evidence linking a gene to any particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Evan, and English, William. (2012). Candidate Genes and Political Behavior. American Political Science Review 106(1):1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linkage analysis===
Employing a more general approach, researchers used genome-wide [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] analysis to identify chromosomal regions associated with political attitudes assessed using scores on a liberalism-conservativism scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genome-Wide Analysis of Liberal and Conservative Political Attitudes|last=Hatemi|first=P. K.|journal=The Journal of Politics|issue=1|volume=73|pages=271–285|url=http://www.vipbg.vcu.edu/~nathan/publications/Hatemi2011.pdf|date=January 2011|doi=10.1017/S0022381610001015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis identified several significant linkage peaks and the associated chromosomal regions implicate a possible role for NMDA and glutamate related receptors in forming political attitudes. However, this role is speculative as linkage analysis cannot identify the effect of individual genes.

===Other explanations===
Associations between genetic markers and political behavior are often assumed to predict a causal connection between the two. Scholars have little incentive to be skeptical of this presumed causal link. Yet it is possible that a confounding factor exists which makes the genetic relationship with politics purely correlative. For instance work on Irish parties, which shows some evidence of a genetic basis for the otherwise inexplicable distinction between the historically two main parties there, is also and more easily explained by socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Kevin P.|title=Politics with Hidden Bases: Unearthing the Deep Roots of Party Systems|journal=BJPIR|date=2012|volume=14|pages=613–629|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00478.x|url=http://www.kevinbyrne.org/pubs/ByrneOMalley2012.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Fibonacci number#Origins}}

The golden ratio has a wide range of demonstrations throughout history. According to [[Mario Livio]]:
{{quote|Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from [[Pythagoras]] and [[Euclid]] in [[ancient Greece]], through the medieval Italian mathematician &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Fibonacci]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the Renaissance astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]], to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist [[Roger Penrose]], have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and its properties. ... it is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=6}}}}

[[File:Pentagram-phi.svg|right|thumb|A pentagram colored to distinguish its line segments of different lengths. The four
lengths are in golden ratio to one another.]]
Ancient Greek mathematicians first studied what we now call the golden ratio because of its fundamentality to the [[geometry]] of regular [[Pentagram#Geometry|pentagram]]s and [[pentagon]]s.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=7–8}} According to one story, 5th-century mathematician [[Hippasus]] discovered that the golden ratio was not a [[simple fraction]] (an [[irrational number]]), surprising [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]].{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=4–5}} Hippasus was also the first to write of the golden ratio-related{{efn|The surface area of a dodecahedron with edge lengths of one unit is &lt;math&gt;\frac{15\varphi}{\sqrt{3-\varphi}}&lt;/math&gt;, and its volume is &lt;math&gt;\frac{5\varphi^3}{6-2\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. {{harv|Livio|2003|pp=70–1}}.}} [[dodecahedron]], though its discovery is attributed to Pythagoras ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;570 BC–c.&amp;nbsp;495&amp;nbsp;BC);{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=36}} [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]] (c.&amp;nbsp;417–c.&amp;nbsp;369&amp;nbsp;BC) was the first to describe all [[Platonic solid|five possible regular solids]].{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=67}} In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;380&amp;nbsp;BC), [[Plato]] expressed the concept of {{nowrap|[[self-similarity]]}} in his [[Analogy of the Divided Line]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', Book 6, translated by [[Benjamin Jowett]], [http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418215659/http://www.filepedia.org/files/Plato%20-%20The%20Republic.pdf|date=18 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid in his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;300&amp;nbsp;BC) provides several [[Theorem|propositions]] and their proofs employing the golden ratio,&lt;ref&gt;Euclid, ''[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/toc.html Elements]'', Book II, Proposition 11; Book IV, Propositions 10–11; Book VI, Proposition 30; Book XIII, Propositions 1–6, 8–11, 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the first known definition:&lt;ref name=Hemenway&gt;{{cite book|last=Hemenway|first=Priya|title=Divine Proportion: Phi In Art, Nature, and Science|year=2005|publisher=Sterling|location=New York|isbn=1-4027-3522-7|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=3}}

==Applications and observations==

===Aesthetics===
{{See also|History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)|Mathematics and art}}

''De Divina Proportione'', a three-volume work by [[Luca Pacioli]], was published in 1509. Pacioli, a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. ''De Divina Proportione'' explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] system of rational proportions.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=134-35}} Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. ''De Divina Proportione'' contains illustrations of regular solids by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.

===Architecture===
{{further|Mathematics and architecture}}
[[File:7234014 Parthenonas (cropped).jpg|thumb|x150px|right|Many of the proportions of the [[Parthenon]] are alleged to exhibit the golden ratio.]]

The [[Parthenon]]'s façade as well as elements of its façade are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis with a Philosophical Polemic", ''Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46 No. 2, 1998, pp 194–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with the golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the ''Elements'' (308&amp;nbsp;BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and [[decagon]]s was duly observed, as well as in the [[dodecahedron]]".&lt;ref&gt;Midhat J. Gazalé , ''Gnomon'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{isbn|0-691-00514-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Keith Devlin]] says, "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook ''Elements'', written around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, showed how to calculate its value."&lt;ref&gt;Keith J. Devlin ''The Math Instinct: Why You're A Mathematical Genius (Along With Lobsters, Birds, Cats, And Dogs)'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRD9gYk2r6oC&amp;pg=PA108 p.&amp;nbsp;108]. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005, {{isbn|1-56025-672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later sources like [[Vitruvius]] exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions. One researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century&amp;nbsp;BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries, based on measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Foutakis, "Did the Greeks Build According to the Golden Ratio?", ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'', vol. 24, n° 1, February 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;71–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Jason Elliot | title = Mirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iran | year = 2006 | pages = 277, 284 | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-312-30191-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gcs4IjUx3-4C&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the [[Mosque of Oqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz.&lt;ref&gt;Boussora, Kenza and Mazouz, Said, ''The Use of the Golden Section in the Great Mosque of Kairouan'', Nexus Network Journal, vol. 6 no. 1 (Spring 2004), [http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/BouMaz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the [[minaret]]. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.

The Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International Style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.&amp;nbsp;25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Frings: The Golden Section in Architectural Theory, Nexus Network Journal vol. 4 no. 1 (Winter 2002), available online [http://belveduto.de/text-nnj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'']]
Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon.

The [[Section d'Or]] was a collective of [[Painting|painters]], sculptors, poets and critics associated with [[Cubism]] and [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediation.centrepompidou.fr/education/ressources/ENS-futurisme2008/ENS-futurisme2008-07-section-or.html ''Le Salon de la Section d'Or'', October 1912, Mediation Centre Pompidou]&lt;/ref&gt; Active from 1911 to around 1914, they adopted the name both to highlight that Cubism represented the continuation of a grand tradition, rather than being an isolated art-form, and in homage to the mathematical harmony associated with [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jeunes Peintres ne vous frappez pas !'', La Section d’Or: Numéro spécial consacré à l'Exposition de la "Section d’Or", première année, n° 1, 9 octobre 1912, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/imagesbk/RP225%5C001/M5050_X0031_PER_P02251912001.pdf ''Jeunes Peintres ne vous frappez pas !'', La Section d’Or: Numéro spécial consacré à l’Exposition de la "Section d’Or", première année, n° 1, 9 octobre 1912, pp. 1-7], Bibliothèque Kandinsky&lt;/ref&gt; The Cubists observed in its harmonies, geometric structuring of motion and form, the primacy of idea over nature, an absolute scientific clarity of conception.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, ''Neo-Impressionism'', New York: The Solomon R.

[[Mario Livio]], for example, claims that they did not,{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=169}} and [[Marcel Duchamp]] said as much in an interview with art historian [[William A. Camfield]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00043079.1965.10788819 William A. Camfield, ''Juan Gris and the Golden Section''], Art Bulletin, 47, no. 1, March 1965, 128-34. 68&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, an analysis by Camfield suggests that [[Juan Gris]] made use of the golden ratio in composing works that were likely, but not definitively, shown at the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0300053746 Christopher Green, ‎''Juan Gris'', Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September - 29 November 1992 ; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart 18 December 1992-14 February 1993 ; Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993], Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 37-38, {{ISBN|0300053746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=0719050049 David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories, Barber Institute's critical perspectives in art history series, Critical Perspectives in Art History''], Manchester University Press, 2004, pp. 112, 142, {{ISBN|0719050049}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]] has argued that in addition to referencing the mathematical term, the exhibition's name also refers to the earlier ''Bandeaux d'Or'' group, with which [[Albert Gleizes]] and other former members of the [[Abbaye de Créteil]] had been deeply involved.)&lt;ref name="Allard"&gt;Roger Allard, ''Sur quelques peintre'', Les Marches du Sud-Ouest, June 1911, pp. 57–64.

[[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] has been said to have used the golden section extensively in his geometrical paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Bouleau, Charles, ''The Painter's Secret Geometry: A Study of Composition in Art'' (1963) pp. 247–8, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, {{isbn|0-87817-259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; though other experts (including critic [[Yve-Alain Bois]]) have disputed this claim.&lt;ref name=livio/&gt;

A statistical study performed in 1999 on 565 works of art by different painters found that they did not use the golden ratio in their canvas sizes. The study concluded that the average ratio of the two sides of the paintings studied is 1.34, with averages for individual artists ranging from 1.04 to 1.46.&lt;ref&gt;Olariu, Agata, ''Golden Section and the Art of Painting'' [https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/9908036/ Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Pablo Tosto listed over 350 works by well-known artists, including more than 100 which have canvasses with golden rectangle and [[Square root of 5|root-5]] proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Tosto, Pablo, ''La composición áurea en las artes plásticas – El número de oro'', Librería Hachette, 1969, p.&amp;nbsp;134–144&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:√3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ernő Lendvai]] analyzes [[Béla Bartók]]'s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the [[acoustic scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Lendvai, Ernő (1971). ''Béla Bartók: An Analysis of His Music''. London: Kahn and Averill.&lt;/ref&gt; though other music scholars reject that analysis.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=190}} French composer [[Erik Satie]] used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including ''[[Sonneries de la Rose+Croix]]''. The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]] (Reflections in Water)'', from ''Images'' (1st series, 1905), in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F.

[[Adolf Zeising]], whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the [[phyllotaxis|arrangement of parts]] such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of [[Leaf#Veins|veins]] in leaves. He extended his research to the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of [[crystal]]s, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these [[patterns in nature]] he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Proportion

In 2010, the journal ''Science'' reported that the golden ratio is present at the atomic scale in the magnetic resonance of spins in cobalt niobate crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-01/haog-grd010510.php |title=Golden ratio discovered in a quantum world |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, several researchers have proposed connections between the golden ratio and [[human genome]] [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Perez (1991), [http://golden-ratio-in-dna.blogspot.com/2008/01/1991-first-publication-related-to.html "Chaos DNA and Neuro-computers: A Golden Link"], in ''Speculations in Science and Technology'' vol. 14 no. 4, {{ISSN|0155-7785}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamagishi, Michel E.B., and Shimabukuro, Alex I.

However, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, James E., Tim K. Marks, and [[Erica Flapan|Erica L. Flapan]], eds. 2010. "Number Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories". John Wiley and Sons: 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual studies===
Studies by psychologists, starting with [[Gustav Fechner]], have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of [[beauty]]. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to test such a hypothesis have been inconclusive.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=7}}&lt;ref name=livio/&gt;

===Disputed observations===
Examples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:
*Historian [[John Man (author)|John Man]] states that the pages of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] were "based on the golden section shape". However, according to Man's own measurements, the ratio of height to width was 1.45.&lt;ref&gt;Man, John, ''Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Word'' (2002) pp. 166–167, Wiley, {{isbn|0-471-21823-5}}. "The half-folio page (30.7 × 44.5 cm) was made up of two rectangles—the whole page and its text area—based on the so called 'golden section', which specifies a crucial relationship between short and long sides, and produces an irrational number, as pi is, but is a ratio of about 5:8."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some specific proportions in the bodies of many animals (including humans)&lt;ref name=pheasant&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephen |last=Pheasant |title=Bodyspace |location=London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1998 |isbn=0-7484-0067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanLaack&gt;{{Cite book |first=Walter |last=van Laack |title=A Better History Of Our World: Volume 1 The Universe |location=Aachen |publisher=van Laach GmbH |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of the shells of mollusks&lt;ref name="dunlap"/&gt; are often claimed to be in the golden ratio. There is a large variation in the real measures of these elements in specific individuals, however, and the proportion in question is often significantly different from the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=pheasant/&gt; The ratio of successive phalangeal bones of the digits and the metacarpal bone has been said to approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=vanLaack/&gt; The [[nautilus]] shell, the construction of which proceeds in a [[logarithmic spiral]], is often cited, usually with the idea that any logarithmic spiral is related to the golden ratio, but sometimes with the claim that each new chamber is proportioned by the golden ratio relative to the previous one;&lt;ref name=moscovich&gt;[[Ivan Moscovich]], ''Ivan Moscovich Mastermind Collection: The Hinged Square &amp; Other Puzzles,'' New York: Sterling, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, measurements of nautilus shells do not support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sea shell spirals|last=Peterson|first=Ivars|journal=Science News|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/6030/title/Sea_Shell_Spirals}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In investing, some practitioners of [[technical analysis]] use the golden ratio to indicate support of a price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Osler writes that "38.2 percent and 61.8 percent retracements of recent rises or declines are common," in {{Cite journal|author=Osler, Carol|title=Support for Resistance: Technical Analysis and Intraday Exchange Rates|journal=Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 53–68| url=http://ftp.ny.frb.org/research/epr/00v06n2/0007osle.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the golden ratio in investing is also related to more complicated patterns described by [[Fibonacci numbers]] (e.g. [[Elliott wave principle]] and [[Fibonacci retracement]]).  However, other market analysts have published analyses suggesting that these percentages and patterns are not supported by the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Batchelor]] and Richard Ramyar, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5reh6NujR?url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/resources/Magic_Numbers_in_the_Dow.pdf Magic numbers in the Dow]," 25th International Symposium on Forecasting, 2005, p.  13, 31. "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2947908/Not-since-the-big-is-beautiful-days-have-giants-looked-better.html Not since the 'big is beautiful' days have giants looked better]", Tom Stevenson, [[The Daily Telegraph]], Apr. 10, 2006, and "Technical failure", [[The Economist]], Sep. 23, 2006, are both popular-press accounts of Batchelor and Ramyar's research.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pyramids====
[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|right|thumb|250px|A regular square pyramid is determined by its medial right triangle, whose edges are the pyramid's apothem (a), semi-base (b), and height (h); the face inclination angle is also marked. Mathematical proportions b:h:a of &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3:4:5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1:4/\pi:1.61899&lt;/math&gt; are of particular interest in relation to Egyptian pyramids.]]
Both Egyptian pyramids and the regular [[square pyramid]]s that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.

=====Mathematical pyramids and triangles=====
A pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to {{φ}} times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a ''golden pyramid''. The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, {{φ}} times the square of the semi-base.

The medial [[right triangle]] of this "golden" pyramid (see diagram), with sides &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the [[Pythagorean theorem]] the relationship &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} = \sqrt{\varphi^2 - 1}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Kepler triangle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Best of Astraea: 17 Articles on Science, History and Philosophy | url = https://books.google.com/?id=LDTPvbXLxgQC&amp;pg=PA93 | publisher = Astrea Web Radio | isbn = 1-4259-7040-0 | year = 2006 | author1 = Radio, Astraea Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[geometric progression]],&lt;ref name=herz&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Shape of the Great Pyramid | author = Roger Herz-Fischler | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-88920-324-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=066T3YLuhA0C&amp;pg=PA81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the 3–4–5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[arithmetic progression]]. The angle with tangent &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51° 49' 38").&lt;ref&gt;Midhat Gazale, ''Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient [[Egyptian mathematics]]), based on the 3:4:5 triangle;&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes).&lt;ref name=Herkommer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |title=The Great Pyramid, The Great Discovery, and The Great Coincidence |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194148/http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot Hogben, ''Mathematics for the Million'', London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;63., as cited by Dick Teresi, ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science—from the Babylonians to the Maya'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt;

Another mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the "golden" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2{{pi}} times the height, or h:b = 4:{{pi}}. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854° (51°51'), very close to the 51.827° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the [[mathematical coincidences|coincidental relationship]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} \approx 4/\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Egyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.&lt;ref name=Herkommer/&gt;

=====Egyptian pyramids=====
In the mid-nineteenth century, Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the {{pi}}-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47')&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor]], ''Trigonometric Delights'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Adding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, [[Eric Temple Bell]], mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as {{pi}} or {{φ}}.{{Disputed inline|Egyptian Pyramids|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |title=The Development of Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=Dover |year=1940 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5KAnw3QMC8C&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rice&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp. 24 Routledge, 2003, {{isbn|0-415-26876-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that principal authorities on the history of [[Egyptian architecture]] have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957).&lt;ref&gt;S. Giedon, 1957, The Beginnings of Architecture, The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 457, as cited in Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp.24 Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Markowsky | first = George | date = January 1992 | title = Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio | journal = College Mathematics Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.2307/2686193 | url = http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | jstor = 2686193 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | pages = 2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the [[Pyramidology|pyramidologist]] [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]] claimed that, in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle [[θ]] to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the [[Cosecant|secant]] of the angle θ.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built and Who Built It?'', 1859&lt;/ref&gt; The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Howard Vyse]], according to Matila Ghyka,&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', New York: Dover, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.

==Mathematics==
Usually, the lowercase form of phi (φ or {{math|''φ''}}) is used to symbolize the golden ratio. Sometimes the uppercase form (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) is used for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the golden ratio, 1/{{math|''φ''}}.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"/&gt;

|}

Two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be in the ''golden ratio'' {{math|''φ''}} if

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} = \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

One method for finding the value of {{math|''φ''}} is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/{{math|''φ''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{a}+\frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by {{math|''φ''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi + 1 = \varphi^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi}^2 - \varphi - 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[quadratic formula]], two solutions are obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.6180\,339887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{math|''φ''}} is the ratio between positive quantities {{math|''φ''}} is necessarily positive:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt; .

===Irrationality ===
The golden ratio is an [[irrational number]]. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:

====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====
[[File:Whirling squares.svg|thumb|right|If &amp;phi; were [[Rational number|rational]], then it would be the ratio of sides of a rectangle with integer sides (the rectangle comprising the entire diagram). But it would also be a ratio of integer sides of the smaller rectangle (the rightmost portion of the diagram) obtained by deleting a square. The sequence of decreasing integer side lengths formed by deleting squares cannot be continued indefinitely because the integers have a lower bound, so &amp;phi; cannot be rational.]]

Recall that:

: the whole is the longer part plus the shorter part;
: the whole is to the longer part as the longer part is to the shorter part.

If we call the whole ''n'' and the longer part ''m'', then the second statement above becomes

: ''n'' is to ''m'' as ''m'' is to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'',

or, algebraically

: &lt;math&gt; \frac nm = \frac{m}{n-m}.\qquad (*) &lt;/math&gt;

To say that the golden ratio {{math|''φ''}} is rational means that {{math|''φ''}} is a fraction ''n''/''m'' where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers.  We may take ''n''/''m'' to be in [[lowest terms]] and ''n'' and ''m'' to be positive. But if ''n''/''m'' is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says ''m''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'') is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{math|''φ''}} is rational.

====By irrationality of {{radic|5}}====
Another short proof—perhaps more commonly known—of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle2\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - 1= \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-[[square number|square]] [[natural number]] is irrational.

===Minimal polynomial===
The golden ratio is also an [[algebraic number]] and even an [[algebraic integer]]. It has [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Having degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.

===Golden ratio conjugate===
The conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − x − 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{\varphi}=1-\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.61803\,39887\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of this quantity (≈ 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, ''b/a''), and is sometimes referred to as the ''golden ratio conjugate''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Golden Ratio Conjugate|urlname=GoldenRatioConjugate}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted here by the capital Phi ('''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = {1 \over \varphi} = \varphi^{-1} = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \varphi -1 = 1.61803\,39887\ldots -1 = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

or its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \Phi} = \Phi + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803....

===Alternative forms===
[[File:Golden mean.png|right|thumb|Approximations to the reciprocal golden ratio by finite continued fractions, or ratios of Fibonacci numbers]]

The formula {{math|''φ''}} = 1 + 1/{{math|''φ''}} can be expanded recursively to obtain a [[continued fraction]] for the golden ratio:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Concrete Abstractions: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Scheme

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = [1; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and its reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1} = [0; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 0 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]]s of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive [[Fibonacci numbers]].

The equation {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + {{math|''φ''}} likewise produces the [[Nested radical|continued square root]], or infinite surd, form:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An infinite series can be derived to express phi:&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roselle, [http://sites.google.com/site/goldenmeanseries/ "Golden Mean Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\frac{13}{8}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{(n+1)}(2n+1)!}{(n+2)!n!4^{(2n+3)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 1+2\sin(\pi/10) = 1 + 2\sin 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1 \over 2}\csc(\pi/10) = {1 \over 2}\csc 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 2\cos(\pi/5)=2\cos 36^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = 2\sin(3\pi/10)=2\sin 54^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

These correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is {{math|''φ''}} times the length of its side, and similar relations in a [[pentagram]].

===Geometry===

The &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt; spiral is made from quarter-circles tangent to the interior of each square, while the &lt;span style="color:maroon;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt; spiral is a Golden Spiral, a special type of [[logarithmic spiral]]. Overlapping portions appear &lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;. The length of the side of one square divided by that of the next smaller square is the golden ratio.]]
The number {{math|''φ''}} turns up frequently in [[geometry]], particularly in figures with pentagonal [[symmetry]].
The length of a regular [[pentagon]]'s [[diagonal]] is {{math|''φ''}} times its side.
The vertices of a regular [[icosahedron]] are those of [[3|three]] mutually [[orthogonal]] golden rectangles.

There is no known general [[algorithm]] to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, ''[[Thomson problem]]''). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal [[surface area]] and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/{{math|''φ''}} ≅ 222.5°. This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory [[artificial satellite|satellite]] [[STARSHINE|Starshine-3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast09oct_1/ |title=A Disco Ball in Space |publisher=NASA |date=2001-10-09 |accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden triangle, pentagon and pentagram====
[[File:Golden triangle (math).svg|right|thumb|[[Golden triangle (mathematics)|Golden triangle]]. The double-red-arched angle is 36 degrees, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{5}&lt;/math&gt; radians.]]

=====Golden triangle=====
The [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]] can be characterized as an [[isosceles triangle]] ABC with the property that [[bisection|bisecting]] the angle C produces a new [[triangle]] CXB which is a [[similar triangle]] to the original.

If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.

Suppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length {{math|''φ''}}. Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length&amp;nbsp;φ. Length AC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AB, therefore equals {{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BC/BX, AC/{{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ/1, and so AC also equals {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, confirming that {{math|''φ''}} is indeed the golden ratio.

Similarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to {{math|''φ''}}, while the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] ratio is&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

=====Pentagon=====
In a [[pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]] the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"/&gt;

=====Odom's construction=====
[[File:Odom.svg|thumb|218 px|Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF. Extend AB to meet the circumcircle of DEF at C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|AB|}{|BC|}=\tfrac{|AC|}{|AB|}=\phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[George Phillips Odom, Jr|George Odom]] has given a remarkably simple construction for {{φ}} involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' accompanied by the single word "Behold!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quandaries and Queries|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/QQ.09.02/mary1.html|publisher=Math Central|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Chris and Penny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pentagram=====
The golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of [[pentagram]]s. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is {{φ}}, as the four-color illustration shows.

The pentagram includes ten [[isosceles triangle]]s: five [[acute triangle|acute]] and five [[obtuse triangle|obtuse]] isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is {{φ}}. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.

=====Ptolemy's theorem=====
[[File:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|thumb|The golden ratio in a regular pentagon can be computed using [[Ptolemy's theorem]].]]

The golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying [[Ptolemy's theorem]] to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are ''b'', and short edges are ''a'', then Ptolemy's theorem gives ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ab'' which yields

:&lt;math&gt;{b \over a}={{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Scalenity of triangles====
Consider a [[triangle]] with sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in decreasing order. Define the "scalenity" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios ''a''/''b'' and ''b''/''c''. The scalenity is always less than {{φ}} and can be made as close as desired to {{φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triangle whose sides form a geometric progression====
If the side lengths of a triangle form a [[geometric progression]] and are in the ratio 1 : ''r'' : ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the common ratio, then ''r'' must lie in the range {{φ}}−1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}, which is a consequence of the [[triangle inequality]] (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If ''r'' = {{φ}} then the shorter two sides are 1 and {{φ}} but their sum is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, thus ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}. A similar calculation shows that ''r'' &gt; {{φ}}−1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : {{radic|{{φ}}}} : {{φ}} is a right triangle (because 1 + {{φ}} = {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) known as a [[Kepler triangle]].&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

====Golden triangle, rhombus, and rhombic triacontahedron====
[[File:GoldenRhombus.svg|thumb|One of the rhombic triacontahedron's rhombi]]

[[File:Rhombictriacontahedron.svg|thumb|All of the faces of the rhombic triacontahedron are golden rhombi]]

A [[golden rhombus]] is a [[rhombus]] whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The [[rhombic triacontahedron]] is a [[convex polytope]] that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi.  In the [[rhombic triacontahedron]] the [[dihedral angle]] between any two adjacent rhombi is 144°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catalan solids derived from three-dimensional-root systems and quaternions|first1=Mehmet|last1=Koca|first2=Nazife Ozdes|last2=Koca|first3=Ramazan|last3=Koç|journal=	Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=51|year=2010|page=043501|doi=10.1063/1.3356985|arxiv=0908.3272|bibcode=2010JMP....51d3501K}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Fibonacci sequence===
The mathematics of the golden ratio and of the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:

:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

A [[closed-form expression]] for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right)
 = {{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n} \over {\sqrt 5}}
 = {{\varphi^n-(-\varphi)^{-n}} \over {\sqrt 5}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Golden Square fractal with T-branching 8.svg|thumb|Golden squares with [[T-square (fractal)|T-branching]]]]
[[File:Golden Square fractal 6.svg|thumb|Golden square fractal]]

The golden ratio is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by [[Kepler]]:&lt;ref name="tatt"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates {{φ}}; e.g., 987/610&amp;nbsp;{{math|≈}}&amp;nbsp;1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than {{φ}}, and converge to {{φ}} as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|F_n\varphi-F_{n+1}|

= \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+a}}{F_n} = \varphi^a,&lt;/math&gt;

where above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when &lt;math&gt;a = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the successive powers of {{φ}} obey the Fibonacci [[recurrence relation|recurrence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{n+1} = \varphi^n + \varphi^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This identity allows any polynomial in {{φ}} to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
3\varphi^3 - 5\varphi^2 + 4 &amp; = 3(\varphi^2 + \varphi) - 5\varphi^2 + 4 \\
&amp; = 3[(\varphi + 1) + \varphi] - 5(\varphi + 1) + 4 \\
&amp; = \varphi + 2 \approx 3.618.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^k=F_k \varphi +F_{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th Fibonacci number.

However, this is no special property of {{φ}}, because polynomials in any solution ''x'' to a [[quadratic equation]] can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;
for given coefficients ''a'', ''b'' such that ''x'' satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any [[rational function]] (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree {{nowrap|''n'' ‒ 1.}}  Phrased in terms of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], if α is a root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial, then &lt;math&gt;\Q(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; has degree ''n'' over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;, with basis &lt;math&gt;\{1, \alpha, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetries===
The golden ratio and inverse golden ratio &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\pm = (1\pm \sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the [[fractional linear transformation]]s &lt;math&gt;x, 1/(1-x), (x-1)/x,&lt;/math&gt; – this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.
Further, they are interchanged by the three maps &lt;math&gt;1/x, 1-x, x/(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; – they are reciprocals, symmetric about &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.

More deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{Z})&lt;/math&gt; isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] on 3 letters, &lt;math&gt;S_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; of 3 standard points on the [[projective line]], and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map &lt;math&gt;S_3 \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; – the subgroup &lt;math&gt;C_3 &lt; S_3&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity &lt;math&gt;() (0 1 \infty) (0 \infty 1)&lt;/math&gt; fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.

===Other properties===
The golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see ''Alternate forms'' above). It is, for that reason, one of the [[continued fraction#A property of the golden ratio φ|worst cases]] of [[Lagrange's approximation theorem]] and it is an extremal case of the [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz inequality]] for [[Diophantine approximation]]s. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in [[phyllotaxis]] (the growth of plants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html Fibonacci Numbers and Nature – Part 2 : Why is the Golden section the "best" arrangement?], from [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/ Dr. Ron Knott's] [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/ Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section], retrieved 2012-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with {{φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1 = 2.618\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1 = 0.618\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of powers of {{φ}} contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,
any power of {{φ}} is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-2} = \varphi \cdot \operatorname{F}_n + \operatorname{F}_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, one can easily decompose any power of {{φ}} into a multiple of {{φ}} and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of {{φ}}:

If &lt;math&gt; \lfloor n/2 - 1 \rfloor = m &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-3} + \cdots + \varphi^{n-1-2m} + \varphi^{n-2-2m} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n - \varphi^{n-1} = \varphi^{n-2} . &lt;/math&gt;

When the golden ratio is used as the base of a [[numeral system]] (see [[Golden ratio base]], sometimes dubbed ''phinary'' or {{φ}}''-nary''), every integer has a terminating representation, despite {{φ}} being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.

The golden ratio is a [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]] of the [[algebraic number field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; and is a [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PisotNumber |title=Pisot Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \sqrt{5}} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Lucas number]].

The golden ratio also appears in [[hyperbolic geometry]], as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an [[ideal triangle]] to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the [[equilateral triangle]] formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is &lt;math&gt;4\log(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabri.net/abracadabri/GeoNonE/GeoHyper/KBModele/Biss3KB.html Horocycles exinscrits : une propriété hyperbolique remarquable], cabri.net, retrieved 2009-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimal expansion===
The golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1+\sqrt{5} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{radic|5}} ≈ 2.2360679774997896964 {{OEIS2C|id=A002163}}. The [[square root of 5]] can be calculated with the [[Babylonian method]], starting with an initial estimate such as ''x''{{φ}} = 2 and [[iterative method|iterating]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{(x_n + 5/x_n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.

The Babylonian algorithm for {{radic|5}} is equivalent to [[Newton's method]] for solving the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any [[algebraic equation]], including the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 1}{2x_n - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

for an appropriate initial estimate ''x''{{φ}} such as ''x''{{φ}} = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 2x_n}{x_n^2 + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

These iterations all [[quadratic convergence|converge quadratically]]; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]]. The time needed to compute ''n'' digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two ''n''-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the [[transcendental number]]s '''[[pi|{{pi}}]]''' and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|'''e'''}}]].

An easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25001&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25000&lt;/sub&gt;, each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.

The decimal expansion of the golden ratio {{φ}}&lt;ref name="a001622"/&gt; has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ({{val|2|e=12}} = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.numberworld.org/digits/GoldenRatio/ |title=Golden Ratio |first= Alexander J. |last=Yee |date=17 August 2015 |website=numberword.org}}  Independent computations done by Ron Watkins and Dustin Kirkland.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Graduate Management Admission Test''' ('''GMAT''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|m|æ|t}} ({{respell|JEE|mat}}))) is a [[Computerized adaptive testing|computer adaptive test]] (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/the-gmat-advantage.aspx|title=The GMAT Advantage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires knowledge of certain specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test owning company, the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/learn-about-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Learn About the GMAT Exam|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taken up to five times a year.  Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-exam-policies.aspx| title =GMAT Exam Policies| website =MBA.com| publisher =GMAC| access-date =March 8, 2016| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. [[Business schools]] use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate [[management]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Finance]] programs and others. The GMAT is administered in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing acceptability of [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-26/study-few-mba-applicants-consider-taking-the-gre |title=Study: Few MBA Applicants Consider Taking the GRE |author=Alison Damast |date=April 26, 2012 |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, it has continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that the exam predicts success in business school programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/about-the-gmat-exam/validity-reliability-fairness.aspx|title=Validity, Reliability and Fairness|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1953, the organization now called the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC) began as an association of nine [[business schools]], whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years, it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|title=GMAC Statistics Video|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504061935/http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|archivedate=May 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/integrated-reasoning.aspx | title =Integrated Reasoning Section | website =MBA.com | publisher =GMAC | access-date =March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The intended purpose of the GMAT is to predict student success in graduate business programs.  According to GMAC, there is a .459 correlation (21% variance) between total GMAT scores and mid-program student grades based on data it collected between 1997 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmac.com/market-intelligence-and-research/research-library/validity-and-testing/research-reports-validity-related/gmat-validity-study-summary-report-for-1997-to-2004.aspx |title=GMAT Validity Study Summary Report for 1997 to 2004 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent research has shown significantly different results.  Independent research has shown that the GMAT can explain only 4.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA (Grade Point Average) while undergraduate GPA can explain 17.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bedsole |first=Charles B. |url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/bedsole_charles_b_201312_edd.pdf |title=Apples to Apples?: Comparing the Predictive Validity of the GMAT and GRE for Business Schools and Building a Better Admissions Formula |publisher=University of Georgia. |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more recent independent research has shown that the GMAT does not add predictive validity after undergraduate GPA and work experience have been considered and that even undergraduate GPA alone can be used in lieu of considering the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pratt |first=William R. |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08832323.2015.1027164 |title=Predicting MBA Student Success and Streamlining the Admissions Process |publisher=Journal of Education for Business |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and timing==
The GMAT exam consists of four sections: an analytical writing assessment, an integrated reasoning section, a quantitative section, and a verbal section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/us/gmat-adds-new-thinking-cap.html?_r=1&amp;ref=education |title=GMAT Adds New Thinking Cap|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total testing time is three hours and seven minutes. Test takers have 30 minutes for the analytical writing assessment and another 30 minutes to work through 12 questions, which often have multiple parts, on the integrated reasoning section and are given 62 minutes to work through 31 questions in the quantitative section and another 65 minutes to get through 36 questions in the verbal section.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Section !! Duration in minutes !! Number of questions
|-
| Analytical writing assessment || 30 || 1 essay
|-
| Integrated reasoning || 30 || 12
|-
| Quantitative || 62 || 31
|-
| Verbal || 65 || 36
|}

The quantitative and verbal sections of the GMAT exam are both multiple-choice and are administered in the computer-adaptive format, adjusting to a test taker’s level of ability. At the start of the quantitative and verbal sections, test takers are presented with a question of average difficulty. As questions are answered correctly, the computer presents the test taker with increasingly difficult questions and as questions are answered incorrectly the computer presents the test taker with questions of decreasing difficulty. This process continues until test takers complete each section, at which point the computer will have an accurate assessment of their ability level in that subject area and come up with a raw score for each section.

On July 11, 2017, the GMAC announced that from now on the order in which the different parts of the GMAT are taken can be chosen at the beginning of the exam.

Three options will be available at the test center:
* Analytical Writing Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, Verbal (original order)
* Verbal, Quantitative, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment
* Quantitative, Verbal, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing.aspx|title=GMAT changes order of sections.|last=|first=|date=|website=GMAT Exam Format and Timing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the GMAC officially shortened the test by half an hour, shortening the verbal and quant sections from 75 minutes each to 65 and 62 minutes, respectively, and shortening some of the instruction screens.

===Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)===
The AWA consists of one 30-minute writing task—analysis of an argument. It is important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay will be given two independent ratings and these ratings are averaged together to determine the test taker's AWA score. One rating is given by a computerized reading evaluation and another is given by a person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without knowledge of what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring engine is an electronic system that evaluates more than 50 structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas, syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differ by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader is required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmac.com/gmat/understand-gmat-exam-scores/how-to-use-the-analytical-writing-assessment-score.aspx |title=How to use the Analytical Writing Assessment Score|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytical writing assessment is graded on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) in half-point intervals (a score of zero means the answer was gibberish or obviously not written on the assigned topic or the test taker failed to write anything at all on the AWA).

===Integrated reasoning===
Integrated Reasoning (IR) is a section introduced in June 2012 and is designed to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills being tested by the integrated reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for today’s incoming students.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-21/the-new-gmat-gets-put-to-the-test|title=The GMAT gets put to the Test|publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated reasoning section consists of 12 questions (which often consist of multiple parts themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Integrated reasoning scores range from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), this section is scored separately from the quantitative and verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA sections do not contribute to the total GMAT score.

The integrated reasoning section includes four question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part analysis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In the table analysis section, test takers are presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column.

===Quantitative section===
The quantitative section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, interpret graphic data, and analyze and use information given in a problem. Questions require knowledge of certain algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. There are two types of quantitative questions: problem solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph paper which are given to them at the testing center.  Scores range from 0 to 60, although GMAC only reports scores between 6 and 51.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Rudner|title=Demystifying the GMAT: Scale Scores|url=http://www.gmac.com/~/media/Files/gmac/Research/validity-and-testing/demystifyingthegmat_scalescores.pdf|publisher=GMAC|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem solving questions are designed to test the ability to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems. Data sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and determine at what point there is enough information to solve a problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information given to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/understanding-your-score-report.aspx|title=Understanding Your Score Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal section===
The verbal section of the GMAT exam includes the following question types: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. Each question type gives five answer options from which to select. Verbal scores range from 0 to 60; however, scores below 9 or above 44 are rare.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

According to GMAC, the reading comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-reading-comprehension-question.aspx | title =Sample Reading Comprehension Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-critical-reasoning-question.aspx | title =Sample Critical Reasoning Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests grammar and effective communication skills. From the available answer options, the test taker should select the most effective construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2011/sep/idioms-sentence-correction-and-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Idioms, Sentence Correction, and the GMAT Exam|work=The Official GMAT Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-sentence-correction-question.aspx|title=Sample Sentence Correction Question|work=The Official GMAT Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.).

The score distribution conforms to a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] with a [[standard deviation]] of approximately 120 points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and 670.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; More precisely, over the three-year period 2014--2017 the mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/what-your-percentile-ranking-means.aspx|title=What Your Percentile Ranking Means. Retrieved October 5th, 2017.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question his score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talento-Miller|first1=Eileen|title=The CAT in the GMAT|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2010/jan/the-cat-in-the-gmat.aspx|website=MBA.com|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After previewing his/her unofficial GMAT score, a GMAT test taker has two minutes to decide whether to keep or cancel a GMAT score at the test center.  A test taker can also cancel a score online within the 72 hours after the scheduled exam start time.  A cancelled score can be reinstated for 4 years and 11 months after the date of the test for a fee of $50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-scores-and-score-reports.aspx|website=MBA.com|title=GMAT Scores and Score Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling and preparing for the exam==
Test takers may register for the GMAT either online at mba.com or by calling one of the test centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/schedule-a-gmat-appointment/scheduling-information.aspx|title=Scheduling Information|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To schedule an exam, an appointment must be made at one of the designated test centers. The GMAT may not be taken more than once within 16 days but no more than five times in a rolling 12-month period and no more than eight times total, even if the scores are canceled. Official GMAT exam study materials are available on the mba.com online store and through third-party vendors. The cost of the exam is $250. All applicants are required to present valid ID when taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/prepare-for-the-gmat-exam/plan-for-test-day/presenting-proper-identification.aspx |title=Presenting proper Identification}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of the test, test takers have the option of canceling or reporting their scores.  As of July 2014, test takers were allowed to view their score before making this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-scoring/your-score-report/preview-your-gmat-score.aspx |title=Preview Your GMAT Score  |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[test preparation]] companies that offer GMAT courses. Other available test preparation resources include university text books, GMAT preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/reach-and-recruit-students/prepare-candidates-for-the-exam-classroom.aspx| |title=Prepare Candidates for the GMAT® Exam &amp; the Classroom |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council |accessdate=November 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GMAT Waiver ==
In order to effectively evaluate all candidates, some graduate schools offer GMAT Waivers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/articles/2017-06-05/what-mba-applicants-should-know-about-test-waivers-test-optional-programs|title=What MBA Applicants Should Know|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GMAT waiver is designed for working professionals who have multiple years of experience and would like to forego taking the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onlinebusiness.syr.edu/mba/gmat-waiver-policy/|title=Why Our Online MBA Doesn't Require the GMAT I MBA@Syracuse GMAT Waiver Policy|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If requesting a GMAT waiver, you must include a letter with your professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/2205/4-easy-steps-to-get-a-gmat-waiver.html|title=4 Easy Steps to Get a GMAT Waiver - MastersPortal.com|website=www.mastersportal.com|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs evaluate GMAT waivers on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Linguistics |applied}}

'''Linguistic anthropology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study of how language influences social life. It is a branch of [[anthropology]] that originated from the endeavor to document [[endangered language]]s, and has grown over the past century to encompass most aspects of [[language structure]] and use.&lt;ref name="Duranti2004"&gt;Duranti, Alessandro (ed.), 2004: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jMmmQjssaEC ''Companion to Linguistic Anthropology''], Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic anthropology explores how language shapes communication, forms social identity and group membership, organizes large-scale cultural beliefs and ideologies, and develops a common cultural representation of natural and [[social world]]s.&lt;ref name="SLA"&gt;Society for Linguistic Anthropology. n.d. [http://www.linguisticanthropology.org/about/ About the Society for Linguistic Anthropology] (accessed 7 July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical development==
Linguistic anthropology emerged from the development of three distinct [[paradigm]]s.These paradigms set the ways of approaching linguistic anthropology: the first, now known as "[[anthropological linguistics]]", focuses on the documentation of languages; the second, known as "linguistic anthropology", engages in theoretical studies of language use; the third, developed over the past two or three decades, studies issues from other sub-fields of anthropology with linguistic tactics. Though they developed sequentially, all three paradigms are still practiced today.&lt;ref name=Duranti2003&gt;Duranti, Alessandro. 2003. Language as Culture in U.S. Anthropology: Three Paradigms. ''Current Anthropology'' 44(3):323–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Paradigm: Anthropological linguistics===
{{main|Anthropological linguistics}}
The first paradigm is known as anthropological linguistics. The field is devoted to themes unique to the sub-discipline: documentation of [[language]]s that were then seen as doomed to [[extinction]], with special focus on the languages of native North American tribes. It is also the paradigm most focused on linguistics.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt; The themes include:

* Grammatical description,
*[[Linguistic typology|Typological classification]] and
*[[Linguistic relativity]]

===Second Paradigm: Linguistic anthropology===
 The second paradigm can be marked by the switch from anthropological linguistics to linguistic anthropology, signalling a more anthropological focus on the study. This term was coined by [[Dell Hymes]], who was also responsible for the idea of [[ethnography]] of [[communication]].  This term was Hymes' vision for the future of linguistic anthropology, where language would be studied in the context of the situation, and relative to the community speaking it.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt; This new era would involve many of the new technological developments, such as mechanical recording.

Hymes had many revolutionary contributions to linguistic anthropology, the first of which was a new [[unit of analysis]]. Unlike the first paradigm, which focused on linguistic tools like measuring of [[phoneme]]s and [[morpheme]]s, the second paradigm's unit of analysis was the "speech event". A speech event is an event defined by speech occurring during it (ex. a lecture, debate). This is different from a speech situation, where speech could possibly occur (ex. dinner). Hymes also pioneered a linguistic anthropological approach to [[ethnopoetics]]. Hymes had hoped that this paradigm would link linguistic anthropology more to anthropology. However, Hymes' ambition backfired as the second paradigm marked a distancing of the sub-discipline from the rest of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;Bauman, Richard. 1977. "Verbal Art as Performance." ''American Anthropologist'' 77:290–311. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1975.77.2.02a00030}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hymes1981"&gt;Hymes, Dell. 1981 [1975] Breakthrough into Performance. In ''In Vain I Tried to Tell You: Essays in Native American Ethnopoetics''. D. Hymes, ed. Pp. 79–141. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third Paradigm: Anthropological issues studied via linguistic methods and data ===
The third paradigm, which began in the late 1980s, refocused on anthropology by providing a linguistic approach to anthropological issues. Rather than focusing on exploring language, third paradigm anthropologists focus on studying culture with linguistic tools. Themes include:

* investigations of personal and social [[Identity (social science)|identities]]
* shared [[Ideology|ideologies]]
* construction of [[narrative]] in interactions among individuals

Furthermore, like how the second paradigm made use of new technology in its studies, the third paradigm heavily includes use of video documentation to support research.&lt;ref name="Duranti2003" /&gt;

== Areas of interest ==
Contemporary linguistic anthropology continues research in all three of the paradigms described above: documentation of languages, study of language through context, and study of identity through linguistic means. The third paradigm, the study of anthropological issues, is a particularly rich area of study for current linguistic anthropologists.

===Identity and intersubjectivity===
A great deal of work in linguistic anthropology investigates questions of sociocultural [[cultural identity|identity]] linguistically and discursively. Linguistic anthropologist [[Don Kulick]] has done so in relation to identity, for example, in a series of settings, first in a village called Gapun in Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref name=Kulick1992&gt;Kulick, Don. 1992. ''Language Shift and Cultural Reproduction: Socialization, Self and Syncretism in a Papua New Guinea Village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He explored how the use of two languages with and around children in Gapun village: the traditional language ([[Taiap language|Taiap]]), not spoken anywhere but in their own village and thus primordially "indexical" of Gapuner identity, and [[Tok Pisin]], the widely circulating official language of New Guinea. ("indexical" points to meanings beyond the immediate context.)&lt;ref name=Silverstein1976&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1976. Shifters, Linguistic Categories, and Cultural Description. In ''Meaning in Anthropology''. K. Basso and H.A. Selby, eds. Pp. 11–56. Albuquerque: School of American Research, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To speak the [[Taiap language]] is associated with one identity: not only local but "Backward" and also an identity based on the display of *hed* (personal autonomy). To speak Tok Pisin is to [[Indexicality|index]] a modern, Christian (Catholic) identity, based not on *hed* but on *save*, an identity linked with the will and the skill to cooperate. In later work, Kulick demonstrates that certain loud speech performances in Brazil called *um escândalo*, Brazilian ''travesti'' (roughly, 'transvestite') sex workers shame clients. The travesti community, the argument goes, ends up at least making a powerful attempt to transcend the shame the larger Brazilian public might try to foist off on them, again by loud public discourse and other modes of [[performance]].&lt;ref name=Kulick&amp;Klein&gt;Kulick, Don, and Charles H. Klein. 2003. Scandalous Acts: The Politics of Shame among Brazilian Travesti Prostitutes. In ''Recognition Struggles and Social Movements: Contested Identities, Agency and Power''. B. Hobson, ed. Pp. 215–238. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, scholars such as [[Émile Benveniste]]&lt;ref&gt;Benveniste, Emile. 1971. Problems in general linguistics. Miami: University of Miami Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Mary Bucholtz]] and [[Kira Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz, M., &amp; Hall, K. 2005. Identity and interaction: A sociocultural linguistic approach. Discourse Studies, 7(4–5), 585–614.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Lee (academic)|Benjamin Lee]]&lt;ref&gt; Lee, Benjamin. 1997. Talking Heads: Language, Metalanguage, and the Semiotics of Subjectivity. Durham: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Paul Kockelman]]&lt;ref&gt;Kockelman, Paul. 2004. Stance and Subjectivity. Journal of Linguistic Anthropology, 14(2), 127–150.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Stanton Wortham]]&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Stanton. 2006. Learning identity: The joint emergence of social identification and academic learning. New York, NY, US: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (among many others) have contributed to understandings of identity as "intersubjectivity" by examining the ways it is discursively constructed.

===Socialization===
In a series of studies, linguistic anthropologists [[Elinor Ochs]] and [[Bambi Schieffelin]] addressed the anthropological topic of [[socialization]] (the process by which infants, children, and foreigners become members of a community, learning to participate in its culture), using linguistic and other ethnographic methods.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, Elinor. 1988. ''Culture and language development: Language acquisition and language socialization in a Samoan village''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
*Ochs, Elinor, and Bambi Schieffelin. 1984. Language Acquisition and Socialization: Three Developmental Stories and Their Implications. In ''Culture Theory: Essays on Mind, Self, and Emotion''. R. Shweder and R.A. LeVine, eds. Pp. 276–320. New York: Cambridge University.
*Ochs, Elinor, and Carolyn Taylor. 2001. The “Father Knows Best” Dynamic in Dinnertime Narratives. In ''Linguistic Anthropology: A Reader''. A. Duranti, ed. Pp. 431–449. Oxford. Malden, MA: Blackwell.
*Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1990. ''The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that the processes of [[enculturation]] and socialization do not occur apart from the process of [[language acquisition]], but that children acquire language and culture together in what amounts to an integrated process. Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that [[baby talk]] is not [[universal proposition|universal]], that the direction of adaptation (whether the child is made to adapt to the ongoing situation of speech around it or vice versa) was a variable that correlated, for example, with the direction it was held vis-à-vis a caregiver's body. In many societies caregivers hold a child facing outward so as to orient it to a network of kin whom it must learn to recognize early in life.

Ochs and Schieffelin demonstrated that members of all societies socialize children both ''to'' and ''through'' the use of language. Ochs and Schieffelin uncovered how, through naturally occurring stories told during dinners in white [[middle class]] households in [[Southern California]], both mothers and fathers participated in replicating [[Patriarchy|male dominance]] (the "father knows best" syndrome) by the distribution of participant roles such as protagonist (often a child but sometimes mother and almost never the father) and "problematizer" (often the father, who raised uncomfortable questions or challenged the competence of the protagonist). When mothers collaborated with children to get their stories told, they unwittingly set themselves up to be subject to this process.

Schieffelin's more recent research has uncovered the socializing role of [[pastor]]s and other fairly new Bosavi converts in the [[Southern Highlands, Papua New Guinea]] community she studies.&lt;ref name=Schieffelin1995&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1995. Creating evidence: Making sense of written words in Bosavi. ''Pragmatics'' 5(2):225–244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2000. Introducing Kaluli Literacy: A Chronology of Influences. In ''Regimes of Language''. P. Kroskrity, ed. Pp. 293–327. Santa Fe: School of American Research Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2002&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2002. Marking time: The dichotomizing discourse of multiple temporalities. ''Current Anthropology'' 43(Supplement):S5-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2006&gt;Schieffelin, Bambi B. 2006. PLENARY ADDRESS: Found in translating: Reflexive language across time and texts in Bosavi, PNG. Twelve Annual Conference on Language, Interaction, and Culture, University of California, Los Angeles, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Pastors have introduced new ways of conveying knowledge,  new linguistic [[epistemic]] markers&lt;ref name=Schieffelin1995/&gt;—and new ways of speaking about time.&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2002/&gt; And they have struggled with and largely resisted those parts of the Bible that speak of being able to know the inner states of others (e.g. the [[gospel of Mark]], chapter 2, verses 6–8).&lt;ref name=Schieffelin2006/&gt;

===Ideologies===
In a third example of the current (third) paradigm, since [[Roman Jakobson]]'s student [[Michael Silverstein]] opened the way, there has been an efflorescence of work done by linguistic anthropologists on the major anthropological theme of [[ideologies]],&lt;ref name=Silverstein1979&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1979. Language Structure and Linguistic Ideology. In ''The Elements: A Parasession on Linguistic Units and Levels''. R. Cline, W. Hanks, and C. Hofbauer, eds. Pp. 193–247. Chicago: Chicago Linguistic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;—in this case "[[language ideology|language ideologies]]", sometimes defined as "shared bodies of [[commonsense]] notions about the nature of language in the world."&lt;ref name=Rumsey&gt;Rumsey, Alan. 1990. "Word, meaning, and linguistic ideology." ''American Anthropologist'' 92(2):346–361. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1990.92.2.02a00060}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silverstein has demonstrated that these ideologies are not mere [[false consciousness]] but actually influence the evolution of linguistic structures, including the dropping of "[[thee]]" and "[[thou]]" from everyday [[English language|English]] usage.&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 1985. Language and the Culture of Gender: At the Intersection of Structure, Usage, and Ideology. In ''Semiotic Mediation: Sociocultural and Psychological Perspectives''. E. Mertz and R. Parmentier, eds. Pp. 219–259. Orlando: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolard, in her overview of "[[Code-switching|code switching]]", or the systematic practice of alternating linguistic varieties within a conversation or even a single utterance, finds the underlying question anthropologists ask of the practice—Why do they do that?—reflects a dominant linguistic ideology. It is the ideology that people should "really" be monoglot and efficiently targeted toward referential clarity rather than diverting themselves with the messiness of multiple varieties in play at a single time.&lt;ref&gt;Woolard, Kathryn A. 2004. Codeswitching. In ''Companion to Linguistic Anthropology''. A. Duranti, ed. Pp. 73–94. Malden: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much research on linguistic ideologies probes subtler influences on language, such as the pull exerted on Tewa, a Kiowa-Tanoan language spoken in certain New Mexican pueblos and on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona, by "kiva speech", discussed in the next section.&lt;ref&gt;Kroskrity, Paul V. 1998. Arizona Tewa Kiva Speech as a Manifestation of Linguistic Ideology. In ''Language ideologies: Practice and theory''. B.B. Schieffelin, K.A. Woolard, and P. Kroskrity, eds. Pp. 103–122. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other linguists have carried out research in the areas of [[language contact]], [[language endangerment]], and '[[English as a global language]]'. For instance, Indian linguist [[Braj Kachru]] investigated local varieties of English in South Asia, the ways in which [[English as a lingua franca|English functions as a lingua franca]] among multicultural groups in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Braj B. Kachru|title=Asian Englishes: Beyond the Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TTW-AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR7|year=2005|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-665-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; British linguist David Crystal has contributed to investigations of [[language death]] attention to the effects of cultural assimilation resulting in the spread of one dominant language in situations of colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Crystal|title=Language Death|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_8K0BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-43181-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social space===
In a final example of this third paradigm, a group of linguistic anthropologists have done very creative work on the idea of social space. Duranti published a groundbreaking article on [[Samoan language|Samoan]] [[greetings]] and their use and transformation of social space.&lt;ref name=Duranti1992&gt;Duranti, Alessandro. 1992. "Language and Bodies in Social Space: Samoan Greetings." ''American Anthropologist'' 94:657–691. {{doi|10.1525/aa.1992.94.3.02a00070}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before that, Indonesianist Joseph Errington, making use of earlier work by Indonesianists not necessarily concerned with language issues per se, brought linguistic anthropological methods (and [[semiotic]] theory) to bear on the notion of the exemplary center, the center of political and ritual power from which emanated exemplary behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Errington, J. Joseph. 1988.  ''Structure and Style in Javanese: A Semiotic View of Linguistic Etiquette''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Errington demonstrated how the [[Java]]nese *[[priyayi]]*, whose ancestors served at the Javanese royal courts, became emissaries, so to speak, long after those courts had ceased to exist, representing throughout Java the highest example of "refined speech." The work of Joel Kuipers develops this theme vis-a-vis the island of [[Sumba]], [[Indonesia]]. And, even though it pertains to [[Tewa people|Tewa]] Indians in [[Arizona]] rather than Indonesians, [[Paul Kroskrity]]'s argument that speech forms originating in the Tewa [[kiva]] (or underground ceremonial space) forms the dominant model for all Tewa speech can be seen as a direct parallel.

Silverstein tries to find the maximum theoretical significance and applicability in this idea of exemplary centers. He feels, in fact, that the exemplary center idea is one of linguistic anthropology's three most important findings. He generalizes the notion thus, arguing "there are wider-scale institutional 'orders of interactionality,' historically contingent yet structured. Within such large-scale, macrosocial orders, in-effect [[ritual]] centers of [[semiosis]] come to exert a structuring, [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]-conferring influence on any particular event of discursive [[Social interaction|interaction]] with respect to the meanings and significance of the verbal and other semiotic forms used in it."&lt;ref name=Silverstein2004&gt;Silverstein, Michael. 2004. {{"'}}Cultural' Concepts and the Language-Culture Nexus." ''Current Anthropology'' 45(5):621–652.&lt;/ref&gt; Current approaches to such classic anthropological topics as ritual by linguistic anthropologists emphasize not static linguistic structures but the unfolding in realtime of a {{"'}}hypertrophic' set of parallel orders of [[iconicity]] and indexicality that seem to cause the ritual to create its own sacred space through what appears, often, to be the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] of textual and nontextual metricalizations, synchronized."&lt;ref name=Silverstein2004/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilce, James M. 2006. Magical Laments and Anthropological Reflections: The Production and Circulation of Anthropological Text as Ritual Activity. ''Current Anthropology''. 47(6):891–914.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race, Class, and Gender===
Addressing the broad central concerns of the subfield and drawing from its core theories, many scholars focus on the intersections of language and the particularly salient social constructs of race (and ethnicity), class, and gender (and sexuality). These works generally consider the roles of social structures (e.g., ideologies and institutions) related to race, class, and gender (e.g., marriage, labor, pop culture, education) in terms of their constructions and in terms of individuals' lived experiences. A short list of linguistic anthropological texts that address these topics follows:

The '''Mingun Bell''' ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းကွန်းခေါင်းလောင်းတော်ကြီး}} {{IPA-my|mɪ́ɴɡʊ́ɴ kʰáʊɴláʊɴ dɔ̀ dʑí|}}) is a [[bell (instrument)|bell]] located in [[Mingun]], [[Sagaing Region]], [[Myanmar]]. It is located approximately {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mandalay]] on the western bank of the [[Irrawaddy River]]. It was the heaviest functioning bell in the world at several times in history. 

==Description==
The weight of the bell is 55,555 [[Burmese units of measurement#Mass|viss]] ({{convert|90,718|kg|lb|0|disp=or}}). This number is conveniently remembered by many people in Myanmar as a mnemonic "''Min Hpyu Hman Hman Pyaw''" ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းဖြူမှန်မှန်ပြော}}), with the consonants representing the number 5 in Burmese astronomy and numerology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-museum/largest-ringing-bell.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909082625/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-museum/largest-ringing-bell.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=The Mingun Bell |publisher=Myanmar's Net Inc. |accessdate=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-mandalay/mingun.htm|title=Mingun|publisher=Myanmar's Net Inc.|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the bell and its mnemonic words are written on the surface of the bell in white.

The outer diameter of the rim of the bell is {{convert|16|ft|3|in|m|2}}. The height of the bell is {{convert|12.0|ft|m|2}} on the exterior and {{convert|11.5|ft|m|2}} in the interior. The outside circumference at the rim is {{convert|50.75|ft|m|3}}. The bell is {{convert|6|to(-)|12|in|cm|0}} thick and stands {{convert|20.7|ft|m|2}} high from the rim to the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/8-2001/min.htm|title=The Mingun Bell|publisher=Ni Ni Myint, (www.myanmar.gov.mm)|accessdate=2008-04-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706051545/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/8-2001/min.htm|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bell is uncracked and in good ringing condition. The bell does not have a clanger but is rung by striking the outer edge.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

==History==
{{multiple image|right|direction=vertical|image1=Mingun Bell 1873.jpg|width=200|image2=Mingun Bell 1896.jpg|footer=Mingun Bell in 1873 (top) and 1896}}
Casting of the bell started in 1808 and was finished by 1810. King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782–1819) had this gigantic bell cast to go with his huge [[stupa]], [[Mingun Pahtodawgyi]]. The bell was said to have been cast on the opposite side of the river and was transported by using two boats, which after crossing the river, proceeded up two specially built canals. The canals were then dammed and the bell was lifted by raising the water level by the addition of earth into the blocked canal. In this way the bell was originally suspended.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

The Mingun Bell was knocked off its supports as a result of a large [[earthquake]] on 23 March 1839. It was resuspended by the [[Irrawaddy Flotilla Company]] in March 1896 using screw jacks and levers using funds from public subscription. The party to celebrate was attended by many and an hourly boat was required to take visitors from nearby [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref name=bird&gt;Bird, George W (1897). [http://dlxs.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=sea&amp;cc=sea&amp;idno=sea282&amp;node=sea282%3A29&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=466''Wanderings in Burma''], pages 318–319. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co., Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felice Beato]] captured a photograph of the bell prior to its resuspension.

==Current status==
At 90 tons, the Mingun Bell reigned as the largest ringing bell in the world until 2000, when it was eclipsed by the 116-ton [[Bell of Good Luck]] at the [[Foquan Temple]], [[Pingdingshan]], [[Henan]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kungfuhome.net/Htmls/Scenic/Scenic_308.shtml Fodushan Scenic Area]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "MEI", like "TEI", describes the governing organization and the markup language. The MEI community solicits input and development directions from specialists in various music research communities, including technologists, librarians, historians, and theorists in a common effort to discuss and define best practices for representing a broad range of musical documents and structures. The results of these discussions are then formalized into the MEI schema, a core set of rules for recording physical and intellectual characteristics of music notation documents. This schema is expressed in an [[XML Schema]] Language, with [[RelaxNG]] being the preferred format.  The MEI schema is developed using the One-Document-Does-it-all (ODD) format, a [[literate programming]] XML format developed by the Text Encoding Initiative.

'''Neuroinformatics''' is a research field concerned with the organization of [[neuroscience]] data by the application of computational models and analytical tools. These areas of research are important for the integration and analysis of increasingly large-volume, high-dimensional, and fine-grain experimental data.  Neuroinformaticians provide computational tools, mathematical models, and create interoperable databases for clinicians and research scientists. Neuroscience is a heterogeneous field, consisting of many and various sub-disciplines (e.g., [[cognitive psychology]], [[behavioral neuroscience]], and [[behavioral genetics]]). In order for our understanding of the brain to continue to deepen, it is necessary that these sub-disciplines are able to share data and findings in a meaningful way; Neuroinformaticians facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Neuroinformatics stands at the intersection of [[neuroscience]] and [[information science]]. Other fields, like [[genomics]], have demonstrated the effectiveness of freely distributed databases and the  application of theoretical and computational models for solving complex problems. In Neuroinformatics, such facilities allow researchers to more easily quantitatively confirm their working theories by computational modeling.  Additionally, neuroinformatics fosters collaborative research—an important fact that facilitates the field's interest in studying the multi-level complexity of the brain.

There are three main directions where neuroinformatics has to be applied:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INCF Strategy Overview|url=http://www.incf.org/documents/incf-core-documents/INCFStrategyOverview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# the development of tools and databases for management and sharing of neuroscience data at all levels of analysis,
# the development of tools for analyzing and modeling neuroscience data,
# the development of computational models of the [[nervous system]] and neural processes.

In the recent decade, as vast amounts of diverse data about the brain were gathered by many research groups, the problem was raised of how to integrate the data from thousands of publications in order to enable efficient tools for further research. The biological and neuroscience data are highly interconnected and complex, and by itself, integration represents a great challenge for scientists.

Combining [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] research and [[brain]] research provides benefits for both fields of science. On one hand, informatics facilitates brain [[data processing]] and data handling, by providing new electronic and software technologies for arranging [[database]]s, modeling and communication in brain research. On the other hand, enhanced discoveries in the field of neuroscience will invoke the development of new methods in [[information technologies]] (IT).

==History==
Starting in 1989, the United States [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), the [[National Institute of Drug Abuse]] (NIDA) and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) provided the  National Academy of Sciences [[Institute of Medicine]] with funds to undertake a careful analysis and study of the need to create databases, share neuroscientific data and to examine how the field of information technology could create the tools needed for the increasing volume and modalities of neuroscientific data. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The positive recommendations were reported in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=1991 |title=Mapping the Brain and Its Functions: Integrating Enabling Technologies into Neuroscience Research |type=Consensus study report |publisher=[[National Academy Press]] |location=Washington, DC |editor1-last=Pechura |editor1-first=Constance M. |editor2-last=Martin |editor2-first=Joseph B. |isbn=978-0-309-04497-4 |doi=10.17226/1816 |doi-access=free |url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/1816/mapping-the-brain-and-its-functions-integrating-enabling-technologies-into }}&lt;/ref&gt; This positive report enabled NIMH, now directed by Allan Leshner, to create the "Human Brain Project" (HBP), with the first grants awarded in 1993. The HBP was led by Koslow along with cooperative efforts of other [[NIH]] Institutes, the NSF, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. The HPG{{Expand acronym|date=September 2017}} and grant-funding initiative in this area slightly preceded the explosive expansion of the World Wide Web. From 1993 through 2004 this program grew to over 100 million dollars in funded grants.

Next, Koslow pursued the globalization of the HPG and neuroinformatics through the [[European Union]] and the [[Office for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), Paris, France. Two particular opportunities occurred in 1996.

* The first was the existence of the US/European Commission Biotechnology Task force co-chaired by Mary Clutter from NSF. Within the mandate of this committee, of which Koslow was a member the United States European Commission Committee on Neuroinformatics was established and co-chaired by Koslow from the United States. This committee resulted in the European Commission initiating support for neuroinformatics in Framework 5 and it has continued to support activities in neuroinformatics research and training.
* A second opportunity for globalization of neuroinformatics occurred when the participating governments of the Mega Science Forum (MSF) of the OECD were asked if they had any new scientific initiatives to bring forward for scientific cooperation around the globe. The [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] requested that agencies in the federal government meet at NIH to decide if cooperation were needed that would be of global benefit. The NIH held a series of meetings in which proposals from different agencies were discussed. The proposal recommendation from the U.S. for the MSF was a combination of the NSF and NIH proposals. Jim Edwards of NSF supported databases and data-sharing in the area of biodiversity; Koslow proposed the HPG as a model for sharing neuroscientific data, with the new moniker of ''neuroinformatics''.

The two related initiates were combined to form the United States proposal on "Biological Informatics". This initiative was supported by the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] and presented at the OECD MSF by Edwards and Koslow. An MSF committee was established on Biological Informatics with two subcommittees: 1. Biodiversity (Chair, James Edwards, NSF), and 2. Neuroinformatics (Chair, Stephen Koslow, NIH). At the end of two years the Neuroinformatics subcommittee of the Biological Working Group issued a report supporting a global neuroinformatics effort. Koslow, working with the NIH and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to establishing a new Neuroinformatics working group to develop specific recommendation to support the more general recommendations of the first report. The Global Science Forum (GSF; renamed from MSF) of the OECD supported this recommendation.

===The International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility===
{{Main|International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
This committee presented 3 recommendations to the member governments of GSF. These recommendations were:

# National neuroinformatics programs should be continued or initiated in each country should have a national node to both provide research resources nationally and to serve as the contact for national and international coordination.
# An [[International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility]] (INCF) should be established. The INCF will coordinate the implementation of a global neuroinformatics network through integration of national neuroinformatics nodes.
# A new international funding scheme should be established. This scheme should eliminate national and disciplinary barriers and provide a most efficient approach to global collaborative research and data sharing. In this new scheme, each country will be expected to fund the participating researchers from their country.

The GSF neuroinformatics committee then developed a business plan for the operation, support and establishment of the INCF which was supported and approved by the GSF Science Ministers at its 2004 meeting. In 2006 the INCF was created and its central office established and set into operation at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden under the leadership of [[Sten Grillner]]. Sixteen countries (Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States), and the EU Commission established the legal basis for the INCF and Programme in International Neuroinformatics (PIN). To date, eighteen countries (Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States) are members of the INCF. Membership is pending for several other countries.

The goal of the INCF is to coordinate and promote international activities in neuroinformatics. The INCF contributes to the development and maintenance of database and computational infrastructure and support mechanisms for neuroscience applications. The system is expected to provide access to all freely accessible human brain data and resources to the international research community. The more general task of INCF is to provide conditions for developing convenient and flexible applications for neuroscience laboratories in order to improve our knowledge about the human brain and its disorders.

===Society for Neuroscience Brain Information Group===
On the foundation of all of these activities, Huda Akil, the 2003 President of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] (SfN) established the Brain Information Group (BIG) to evaluate the importance of neuroinformatics to neuroscience and specifically to the SfN. Following the report from BIG, SfN also established a neuroinformatics committee.

In 2004, SfN announced the Neuroscience Database Gateway (NDG) as a universal resource for neuroscientists through which almost any neuroscience databases and tools may be reached. The NDG was established with funding from NIDA, NINDS and NIMH. The Neuroscience Database Gateway has transitioned to a new enhanced platform, the [[Neuroscience Information Framework]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neuinfo.org{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funded by the NIH Neuroscience BLueprint, the NIF is a dynamic portal providing access to neuroscience-relevant resources (data, tools, materials) from a single search interface. The NIF builds upon the foundation of the NDG, but provides a unique set of tools tailored especially for neuroscientists: a more expansive catalog, the ability to search multiple databases directly from the NIF home page, a custom web index of neuroscience resources, and a neuroscience-focused literature search function.

==Collaboration with other disciplines==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Neuroinformatics is formed at the intersections of the following fields:
{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|
* [[neuroscience]]
* [[computer science]]
* [[biology]]
* [[experimental psychology]]
* [[medicine]]
* [[engineering]]
* [[physical sciences]]
* [[mathematics]]
* [[chemistry]]
}}
Biology is concerned with molecular data (from genes to cell specific expression); medicine and anatomy with the structure of synapses and systems level anatomy; engineering – [[electrophysiology]] (from single channels to scalp surface EEG), brain imaging; computer science – databases, software tools, mathematical sciences – models, chemistry – [[neurotransmitter]]s, etc.  Neuroscience uses all aforementioned experimental and theoretical studies to learn about the brain through its various levels. Medical and biological specialists help to identify the unique cell types, and their elements and anatomical connections. Functions of complex organic molecules and structures, including a myriad of biochemical, molecular, and genetic mechanisms which regulate and control brain function, are determined by specialists in chemistry and cell biology. Brain imaging determines structural and functional information during mental and behavioral activity. Specialists in [[biophysics]] and physiology study physical processes within neural cells neuronal networks. The data from these fields of research is analyzed and arranged in databases and neural models in order to integrate various elements into a sophisticated system; this is the point where neuroinformatics meets other disciplines.

Neuroscience provides the following types of data and information on which neuroinformatics operates: 
* Molecular and cellular data ([[ion channel]], [[action potential]], genetics, cytology of neurons, [[protein pathway]]s),
* Data from organs and systems ([[visual cortex]], [[perception]], audition, [[sensory system]], pain, taste, [[motor system]], [[spinal cord]]),
* [[Cognitive]] data (language, emotion, [[motor learning]], [[sexual behavior]], [[decision making]], [[social neuroscience]]),
* Developmental information ([[neuronal differentiation]], cell survival, [[synaptic formation]], motor differentiation, injury and regeneration, axon guidance, [[growth factor]]s),
* Information about diseases and aging (autonomic nervous system, depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease, addiction, [[memory loss]]),
* Neural engineering data ([[brain-computer interface]]), and
* Computational neuroscience data (computational models of various neuronal systems, from membrane currents, proteins to learning and memory).

Neuroinformatics uses databases, the Internet, and visualization in the storage and analysis of the mentioned neuroscience data.

=== Switzerland ===
; The Blue Brain Project
: The [[Blue Brain]] Project was founded in May 2005, and uses an 8000 processor [[Blue Gene]]/L supercomputer developed by IBM.  At the time, this was one of the fastest supercomputers in the world.
:The project involves:
:* '''Databases''': 3D reconstructed model neurons, synapses, synaptic pathways, microcircuit statistics, computer model neurons, virtual neurons.
:* '''Visualization''': microcircuit builder and simulation results visualizator, 2D, 3D and immersive visualization systems are being developed.
:* '''Simulation''': a simulation environment for large-scale simulations of morphologically complex neurons on 8000 processors of IBM's Blue Gene supercomputer.
:* '''Simulations and experiments''': iterations between large-scale simulations of neocortical microcircuits and experiments in order to verify the computational model and explore predictions.
: The mission of the Blue Brain Project is to understand mammalian brain function and dysfunction through detailed simulations. The Blue Brain Project will invite researchers to build their own models of different brain regions in different species and at different levels of detail using Blue Brain Software for simulation on Blue Gene. These models will be deposited in an internet database from which Blue Brain software can extract and connect models together to build brain regions and begin the first whole brain simulations.

=== United States ===
; Neuroscience Information Framework
: The [[Neuroscience Information Framework]] (NIF) is an initiative of the [[NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research]], which was established in 2004 by the [[National Institutes of Health]]. Unlike general [[search engine]]s, NIF provides deeper access to a more focused set of resources that are relevant to neuroscience, search strategies tailored to neuroscience, and access to content that is traditionally "hidden" from [[web search engine]]s.  The NIF is a dynamic inventory of neuroscience databases, annotated and integrated with a unified system of biomedical terminology (i.e. [[NeuroLex]]). NIF supports concept-based queries across multiple scales of biological structure and multiple levels of biological function, making it easier to search for and understand the results. NIF will  also provide a registry through which resources providers can disclose availability of resources relevant to neuroscience research. NIF is not intended to be a warehouse or repository itself, but a means for disclosing and locating resources elsewhere available via the [[World Wide Web|web]].
; Neurogenetics GeneNetwork
: [[Genenetwork]] started as component of the NIH Human Brain Project in 1999 with a focus on the genetic analysis of brain structure and function. This international program consists of tightly integrated genome and phenome data sets for human, mouse, and rat that are designed specifically for large-scale systems and network studies relating gene variants to differences in mRNA and protein expression and to differences in CNS structure and behavior. The great majority of data are open access. GeneNetwork has a companion neuroimaging web site—the Mouse Brain Library—that contains high resolution images for thousands of genetically defined strains of mice.
; The Neuronal Time Series Analysis (NTSA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NTSA Workbench |url=http://soma.npa.uiuc.edu/ntsa/ |publisher=University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign |archive-date=21 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721115355/http://soma.npa.uiuc.edu/ntsa/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technologies and developments==
The main technological tendencies in neuroinformatics are:

# Application of computer science for building databases, tools, and networks in neuroscience;
# Analysis and modeling of neuronal systems.
In order to organize and operate with neural data scientists need to use the standard terminology and atlases that precisely describe the brain structures and their relationships.

The '''Oceanic Platform of the Canary Islands''' ([[PLOCAN]]) is a [http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.26172fcf4eb029fa6ec7da6901432ea0/?vgnextoid=05cf097c526b4410VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD&amp;lang_choosen=en singular scientific and technological infrastructure] built in order to create a new network of production in the marine and maritime sector that is in harmony with the strategy for blue growth{{clarify|date=October 2017}} that has been established within the European Union. It has been partially co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the ERDF Operational Programme for the Canary Islands 2007-2013 within Axis 1 “Development of the Knowledge Economy”, priority theme 02, with a co-financing rate of 85%. [[PLOCAN]] is financed and managed by a consortium comprising 50% contributions from the Government of the [[Canary Islands]] and from the Spanish National Government (Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities).

==History==

The project was approved in 2007 as a node part of the [http://www.idi.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.26172fcf4eb029fa6ec7da6901432ea0/?vgnextoid=05cf097c526b4410VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD&amp;lang_choosen=en Singular Scientific and Technological Infrastructures (ICTS)] within the framework of the [[Ingenio 2010 Program]].&lt;ref name=ingenio2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ingenio2010.es/ |title=Programa Ingenio 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2011 |language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation was officially published in the [[Spanish Official Journal]] on 5 April 2008.&lt;ref name="boe20080405"/&gt;

==Infrastructures==

[[PLOCAN]] offers land-based and sea-based novel infrastructures to promote long-term observation and sustainability of the ocean, providing a cost-effective combination of services, such as observatories, a test site, a base for marine vehicles, training and an innovation hub. PLOCAN is able to provide access and multidisciplinary logistic support through its onshore facility and two marine test sites (Taliarte harbor and offshore). The facility and test sites are located in the NE coast of Gran Canaria Island, and the platform is integrated in the offshore test site.

===The platform===

The main aim of the [[PLOCAN]] consortium is the construction and operation of a fixed offshore platform that will underpin national research and technological development capacities at the cutting-edge of knowledge and within the framework of international competitiveness. The platform will be located both close to the coast and near the edge of the continental shelf, in shallow waters (30 meters depth). It has a net surface of around 2,500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of research capacity, space for laboratories, instrumented containers and capacity to accommodate researchers distributed in a multi-story building with a main dock of 1,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Onshore facility===

The onshore testing facility has dedicated 400 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; equipped workshops for electronics and mechanical integration, repairs, storage and logistics, including a wet-lab with a testing pool with target seawater. A dedicated control room for piloting and related issues is also available.

===Marine test sites (harbor and offshore)===

The harbor testing facility is located very close to the onshore facility (just a few meters with a direct view between both) and has clear and calm waters with maximum depths of 8 m. It is an optimal place for the early sea trials.

The [[PLOCAN]] offshore test site area is 23&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, located  3 nautical miles from the harbour testing area and also quite near to the major harbor of Gran Canaria Island (Las Palmas/ Port). The area offers progressive depths from shore up to 600 m (deeper upon request) dedicated to study the behaviour and efficiency of different types of maritime devices and technologies and contributing to speed up the process of their introduction into the market. The marine area of [[PLOCAN]] test site was comprehensively studied with a view of offering an optimal space in terms of logistics, supported infrastructures and grid connection. In addition, the area has excellent environmental conditions facilitating 9 to 12 months of operational window and optimal wind and wave energy resources for testing/demonstration operations, which range from 300-400 W/m2 for wind power density and from 4 to 8 Kw/m of wave power.

===Electrical and Communications Grid Infrastructure (IECOM)===

The evacuation of the electricity produced during experimental assays in PLOCAN Marine Test Site is done through its Electrical and Communication grid Infrastructure (IECOM). The IECOM will be operational in 2017 and it will be composed of 2 main modules, each with 5 MW of electricity evacuation capacity. Module 1 will be dedicated to [[Wave power|wave energy]] converter demonstrators, with 5 positions of 1 MW each. Module 2 will be dedicated to [[Offshore wind power|offshore wind]] technologies with one position of 5 MW. Regular sea-operations are covered by PLOCAN’s own boats as part of the main equipment available.

===Fleet of unmanned marine vehicles===

A fleet of unmanned marine vehicles for survey and work applications up to 1,000 m and moored buoys suited with meteorological and oceanographic sensors are available in order to cover real-time monitoring needs in the area.

== Projects ==
[[PLOCAN]] is involved in European and national R&amp;D&amp;I projects with the objective of enabling research and scientific and technological development of maritime and marine sciences. Finished and ongoing projects can be consulted in a [http://plocan.eu/index.php/en/projects specific section of the PLOCAN webpage].

'''Pictorialism''' is the name given to an international style and aesthetic movement that dominated [[photography]] during the later 19th and early 20th centuries. There is no standard definition of the term, but in general it refers to a style in which the photographer has somehow manipulated what would otherwise be a straightforward photograph as a means of "creating" an image rather than simply recording it. Typically, a pictorial photograph appears to lack a sharp focus (some more so than others), is printed in one or more colors other than black-and-white (ranging from warm brown to deep blue) and may have visible brush strokes or other manipulation of the surface. For the pictorialist, a photograph, like a painting, drawing or engraving, was a way of projecting an emotional intent into the viewer's realm of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Daum, p 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Pictorialism as a movement thrived from about 1885 to 1915, although it was still being promoted by some as late as the 1940s. It began in response to claims that a photograph was nothing more than a simple record of reality, and transformed into an international movement to advance the status of all photography as a true art form. For more than three decades painters, photographers and art critics debated opposing artistic philosophies, ultimately culminating in the acquisition of photographs by several major art museums.

Pictorialism gradually declined in popularity after 1920, although it did not fade out of popularity until the end of [[World War II]]. During this period the new style of photographic [[Modernism]] came into vogue, and the public's interest shifted to more sharply focused images. Several important 20th-century photographers began their careers in a pictorialist style but transitioned into sharply focused photography by the 1930s.

==Overview==

[[Image:Watson-Schutze-Rose.jpg|thumb|upright|"The Rose", by [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], 1905]]

Photography as a technical process involving the development of film and prints in a darkroom originated in the early 19th century, with the forerunners of traditional photographic prints coming into prominence around 1838 to 1840. Not long after the new medium was established, photographers, painters and others began to argue about the relationship between the scientific and artistic aspects of the medium. As early as 1853, English painter William John Newton proposed that the camera could produce artistic results if the photographer would keep an image slightly out of focus.&lt;ref&gt;Doty, p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Others vehemently believed  that a photograph was equivalent to the visual record of a chemistry experiment. Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum points out that "the dual character of the medium — its capacity to produce both art and document — [was] demonstrated soon after its discovery&amp;nbsp;... Nevertheless, a good part of the nineteenth century was spent debating which of these directions was the medium's true function."&lt;ref&gt;In Johnson, p 121&lt;/ref&gt;

These debates reached their peak during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, culminating in the creation of a movement that is usually characterized as a particular style of photography: pictorialism. This style is defined first by a distinctly personal expression that emphasizes photography's ability  to create visual beauty rather than simply record facts.&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, p 17&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently historians have recognized that pictorialism is more than just a visual style. It evolved in direct context with the changing social and cultural attitudes of the time, and, as such, it should not be characterized simply as a visual trend. One writer has noted that pictorialism was "simultaneously a movement, a philosophy, an aesthetic and a style."&lt;ref&gt;Nordström and David Wooters. "Crafting the Art of the Photograph." In Pardon, p 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to what some histories of photography portray, pictorialism did not come about as the result of a linear evolution of artistic sensibilities; rather, it was formed through "an intricate, divergent, often passionately conflicting barrage of strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, p xi&lt;/ref&gt; While photographers and others debated whether photography could be art, the advent of photography directly affected the roles and livelihoods of many traditional artists. Prior to the development of photography, a painted [[Portrait miniature|miniature portrait]] was the most common means of recording a person's likeness. Thousands of painters were engaged in this art form. But photography quickly negated the need for and interest in miniature portraits. One example of this effect was seen at the annual exhibition of the [[Royal Academy]] in London; in 1830 more than 300 miniature paintings were exhibited, but by 1870 only 33 were on display.&lt;ref&gt;Harker, p 16&lt;/ref&gt; Photography had taken over for one type of art form, but the question of whether photography itself could be artistic had not been resolved.

Some painters soon adopted photography as a tool to help them record a model's pose, a landscape scene or other elements to include in their art. It's known that many of the great 19th-century painters, including [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Gustav Courbet|Courbet]], [[Manet]], [[Degas]], [[Cézanne]], and [[Gauguin]], took photographs themselves, used photographs by others and incorporated images from photographs into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, p&amp;nbsp;10–12&lt;/ref&gt; While heated debates about the relationship between photography and art continued in print and in lecture halls, the distinction between a photographic image and a painting became more and more difficult to discern. As photography continued to develop, the interactions between painting and photography became increasingly reciprocal.&lt;ref name="Harker, p 19"&gt;Harker, p 19&lt;/ref&gt; More than a few pictorial photographers, including [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]], and [[Sarah Choate Sears]], were originally trained as painters or took up painting in addition to their photographic skills.

It was during this same period that cultures and societies around the world were being affected by a rapid increase in intercontinental travel and commerce. Books and magazines published on one continent could be exported and sold on another with increasing ease, and the development of reliable mail services facilitated individual exchanges of ideas, techniques and, most importantly for photography, actual prints. These developments led to pictorialism being "a more international movement in photography than almost any other photographic genre."&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, p 10&lt;/ref&gt; Camera clubs in the U.S., England, France, Germany, Austria, Japan and other countries regularly lent works to each other's exhibitions, exchanged technical information and published essays and critical commentaries in one another's journals. Led by [[The Linked Ring]] in England, the [[Photo-Secession]] in the U.S., and the [[Photo-Club de Paris]] in France, first hundreds and then thousands of photographers passionately pursued common interests in this multi-dimensional movement. Within the span of little more than a decade, notable pictorial photographers were found in Western and Eastern Europe, North America, Asia and Australia.

==The impact of Kodak cameras==

For the first forty years after a practical process of capturing and reproducing images was invented, photography remained the domain of a highly dedicated group of individuals who had expert knowledge of and skills in science, mechanics and art. To make a photograph, a person had to learn a great deal about chemistry, optics, light, the mechanics of cameras and how these factors combine to properly render a scene. It was not something that one learned easily or engaged in lightly, and, as such, it was limited to a relatively small group of academics, scientists and professional photographers.

[[Image:Kodak ad 1888.GIF|thumb|left|Ad for a [[Kodak]] camera, 1888 - "No knowledge of photography is necessary."]]
All of that changed in a few years' time span. In 1888 [[George Eastman]] introduced the first handheld amateur camera, the [[Kodak]] camera. It was marketed with the slogan "You press the button, we do the rest."&lt;ref name=PIC&gt;Wilson, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; The camera was pre-loaded with a roll of film that produced about 100 2.5" round pictures exposures, and it could easily be carried and handheld during its operation. After all of the shots on the film were exposed, the whole camera was returned to the Kodak company in Rochester, New York, where the film was developed, prints were made, and new photographic film was placed inside. Then the camera and prints were returned to the customer, who was ready to take more pictures.

The impact of this change was enormous. Suddenly almost anyone could take a photograph, and within the span of a few years photography became one of the biggest [[fad]]s in the world. Photography collector Michael Wilson observed "Thousands of commercial photographers and a hundred times as many amateurs were producing millions of photographs annually&amp;nbsp;... The decline in the quality of professional work and the deluge of snapshots (a term borrowed from hunting, meaning to get off a quick shot without taking the time to aim) resulted in a world awash with technically good but aesthetically indifferent photographs."&lt;ref name=PIC/&gt;

Concurrent with this change was the development of national and international commercial  enterprises to meet the new demand for cameras, films and prints. At the 1893 [[World Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, which attracted more than 27 million people, photography for amateurs was marketed at an unprecedented scale.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p 24&lt;/ref&gt; There were multiple large exhibits displaying photographs from around the world, many camera and darkroom equipment manufacturers showing and selling their latest goods, dozens of portrait studios and even on-the-spot documentation of the Exposition itself. Suddenly photography and photographers were household commodities.

Many serious photographers were appalled. Their craft, and to some their art, was being co-opted by a newly engaged, uncontrolled and mostly untalented citizenry. The debate about art and photography intensified around the argument that if anyone could take a photograph then photography could not possibly be called art. Some of the most passionate defenders of photography as art pointed out that photography should not and cannot be seen as an "either/or" medium ‒ some photographs are indeed simple records of reality, but with the right elements some are indeed works of art. William Howe Downs, art critic for the ''Boston Evening Transcript'', summed up this position in 1900 by saying "Art is not so much a matter of methods and processes as it is an affair of temperament, of taste and of sentiment&amp;nbsp;... In the hands of the artist, the photograph becomes a work of art&amp;nbsp;... In a word, photography is what the photographer makes it ‒ an art or a trade."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum, p 296&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these elements ‒ the debates over photography and art, the impacts of Kodak cameras, and the changing social and cultural values of the times ‒ combined to set the stage for an evolution in how art and photography, independently and together, would appear at the turn of the century. The course that drove pictorialism was set almost as soon as photographic processes were established, but it wasn't until the last decade of the 19th century that an international pictorialist movement came together.

==Defining pictorialism==

[[Image:Fading Away.jpg|thumb|left|"Fading Away", by [[Henry Peach Robinson]], 1858]]

In 1869 English photographer [[Henry Peach Robinson]] published a book entitled ''Pictorial Effect in Photography: Being Hints On Composition And Chiaroscuro For Photographers.''&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, 1869&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first common use of the term "pictorial" referring to photography in the context of a certain stylistic element - [[chiaroscuro]] ‒ an Italian term used by painters and art historians that refers to the use of dramatic lighting and shading to convey an expressive mood. In his book Robinson promoted what he called "combination printing", a method he had devised nearly 20 years earlier by combining individual elements from separate images into a new single image by manipulating multiple negatives or prints. Robinson thus considered that he had created "art" through photography, since it was only through his direct intervention that the final image came about. Robinson continued to expand on the meaning of the term throughout his life.

Other photographers and art critics, including [[Oscar Rejlander]], [[Marcus Aurelius Root]], [[John Ruskin]], echoed these ideas. One of the primary forces behind the rise of pictorialism was the belief that [[straight photography]] was purely representational ‒ that it showed reality without the filter of artistic interpretation. It was for, all intents and purposes, a simple record of the visual facts, lacking artistic intent or merit.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnell, p 2&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson and others felt strongly that the "usually accepted limitations of photography had to be overcome if an equality of status was to be achieved.&lt;ref name="Harker, p 19"/&gt;

Robert Demachy later summarized this concept in an article entitled "What Difference Is There Between a Good Photograph and an Artistic Photograph?". He wrote "We must realize that, on undertaking pictorial photography, we have, unwittingly perhaps, bound ourselves to the strict observance of rules hundreds of years more ancient than the oldest formulae of our chemical craft. We have slipped into the Temple of Art by a back door, and found ourselves amongst the crowd of adepts."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Demachy, ''Camera Notes'', Vol 3, No 2, Oct 1899, pp 46. Reprinted in Padon, p 120&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the challenges in promoting photography as art was that there were many different opinions about how art should look. After the Third Philadelphia Salon 1900, which showcased dozens of pictorial photographers, one critic wondered "whether the idea of art in anything like the true sense had ever been heard or thought by the great majority of exhibitors."&lt;ref&gt;Sternberger, p 136&lt;/ref&gt;

While some photographers saw themselves becoming true artists by emulating painting, at least one school of painting directly inspired photographers. During the 1880s, when debates over art and photography were becoming commonplace, a style of painting known as [[Tonalism]] first appeared. Within a few years it became a significant artistic influence on the development of pictorialism.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p 3&lt;/ref&gt; Painters such as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[George Inness]], [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]] and [[Arnold Böcklin]] saw the interpretation of the experience of nature, as contrasted with simply recording an image of nature, as the artist's highest duty. To these artists it was essential that their paintings convey an emotional response to the viewer, which was elicited through an emphasis on the atmospheric elements in the picture and by the use of "vague shapes and subdued tonalities&amp;nbsp;... [to convey] a sense of elegiac melancholy."&lt;ref name=WHP1&gt;Rosenblum, pp&amp;nbsp;297–299&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Stieglitz-SpringShowers.jpg|thumb|upright|"Spring Showers", by [[Alfred Stieglitz]], 1902]]

Applying this same sensibility to photography, [[Alfred Stieglitz]] later stated it this way: "Atmosphere is the medium through which we see all things. In order, therefore, to see them in their true value on a photograph, as we do in Nature, atmosphere must be there. Atmosphere softens all lines; it graduates the transition from light to shade; it is essential to the reproduction of the sense of distance. That dimness of outline which is characteristic for distant objects is due to atmosphere. Now, what atmosphere is to Nature, tone is to a picture."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Stieglitz, "A Plea for Art Photography in America." ''Photographic Mosaics,'' Vol 28, 1892. In Whelan, p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul L. Anderson, a prolific contemporary promoter of pictorialism, advised his readers that true art photography conveyed "suggestion and mystery", in which "mystery consists in affording an opportunity for the exercise of the imagination, whereas suggestion involves stimulating the imagination by direct or indirect means."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1919), p 90&lt;/ref&gt; Science, pictorialists contended, might answer a demand for truthful information, but art must respond to the human need for stimulation of the senses.&lt;ref name=WHP1/&gt; This could only be done by creating a mark of individuality for each image and, ideally, each print.

For pictorialists, true individuality was expressed through the creation of a unique print, considered by many to be the epitome of artistic photography.&lt;ref name=WHP1/&gt; By manipulating the appearance of images through what some called "ennobling processes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Samuel|last=Morozov|date=October 1977|title=Early Photography in Eastern Europe - Russia|journal=History of Photography|volume=1|issue=4| page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[gum bichromate|gum]] or [[Oil Print Process#Bromoil process|bromoil]] printing, pictorialists were able to create unique photographs that were sometimes mistaken for drawings or lithographs.

Many of the strongest voices that championed pictorialism at its beginning were a new generation of amateur photographers. In contrast to its meaning today, the word "amateur" held a different connotation in the discussions of that time. Rather than suggesting an inexperienced novice, the word characterized someone who strived for artistic excellence and a freedom from rigid academic influence.&lt;ref name=PCC4&gt;Wilson, p 4&lt;/ref&gt; An amateur was seen as someone who could break the rules because he or she was not bound by the then rigid rules set forth by long-established photography organizations like the [[Royal Photographic Society]]. An article in the British journal ''Amateur Photographer'' stated "photography is an art ‒ perhaps the only one in which the amateur soon equals, and frequently excels, the professional in proficiency."&lt;ref name=PCC4/&gt; This attitude prevailed in many countries around the world. At the 1893 Hamburg International Photographic Exhibition in Germany, only the work of amateurs was allowed. Alfred Lichtwark, then director of the [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]] believed "the only good portraiture in any medium was being done by amateurs photographers, who had the economic freedom and time to experiment."&lt;ref name=PCC4/&gt;

In 1948, [[S. D. Jouhar|S.D.Jouhar]] defined a Pictorial photograph as "mainly an aesthetic symbolic record of a scene ''plus'' the artist's personal comment and interpretation, capable of transmitting an emotional response to the mind of a receptive spectator. It should show originality, imagination, unity of purpose, a quality of repose, and have an infinite quality about it"&lt;ref&gt;Royal Photographic Society Journal, August 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years other names were given to pictorialism, including "art photography" and ''Camerawork'' (both by Alfred Stieglitz), "Impressionist photography" (by George Davision), "new vision (''Neue Vision''), and finally "subjective photography" (''Subjektive Fotographie'') in Germany after the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnell, p 1&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain pictorial photographers were sometimes called "interventionists" (''intervencionistas''), although the style itself was not known as "interventionism".&lt;ref&gt;King, p 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition into Modernism==

[[Image:Jane Reece-Spaces.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jane Reece (photographer)|Jane Reece]], ''Spaces'', 1922.]]

The evolution of pictorialism from the 19th century well into the 1940s was both slow and determined. From its roots in Europe it spread to the U.S. and the rest of the world in several semi-distinct stages. Prior to 1890 pictorialism emerged through advocates who were mainly in England, Germany, Austria and France. During the 1890s the center shifted to New York and Stieglitz's multi-faceted efforts. By 1900 pictorialism had reached countries around the world, and major exhibitions of pictorial photography were held in dozens of cities.

A culminating moment for pictorialism and for photography in general occurred in  1910, when the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery|Albright Gallery]] in Buffalo bought 15 photographs from Stieglitz' [[291 (art gallery)|291 Gallery]]. This was the first time photography was officially recognized as an art form worthy of a museum collection, and it signaled a definite shift in many photographers' thinking. Stieglitz, who had worked so long for this moment, responded by indicating he was already thinking of a new vision beyond pictorialism. He wrote, "It is high time that the stupidity and sham in pictorial photography be struck a solarplexus blow&amp;nbsp;... Claims of art won't do. Let the photographer make a perfect photograph. And if he happens to be a lover of perfection and a seer, the resulting photograph will be straight and beautiful - a true photograph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes|title=American Masters - Alfred Stieglitz: The Eloquent Eye|origyear = 2001|others = Perry Miller Adato|type = DVD|publisher = Winstar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Stieglitz began to direct his attention more to modern painting and sculpture, and Clarence H. White and others took over the leadership of a new generation of photographers. As the harsh realities of [[World War I]] affected people around the world, the public's taste for the art of the past began to change. Developed countries of the world focused on more and more in the industry and growth, and art reflected this change by featuring hard-edged images of new buildings, airplanes and industrial landscapes.

Pictorialism had, for the most part, run its course, but in the early part of the 21st century it is now more popular than ever {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  Adolf Fassbender, a 20th-century photographer who continued to make pictorial photographs well into the 1960s, believed that pictorialism is eternal because it is based upon beauty first. He wrote "There is no solution in trying to eradicate pictorialism for one would then have to destroy idealism, sentiment and all sense of art and beauty. There will always be pictorialism."&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, p 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pictorialism by country==

===Australia===

One of the primary catalysts of pictorialism in Australia was [[John Kauffmann]] (1864–1942), who studied photographic chemistry and printing in London, Zurich and Vienna between 1889 and 1897. When he returned to his home country in 1897, he greatly influenced his colleagues by exhibiting what one newspaper called photographs that could be "mistaken for works of art."&lt;ref&gt;Gael Newton, "Australian Pictorial Photography: Seeing the Light", in Padon, pp&amp;nbsp;97–99&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade a core of photographer artists, including [[Harold Cazneaux]], [[Frank Hurley]], [[Cecil Bostock]], [[Henri Mallard]], [[Rose Simmonds]]&lt;ref name=queen&gt;[http://www.artmuseum.uq.edu.au/content/rose-simmonds-queensland-pictorial-photographer Rose Simmonds Queensland Pictorial Photographer], Art Museum Queensland, Retrieved 16 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Olive Cotton]], exhibited pictorial works at salons and exhibitions across the country and published their photos in the ''Australian Photographic Journal'' and the ''Australasian Photo-Review''.

===Austria===

In 1891 the Club der Amateur Photographen in Wien (Vienna Amateur Photographers' Club) held the first International Exhibition of Photography in Vienna. The Club, founded by Carl Sma, Federico Mallmann and Charles Scolik, was founded to foster relationships with photographic groups in other countries. After Alfred Buschbeck became head of the club in 1893, it simplified its name to Wiener Camera-Klub (Vienna Camera Club) and began publishing a lavish magazine called ''Wiener Photographische Blätter'' that continued until 1898. It regularly featured articles from influential foreign photographers such as [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Robert Demachy]].&lt;ref name=VCC&gt;Manon Hübscher, "The Vienna Camera Club, Catalyst and Crucible", in Daum, pp&amp;nbsp;125–129&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other countries, opposing viewpoints engaged a wider range of photographers in defining what pictorialism meant. {{Interlanguage link multi|Hans Watzek|de|3=Hans Watzek (Fotograf)}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Hugo Henneberg|de}} and [[Heinrich Kühn]] formed an organization called Das Kleeblatt (The Trilfolium) expressly to increase the exchange of information with other organizations in other countries, especially, France, Germany and the United States. Initially a small, informal group, Das Kleeblatt increased it influence in the Wiener Camera-Klub through its international connections, and several other organizations promoting pictorialism were created in other cities throughout the region. As in other countries, interest in pictorialism faded after World War I, and eventually most of the Austrian organization slipped into obscurity during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=VCC/&gt;

===Canada===
[[File:Poster for Exhibition of Pictorial Photography.jpg|thumb|120px|1917 Exhibition Poster]]
Pictorialism in Canada initially centered on Sidney Carter (1880–1956), the first of his countrymen to be elected to the Photo-Secession. This inspired him to bring together a group of pictorial photographers in Toronto,  the Studio Club in Toronto, with [[Harold Mortimer-Lamb]] (1872–1970) and fellow Secessionist Percy Hodgins.&lt;ref&gt;Kolton, pp 4‒11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 Carter organized Canada's first major exhibition of pictorial photography at Montreal's Art Association. Carter and fellow photographer [[Arthur Goss]] attempted to introduce pictorialist principles to the members of the [[Toronto Camera Club]], although their efforts were met with some resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Kolton, p 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===

As early as 1853 amateur photographer William J. Newton proposed the idea that "a  'natural object', such as a tree, should be photographed in accordance 'the acknowledged principles of fine art'".&lt;ref name=Liddy&gt;Brian Liddy, "The Origins and Development of Pictorial Photography in Britain." In Daum, pp 65‒71&lt;/ref&gt; From there other early photographers, including [[Henry Peach Robinson]] and [[Peter Henry Emerson]], continued to promote the concept of photography as art. In 1892 Robinson, along with [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]] and [[Alfred Maskell]], established the first organization devoted specifically to the ideal of photography as art ‒ The Linked Ring. They invited like-minded photographers, including [[Frank Sutcliffe]], [[Frederick H. Evans]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Frederick Hollyer]], [[James Craig Annan]], [[Alfred Horsley Hinton]] and others, to join them. Soon The Linked Ring was at the forefront of the movement to have photography regarded as an art form.

After The Linked Ring invited a select group of Americans as members, debates broke out about the goals and purpose of the club. When more American than British members were shown at their annual exhibit in 1908, a motion was introduced to disband the organization. By 1910 The Linked Ring has dissolved, and its members went their own way.

===France===

Pictorialism in France is dominated by two names, [[Constant Puyo]] and [[Robert Demachy]]. They are the most famous members of the Photo-Club de Paris, a separate organization from the [[Société française de photographie]]. They are particularly well known for their use of pigment processes, especially [[gum bichromate]].&lt;ref&gt;Julien Faure-Conorton, ''Characterization, contextualization and reception of Robert Demachy’s photographic work (1859-1936)'' (Ph.D. Thesis - in French), Paris, EHESS, 2015, 1136 p.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, they published a book on the subject, ''Les Procédés d'art en Photographie''. Both of them also wrote many articles for the ''Bulletin du Photo-Club de Paris'' (1891-1902) and ''La Revue de Photographie'' (1903-1908), a magazine which quickly became the most influential French publication dealing with artistic photography during the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Poivert, "An Avant-Garde without Combat: The French Anti-Modernists and the Pre-Modernism of the American Photo-Secession." In Daum, pp&amp;nbsp;31–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

The brothers Theodor and Oskar Hofmeister of Hamburg were among the first to advocate for photography as art in their country. At meetings of the Society for the Promotion of Amateur Photography (Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Amateur-Photographie), other photographers, including Heinrich Beck, George Einbeck, and Otto Scharf, advanced the cause of pictorialism. The Homeisters, along with [[Heinrich Kühn]], later formed The Presidium (Das Praesidium), whose members  were instrumental in major exhibitions at the Kunsthalle in Hamburg. Nowadays [[Karl Maria Udo Remmes]] represents the style of pictorialism in the field of theatrical backstage photography.

===Japan===

In 1889 photographers [[Ogawa Kazumasa]], [[W. K. Burton]], [[Kajima Seibei]] and several others formed the Nihon Shashin-kai ([[Japan Photographic Society (19th century)|Japan Photographic Society]]) in order to promote ''geijutsu shashin'' (art photography) in that country. Acceptance of this new style was slow at first, but in 1893 Burton coordinated a major invitational exhibition known as ''Gaikoku Shashin-ga Tenrain-kai'' or the ''Foreign Photographic Art Exhibition''.&lt;ref name=PPJ&gt;Ryūichi Kaneko, "Pictorial Photography in Japan." In Padon, pp&amp;nbsp;81–84&lt;/ref&gt; The 296 works that were shown came from members of the London Camera Club, including important photographs by [[Peter Henry Emerson]] and [[George Davison (photographer)|George Davison]]. The breadth and depth of this exhibition had a tremendous impact on Japanese photographers, and it "galvanized the discourse of art photography throughout the country."&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt; After the exhibition ended Burton and Kajima founded a new organization, the Dai Nihon Shashin Hinpyō-kai (Greater Japan Photography Critique Society) to advance their particular viewpoints on art photography.

In 1904 a new magazine called ''Shashin Geppo'' (''Monthly Photo Journal'') was started, and for many years it was the centerpiece for the advancement of and debates about pictorialism. The meaning and direction of art photography as championed by Ogawa and others was challenged in the new journal by photographers Tarō Saitō and Haruki Egashira, who, along with Tetsusuke Akiyama and Seiichi Katō, formed a new group known as Yūtsuzu-sha. This new group promoted their own concepts of what they called "the inner truth" of art photography.&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt; For the next decade many photographers aligned themselves with one of these two organizations.

In the 1920s new organizations were formed that bridged the transition between pictorialism and modernism. Most prominently among these was the Shashin Geijustu-sha (Photographic Art Society) formed by [[Shinzō Fukuhara]] and his brother [[Rosō Fukuhara]]. They promoted the concept of ''hikari to sono kaichō'' (light with its harmony) that rejected an overt manipulation of an image in favor of soft-focused images using silver gelatin printing.&lt;ref name=PPJ/&gt;

===Netherlands===

The first generation of Dutch pictorialists, including Bram Loman, Chris Schuver and Carl Emile Mögle, began working around 1890. They initially focused on naturalistic themes and favored platinum printing. Although initially there was no Dutch equivalent of The Linked Ring or Photo-Secession,  several smaller organizations collaborated to produce the First International Salon for Art Photography in 1904. Three years later Adriann Boer, Ernest Loeb, Johan Huijsen and others founded the Dutch Club for Art Photography (Nederlandsche Club voor Foto-Kunst), which amassed an important collection of pictorial photography now housed at [[Leiden University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingeborg Th. Leijerzapf, "Pictorialism in The Netherlands." In Daum, pp 139‒147&lt;/ref&gt; A second generation of Dutch pictorialists included Henri Berssenbrugge, Bernard Eilers and Berend Zweers.

===Russia===

Pictorialism spread to Russia first through European magazines and was championed by photography pioneers Evgeny Vishnyakov in Russia and [[Jan Bulhak]] from Poland. Soon after a new generation of pictorialists became active. These included Aleksei Mazuin, Sergei Lobovikov, Piotr Klepikov, Vassily Ulitin, [[Nikolay Andreyev (photographer)|Nikolay Andreyev]], Nikolai Svishchov-Paola, Leonid Shokin and Alexander Grinberg. In 1894 the Russian Photographic Society was established in Moscow, but differences of opinion among the members led to the establishment of a second organization, the Moscow Society of Art Photography. Both were the primary promoters of pictorialsim in Russia for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photographer.ru/cult/history/472.htm|title=Edtudes for the History of Russian Pictorlialism|first=Irina|last=Tchmyreva|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quiet Resistance: Russian Pictorialism of the 1900s‒1930s|first=Olga|last=Sviblova|publisher=Moscoe: Multimedia Complex of Actual Arts|year=2005|pages=182–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

The main centers of pictorial photography in Spain were Madrid and Barcelona. Leading the movement in Madrid was Antonio Cánovas, who founded the Real Sociedad Fotográfica de Madrid and edited the magazine ''La Fotografía''. Cánovas claimed to be the first to introduce artistic photography to Spain, but throughout his career he remained rooted in the allegorical style of the early English pictorialists like Robinson. He refused to use any surface manipulation in his prints, saying that style "is not, cannot be and will never be photography.".&lt;ref&gt;King, p 133&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential photographers in the country were Carlos Iñigo, Manual Renon, Joan Vilatobà and a person known only as the Conde de la Ventosa. Unlike the rest of Europe, pictorialism remained popular in Spain throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and Ventosa was the most prolific pictorialist of that period. Unfortunately very few original prints remain from any of these photographers; most of their images are now known only from magazine reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;King, p 125&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

One of the key figures in establishing both the definition and direction of pictorialism was American [[Alfred Stieglitz]], who began as an amateur but quickly made the promotion of pictorialism his profession and obsession. Through his writings, his organizing and his personal efforts to advance and promote pictorial photographers, Stieglitz was a dominant figure in pictorialism from its beginnings to its end. Following in the footsteps of German photographers, in 1892 Stieglitz established a group he called the [[Photo-Secession]] in New York. Stieglitz hand-picked the members of the group, and he tightly controlled what it did and when it did it. By selecting photographers whose vision was aligned with his, including [[Gertrude Käsebier]], [[Eva Watson-Schütze]], [[Alvin Langdon Coburn]], [[Edward Steichen]], and [[Joseph Keiley]], Stieglitz built a circle of friends who had enormous individual and collective influence over the movement to have photography accepted as art. Stieglitz also continually promoted pictorialism through two publications he edited, [[Camera Notes]] and [[Camera Work]] and by establishing and running a gallery in New York that for many years exhibited only pictorial photographers (the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession]]).&lt;ref&gt;Doty, pp&amp;nbsp;5–10&lt;/ref&gt;

While much initially centered on Stieglitz, pictorialism in the U.S. was not limited to New York. In Boston [[F. Holland Day]] was one of the most prolific and noted pictorialists of his time. [[Clarence Hudson White|Clarence H. White]], who produced extraordinary pictorial photographs while in Ohio, went on to teach a whole new generation of photographers. On the West Coast the California Camera Club and Southern California Camera Club included prominent pictorialists [[Annie Brigman]], [[Arnold Genthe]],  [[Adelaide Hanscom Leeson]], Emily Pitchford and William E. Dassonville.&lt;ref&gt;McCarroll, pp 15‒30&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, the [[Seattle Camera Club]] was started by a group of Japanese-American pictorialists, including Dr. Kyo Koike, Frank Asakichi Kunishige and Iwao Matsushita (prominent members later included [[Ella E. McBride]] and [[Soichi Sunami]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin, pp&amp;nbsp;10–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
[[Image:M Sherling Portrait A. Golovin.jpg|thumb|right|Miron A. Sherling, ''Portrait Alexander J. Golovin'', 1916.]]

Pictorial photographers began by taking an ordinary glass-plate or film negative. Some adjusted the focus of the scene or used a special lens to produce a softer image, but for the most part the printing process controlled the final appearance of the photograph. Pictorialists used a variety of papers and chemical processes to produce particular effects, and some then manipulated the tones and surface of prints with brushes, ink or pigments. The following is a list of the most commonly used pictorial processes. More details about these processes may be found in Crawford (pp 85‒95) and in Daum (pp 332‒334). Unless otherwise noted, the descriptions below are summarized from these two books.

*[[Oil Print Process#Bromoil process|Bromoil process]]: This is a variant on the oil print process that allows a print to be enlarged. In this process a regular silver gelatin print is made, then bleached in a solution of potassium bichromate. This hardens the surface of the print and allows ink to stick to it. Both the lighter and darker areas of a bromoil print may be manipulated, providing a broader tonal range than an oil print.
*[[Carbon print]]: This is an extremely delicate print made by coating tissue paper with potassium bichromate, [[carbon black]] or another pigment and gelatin. Carbon prints can provide extraordinary detail and are among the most permanent of all photographic prints. Due to the stability of the paper both before and after processing, carbon printing tissue was one of the earliest commercially made photographic products.
*[[Cyanotype]]: One of the earliest photographic processes, cyanotypes experienced a brief renewal when pictorialists experimented with their deep blue color tones. The color came from coating paper with light-sensitive iron salts.
*[[Gum bichromate]]: One of the pictorialists' favorites, these prints were made by applying [[gum Arabic]], [[potassium bichromate]] and one or more artist's colored pigments to paper. This sensitized solution slowly hardens where light strikes it, and these areas remain pliable for several hours. The photographer had a great deal of control by varying the mixture of the solution, allowing a shorter or longer exposure and by brushing or rubbing the pigmented areas after exposure.
*[[Oil Print Process]]: Made by applying greasy inks to paper coated with a solution of gum bichromate and gelatin. When exposed through a negative, the gum-gelatin hardens where light strikes it while unexposed areas remain soft. Artist's inks are then applied by brush, and the inks adhere only to the hardened areas. Through this process a photographer can manipulate the lighter areas of a gum print while the darker areas remain stable. An oil print cannot be enlarged since it has to be in direct contact with the negative.
*[[Platinum print]]: Platinum prints require a two-steps process. First, paper is sensitized with iron salts and exposed in contact with a negative until a faint image is formed. Then the paper is chemically developed in a process that replaces the iron salts with platinum. This produces an image with a very wide range of tones, each intensely realized.

==Pictorial photographers==

Following are two lists of prominent photographers who engaged in pictorialism during their careers. The first list includes photographers who were predominantly pictorialists for all or almost all of their careers (generally those active from 1880 to 1920). The second list includes 20th-century photographers who used a pictorial style early in the careers but who are more well known for pure or [[straight photography]].

{{linguistics}}

'''Pragmatics''' is a subfield of [[linguistics]] and [[semiotics]] that studies the ways in which [[context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning. Pragmatics encompasses [[speech act]] theory, conversational [[implicature]], [[Conversation analysis|talk in interaction]] and other approaches to language behavior in [[Philosophy of language|philosophy]], [[Sociology of language|sociology]], linguistics and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=Mey&gt;Mey, Jacob L. (1993) ''Pragmatics: An Introduction''. Oxford: Blackwell (2nd ed. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[semantics]], which examines meaning that is conventional or "coded" in a given language, pragmatics studies how the transmission of meaning depends not only on structural and linguistic knowledge (e.g., [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], etc.) of the speaker and listener, but also on the context of the utterance,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/meaning-semantics-and-pragmatics|title=Meaning (Semantics and Pragmatics) {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; any pre-existing knowledge about those involved, the inferred [[intention|intent]] of the speaker, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, pragmatics explains how language users are able to overcome apparent [[ambiguity]], since meaning relies on the manner, place, time, etc. of an utterance.&lt;ref name=Mey/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/pragmatics-language-1691654|title=What Is Pragmatics?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to understand another speaker's intended meaning is called ''pragmatic competence''.&lt;ref&gt;Daejin Kim ''et al.'' (2002) "The Role of an Interactive Book Reading Program in the Development of Second Language Pragmatic Competence", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 86, No. 3 (Autumn, 2002), pp. 332-348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Takimoto (2008) "The Effects of Deductive and Inductive Instruction on the Development of Language Learners' Pragmatic Competence", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 92, No. 3 (Fall, 2008), pp. 369-386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale April Koike (1989) "Pragmatic Competence and Adult L2 Acquisition: Speech Acts in Interlanguage", ''The Modern Language Journal'', Vol. 73, No. 3 (Autumn, 1989), pp. 279-289&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambiguity==
{{main article|Ambiguity}}
The sentence "You have a green light" is ambiguous. Without knowing the context, the identity of the speaker or the speaker's intent, it is difficult to infer the meaning with certainty. For example, it could mean:
* the space that belongs to you has green ambient lighting;
* you are driving through a green traffic signal;
* you no longer have to wait to continue driving;
* you are permitted to proceed in a non-driving context;
* your body is cast in a greenish glow; or
* you possess a light bulb that is tinted green.
Similarly, the sentence "Sherlock saw the man with binoculars" could mean that Sherlock observed the man by using binoculars, or it could mean that Sherlock observed a man who was holding binoculars (''[[syntactic ambiguity]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Linguistics-and-Philosophy/24-903Spring-2005/CourseHome/| title= 24.903 / 24.933 Language and its Structure III: Semantics and Pragmatics | website= MIT.edu| publisher= MIT [[OpenCourseWare]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]| date= 2004| access-date= October 17, 2017|deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409033734/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Linguistics-and-Philosophy/24-903Spring-2005/CourseHome/| archivedate= April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the sentence depends on an understanding of the context and the speaker's intent. As defined in linguistics, a sentence is an abstract entity—a string of words divorced from non-linguistic context—as opposed to an [[utterance]], which is a concrete example of a [[speech act]] in a specific context. The more closely conscious subjects stick to common words, idioms, phrasings, and topics, the more easily others can surmise their meaning; the further they stray from common expressions and topics, the wider the variations in interpretations. This suggests that sentences do not have intrinsic meaning, that there is no meaning associated with a sentence or word, and that either can only represent an idea symbolically. ''The cat sat on the mat'' is a sentence in English. If someone were to say to someone else, "The cat sat on the mat," the act is itself an utterance. This implies that a sentence, term, expression or word cannot symbolically represent a single true meaning; such meaning is underspecified (which cat sat on which mat?) and potentially ambiguous. By contrast, the meaning of an utterance can be inferred through knowledge of both its linguistic and non-linguistic contexts (which may or may not be sufficient to resolve ambiguity). In mathematics, with [[Berry's paradox]], there arises a similar systematic ambiguity with the word "definable".

==Etymology==
The word ''pragmatics'' derives via [[Latin]] ''pragmaticus'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] πραγματικός (''pragmatikos''), meaning amongst others "fit for action",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpragmatiko%2Fs πραγματικός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  which comes from πρᾶγμα (''pragma''), "deed, act",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%3Dgma πρᾶγμα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and that from πράσσω (''prassō''), "to pass over, to practise, to achieve".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpra%2Fssw πράσσω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the field==
{{Ref improve section|date=April 2018}}
Pragmatics was a reaction to [[Structuralism|structuralist]] linguistics as outlined by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. In many cases, it expanded upon his idea that language has an analyzable structure, composed of parts that can be defined in relation to others. Pragmatics first engaged only in [[Course in General Linguistics#Synchronic and diachronic axes|synchronic]] study, as opposed to examining the historical development of language. However, it rejected the notion that all meaning comes from [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] existing purely in the abstract space of ''langue''. Meanwhile, [[historical pragmatics]] has also come into being. This field only gained linguists' attention in the 70s. This is when two different schools emerged; notably the Anglo-American pragmatic thought and the European continental pragmatic thought (also called the perspective view).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/57900/1/Jucker_Pragmatics_in_the_history_of_linguistic_thought.pdf|title=Pragmatics in the history of linguistic thought|last=Jucker|first=Andreas H|date=2012|website=www.zora.uzh.ch|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923010723/http://www.zora.uzh.ch/57900/1/Jucker_Pragmatics_in_the_history_of_linguistic_thought.pdf|archive-date=2017-09-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
{{Ref improve section|date=April 2018}}
* The study of the speaker's meaning,  not focusing on the phonetic or grammatical form of an utterance, but instead on what the speaker's intentions and beliefs are.
* The study of the meaning in context, and the influence that a given context can have on the message. It requires knowledge of the speaker's identities, and the place and time of the utterance.
* The study of [[implicature]]s, i.e. the things that are communicated even though they are not explicitly expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-pragmatics-definition-examples.html|title=What is Pragmatics? - Definition &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The study of relative distance, both social and physical, between speakers in order to understand what determines the choice of what is said and what is not said.
* The study of what is not meant, as opposed to the intended meaning, i.e. that which is unsaid and unintended, or unintentional.
* [[Information structure]], the study of how utterances are marked in order to efficiently manage the common ground of referred entities between speaker and hearer
* [[Formal Pragmatics]], the study of those aspects of meaning and use for which context of use is an important factor, by using the methods and goals of formal semantics.

==Referential uses of language==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
When we speak of the referential uses of language we are talking about how we use [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] to refer to certain items. Below is an explanation of, first, what a sign is, second, how meanings are accomplished through its usage.

A sign is the link or relationship between a [[Sign (semiotics)|signified and the signifier]] as defined by Saussure and Huguenin. The signified is some entity or concept in the world. The signifier represents the signified. An example would be:

:''Signified: the concept cat
:''Signifier: the word "cat"

The relationship between the two gives the sign meaning. This relationship can be further explained by considering what we mean by "meaning." In pragmatics, there are two different types of meaning to consider: '''semantico-referential meaning''' and '''indexical meaning.''' Semantico-referential meaning refers to the aspect of meaning, which describes events in the world that are independent of the circumstance they are uttered in. An example would be propositions such as:

:''"Santa Claus eats cookies."''

In this case, the proposition is describing that Santa Claus eats cookies. The meaning of this proposition does not rely on whether or not Santa Claus is eating cookies at the time of its utterance. Santa Claus could be eating cookies at any time and the meaning of the proposition would remain the same. The meaning is simply describing something that is the case in the world. In contrast, the proposition, "Santa Claus is eating a cookie right now," describes events that are happening at the time the proposition is uttered.

Semantico-referential meaning is also present in meta-semantical statements such as:

:''Tiger: carnivorous, a mammal''

If someone were to say that a tiger is a carnivorous animal in one context and a mammal in another, the definition of tiger would still be the same. The meaning of the sign tiger is describing some animal in the world, which does not change in either circumstance.

[[Indexical]] meaning, on the other hand, is dependent on the context of the utterance and has rules of use. By rules of use, it is meant that indexicals can tell you when they are used, but not what they actually mean.

:''Example'': "I"

Whom "I" refers to depends on the context and the person uttering it.

As mentioned, these meanings are brought about through the relationship between the signified and the signifier. One way to define the relationship is by placing signs in two categories: '''referential indexical signs,''' also called "shifters," and '''pure indexical signs.'''

Referential indexical signs are signs where the meaning shifts depending on the context hence the nickname "shifters." 'I' would be considered a referential indexical sign. The referential aspect of its meaning would be '1st person singular' while the indexical aspect would be the person who is speaking (refer above for definitions of semantico-referential and indexical meaning). Another example would be:

:''"This"''
:''Referential: singular count''
:''Indexical: Close by''

A pure indexical sign does not contribute to the meaning of the propositions at all. It is an example of a "non-referential use of language."

A second way to define the signified and signifier relationship is [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]]'s '''Peircean Trichotomy'''. The components of the trichotomy are the following:

:1. '''Icon''': the signified resembles the signifier (signified: a dog's barking noise, signifier: bow-wow)
:2. '''Index''': the signified and signifier are linked by proximity or the signifier has meaning only because it is pointing to the signified
:3. '''Symbol''': the signified and signifier are arbitrarily linked (signified: a cat, signifier: the word cat)

These relationships allow us to use signs to convey what we want to say. If two people were in a room and one of them wanted to refer to a characteristic of a chair in the room he would say "this chair has four legs" instead of "a chair has four legs." The former relies on context (indexical and referential meaning) by referring to a chair specifically in the room at that moment while the latter is independent of the context (semantico-referential meaning), meaning the concept chair.

==Non-referential uses of language==

===Silverstein's "pure" indexes===

[[Michael Silverstein]] has argued that "nonreferential" or "pure" indices do not contribute to an utterance's referential meaning but instead "signal some particular value of one or more contextual variables."&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Although nonreferential indexes are devoid of semantico-referential meaning, they do encode "pragmatic" meaning.

The sorts of contexts that such indexes can mark are varied. Examples include:
* '''Sex indexes''' are affixes or inflections that index the sex of the speaker, e.g. the verb forms of female [[Koasati language|Koasati]] speakers take the suffix "-s".
*  '''Deference indexes''' are words that signal social differences (usually related to status or age) between the speaker and the addressee. The most common example of a deference index is the V form in a language with a [[T-V distinction]], the widespread phenomenon in which there are multiple second-person pronouns that correspond to the addressee's relative status or familiarity to the speaker. [[Honorific]]s are another common form of deference index and demonstrate the speaker's respect or esteem for the addressee via special forms of address and/or self-humbling first-person pronouns.
* An '''Affinal taboo index''' is an example of [[avoidance speech]] that produces and reinforces sociological distance, as seen in the Aboriginal [[Dyirbal language]] of Australia. In this language and some others, there is a social taboo against the use of the everyday lexicon in the presence of certain relatives (mother-in-law, child-in-law, paternal aunt's child, and maternal uncle's child). If any of those relatives are present, a Dyirbal speaker has to switch to a completely separate lexicon reserved for that purpose.

In all of these cases, the semantico-referential meaning of the utterances is unchanged from that of the other possible (but often impermissible) forms, but the pragmatic meaning is vastly different.

===The performative===
{{main article|Performative utterance|Speech act theory}}

[[J.L. Austin]] introduced the concept of the [[Performative utterance|performative]], contrasted in his writing with "constative" (i.e. descriptive) utterances. According to Austin's original formulation, a performative is a type of utterance characterized by two distinctive features:

* It is not [[logical value|truth-evaluable]] (i.e. it is neither true nor false)
* Its uttering ''performs'' an action rather than simply describing one

Examples:
* "I hereby pronounce you man and wife."
* "I accept your apology."
* "This meeting is now adjourned."

To be performative, an utterance must conform to various conditions involving what Austin calls [[felicity conditions|felicity]]. These deal with things like appropriate context and the speaker's authority. For instance, when a couple has been arguing and the husband says to his wife that he accepts her apology even though she has offered nothing approaching an apology, his assertion is infelicitous—because she has made neither expression of regret nor request for forgiveness, there exists none to accept, and thus no act of accepting can possibly happen.

===Jakobson's six functions of language===
{{main article|Jakobson's functions of language}}
[[File:Roma jakobson theory.png|right|thumb|The six factors of an effective verbal communication. To each one corresponds a communication function (not displayed in this picture).&lt;ref name="Middleton"&gt;Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). ''Studying Popular Music'', p. 241. Philadelphia: Open University Press. {{ISBN|0-335-15275-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Roman Jakobson]], expanding on the work of [[Karl Bühler]], described six "constitutive factors" of a [[speech act|speech event]], each of which represents the privileging of a corresponding function, and only one of which is the referential (which corresponds to the '''context''' of the speech event). The six constitutive factors and their corresponding functions are diagrammed below.

'''The six constitutive factors of a speech event'''

:::Context
:::Message
Addresser---------------------Addressee
:::Contact
:::Code
&lt;br /&gt;
'''The six functions of language'''

:::Referential
:::Poetic
Emotive-----------------------Conative
:::Phatic
:::Metalingual

* The Referential Function corresponds to the factor of Context and describes a situation, object or mental state. The descriptive statements of the referential function can consist of both definite descriptions and [[deixis|deictic]] words, e.g. "The autumn leaves have all fallen now."
* The Expressive (alternatively called "emotive" or "affective") Function relates to the Addresser and is best exemplified by [[interjections]] and other sound changes that do not alter the [[denotation|denotative meaning]] of an utterance but do add information about the Addresser's (speaker's) internal state, e.g. "Wow, what a view!"
* The Conative Function engages the Addressee directly and is best illustrated by [[vocative]]s and [[imperative mood|imperatives]], e.g. "Tom! Come inside and eat!"
* The Poetic Function focuses on "the message for its own sake"&lt;ref name="Duranti 1997"&gt;Duranti 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and is the operative function in poetry as well as slogans.
* The [[Phatic]] Function is language for the sake of interaction and is therefore associated with the Contact factor. The Phatic Function can be observed in greetings and casual discussions of the weather, particularly with strangers.
* The Metalingual (alternatively called "metalinguistic" or "reflexive") Function is the use of language (what Jakobson calls "Code") to discuss or describe itself.

==Related fields==
There is considerable overlap between pragmatics and [[sociolinguistics]], since both share an interest in [[linguistic meaning]] as determined by usage in a speech community. However, sociolinguists tend to be more interested in variations in language within such communities.

Pragmatics helps anthropologists relate elements of language to broader social phenomena; it thus pervades the field of [[linguistic anthropology]]. Because pragmatics describes generally the forces in play for a given utterance, it includes the study of power, gender, race, identity, and their interactions with individual speech acts. For example, the study of [[Code-switching|code switching]] directly relates to pragmatics, since a switch in code effects a shift in pragmatic force.&lt;ref name="Duranti 1997"/&gt;

According to [[Charles W. Morris]], pragmatics tries to understand the relationship between signs and their users, while [[semantics]] tends to focus on the actual objects or ideas to which a word refers, and [[syntax]] (or "syntactics") examines relationships among signs or symbols. Semantics is the literal meaning of an idea whereas pragmatics is the implied meaning of the given idea.

[[Speech act|Speech Act Theory]], pioneered by [[J.L. Austin]] and further developed by [[John Searle]], centers around the idea of the [[performative]], a type of utterance that performs the very action it describes. Speech Act Theory's examination of [[Illocutionary act|Illocutionary Acts]] has many of the same goals as pragmatics, as outlined [[Pragmatics#Areas of interest|above]].

Computational Pragmatics, as defined by [[Victoria Fromkin]], concerns how humans can communicate their intentions to computers with as little ambiguity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Language|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=1133310680|location=Boston, Ma.|pages=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, integral to the science of [[natural language processing]] (seen as a sub-discipline of [[artificial intelligence]]), involves providing a computer system with some database of knowledge related to a topic and a series of algorithms which control how the system responds to incoming data, using contextual knowledge to more accurately approximate natural human language and information processing abilities. Reference resolution, how a computer determines when two objects are different or not, is one of the most important tasks of computational pragmatics. 

==Formalization==

There has been a great amount of discussion on the boundary between semantics and pragmatics &lt;ref&gt;[http://web.stanford.edu/group/cslipublications/cslipublications/site/9781575866673.shtml see for instance F.Domaneschi. C. Penco, What is Said and What is Not, CSLI Publication, Stanford]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are many different formalizations of aspects of pragmatics linked to context dependence. Particularly interesting cases are the discussions on the semantics of indexicals and the problem of referential descriptions, a topic developed after the theories of [[Keith Donnellan]].&lt;ref&gt;see for instance S. Neale, Descriptions, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; A proper logical theory of formal pragmatics has been developed by [[Carlo Dalla Pozza]], according to which it is possible to connect classical semantics (treating propositional contents as true or false) and intuitionistic semantics (dealing with illocutionary forces). The presentation of a formal treatment of pragmatics appears to be a development of the Fregean idea of assertion sign as formal sign of the act of assertion.

==In literary theory==

Pragmatics (more specifically, [[Speech act|Speech Act Theory's]] notion of the [[performative]]) underpins [[Judith Butler]]'s theory of [[gender performativity]]. In ''[[Gender Trouble]]'', she claims that gender and sex are not natural categories, but socially constructed roles produced by "reiterative acting."

In [[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative|''Excitable Speech'']] she extends her theory of [[performativity]] to [[hate speech]] and [[censorship]], arguing that censorship necessarily strengthens any discourse it tries to suppress and therefore, since the state has sole power to define hate speech legally, it is the state that makes hate speech performative.

[[Jacques Derrida]] remarked that some work done under Pragmatics aligned well with the program he outlined in his book ''[[Of Grammatology]]''.

[[Émile Benveniste]] argued that the [[pronouns]] "I" and "you" are fundamentally distinct from other pronouns because of their role in creating the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

[[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] discuss linguistic pragmatics in the fourth chapter of ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' ("November 20, 1923--Postulates of Linguistics"). They draw three conclusions from Austin: (1) A [[performative utterance]] does not communicate information about an act second-hand—it is the act; (2) Every aspect of language ("semantics, syntactics, or even phonematics") functionally interacts with pragmatics; (3) There is no distinction between language and speech. This last conclusion attempts to refute [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] division between [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] and [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] distinction between [[surface structure]] and [[deep structure]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari]] (1987) [1980].

'''Science Learning Centres''' are a [[UK Government]] initiative to address the need for improved [[science education]] and development for teachers in England.

==Origins==
In 2001, the House of Lords Science &amp; Technology Select Committee Report&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldselect/ldsctech/47/4702.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; identified an urgent need for subject specific Continuing Professional Development for Science Teachers. In response to this and numerous other calls for action, the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] and the [[Wellcome Trust]]  invested £51 million in the creation of the '''national network of Science Learning Centres'''.  After a competitive tendering process the first Science Learning Centre opened its doors in October 2004. Today the Centres are more than just a location for training courses, they are rapidly becoming the focus for all science education activity in the UK.

==Continuing professional development==
'''Science Learning Centres''' run courses that provide continuing [[professional development]] for ''anyone'' involved in the teaching of science, from those working with reception aged children to post 16 students, including primary and secondary teachers, technicians, teaching assistants and FE lecturers.

The aim of all '''Science Learning Centres''' is to reconnect teachers with the frontiers of their subject and the latest techniques for teaching it. Teachers who attend courses are given the opportunity to renew and extend their teaching skills by mixing with and learning from colleagues who face similar challenges to their own, and have access to the UK’s leading experts in science educational research.

==Centres==
There are '''10 Science Learning Centres''' around the country.  One to serve each of the nine English government regions and a '''National Science Learning Centre''' (based in the University of York) which provides training for anyone from England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.  Each Centre is run by a consortium of organisations, which vary from local councils and professional bodies to universities, schools, science centres and industry partners.

*The National Science Learning Centre, located in York
*Science Learning Centre East of England, located in Hertfordshire
*Science Learning Centre East Midlands, located in Leicester
*Science Learning Centre London
*Science Learning Centre North East, located in Durham
*Science Learning Centre North West, located in Manchester
*Science Learning Centre South East, at the University of Southampton is now the [http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mslc Mathematics and Science Learning Centre] (MSLC)
*Science Learning Centre South West, located in Bristol
*Science Learning Centre West Midlands, located in Keele
*Science Learning Centre Yorkshire &amp; the Humber, located in Sheffield

==Courses==
The courses offered at the regional Centres usually feature one day’s training at the Centre, together with ongoing support through classroom exercises and online materials.  The '''National Science Learning Centre''', based at the [[University of York]], offers residential courses for teachers, providing access to the facilities for teachers of two or more days, often spread across more than one term.

==Ambitions==
The national network of Science Learning Centres has been created with ambitious goals in mind; not least to help British teachers, lecturers, technicians and classroom assistants to lead the world in science education by 2015.

'''Science outreach''', also called '''Education and Public Outreach''' ('''EPO''' or '''E/PO''') or simply '''public outreach''',{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} is an [[umbrella term]] for a variety of activities by [[research institute]]s, [[University|universities]], and institutions such as [[science museum]]s, aimed at promoting [[Public awareness of science|public awareness (and understanding) of science]] and making informal contributions to [[science education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Varner, Johanna|title=Scientific outreach: toward effective public engagement with biological science|journal=BioScience|volume=64|issue=4|year=2014|pages=333–340|doi=10.1093/biosci/biu021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope and history==

While there have always been individual scientists interested in educating the public, science outreach has recently become more organized. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ([[NASA]]) now requires all of its projects to organize suitable outreach activities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also working to inform the public are organizations such as Communicating Astronomy to the Public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatingastronomy.org/meetings/ Communicating Astronomy to the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrao.edu/ccap/conf_wash.shtml Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public]&lt;/ref&gt; that organize conferences for the public on science issues and make efforts to put outreach on a more general institutional footing.

Recently, an increasing number of projects have hired designated outreach scientists (part-time or full-time) that handle public relations for their project. There are also specialized outreach providers such as the Education branch of the [[Space Science Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacescience.org/education/index.html Education branch of the Space Science Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; in Boulder, Colorado and the [[NASA Education and Public Outreach Group at Sonoma State University|Education and Public Outreach Group]] at [[Sonoma State University]] which offer to organize a project's outreach activities on a contractual basis.

In addition to outreach by research institutions, an important part of informal science education are outreach programs such as [[science museum]]s and [[science festival]]s.

==Examples of science outreach activities==

Science outreach can take on a variety of forms.

===Public talks/lectures/discussions===
[[File:Universum für Alle - New book showcases ESO images.jpg|thumb|Universum für Alle: 70 short popular lectures at [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Book Showcases ESO Images|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann12091/|accessdate=3 December 2012|newspaper=ESO Announcements}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

Lectures are probably the oldest form of science outreach, dating back to the 1820s when [[Michael Faraday]] organized the first of the [[Royal Institution|Royal Institution's]] [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas Lectures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The RI Christmas Lectures (Royal Institution Website)| url=http://www.rigb.org/rimain/events/christmaslectures.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public talks can be part of a lecture series, given at a [[science festival]] or in cooperation with a special interest group such as a local [[astronomy club]]. Public presentations can have a variety of formats, including straightforward lecture formats with or without [[Scientific demonstration|experimental demonstrations]], guided live interviews, and discussions with several participants and a moderator. There are also less formal initiatives such as [[Café Scientifique]], in which a café or bar is the venue for regular meetings involving guest scientists that come to talk about their work or take part in discussions with members of the public.

===Visiting primary and secondary schools===

School students and teachers are an important target group for science outreach. Outreach activities can include scientists visiting schools, giving talks at assemblies, discussions with students, or participation in events such as [[career fair]]s and science and technology camps.  One organization that focuses on this kind of science outreach is [[Robogals]]. Many universities also have science outreach programs that are dedicated to building relationships between high school students, university scientists, and K-12 teachers. A few of the most prominent university science outreach programs include Carolina Science Outreach,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Carolina Science Outreach | url=http://www.csousc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science | url=http://studentorgs.vanderbilt.edu/vsvs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program | url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/outreach/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old Outreach Project at University of Texas in Austin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Science Educational Outreach Programs That Benefit Students and Scientists | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002368}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stanford University Office of Science Outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Stanford University Office of Science Outreach| url=http://oso.stanford.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Canada as an example, it has been estimated that with sufficient organization, every classroom from kindergarten through graduation could in practice receive a visit from one or more scientists annually with participation from only 10-15% of the scientific enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Bechara J. Saab, [http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=902 "Engaging the Clutch of the Science Communication Continuum – Shifting Science Outreach into High Gear"], ''Hypothesis'' Volume 8 Issue 1 (September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of science outreach programs in Canada include: [[Let's Talk Science]], [[Actua (Canadian charity)|Actua]], [[Chemical Institute of Canada|The Chemical Institute of Canada]], and [[Science Rendezvous]]. 

===Workshops/schools for teachers and/or students===
[[File:Cover of the ALMA radioastronomy manual.jpg|thumb|Cover of the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] [[radioastronomy]] manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALMA Material for Teachers|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15052/|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Inviting groups of school students to a research institution for a workshop is another popular form of outreach.  Formats range from a one-day visit to more involved week-long events such as [[Perimeter Institute]]'s International Summer School for Young Physicists, a two-week-long programs for a total of a hundred Canadian and international students from grade 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/Outreach/Education/ISSYP_Overview International Summer School for Young Physicists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of science outreach invites school teachers to participate in workshops where they are able to learn effective strategies to engage students in science. This approach was especially embraced by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] which held an annual "Space Educators" conference up until 2012 to provides teachers with access to resources to educate their students in space-related science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Canadian Space Agency Educators Resources | url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/educators/default.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporting science fairs and similar events===
[[File:Cloud chamber as science for general public.jpg|thumb|One of the major goals of [[science festival]]s is to make [[science]] more accessible to [[general public]]. [[Cloud chamber]]s are popular at [[science fair]]s for their ability to visualize otherwise [[invisible]] [[radiation]] that surrounds us.]]
Besides organizing independent events, many outreach organizations sponsor existing events that promote sciences awareness. A notable examples are [[science fair]]s, [[public science]] events in which working scientists can participate both as judges and as sponsors of student projects.

=== Online aggregation of science activities, resources, and programs ===
The internet is a rich source of science activities, resources, and programs. For example, research laboratories often maintain educational outreach projects aimed at translating their science into something meaningful for the general public, often [[K–12|K-12]] students, as an effort to increase research broader impacts required by funding agencies such as the NSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/special/broaderimpacts/|title=Broader Impacts - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include activities using fast-growing plants that exhibit distinctive mutants with unique [[phenotype]]s useful to teach K-12 students about both Mendelian and molecular genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fpsc.wisc.edu/program/index.shtm|title=FPsc: genetics, evolution, modern genetic sciences|website=fpsc.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions and organizations maintain large&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/|title=Home {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or small&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/updates|title=Education and Outreach {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; aggregations of their activity resources,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanfordlab.org/education/curriculum-modules|title=Curriculum Modules {{!}} Sanford Underground Research Facility|website=www.sanfordlab.org|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; outreach programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/outreachprograms.htm|title=Outreach Programs {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; upcoming events calendars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.wisc.edu/events/feed/2/|title=Science / UW-Madison Events Calendar|website=today.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partnering programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.wisc.edu/sciencealliance.htm|title=Science Alliance {{!}} science.wisc.edu {{!}} University of Wisconsin–Madison|website=science.wisc.edu|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

A number of awards honor commitment to science outreach.  Examples include:

'''Scientific misconceptions''' are commonly held [[beliefs]] about science that have no basis in actual [[scientific fact]]. Scientific misconceptions can also refer to preconceived notions based on religious and/or cultural influences. Many scientific misconceptions occur because of faulty teaching styles and the sometimes distancing nature of true scientific texts.

== Types ==
Misconceptions (a.k.a. alternative conceptions, alternative frameworks, etc.) are a key issue from [[constructivism in science education]], a major theoretical perspective informing science teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2011). Constructivism as educational theory: Contingency in learning, and optimally guided instruction. In J. Hassaskhah (Ed.), Educational Theory (pp. 39-61). New York: Nova. From https://camtools.cam.ac.uk/wiki/eclipse/Constructivism.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, '''scientific misconceptions''' have their foundations in a few "[[intuitive]] knowledge domains, including [[folkmechanics]] (object boundaries and movements), [[folkbiology]] (biological species' configurations and relationships), and [[folkpsychology]] (interactive agents and goal-directed behavior)",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Altran S |author2=Norenzayan A |title=Religion's evolutionary landscape: Counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=27 |issue=6 |pages=713–30 |year=2004 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X04000172 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=311512 |pmid=16035401|citeseerx=10.1.1.687.8586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that enable humans to interact effectively with the world in which they evolved. That these folksciences do not map accurately onto modern scientific theory is not unexpected. A second major source of scientific misconceptions are instruction-induced or [[didaskalogenic]] misconceptions.

There has been extensive research into students' informal ideas about science topics, and studies have suggested reported misconceptions vary considerably in terms of properties such as coherence, stability, context-dependence, range of application etc.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K. S. (2009). Progressing Science Education: Constructing the scientific research programme into the contingent nature of learning science. Dordrecht: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Misconceptions can be broken down into five basic categories,[https://www.academia.edu/626065/EFFECTS_OF_LEARNER_MISCONCEPTIONS_ON_LEARNING (Alkhalifa, 2006)] 1) preconceived notions; 2) nonscientific beliefs; 3) conceptual misunderstandings; 4) vernacular misconceptions; and 5) factual misconceptions (e.g., Committee on Undergraduate Science Education, 1997).  Preconceived notions are thinking about a concept in only one way.  Specially heat, gravity, and energy.  Once a person knows how something works it is difficult to imagine it working a different way. Nonscientific beliefs are beliefs learned outside of scientific evidence.  For example, one’s beliefs about the history of world based on the bible.  Conceptual misunderstandings are ideas about what one thinks they understand based on their personal experiences or what they may have heard.  One does not fully grasp the concept and understand it.  Vernacular misconceptions happen when one word has two completely different meanings, specially in regard to science and everyday life. Factual misconceptions are ideas or beliefs that are learned at a young age but are actually incorrect.

While most student misconceptions go unrecognized, there has been an informal effort to identify errors and misconceptions present in textbooks. The [http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/BadScience.html Bad Science] web page, maintained by Alistair Fraser, is a good resource. Another important resource is the [http://www.ipn.uni-kiel.de/aktuell/stcse/stcse.html Students' and Teachers' Conceptions and Science Education] (STCSE) website maintained by Reinders Duit. Another useful resource related to chemistry has been compiled by [http://www.rsc.org/education/teachers/learnnet/miscon.htm Vanessa Barker].

== Identifying student misconceptions ==
In the context of [[Socratic instruction]], student misconceptions are identified and addressed through a process of questioning and listening. A number of strategies have been employed to understand what students are [[Belief bias|thinking prior]], or in response, to instruction. These strategies include various forms of "real type" feedback, which can involve the use of colored cards or electronic survey systems (clickers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martyn M |title=Clickers in the classroom: an active learning approach |journal=Educause Quarterly |volume=30 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=http://connect.educause.edu/Library/EDUCAUSE+Quarterly/ClickersintheClassroomAnA/40032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach is typified by the strategy known as "[[Just in Time Teaching]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jittdl.physics.iupui.edu/jitt/|title=www.jitt.org|author=|date=|website=jittdl.physics.iupui.edu|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rozycki W |title=Just-in-Time Teaching |journal=J Indiana University Research &amp; Creative Activity |volume=XXII |issue=1 |pages=8 |year=1999 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v22n1/p08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here students are asked various questions prior to class, the instructor uses these responses to adapt his or her teaching to the students' prior knowledge and misconceptions.

Finally, there is a more research-intensive approach that involves interviewing students for the purpose of generating the items that will make up a [[concept inventory]] or other forms of diagnostic instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Taber, K.

== Addressing student misconceptions ==
A number of lines of evidence suggest that the recognition and revision of student misconceptions involves active, rather than passive, involvement with the material. A common approach to instruction involves meta-cognition, that is to encourage students to think about their thinking about a particular problem. In part this approach requires students to verbalize, defend and reformulate their understanding. Recognizing the realities of the modern classroom, a number of variations have been introduced. These include [[Eric Mazur]]'s peer instruction, as well as various tutorials in physics developed groups at [http://www.phys.washington.edu/groups/peg/tut.html University of Washington] and the [http://www.physics.umd.edu/perg/abp/ University of Maryland]. Scientific inquiry is another technique that provides an active engagement opportunity for students and incorporates metacognition and critical thinking.

Success with inquiry-based learning activities relies on a deep foundation of [[factual knowledge]]. Students then use observation, imagination, and [[reasoning]] about scientific phenomena they are studying to organize knowledge within a conceptual framework.&lt;ref name=Bransford&gt;Bransford , J. D., Brown, A. L., &amp; Cocking, R. R. (2000). ''[[How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School (expanded edition)|How people learn: Brain, mind, experience, and school]]''.

How Students Learn: History, Mathematics and Science in the Classroom. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher monitors the changing concepts of the students through formative assessment as the instruction proceeds. Beginning inquiry activities should develop from simple concrete examples to more abstract.&lt;ref name="Bransford2005" /&gt; As students progress through inquiry, opportunities should be included for students to generate, ask, and discuss challenging questions. According to Magnusson and Palincsan,&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, S.J. &amp; Palincsar, A.S. (Eds).(2005). "Teaching to Promote the Development of Scientific Knowledge and Reasoning About Light at the Elementary School Level". How Students Learn: History, Mathematics and Science in the Classroom. Washington, D.C.: The National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; teachers should allow multiple cycles of investigation where students can ask the same questions as their understanding of the concept matures. Through strategies that apply formative assessment of student learning and adjust accordingly, teachers can help redirect scientific misconceptions.

[[Image:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|[[Double Herm of Socrates and Seneca]] ([[Antikensammlung Berlin]])]]

'''Senecan tragedy''' refers to a set of [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[tragedies]]. Ten of these [[Play (theatre)|plays]] exist, of which most likely eight were written by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher and politician [[Lucius Annaeus Seneca]]. The group includes ''Hercules Furens'', ''Medea'', ''Troades'', ''Phaedra'', ''Agamemnon'', ''Oedipus'', ''Phoenissae'', ''Thyestes'', ''Hercules Oetaeus'', and ''Octavia''. ''Hercules Oetaeus'' is generally considered not to have been written by Seneca, and ''Octavia'' is certainly not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century, [[Italian humanists]] rediscovered these works, making them models for the revival of tragedy on the [[Renaissance]] stage. The two great, but very different, dramatic traditions of the age — French neoclassical tragedy and [[Revenge play|Elizabethan tragedy]] — both drew inspiration from Seneca. Usually, the Senecan tragedy focuses heavily on supernatural elements.

Although many of the Senecan tragedies adapt the same Greek myths as tragedies by [[Sophocles]], [[Aeschylus]], and [[Euripides]], scholars tend not to view Seneca's works as direct adaptations of the Attic works, as Seneca's approach to the myths differs significantly from the Greek poets and often contains themes familiar from his philosophical writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Buckley|editor1-first=Emma|editor2-last=Dinter|editor2-first=Martin|title=A Companion to the Neronian Age|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Seneca's tragic style was more directly influenced by [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarrant|first1=R. J.|title=Senecan Drama and Its Antecedents|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|date=1978|volume=82|pages=213–263|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French neoclassical dramatic tradition, which reached its highest expression in the 17th-century tragedies of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]], drew on Seneca for form and grandeur of style. These neoclassicists adopted Seneca's innovation of the confidant (usually a servant), his substitution of speech for action, and his moral hairsplitting.

The Elizabethan dramatists found Seneca's themes of bloodthirsty revenge more congenial to English taste than they did his form. The first English tragedy, ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' (1561), by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]] and [[Thomas Norton]], is a chain of slaughter and revenge written in direct imitation of Seneca. (As it happens, ''Gorboduc'' does follow the form as well as the subject matter of Senecan tragedy: but only a very few other English plays—e.g. ''[[The Misfortunes of Arthur]]''—followed its lead in this.) Senecan influence is also evident in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', and in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. All three share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and The Spanish Tragedy and Hamlet also have ghosts among the cast; all of these elements can be traced back to the Senecan model.

{{nihongo|'''''Sexfriend'''''|セックスフレンド|Sekkusufurendo}} is a [[hentai]] [[computer game]] and [[anime]]. ''Sexfriend'' focuses on the [[protagonist]], Tomohiro Takabe, who has his first sexual encounter in the nurse's office after school with his classmate, Mina Hayase. He eventually desires a real romantic relationship, not just "friends with benefits." Another student, Kaori Nonomiya, sees Takabe and Hayase having sex and runs off disappointed because she loves Takabe. She eventually joins them in a threesome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4228">'''Simplicity theory''' is a cognitive theory that seeks to explain the attractiveness of situations or events to human minds. It is 
based on work done by scientists like Nick Chater, [[Paul Vitanyi]], [[Jean-Louis Dessalles]], and [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]. It claims that interesting 
situations appear simpler than expected to the observer. 

== Overview ==

Technically, simplicity corresponds in a drop in [[Kolmogorov complexity]], which means that, for an observer, the shortest description 
of the situation is shorter than anticipated. For instance, the description of a consecutive lottery draw, such as 22-23-24-25-26-27, is 
significantly shorter than a typical one, such as 12-22-27-37-38-42. The former requires only one instantiation (choice of a number
among all possible numbers in the lottery), whereas the latter requires six instantiations.

Simplicity theory makes several quantitative predictions concerning the way distance, recency, prominence (places, individuals), or 
atypicality influence interestingness. 

== Formalization ==
The basic concept of simplicity theory is ''unexpectedness'', defined as the difference between expected complexity and observed complexity:

:&lt;math&gt;U = C_\text{exp} - C_\text{obs}.&lt;/math&gt;

In most contexts, &lt;math&gt;C_\text{exp}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to ''generation'' complexity, which is the smallest description of all parameters 
that must be set in the "world" for the situation to exist. In the lottery example, generation complexity is identical for a consecutive draw 
and a typical draw (as long as no cheating is imagined) and amounts to six instantiations.

Simplicity theory avoids most criticisms addressed at [[Kolmogorov complexity]] by considering only descriptions that are ''available'' 
to a given ''observer'' (instead of any imaginable description). This amounts to saying that complexity, and thus unexpectedness, are 
observer-dependent. For instance, the typical draw 12-22-27-37-38-42 will appear very simple, even simpler than the consecutive one, to 
the person who played that combination.

== Connection with probability ==
Unexpectedness &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is linked to [[subjective probability]] &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;P = 2^{-U}.&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of this formula is that subjective probability can be assessed without necessarily knowing the alternatives. Classical 
approaches to probability would consider all situations in the world as having virtually zero probability to have occurred, as each 
situation is complex and unique. Simplicity theory avoids this trap by considering that subjective improbability is only due to 
complexity drop.

'''Small Island Developing States''' ('''SIDS''') are a group of small [[island countries]] that tend to share similar [[sustainable development]] challenges, including small but growing populations, limited resources, remoteness, susceptibility to [[natural disaster]]s, vulnerability to external shocks, excessive dependence on [[international trade]], and fragile environments. Their growth and development is also held back by high communication, energy and transportation costs, irregular international transport volumes, disproportionately expensive public administration and [[infrastructure]] due to their small size, and little to no opportunity to create [[economies of scale]].

The SIDS were first recognized as a distinct group of developing countries at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in June 1992. The [[Barbados Programme of Action]] was produced in 1994 to assist the SIDS in their sustainable development efforts. The [[United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States]] (UN-OHRLLS) represents this group of states.

==Embracing sustainability==

Many SIDS now recognise the need to move towards low-carbon, [[Climate resilience|climate resilient]] economies, as set out in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) implementation plan for climate change-resilient development. SIDS often rely heavily on imported fossil fuels, spending an ever-larger proportion of their GDP on energy imports.  Renewable technologies have the advantage of providing energy at a lower cost than fossil fuels and making SIDS more sustainable. Barbados has been successful in adopting the use of solar water heaters (SWHs). A 2012 report published by the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] showed that its SWH industry now boasts over 50,000 installations. These have saved consumers as much as US$137 million since the early 1970s. The report suggested that Barbados's experience could be easily replicated in other SIDS with high fossil fuel imports and abundant sunshine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/resource/cdkn-inside-story-seizing-the-sunshine-barbados-thriving-solar-water-heater-industry/?loclang=en_gb ''Seizing the sunshine – Barbados’ thriving solar water heater industry''], [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]], 17 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of SIDS ==
Currently, the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] lists 57 small island developing states. These are broken down into three geographic regions: the [[Caribbean]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Caribbean|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1522|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Pacific]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pacific|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1523|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Africa]], [[Indian Ocean]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[South China Sea]] (AIMS).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The AIMS|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1521|publisher=UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA)|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Associate Members of the Regional Commissions. Each of these regions has a regional cooperation body: the [[Caribbean Community]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Indian Ocean Commission]] respectively, which many SIDS are members or associate members of. In addition, most (but not all) SIDS are members of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), which performs lobbying and negotiating functions for the SIDS within the [[United Nations]] system. The [[UNCTAD]] website states that "the UN never established criteria to determine an official list of SIDS" but it maintains a shorter, unofficial list on its website for analytical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNCTAD´s unofficial list of SIDS|url=http://unctad.org/en/pages/aldc/Small%20Island%20Developing%20States/UNCTAD%C2%B4s-unofficial-list-of-SIDS.aspx|publisher=UNCTAD|accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2014) ''The Sociotechnical Perspective: Information Systems and Information Technology'', Volume 2 (Computing Handbook Set, Third Edition,) edited by Heikki Topi and Allen Tucker. Chapman and Hall/CRC. | http://sawyer.syr.edu/publications/2013/sociotechnical%20chapter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of social informatics use the relationship of a [[Biology|biological]] [[community]] to its [[Ecology|environment]] as an [[analogy]] for the relationship of tools to [[person|people]] who use them. The [http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/ Center for Social Informatics] founded by the late Dr. [[Rob Kling]], an early champion of the field’s ideas, defines the field thus:

:Social Informatics (SI) refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization – including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices.&lt;ref name="rkcsi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics|title=Homepage of Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics|url=http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/|website=Indiana University|publisher=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics|accessdate=22 August 2016|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Historically, Western European concepts of social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries and the UK.&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|last2=Edge|first2=David|title=The social shaping of technology|journal=Research Policy|date=1996|volume=25|issue=6|pages=865–899|doi=10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings can be traced to the 1980s in Norway and Slovenia.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fichman|first1=Pnina|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Howard|title=Social Informatics: Past, Present and Future|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|isbn=978-1443855761}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamentals of social informatics in the USA were laid by Kling in 1996 with his colleagues and students from Indiana University.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014" /&gt; Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt; There are several approaches, which were historically named or classified as social informatics: American, Russian, British, Norwegian, Slovenian, German and Japanese.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smutny|first1=Zdenek|title=Social informatics as a concept: Widening the discourse|journal=Journal of Information Science|date=2016|volume=42|issue=5|pages=681–710|doi=10.1177/0165551515608731}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest concept of social informatics was founded in the USSR by A.V. Sokolov and his colleagues in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chugunov2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chugunov|first1=Andrey Vladimirovich|title=Социальная информатика: Учебное пособие|date=2012|publisher=НИУ ИТМО|location=Санкт-Петербургский}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society which are dictated by the technology’s stated capabilities.&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt;  Similarly, the socially [[Determinism|deterministic theory]] represented by some proponents of the [[social construction of technology|social construction of technology (SCOT)]] or [[social shaping of technology]] theory as advocated by Williams &amp; Edge (1996)&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt; see technology as the product of human social forces.  In contrast, some social informatics methodologies consider the context surrounding technology and the material properties of the technology to be equally important:  the people who will interact with a system, the organizational policies governing work practice, and support resources.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This contextual inquiry produces "nuanced [[concept]]ual understanding" of systems that can be used to examine issues like access to technology, [[Telecommunication|electronic forms of communication]], and large-scale [[Computer networking|networks]].&lt;ref name="Kling2000a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kling|first1=Rob|title=Learning about information technologies and social change: The contribution of social informatics|journal=The Information Society|date=2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=217–232|doi=10.1080/01972240050133661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in social informatics can be categorized into three orientations.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt;  [[Norm (sociology)|Normative]] research focuses on the development of theories based on [[empirical]] analysis that may be used to develop organizational policies and work practices.&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; The heart of such analyses lies in socio-technical interaction networks,&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; a framework built around the idea that humans and the technologies they build are "[[Coconstitutionalism|co-constitutive]]", bound together, and that any examination of one must necessarily consider the other. Studies of the analytical orientation develop theory or define methodologies to contribute to theorizing in institutional settings.&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt;  Critical analysis, like [[Lucy Suchman]]’s examination of articulation work,&lt;ref name="Suchman1994"&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Lucy|last1=Suchman|title=Supporting articulation work: Aspects of a feminist practice of office technology production|conference=Proceedings of the 5th IFIP WG9.1 Conference on Women, Work and Computerization|date=1994|publisher=Elsevier|location=New York|pages=7–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; examine technological solutions from non-traditional perspectives in order to influence design and implementation.&lt;ref name="SawyerRosenbaum2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt;

==Future==
Social informatics is a young intellectual movement and its future is still being defined.  However, because SST theorists such as [[Robin Williams (academic)|Williams]] and Edge suggest that the [[amorphous]] boundaries between humans and technology that emerge in social shaping technology research indicate that technology is not a distinct social endeavor worthy of individual study,&lt;ref name="WilliamsEdge1996" /&gt; indicating that there is a need for social informatics research that bridges the gap between technological and social [[determinism]].  This observation, coupled with the many fields that contribute research, suggest a future in which social informatics theories and concepts settle to form a substrate, an "indispensable analytical foundation"&lt;ref name="Kling2000a" /&gt; for work in other disciplines.

Relevant topics about future direction of social informatics are discussed in the book by Fichman and Rosenbaum.&lt;ref name="FichmanRosenbaum2014" /&gt; Conceptualization of international discourse, including current trends in research and direction of social informatics development is presented in an article by Smutny.&lt;ref name="Smutny2016" /&gt; This article discusses current possibilities of development of social informatics within the international discourse of various concepts including possible areas for future cooperation. Other topical article by Marcinkowski&lt;ref name="Marcinkowski2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcinkowski|first1=Michael|title=Data, Ideology, and the Developing Critical Program of Social Informatics|journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology|date=2016|volume=67|issue=5|pages=1266–1275|doi=10.1002/asi.23483}}&lt;/ref&gt; presents a perspective shift from studying only the effects of the implementation and use of technology to the primary discussion of what are the ideological implications of empirical work in social informatics connected with data analytics approach.

==In education==
Social informatics is also about teaching social issues of computing to computer science students.&lt;ref name="KlingJewett1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kling|first1=Rob|last2=Jewett|first2=Tom|title=The Social Design of Worklife with Computers and Networks: An Open Natural Systems Perspective|journal=Advances in Computers|date=1994|volume=39|pages=239–293|doi=10.1016/S0065-2458(08)60381-2|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/13m1k4jg|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on educational traditions, social informatics is scattered in the curriculum of different disciplines, as well as in [[computer science]], information science, [[informatics (academic field)|informatics]] (Europe) and web sociology.&lt;ref name="Kling2007" /&gt; In some instances there might be a lack of understanding of why teaching social issues of computing is important, both by individual lecturers and students, resulting in a view that social informatics is boring and without importance.&lt;ref name="Godejord2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godejord|first1=Per Arne|title=Fighting child pornography: Exploring didactics and student engagement in social informatics|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=2007|volume=58|issue=3|pages=446–451|doi=10.1002/asi.20522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on [[didactics]] of social informatics.&lt;ref name="Godejord2007" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1328">'''Social Nature''' is the core concept of a geographical work on the [[social construction]] of [[nature]], entitled ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', which has been published by [[Noel Castree]] and [[Bruce Braun]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, B., ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford and New York: Blackwell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

It says that the concept of Social Nature was created by [[Critical geography|critical geographers]] and embraces the idea of a [[socialize]]d [[nature]]. Critical geographers like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] and [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]] "insisted that nature is social in three related ways":&lt;ref&gt;CASTREE, Noel and BRAUN, Bruce (Eds.), ''Social nature: theory, practice and politics'', Oxford: Blackwell, 2001, pp.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge "of nature is invariably inflected with the biases of the" knowers,
*"Though knowledges of nature are social through and through, the social dimensions of nature are not reducible to knowledge alone",
*Societies "''physically reconstitute'' nature, both intentionally and unintentionally", to the point of internalizing nature into social processes (particularly in advanced Western societies).

'''Tadesse Meskela''' is the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]] of Ethiopia and was featured in the documentary ''[[Black Gold (2006 film)|Black Gold]]''. He is a proponent of [[Fair trade|fair-trade]], and speaks publicly in support of it around the world. 

He grew up in the countryside outside Addis Ababa, Bishoftu. Tadesse Meskela studied his way out of poverty and eventually made it to university. By the early 1990s he was working for the state Agricultural Bureau. He attended a two-month co-operative training placement in Japan and was inspired to develop a cooperative union system to help Ethiopian coffee farmers attain a fairer recompense for their produce. The Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union was established in 1999. In the year 2004, the union has facilitated the constructed of four new schools, seventeen additional classrooms, four health centres, two clean water supply stations, and in terms of dividends, $2 million has been given back to the farmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2064">In [[music]], '''tension''' is the anticipation music creates in a listener's mind for relaxation or release. For example, tension may be produced through [[Repetition (music)|reiteration]], increase in [[dynamics (music)|dynamic level]], gradual motion to a higher or lower [[pitch (music)|pitch]], or (partial) [[Syncopation|syncopations]] between [[consonance and dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kliewer, Vernon (1975). "Melody: Linear Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music", ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;290. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments in music perception have explored perceived tension in music &lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, W. E. (1999). "Effect of Musical Performance on Perception of Tension in Gustav Holst's First Suite in E-flat", ''Journal of Research in Music Education'', 47(1), 44–52.&lt;/ref&gt; and perceived emotional intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Brittin, R. V., &amp; Duke, R. A. (1997). "Continuous versus Summative Evaluations of Musical Intensity: A Comparison of Two Methods for Measuring Overall Effect", ''International Journal of Research in Music Education'', 45(2), 245–258.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sloboda, J. A., &amp; Lehmann, A. C. (2001). "Tracking Performance Correlates of Changes in Perceived Intensity of Emotion During Different Interpretations of a Chopin Piano Prelude", ''Music Perception'', 19(1), 87–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The balance between tension and [[wikt:repose|repose]] are explored in [[musical analysis]]—determined by contrasts that are, "...of great interest to the style analyst," and can be analyzed in several, even conflicting layers—as different musical elements such as harmony may create different levels of tension than rhythm and melody.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p.15. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A trophy or '''trophy of arms''' in art and architecture is a real or depicted artistically assembled display of weaponry and other militaria, often captured from a defeated enemy, as an [[Ornament (art)|ornament]] designed for the purpose of triumphalist display by a victor or as a show of military prowess by a monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ''The Oxford Companion to Art'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1990, p. 1161-2&lt;/ref&gt; Similar decorative vertical arrangements of hunting accessories, musical instruments or other objects are also commonly referred to as trophies.

The term comes from the ancient Greek ''[[Tropaion]]'' and Roman equivalent ''Tropaeum'', military victories which were commemorated with a display of actual captured [[weapon|arms]], [[armour]] and [[Heraldic standard|standards]]. The use of trophies as an ornament in decoration became popular in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and as   an architectural element in [[relief]] or free-standing sculpture during the [[baroque]] era, where they are often used as a kind of [[finial]] to decorate rooflines, gate columns and other elements of buildings with military associations, which included most royal palaces.

The [[Triumphs of Caesar (Mantegna)|''Triumphs of Caesar'']] by [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1482–94, now [[Royal Collection]]) are a series of paintings of the [[Roman triumph]] of [[Julius Caesar]] that soon became enormously influential in [[old master print|print]] form.  They showed trophies carried on carts and on poles, and 
probably gave a big impetus to the trend for [[ornament print]]s of trophies, which were then copied into a range of media. 
   
==Origins==
The practice was used in the classical age by the Greeks and Romans.  [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' relates the practice of warriors in the [[Trojan War]] removing the armour and weapons of a killed opponent in order to make an offering to the gods. This was contrasted to mere [[Treasure|booty]]. Trophies of arms were commonly depicted on Greek and Roman coins.

In England a tradition of making trophies of arms and armour, designed to display British military prowess, was established in the armoury of the [[Tower of London]] from the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalarmouries.org/tower-of-london/power-house/dragon]&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1700 John Harris created an impressive display in the Grand Storehouse which included a serpent and a seven-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], together with a variety of weapons including muskets, pistols and swords. The antiquarian William Maitland described it as a sight "no one ever beheld without astonishment...not to be matched perhaps in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalarmouries.org/tower-of-london/power-house/dragon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituent elements==
Elements commonly depicted within antique trophies of arms include:
*breastplates
*spears
*halberds
*bows
*arrows
*quivers
*lit torches
*swords
*cannon and balls
*captured military standards
*clubs

'''Type II partnerships''' were developed at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in 2002. Arising in opposition to the [[State (polity)|state]]-centred [[Ecogovernmentality|eco-governmentality]] of previous approaches to [[sustainable development]] policy, the partnerships facilitate the inclusion of private and civil [[Actor (policy debate)|actors]] into the management of sustainable development. The partnerships are employed alongside traditional [[Intergovernmentalism|intergovernmental]] mechanisms in order to effectively implement the United Nations' [[Agenda 21]] and [[Millennium Development Goals]], particularly at sub-national level. Although widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and effective developments in global [[environmental governance]] in recent years, the partnerships have faced criticism due to fears of a lack of [[accountability]], and the risk that they may exacerbate inequalities of power between Northern and Southern states. Despite these reservations, there is a general consensus among state and non-governmental actors that Type II partnerships are a significantly progressive step in global environmental governance in general, and sustainable development [[discourse]] in particular.&lt;ref name="Witte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Witte|first=J.M.|title=or Peril? Networks and Partnerships in Global Environmental Governance|year=2003|publisher=Global Public Policy Institute|location=Washington D.C.|authorlink=The Road from Johannesburg: What Future for Partnerships in Global Environmental Governance?|author2=Streck, C. |author3=Benner, T. |editor=T. Benner |editor2=C. Streck |editor3=J.M. Witte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and development==

First proposed at the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, Type II partnerships are characterised by collaborations between national or sub-national governments, private sector actors and civil society actors, who form [[Voluntariness|voluntary]] transnational agreements in order to meet specific sustainable development goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Susan|title=Sustainable Development|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johannesburg negotiations also produced so-called Type I outcomes referred to under the umbrella of a Global Deal, a series of legally binding intergovernmental commitments designed to aid states in the implementation of sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name="Death"&gt;{{cite book|last=Death|first=Carl|title=Governing Sustainable Development: Partnerships, Protests and Power at the World Summit|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the discussions preceding the summit, a growing consensus emerged among the actors involved that traditional intergovernmental relations were no longer sufficient in the management of sustainable development, and consequently the talks began to incorporate suggestions for increasingly [[Decentralisation|decentralised]] and [[Participation (decision making)|participatory]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Von Moltke|first=K|title=Governments and International Civil Society in Sustainable Development: A Framework|journal=International Environmental Agreements: Politics, Law and Economics|year=2002|volume=2|issue=4|pages=341–359|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/r357283n24j85mr1/|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considered to be one of the most innovative and celebrated outcomes of the 2002 summit, the partnerships were created as a means by which to further implement the sustainable development goals set out in the Agenda 21 action plan, particularly those objectives aimed at the local and regional level, as traditional Type I intergovernmental strategies were deemed unlikely to effectively achieve lower level implementation of the Agenda 21 plan.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"&gt;{{cite book|last=UNESCAP|title=Regional Follow-Up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|location=Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johannesburg negotiations concluded that Type II partnerships must meet seven key criteria: i) they should be voluntary and based on shared responsibility, ii) they must complement, rather than substitute, intergovernmental sustainable development strategies, and must meet the agreed outcomes of the Johannesburg summit, iii) they must consist of a range of multi-level [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], preferably within a given area of work, iv) they must ensure [[Transparency (social)|transparency]] and accountability, v) they must produce tangible results, vi) the partnership must be new, and adequate funding must be available, and vii) a follow-up process must be developed. If these requirements were successfully fulfilled, it was hoped that Type II partnerships could create a fundamental shift in sustainable development discourse, leading to an increasingly participatory, bottom-up method of governing the issue.&lt;ref name="UNESCAP"/&gt;

== Implementation and management==

Following the Johannesburg summit, the [[United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development]] was granted responsibility for the management of Type II partnerships as its [[:wikt:mandate|mandate]] and focus were considered most appropriate to the supervision of the partnerships. The UNCSD was created following the [[Earth Summit|1992 Rio summit]] with the sole mandate of overseeing the implementation of Agenda 21 and the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], a focus which made the UNCSD highly amenable to the management of Type II agreements. The UNCSD supervises the 300+ Type II partnerships formed as a result of the summit, ensuring that the partnerships continue to implement the sustainable development goals agreed at Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bull|first=B|title=International Handbook on Public-Private Partnerships|year=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|authorlink=Public-Private Partnerships: The United Nations Experience|editor=G.A. Hodge |editor2=C. Greve |editor3=A.E. Boardman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of one of the larger partnerships supervised by the UNCSD is the [[Global Water Partnership]], a network of over 2,300 global partners composed of organisations including UN agencies, governments of developed and developing countries, development banks, research institutions, [[NGOs]] and private actors. The organisation aims to diffuse information regarding water management to stakeholders at all levels, and assists countries in the development of water management strategies at the local, national and global level, increasing the capacity of developing nations to manage water supplies in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Global Water Partnership|title=About GWP|url=http://www.gwp.org/en/About-GWP/|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in environmental governance==

=== Transition from government to governance===

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“This Summit will be remembered not for the treaties, commitments, or eloquent declarations it produced, but for the first stirrings of a new way of governing the global commons, the beginnings of a shift from the stiff formal waltz of traditional diplomacy to the jazzier dance of improvisational solution oriented partnerships that may include non-government organizations, willing governments and other stakeholders.”'' World Resources Institute, 2002&lt;ref name="WRI"&gt;{{cite web|last=World Resources Institute|title=The Johannesburg Summit- News Release|url=http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|accessdate=11 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807172431/http://archive.wri.org/newsroom/wrifeatures_text.cfm?ContentID=371|archivedate=7 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dominance of Type II partnerships as a primary outcome of the Johannesburg summit represented a fundamental shift in the governing of sustainable development; a transition from the top-down, government-centred method favoured by the [[Brundtland Report]] and at the 1992 Rio summit, to a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach which acknowledged the importance of the economic and social expertise of non-governmental actors in sustainable development initiatives. Immediately prior to the summit, then- UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] predicted that whilst [[governments]] would be responsible for the creation of a common plan of action for sustainable development, the most significant and powerful agents of change to emerge from the Johannesburg negotiations would be Type II partnerships, through which the UN hoped to harness the technological, financial and scientific resources of partners involved in the agreements, reinvigorating the organisation's pursuit of sustainable development.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

The UN guidelines for Type II partnerships specified that the agreements should be complementary to, not an alternative to, intergovernmental action plans for sustainable development. As opposed to developing the partnerships as a method of 'governing without government', the agreements were designed to govern alongside traditional government approaches. Rather than treating Type II partnerships as a [[panacea]] for sustainable development, it was hoped that such participatory multi-stakeholder governance mechanisms would increase the flexibility and enhance the implementation of sustainable development policy in collaboration with states and international organisations. After the Johannesburg summit, the concept of environmental governance was no longer understood as a legalistic function performed solely by governments, but rather as a collaborative, informal approach to the management of environmental issues, involving both state and non-governmental actors. This new understanding demonstrates that the changing approach to sustainable development which arose from the Johannesburg summit influenced a much wider shift in global environmental governance.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

==== Competing rationalities of government====

Within a [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] context, the Type I and Type II arguments presented in the summit negotiations represent two fundamentally opposing [[Governmentality|rationalities of government]]. The [[Interventionism (politics)|interventionist]], state-centric approach to sustainable development favoured by advocates of the Global Deal represents a rationality of government which Foucault&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foucault|first=Michel|title=The Will to Knowledge: The History of Sexuality, vol. 1|year=1998|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified as [[Biopolitics|bio-politics]]; the application of political power in an attempt to control or modify life processes. Such an approach to the pursuit of sustainable development offers little opportunity for participation by private or civil actors, in direct contrast to the multi-stakeholder premise of Type II partnerships. The eco-governmental, disciplinary ideas conveyed in the Global Deal suggest that the Type I approach typifies the centralised [[command-and-control]] method favoured by traditional government, whereas the decentralised, voluntary nature of Type II partnerships demonstrates an advanced liberal governmentality which empowers non-state actors to undertake responsibility for the governing of sustainable development, an approach which is representative of the participatory, multi-stakeholder methods by which governance is characterised.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt; The eventual dominance of Type II partnerships in the outcomes of the Johannesburg summit therefore symbolises a wider shift in the understanding of the purposes, ends and means of government in relation to sustainable development and environmental governance.

However, Mert&lt;ref name="Mert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mert|first=A|title=Partnerships for sustainable development as discursive practice: Shifts in discourses of environment and democracy|journal=Forest Policy and Economics|year=2009|volume=11|issue=5–6|pages=326–339|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VT4-4V1V4W8-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=10%2F31%2F2009&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=gateway&amp;_origin=gateway&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=15ccd8bbaafc4015ed26846ca6267eb1&amp;searchtype=a|accessdate=14 May 2011|doi=10.1016/j.forpol.2008.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the compatibility of partnerships with the global governance of sustainable development. The partnerships represented a point of intersection between three previously separate political discourses; [[participatory democracy]], [[private governance]], and sustainable development, altering the dynamics of global environmental governance processes. The shift towards voluntary [[Mechanism (sociology)|mechanisms]] as opposed to international regulation could prove problematic as legally binding [[Legal framework|frameworks]] are sometimes the most appropriate solution to the governance of environmental problems. A [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] approach to sustainable development discourse could demonstrate greater effectiveness in the management of the issue than a fragmented, partnership-driven approach which could lead to inconsistent and conflicting management of such a global issue.&lt;ref name="Mert"/&gt;

=== Transnational governance networks===

Type II partnerships exemplify a growing reliance on public-private-civil co-operation in environmental governance. The architects of the summit placed an emphasis on discussions which would encourage the creation of multi-stakeholder partnerships with the objective of fulfilling UN sustainable development goals, acknowledging that traditional intergovernmental agreements were inadequate to sufficiently promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andonova|first=L.B.|author2=Levy, M.A.|title=Franchising Global Governance: Making Sense of the Johannesburg Type II Partnerships|journal=Yearbook of International Co-operation on Environment and Development 2003/04|year=2003|url=http://web-prod.iheid.ch/webdav/site/iheid/shared/iheid/800/andonova/Andonova-Levy2.pdf|accessdate=5 May 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, state actors were notoriously unwilling to improve international environmental co-operation prior to the Johannesburg summit, leaving those who sought a positive outcome to the WSSD to search for alternative solutions which incorporated a broader variety of actors.&lt;ref name="Andonova"&gt;{{cite book|title=International Organisations in Global Environmental Governance|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|author=Andonova, L.B.|authorlink=International Organisations as Entrepreneurs of Environmental Partnerships|editor1=F. Biermann |editor2=B. Siebenhüner |editor3=A. Schreyögg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Type II partnerships emerged as the dominant outcome of the Johannesburg summit, highlighting their importance as agents of change in the achievement of sustainable development. The partnerships were considered by advocates to be representative of a new era of environmental governance, characterised by collaborative decision-making and shared responsibility between public, private and civil actors in the management of [[International|transnational]] public issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Partnerships, Governance and Sustainable Development: Reflections on Theory and Practice|year=2007|publisher=Edward Elgar|location=Cheltenham|author=Glasbergen, P.|authorlink=Setting the Scene: The Partnership Paradigm in the Making|editor=P. Glasbergen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of Type II partnerships marked the emergence of a broader phenomenon within environmental governance- the introduction of [[Network governance|transnational governance networks]] in the management of global environmental issues. Transnational governance networks combine actors from the public, private and civil sectors in the pursuit of common practices and ideas.&lt;ref name="Andonova"/&gt; The role of networks of private and civil actors in transboundary communication is not novel to the academic community; however, the emphasis on transnational public-private-civil networks as mechanisms for achieving sustainable development during the Johannesburg negotiations led to recognition of the ability of such networks to integrate private and civil actors into the global environmental governance process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=J|title=Environmental Governance|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational governance networks address a number of shortcomings in traditional state-centred approaches to the management of transboundary issues such as sustainable development. They can diffuse information to the public perhaps more effectively than governments or international organisations, particularly when such information requires a degree of technical expertise to deliver, such as the transfer of specialised knowledge from the private sector to industry groups regarding sustainable business practices. They can also facilitate the implementation of global management strategies at the local level, and they may potentially close the participation gap in global environmental governance by involving private and civil actors in decision-making processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biermann|first=F |author2=Chan, M-S. |author3=Mert, A. |author4=Pattberg, P. |title=Multi-stakeholder Partnerships for Sustainable Development: Does the Promise Hold?|journal=Paper presented at the 2007 Amsterdam Conference on the Human Dimensions of Global Environmental Change|year=2007|url=http://www.2007amsterdamconference.org/Downloads/AC2007_%20BiermannChanMertPattberg.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reframing of sustainable development discourse===

The Johannesburg summit represented a further shift in the governing of sustainable development; rather than considering environmental issues in isolation, as had previously been common practice within sustainable development policy, the Johannesburg negotiations concluded that a reframing of sustainable development discourse, which re-conceptualised sustainable development as a dynamic interaction between three interdependent pillars- society, environment and economy- was necessary in order to pursue a more [[holistic]] ideal of sustainable development. This reframing of sustainable development required Type II partnerships to address a broader concept of sustainable development, and consequently objectives such as poverty alleviation and community involvement feature alongside environmental issues in the objectives of the partnerships.&lt;ref name="Death"/&gt;

== Issues==

=== Imbalances of power===

Although designed to incorporate a broader range of social, environmental and economic perspectives into the environmental governance process and to facilitate the inclusion of actors from all levels into decision-making, the extent to which imbalances of power between actors involved in the partnerships affects their implementation has provoked concern among their critics.&lt;ref name="AndonovaLevy"/&gt;

Brinkerhoff and Brinkerhoff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brinkerhoff|first=D.W.|author2=Brinkerhoff, J.M. |title=Partnerships between international donors and non-governmental development organizations: opportunities and constraints|journal=Review of Administrative Sciences|year=2004|volume=70|issue=2|pages=253–270|url=http://ras.sagepub.com/content/70/2/253.short|accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorised that an effective partnership must fulfil two essential criteria: mutuality- interdependence and equality between partners, and organisational identity- the equal maintenance of each partner’s missions and goals. In the event of a partnership between Northern and Southern actors, for example, the North will inevitably contribute greater financial and material resources to the partnership than the South, creating a power inequality which may enable the North to assume control of the partnership and impairing the mutuality necessary for the partnership to function successfully.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blagescu|first=M.|author2=Young, J. |title=Partnerships and Accountability: Current thinking and approaches among agencies supporting Civil Society Organisations|journal=ODI Working Paper no. 255|year=2005|url=http://kms1.isn.ethz.ch|accessdate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concern was reflected by a number of developing nations who formed a coalition to lobby against the development of Type II partnerships, fearing that the partnerships would award too much authority over sustainable development to the global North, whilst simultaneously reducing the responsibility of industrialised nations to develop and implement legally binding intergovernmental management strategies.&lt;ref name="Witte"/&gt;

In order to maintain mutuality, it is therefore essential that the definition of a contribution within Type II partnerships is extended beyond financial and material resources, and includes knowledge, skills and other relevant strengths which can be incorporated to redress the balance of power within the partnership.&lt;ref name="Blagescu"/&gt;

=== Accountability===

Critics of Type II partnerships have expressed concern that the initiative is simply a means by which to deflect accountability for sustainable development management from states and international organisations. The United States, a nation infamously opposed to state-led environmental governance as evidenced by their withdrawal from the [[Kyoto protocol]], strongly supported the development of Type II partnerships whilst continuing to oppose Type I outcomes, leading to concern that some nations may view Type II partnerships as an opportunity to deflect attention from a lack of state-level progress in the management of sustainable development. An emphasis on Type II partnerships, it is argued, could therefore be exploited by nations who wish to avoid accountability for the management of sustainable development and environmental issues, transferring responsibility for such issues to private actors who are less accountable to the needs of those affected by the problem in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Survival For a Small Planet|year=2004|publisher=Earthscan|location=London|author=Bigg, T.|authorlink=The World Summit on Sustainable Development: Was It Worth It?|editor=T. Bigg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ensuring of accountability and transparency is a key criterion of Type II partnerships; however, the diverse multi-stakeholder composition of the partnerships negates the use of traditional accountability methods, such as the introduction of a centralised authority charged with maintaining the accountability of the partners involved in Type II agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=T.N.|author2=Mauzerall, D.L. |title=Thinking Globally and Acting Locally: Can the Johannesburg Partnerships Coordinate Action on Sustainable Development?|journal=Journal of Environment and Development|year=2004|volume=13|issue=3|pages=220–239|url=http://jed.sagepub.com/content/13/3/220.short|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bäckstrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bäckstrand|first=K|title=Democratizing Global Environmental Governance?

== Discussion==

The Type II partnerships developed at the Johannesburg summit demonstrated a paradigm-shifting impact upon sustainable development discourse and the conceptualisation of global environmental governance. By addressing the limitations of the state-centric, top-down method which typified environmental governance prior to Johannesburg and facilitating the participation of private and civil actors in the governing of sustainable development, the partnerships became emblematic of the transition from command-and-control government to the informal, participatory governance mechanisms by which global environmental governance is now classified. Furthermore, the partnerships exemplify the use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level. Such factors led the World Resources Institute&lt;ref name="WRI"/&gt; to declare the partnerships representative of a ‘new era’ of environmental governance.

However, considering the flaws inherent in the partnerships, it is crucial that advocates of the agreements resist the temptation to consider them a magic bullet with which every shortcoming of a centralised approach to environmental governance can be addressed. Although advantageous in terms of increased flexibility and effective lower-level implementation of policies, partnerships lack the internal and external accountability of intergovernmental strategies, and may intensify power inequalities between the industrialised North and developing South. The decision of the UN to introduce Type II partnerships as complementary governance mechanism is therefore the most appropriate application of the partnerships, as the dynamic interaction between intergovernmental strategies and voluntary public-private-civil partnerships can potentially produce a far greater positive impact upon global environmental governance than the sum of its parts.

[[File:VertiCrop.jpg|thumb|Lettuce grown in indoor vertical farming system]]

'''Vertical farming''' is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and [[controlled-environment agriculture]] (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases...) and [[fertigation]]. Some vertical farms use techniques similar to [[greenhouse]]s, where natural [[sunlight]] can be augmented with artificial [[lighting]] and [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]].&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974"&gt;Hix, John. 1974.

Hydroponic systems can be lit by LEDs that mimic sunlight. Software can ensure that all the plants get the same amount of light, water and nutrients. Proper managements means that no herbicides or pesticides are required.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/|title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world|last=Marks|first=Paul|date=15 January 2014|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The term "vertical farming" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book ''Vertical Farming''. His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about [[farming]] with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as "vertical" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924000349328 |title=Vertical farming (1915) |publisher=E. I. duPont de Nemours Powder Co. |location=Wilmington, Del.  |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern usage of the term "vertical farming" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistory skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.

===Mixed-use skyscrapers===
Mixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect [[Ken Yeang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecture.org.au/news/enews/354-ken-yeang-and-bioclimatic-architecture|title=Ken Yeang and Bioclimatic Architecture|website=www.architecture.org.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.

===Despommier's skyscrapers===
Ecologist [[Dickson Despommier]] argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less [[embodied energy]] and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production, despite the ecological and environmental costs of extracting materials to build skyscrapers for the simple purpose of agricultural production.{{citation needed|reason=the 2nd part of the sentence sounds like a reader's inserted opinion, not Despommier's|date=February 2016}}

Despommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at [[Columbia University]]. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15farm.html |title=Country, the City Version: Farms in the Sky Gain New Interest  |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date= 2008-07-15|accessdate=2011-01-05 |first=Bina |last=Venkataraman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackable shipping containers===
Several companies have developed stacking recycled [[Intermodal_container|shipping containers]] in urban settings. Brighterside Consulting created a complete off-grid container system. [[Freight Farms]] produces a "leafy green machine" that is a complete [[farm-to-table]] system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, [[LED]] lighting and intuitive climate controls built within a 12&amp;nbsp;m &amp;times; 2.4&amp;nbsp;m shipping container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-PUIXUPgw|title=2015 Leafy Green Machine by Freight Farms|first=|last=Freight Farms|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked "growpods".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zWommg6JVfY|title=PodPonics Info Video 3d Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar farm is under construction in Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=r-Iymp-gdbo|title=PodPonics Oman Video Blog Part 1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=PrLTuGKcvPA|title=Oman Video Blog Part 2: Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; TerraFarms offer a proprietary&lt;ref name="localrootsfarms-how-we-farm-tech"&gt;{{cite web

Controlling light governs the growth cycle of the plant. E.g., infrared LEDs can mimic 5 minutes of sunset, stimulating some plants to begin flowering.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-science-2017-12-local-roots-farm-in-a-box"/&gt;

==Technology==
Lighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28 per cent efficient, which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. However, lighting engineers at [[Philips]] have demonstrated LEDs with 68 per cent efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.

==History==
One of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.ctbuh.org/PDF_Previews/Journal/CTBUHJournal_2009-2.pdf Nakheel Harbor and Tower] &lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Delirious New York''.  Koolhaas wrote that this 1909 theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas2014"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=163oAwAAQBAJ}}|title=Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan|last=Koolhaas|first=Rem|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=978-1-58093-410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroponicum ===
Early architectural proposals that contributge to VF include [[Le Corbusier]]'s Immeubles-Villas (1922) and SITE's Highrise of Homes (1972).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruby|first1=Ilka|last2=Ruby|first2=Andreas|title=Groundscapes: el reencuentro con el suelo en la arquitectura contemporánea|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mglNAAAAYAAJ}}|year=2006|publisher=G.

Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed.&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974" /&gt; The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of [[greenhouse]] and [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] technology. Early [[Hydroponicum|hydroponicums]] integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These [[horticultural building system]]s evolved from greenhouse technology.  The British Interplanetary Society developed a [[hydroponicum]] for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The first Tower Hydroponic Units were developed in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Hydroponics problems|url=http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811024138/http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' ''[[Hydroponics]]: The Bengal System,'' first published in 1951 with data from the then-[[East Pakistan]], today's [[Bangladesh]], and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf|title=link|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf Hydroponics The Bengal System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sholto Douglas 1975"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=obVOSgAACAAJ}}|title=Hydroponics: The Bengal System|last1=Douglas|first1=James Sholto|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195605662|edition=5th|location=New Dehli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Ken Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.

=== Vertical farm ===
[[Dickson Despommier]] is a professor of [[environmental health]] sciences and [[microbiology]]. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste.

Although many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21154137/|title=Could vertical farming be the future?

Despommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of [[Manhattan]] (about 2,000,000 people) using only {{convert|13|acre|ha|order=flip|0}} of [[rooftop gardens]]. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only two percent of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function:

{{quote|Each floor will have its own watering and nutrient monitoring systems. There will be sensors for every single plant that tracks how much and what kinds of nutrients the plant has absorbed. You'll even have systems to monitor plant diseases by employing DNA chip technologies that detect the presence of plant pathogens by simply sampling the air and using snippets from various viral and bacterial infections. It's very easy to do.

Moreover, a gas [[chromatograph]] will tell us when to pick the plant by analyzing which [[Flavonoid|flavenoids]] the produce contains. These flavonoids are what gives the food the flavors you're so fond of, particularly for more aromatic produce like tomatoes and peppers. These are all right-off-the-shelf technologies. The ability to construct a vertical farm exists now. We don't have to make anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Arnie Cooper |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/science_environment/farming-in-high-rises-raises-hopes-1226 |title=Going up?

==Problems==

===Economics===
Opponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Clifton says: |url=http://e4capital.com/2009/08/24/vertical-farming/ |title=Vertical Farming: Too Far Outside the Box? &amp;#124; |publisher=E4capital.com |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic and environmental benefits rest partly on the concept of minimizing [[food miles]], the distance that food travels from farm to consumer.{{original research inline|date=September 2011}} However, a recent analysis suggests that transportation is only a minor contributor to the economic and environmental costs of supplying food to urban populations. The analysis concluded that "food miles are, at best, a marketing fad."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. (July 22, 2009). Local food no green panacea: professor. CBC News http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/07/22/consumer-local-food.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the facility would have to lower costs or charge higher prices to justify remaining in a city.

Similarly, if power needs are met by fossil fuels, the environmental effect may be a net loss;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627?story_id=17647627&amp;fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=Does it really stack up? | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; even building low-carbon capacity to power the farms may not make as much sense as simply leaving traditional farms in place, while burning less coal.

The initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |title=Starting a Commercial Greenhouse Business |publisher=Omafra.gov.on.ca |date=2003-07-28 |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024230113/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |archivedate=2005-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Office [[occupancy cost]]s can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[Dubai]], [[Milan]], [[Zurich]], and [[Sao Paulo]] ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket World in Figures, [[The Economist]], 2011 ed. pg 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy use===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:B11architecture exteriors040.jpg|thumb|A [[greenhouse]] with its lights on at night, contributing to ''[[light pollution]]'']] --&gt;

During the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roach |first=J. |date=June 30, 2009 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090630-farm-towers-locally-grown.html |title=High-Rise Farms: The Future of Food?|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental writer [[George Monbiot]] calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2010/08/16/towering-lunacy/ |title=George Monbiot – Towering Lunacy |publisher=Monbiot.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Economist argued that "even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough" and "the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Economist |date=December 9, 2010 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627 |title=Vertical farming: Does it really stack up?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "The Vertical Farm" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other tower. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/greenhouse/bng01s01.html |title=Crops &amp;#124; Greenhouse &amp;#124; Greenhouse Energy Calculations &amp;#124; Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives &amp;#124; Province of Manitoba |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
Depending on the method of electricity generation used, greenhouse [[produce]] can create more greenhouse gases than field produce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125741/http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to higher energy use per kilogram. Vertical farms require much greater energy per kilogram versus regular greenhouses, mainly through increased lighting. The amount of pollution produced is dependent on how the energy is generated.

Greenhouses commonly supplement [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels to 3–4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Dioxide In Greenhouses|last=Blom|first=T.J.|author2=W.A. Straver |author3=F.J. Ingratta |author4=Shalin Khosla |author5= Wayne Brown |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-077.htm|date=December 2002|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some greenhouses burn fossil fuels purely for this purpose, as other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sources, such as those from furnaces, contain pollutants such as [[sulphur dioxide]] and [[ethylene]] which significantly damage plants.&lt;ref name="Blom"/&gt;  This means a vertical farm requires a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source, most likely from [[combustion]]. Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to leak into the atmosphere.

Greenhouse growers commonly exploit [[photoperiodism]] in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over [[light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=61B_RV3EdIcC|page=163}}|title=Light pollution handbook – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10|isbn=978-1-4020-2665-2|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. The most common method of spreading the effluent over neighbouring farmland or [[wetlands]] would be more difficult for an urban vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/greenhouse/nursery/environ/wmrecyc.html |title=Treating and Recycling Irrigation Runoff |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, Vertical Harvest was raising funds for an urban, small-scale vertical farm in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/vertical-harvest-of-jackson-hole-will-grow-organic-produce-even-in-the-winter/|title=Vertical Harvest of Jackson Hole Will Grow Organic Produce Even in the Winter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Many of VF's potential benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or [[aeroponic]] growing methods.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I |publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091951/http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |archivedate= 2009-07-01 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Nicholas|last2=Stuhlmacher|first2=Michelle|last3=Miles|first3=Albie|last4=Uludere Aragon|first4=Nazli|last5=Wagner|first5=Melissa|last6=Georgescu|first6=Matei|last7=Herwig|first7=Chris|last8=Gong|first8=Peng|date=2018-01-01|title=A Global Geospatial Ecosystem Services Estimate of Urban Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000536/abstract|journal=Earth's Future|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=40–60|doi=10.1002/2017ef000536|issn=2328-4277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for the future===
It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite web|website=The Vertical Farm Project |year=2009 |title=Agriculture for the 21st Century and Beyond |url=http://www.verticalfarm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland.&lt;ref name=vf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K.

L. |date= October 2011|title=High rise food |journal=The Horticulturalist |pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased crop production===
Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I|publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/?page_id=36 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Vertical Farm Video |publisher= Discovery Channel |date= 2009-04-23 |url= http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510091346/http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |archive-date= 2009-05-10 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs. Globally some 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

Despommier suggests that once dwarf versions of crops (e.g. [[dwarf wheat]] which is smaller in size but richer in nutrients&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web| title = Dwarf Wheat grown aboard the International Space Station | publisher = NASA| date = 9 February 2003| url = http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=2889| accessdate = 17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), year-round crops and "stacker" plant holders are accounted for, a 30-story building with a base of a building block ({{convert|5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}) would yield a yearly crop analogous to that of {{convert|2400|acre|ha|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of traditional farming.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

===Weather disruption===
Crops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather, and suffer from undesirable temperatures rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornadoe, flooding, wildfires and drought.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; "Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Big Food vs. Big Insurance|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2009-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VF productivity is mostly independent of weather, although earthquakes and tornadoes still pose threats.

=== Conservation ===
Up to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of VF could return to its natural state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/opinion/24Despommier.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Farm on Every Floor|last=Despommier|first=Dickson D.|date=2009-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainweb.org/pdf/11/ch_vertical_farming.pdf Vertical take off], ''Fresh Produce Journal'', 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; due to VR's increased productivity.

Vertical farming would thus reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Despommier| first = Dickson| authorlink = Dickson Despommier| title = The Rise of Vertical Farms| journal = Scientific American| volume = 301| issue = 5| pages = 60–67| publisher = Scientific American Inc.| location = New york| date = November 2009| url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-rise-of-vertical-farms| issn = 0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation and [[desertification]] caused by agricultural encroachment on natural [[biome]]s could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil and reducing emissions.

===Resource scarcity===
The scarcity of fertilizer components like phosphorus&lt;ref name="phosphorus"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100311092124.htm Expertanswer. "Scarcity of phosphorus threat to global food production". ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 17 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; poses a threat to industrial agriculture. The closed-cycle design of vertical farm systems minimizes the loss of nutrients, while traditional field agriculture loses nutrients to runoff and leeching.&lt;ref name="runoff"&gt;[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR009i003p00658 Timmons, D. R., et al. “Nitrogen and Phosphorus Losses in Surface Runoff from Agricultural Land as Influenced by Placement of Broadcast Fertilizer.” Water Resources Research , June 1973, doi:https://doi.org/10.1029/WR009i003p00658.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass extinction===
Withdrawing human activity from large areas of the Earth's land surface may be necessary to address [[Holocene extinction event|anthropogenic mass extinction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

Traditional agriculture disrupts wild populations and may be [[Ethics of eating meat#Argument that plant consumption also kills animals|unethical]] given a viable alternative. One study showed that [[wood mouse]] populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming.&lt;ref name="sldavis"&gt;{{cite conference

===Human health===
Traditional farming is a hazardous occupation that often affects the health of farmers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[schistosomes]], exposure to toxic pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with wildlife such as venomous snakes, and injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. VF reduces some of these risks.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; The modern industrial food system makes unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These habits lead to health problems such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. 

===Poverty and culture===
Food security is one of the primary factors leading to absolute poverty.  Constructing farms will allow continued growth of culturally significant food items without sacrificing sustainability or basic needs, which can be significant to the recovery of a society from poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-265-food-and-culture-spring-2011/|title=Food and Culture Spring 2011 course|work=ocw.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban growth===
Vertical farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining substantially self-sufficient in food. This would allow large urban centers to grow without food constraints.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt;

===Energy sustainability===
Vertical farms could exploit [[methane digesters]] to generate energy.  Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into [[biogas]] that is generally composed of 65% methane along with other gases. This biogas could then be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Case Study&amp;nbsp;— Landfill Power Generation, H.

==Technologies and devices==
Vertical farming relies on the use of various physical methods to become effective. Combining these technologies and devices in an integrated whole is necessary to make Vertical Farming a reality. Various methods are proposed and under research. The most common technologies suggested are:

In 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a physical base to conduct research into sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/files/Dublin2010/papers/Frediani-Kevin.pdf|title=Vertical plant production as a public exhibit at Paignton Zoo|publisher= Proceedings of the 4th World Botanic Garden Congress, Botanic Gardens Conservation International|date= June 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[Green Zionist Alliance]] proposed a resolution at the 36th World Zionist Congress calling on Keren Kayemet L'Yisrael ([[Jewish National Fund]] in Israel) to develop vertical farms in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=  Green Zionist Alliance (GZA) – Bold Resolutions for 36th World Zionist Congress |url= http://www.greenprophet.com/2010/06/green-zionist-alliance-gza-resolutions/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the world's first commercial vertical farm was opened in Singapore, developed by Sky Greens Farms, and is three stories high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1233261/1/.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027232546/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1233261/1/.html |archivedate=2012-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5954847/worlds-first-commercial-vertical-farm-opens-in-singapore |title=World's first commercial vertical farm opens in Singapore |publisher=Io9.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They currently have over 100 nine meter-tall towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/12/09/business/eco-singapore-vertical-farm |title=Urban farming looking up in Singapore – CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Association for Vertical Farming]] (AVF) was founded in Munich (Germany). By May 2015 the AVF had expanded with regional chapters all over Europe, Asia, USA, Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agritecture.com/post/92942014432/vertical-farming-infoday-munich-what-is-the-avf4 |title= vertical farming infoday munich - agritecture.com | accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This organization unites growers and inventors to improve food security and sustainable development. AVF focuses on advancing vertical farming technologies, designs and businesses by hosting international info-days, workshops and summits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agritecture.com/post/87002187837/spring2014 |title= Vertical Farming technologies trends - agritecture.com | accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wheat Research Centre''' is an autonomous national research institute that researches the production and cultivation of wheat in Bangladesh and is located in Nashipur, [[Dinajpur]], [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="wrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Islam|first1=Md Shahidul|title=Wheat Research Centre|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Wheat_Research_Centre|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|accessdate=30 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fear of Fatal Fungal Disease: Wheat cultivation withheld in 8 dists|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/fear-fatal-fungal-disease-wheat-cultivation-withheld-8-dists-1309711|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=5 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Naresh Chandra Dev Barma is the head of the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global efforts to fight wheat blast|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/global-efforts-fight-wheat-blast-1454227|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=26 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wheat Research Centre traces its origins to the Accelerated Wheat Research Programme for Bangladesh which was founded in 1971 and ended in June 1975. It was revived as the Expanded Wheat Research Programme. Wheat Research Centre was established on July 1980 under the [[Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute]]. It is one of six research centres under the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute. It has released wheats developed by [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]]. From 1975 to 1985 wheat varieties released by the centre contributed to a 30 to 40 percent growth in wheat output in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="wrc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The centre is responsible for preventing wheat blast damage to corps and supporting farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Wheat blast' threatens yield|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/wheat-blast-threatens-yield-784372|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=1 March 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wheat blast affects 15,500 hectares of land in 5 dists|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/country/wheat-blast-affects-15500-hectares-land-5-dists-1208944|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=The Daily Star|date=14 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
