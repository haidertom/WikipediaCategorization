'''Acrodynia''' is a condition of [[Pain and nociception|pain]] and dusky pink discoloration in the hands and feet most often seen in children chronically exposed to [[heavy metals]], especially  [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].

The word ''acrodynia'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]], where ακρος means ''end'' or ''[[wiktionary:extremity|extremity]]'' and οδυνη means pain. As such, it might be (erroneously) used to indicate that a patient has pain in the hands or feet. However, acrodynia is a disease rather than a symptom.&lt;ref name=siblings&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horowitz Y, Greenberg D, Ling G, Lifshitz M | year = 2002 | title = Acrodynia: a case report of two siblings | url = | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 86 | issue = 6| page = 453 | doi = 10.1136/adc.86.6.453 | pmid = 12023189 | pmc=1762992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition is known by a large number of other names including '''pink disease''', '''hydrargyria''', '''mercurialism''', '''erythredema''', '''erythredema polyneuropathy''', '''Bilderbeck's''', '''Selter's''', '''Swift's''' and '''Swift-Feer disease'''.

==Symptoms==
Besides [[peripheral neuropathy]] (presenting as [[paresthesia]] or [[itching]], burning or [[Pain and nociception|pain]]) and discoloration, swelling ([[edema]]) and [[desquamation]] may occur.

Since mercury blocks the degradation pathway of [[catecholamines]], [[epinephrine]] excess causes profuse sweating ([[Diaphoresis|diaphora]]), [[tachycardia]], [[salivation]] and [[hypertension|elevated blood pressure]]. Mercury is suggested to inactivate [[S-adenosyl-methionine]], which is necessary for catecholamine [[catabolism]] by [[catechol-o-methyl transferase]].

Affected children may show red [[cheeks]] and [[nose]], red ([[erythema]]tous) [[lips]], loss of [[hair]], [[teeth]], and [[nail (anatomy)|nails]], transient rashes, [[hypotonia]] and [[photophobia]]. Other symptoms may include [[kidney]] dysfunction (e.g. [[Fanconi syndrome]]) or neuropsychiatric symptoms (emotional lability, [[memory]] impairment, [[insomnia]]).

Thus, the clinical presentation may resemble [[pheochromocytoma]] or [[Kawasaki disease]].

There is some evidence that the same mercury poisoning may predispose to [[Young's syndrome]] (men with [[bronchiectasis]] and [[low sperm count]]).&lt;ref name=hendry&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hendry WF, ((A'Hern FPA)), Cole PJ | year = 1993 | title = Was Young's syndrome caused by mercury exposure in childhood? | url = | journal = [[BMJ]] | volume = 307 | issue = 6919| pages = 1579–82 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.307.6919.1579 | pmid = 8292944 | pmc=1697782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Mercury compounds like [[calomel]] were historically used for various medical purposes: as [[laxative]]s, [[diuretics]], [[antiseptics]] or [[Antimicrobial|antimicrobial drugs]] for [[syphilis]], [[typhus]] and [[yellow fever]]&lt;ref name=beck&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beck C, Krafchik B, Traubici J, Jacobson S | year = 2004 | title = Mercury intoxication: it still exists | url = | journal = Pediatr Dermatol | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 254–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.0736-8046.2004.21314.x | pmid = 15165207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Teething powders were a widespread source of [[mercury poisoning]] until the recognition of mercury [[toxicity]] in the 1940s.

However, mercury poisoning and acrodynia still exist today.&lt;ref name=weinstein&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weinstein M, Bernstein S | year = 2003 | title = Pink ladies: mercury poisoning in twin girls | journal = CMAJ | volume = 168 | issue = 2| page = 201 | pmid = 12538551 | pmc=140434}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sources of mercury intoxication include broken [[thermometers]].&lt;ref name=torres&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Torres AD, Rai AN, Hardiek ML|title=Mercury intoxication and arterial hypertension: report of two patients and review of the literature|journal=Pediatrics|date=2000|volume=105|issue=3|pages=E34|pmid=10699136|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/105/3/e34.long|doi=10.1542/peds.105.3.e34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Removal of the inciting agent is the goal of treatment. Correcting fluid and electrolyte losses and rectifying any nutritional imbalances (vitamin-rich diets, vitamin-B complex) are of utmost importance in the treatment of the disease.

The chelating agent meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid has been shown to be the preferred treatment modality. It can almost completely prevent methylmercury uptake by erythrocytes and hepatocytes.

In the past, dimercaprol (British antilewisite; 2,3-dimer-capto-l-propanol) and D-penicillamine were the most popular treatment modalities. Disodium edetate (Versene) was also used. Neither disodium edetate nor British antilewisite has proven reliable. British antilewisite has now been shown to increase CNS levels and exacerbate toxicity. N -acetyl-penicillamine has been successfully given to patients with mercury-induced neuropathies and chronic toxicity, although it is not approved for such uses. It has a less favorable adverse effect profile than meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. [13]

Hemodialysis with and without the addition of L-cysteine as a chelating agent has been used in some patients experiencing acute renal failure from mercury toxicity.

Peritoneal dialysis and plasma exchange also may be of benefit.

Tolazoline (Priscoline) has been shown to offer symptomatic relief from sympathetic overactivity.

Antibiotics are necessary when massive hyperhidrosis, which may rapidly lead to miliaria rubra, is present. This can easily progress to bacterial secondary infection with a tendency for ulcerating pyoderma.

==Therapy==
The [[standard of care]] is discontinuation of the environmental exposure, and [[chelation]] therapy done safely with the Andrew Cutler Protocol, DMPS/DMSA and ALA taken orally in small doses according to their half-lives over a 72 hour period, followed by a three day break.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">An '''adventive species''' is a species that has arrived in a new locality. It may have had help from humans as an [[introduced species]] or it may not.

The term is now used by some writers in a more restricted sense than its initial usage. The earliest and most widespread concept among biologists is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region (without further caveats). This is the forerunner of the term 'non-indigenous species', although it lacks the frequently invoked basis of the word 'introduced', which means different things to different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Morse A.P. 1916. "[http://psyche.entclub.org/pdf/23/23-178.pdf A New England orthopteran adventive]". ''Psyche'' 23: 178-179. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Townes H.K. 1947. "[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/16163/PHES13_105-106.pdf?sequence=1 A ''Eumenes'' wasp and six adventive Ichneumonidae new to Hawaii (Hymenoptera)]". ''Proceedings of the Hawaiian Entomological Society'' 13: 105-105 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton C.E. 1964. "[http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pi/pdf/6(4)-689.pdf Highlights in the history of entomology in Hawaii 1778-1963]". ''Pacific Insects'' 6: 689-729 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank J.H., McCoy E.D. 1995. "[http://journals.fcla.edu/flaent/article/view/74655/72313 Introduction to insect behavioral ecology: The good, the bad, and the beautiful: Non-indigenous species in Florida. Invasive adventive insects and other organisms in Florida]". ''Florida Entomologist'' 78: 1-15 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the [[cattle egret]] (''Bubulcus ibis''), which arrived in North America by natural range expansion, the [[black rat]] (''Rattus rattus''), which is believed to have arrived as a hitchhiker aboard ships, and the [[kudzu]] vine (''Pueraria lobata''), which was introduced deliberately by humans, are all adventive species and have established populations. Common adventive species include herbivorous insects.&lt;ref&gt;Martin N.A., Paynter Q. 2013. Predicting risk from adventive herbivores to New Zealand indigenous plants. ''New Zealand Entomologist'': 1-8. DOI:10.1080/00779962.2012.759308&lt;/ref&gt;

The later and more limited concept is that of a species that has arrived in a specific geographic area from a different region, but its population is not self-sustaining. Population numbers are only increased through re-introduction. After some time, an adventive species may become [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]]; or, some populations do not sustain themselves reproductively, but exist because of continued influx from elsewhere. Such a non-sustaining population, or the individuals within it, are said to be adventive.&lt;ref name="WHS1999"&gt;Warren L. Wagner, Derral R. Herbst, and Sy H. Sohmer. ''Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii'', Revised Edition, 1999. Bishop Museum Press: Honolulu&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plant cultivation|Cultivated]] plants are a major source of adventive populations. It is estimated that 10-20% of adventive species used in [[biological control]] programs eventually become naturalized.&lt;ref&gt;Stiling, P. 1993. Why do natural enemies fail in classical Biological Control Programs? ''American Entomologist''. 39:31-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

We can readily see how this second (later) concept applies to cultivated plants. Those that grow within the confines of culture are ‘adventive’; those that grow outside those confines are ‘naturalized’. But the concept falls apart when applied to the far more numerous species of invertebrate animals and microorganisms: extremely few of these are cultured, and by the time they are detected in nature they tend to be established (‘naturalized’).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14310">[[Image:Jesus-Noah.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Noah]] and the "baptismal flood" of the Old Testament (top panel) is "typologically linked" with (it prefigures) the baptism of Jesus in the New Testament (bottom panel).]]
'''Allegory in the Middle Ages''' was a vital element in the synthesis of biblical and [[classical tradition]]s into what would become recognizable as medieval culture. People of the [[Middle Ages]] consciously drew from the cultural legacies of the ancient world in shaping their institutions and ideas, and so [[allegory]] in [[medieval literature]] and [[medieval art]] was a prime mover for the synthesis and transformational continuity between the ancient world and the "new" Christian world.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

People of the Middle Ages did not see the same break between themselves and their classical predecessors that modern observers see; rather, they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world, using [[allegory]] as a synthesizing agent that brings together a whole image.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

==Four types of interpretation or ''allēgoria''==

For most medieval thinkers there were four categories of interpretation (or meaning) used in the Middle Ages, which had originated with the Bible commentators of the early Christian era.&lt;ref name=barney&gt;Stephen A. Barney (1989). "Allegory". ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''. vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first is simply the ''[[literal and figurative language|literal]]'' interpretation of the events of the story for historical purposes with no underlying meaning. 
# The second is called ''[[typology (theology)|typological]]'': it connects the events of the [[Old Testament]] with the [[New Testament]]; in particular drawing allegorical connections between the events of Christ's life with the stories of the Old Testament. 
# The third is ''[[moral]]'' (or ''[[tropological]]''), which is how one should act in the present, the "moral of the story". 
# The fourth type of interpretation is ''[[anagogical]]'', dealing with the future events of Christian history, heaven, hell, the last judgment; it deals with prophecies.

Thus the four types of interpretation (or meaning) deal with past events (literal), the connection of past events with the present (typology), present events (moral), and the future (anagogical).&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Dante]] describes interpreting through a "four-fold method" (or "allegory of the theologians") in his [[epistle]] to [[Scaliger|Can Grande della Scala]]. He says the "senses" of his work are not simple, but:

{{cquote|Rather, it may be called "[[polysemy|polysemous]]", that is, of many senses. A first sense derives from the letters themselves, and a second from the things signified by the letters. We call the first sense "literal" sense, the second the "allegorical", or "moral" or "anagogical". To clarify this method of treatment, consider this verse: ''When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people: Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion'' (Psalm 113). Now if we examine the letters alone, the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified; in the allegory, our redemption accomplished through Christ; in the moral sense, the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to the state of grace; in the anagogical sense, the exodus of the holy soul from slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory.. they can all be called allegorical.
}}

=== Old and New Testaments ===

Medieval allegory began as a Christian method for synthesizing the discrepancies between the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; While both testaments were studied and seen as equally divinely inspired by [[God]], the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians—for example the Jewish [[kosher]] laws.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The Old Testament was therefore seen in relation to how it would predict the events of the New Testament, in particular how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life. The events of the Old Testament were seen as part of the story, with the events of Christ's life bringing these stories to a full conclusion. The technical name for seeing the New Testament in the Old is called ''[[typology (theology)|typology]]''.

[[Image:Biblia.pauperum.jpg|250px|thumb|Christ rises from the tomb, alongside Jonah spit onto the beach, a typological allegory.]]

One example of typology is the story of [[Jonah]] and the whale from the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; Medieval allegorical interpretation of this story is that it prefigures Christ's burial, with the stomach of the whale as Christ's tomb. Jonah was eventually freed from the whale after three days, so did Christ rise from his tomb after three days. Thus, whenever one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or literature, it is usually an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ.

Another common typological allegory is with the four major Old testament prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. These four prophets prefigure the four Apostles [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]. There was no end to the number of analogies that commentators could find between stories of the Old Testament and the New.

There also existed a tradition in the Middle Ages of ''[[mythography]]''—the allegorical interpretation of pagan myths.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt; [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' were standard textbooks throughout the Middle Ages, and each had a long tradition of allegorical interpretation. 
:"An illustrative example can be found in [[Siena]] in a painting of Christ on the cross (''Sano di Pietro's Crucifix'', 15th c). At the top of the cross can be seen a bird pecking its own breast, blood pouring forth from the wound and feeding its waiting chicks below. This is the [[pelican]] whose "story" was told by the Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]]. Thus by analogy to a "[[paganism|pagan]]" source,  Christ feeds his own children with his own blood."

Mediaeval philosophers also saw allegory in the natural world, interpreting animals, plants, and even non-living things in books called [[bestiary|bestiaries]] as symbols of Biblical figures and morals.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;  For example, one bestiary compares [[stag]]s with people devoted to the Church, because (according to medieval zoology) they leave their pastures for other (heavenly) pastures, and when they come to broad rivers (sin) they form in line and each rests its head on the haunches of the next (supporting each other by example and good works), speeding across the waters together.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Beasts'', trans. [[T. H. White]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of allegory==

===Late Antiquity===
The early allegorizing trait in the interpretation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] figures prominently in the massive oeuvre of a prominent Hellenized Jew of Alexandria, [[Philo Judaeus]] (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), whose allegorical reading of the [[Septuagint]] synthesized the traditional Jewish narratives with [[Platonism]]. Philo's allegorizing, in which he continued an earlier tradition, had little effect in later Jewish thought, in part because the Jewish culture of Alexandria dispersed by the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman F. Cantor, [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321173.The_Civilization_of_the_Middle_Ages''The Civilization of the Middle Ages''], 1993:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian writers such as [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254) took up the allegorized interpretations and began to read the Old Testament as a series of prefigurations of the New Testament,&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; in a time when rhetorical training was common, when the classics of mythology were still standard teaching texts, when the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods were still visible forms (if not always fully recognized by the more learned populace), and when the new religions such as Christianity adopted or rejected pagan elements by way of ''allegoresis'' (the study and interpretation of allegory).

[[Prudentius]] wrote the first surviving Christian purely allegorical freestanding work, ''[[Psychomachia]]'' ("Soul-War"), about AD 400.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The plot consists of the personified "good" virtues of Hope, Sobriety, Chastity, Humility, etc. fighting the personified "evil" vices of Pride, Wrath, Paganism, Avarice, etc. The [[personification]]s are women, because in Latin words for abstract concepts have feminine grammatical gender; an uninformed reader of the work might take the story literally as a tale of many angry women fighting one another, because Prudentius provides no context or explanation of the allegory.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;William R. Cook and Ronald B. Herzman (2001). ''Discovering the Middle Ages''. [[The Teaching Company]]. {{ISBN|1-56585-701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this same period of the early 5th century three other authors of importance to the history of allegory emerged: [[Claudian]], [[Macrobius]] and [[Martianus Capella]]. Little is known of these authors, even if they were "truly" Christian or not, but we do know they handed down the inclination to express learned material in allegorical form, mainly through personification, which later became a standard part of medieval schooling methods.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

Claudian's first work ''In Rufinum'' attacked the ruthless [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]] and would become a model for the 12th century ''[[Alanus de Insulis Anticlaudianus|Anticlaudianus]]'', a well known allegory for how to be an upstanding man. As well his ''Rape of Prosperpine'' served up a litany of mythological allegories, personifications, and [[cosmological allegory|cosmological allegories]].&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Neoplatonist]] commentators&lt;ref name=calian/&gt; used allegory as a [[rhetorical]], philosophical and religious devise in reading Ancient mythology, [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=lamberton&gt;Robert Lamberton (1989). ''Homer the Theologian: Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition'' (London: University of California Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]].&lt;ref name=calian&gt;Florin Calian (2013).[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256848245_Clarifications_of_Obscurity_Conditions_for_Proclus's_Allegorical_Reading_of_Plato's_Parmenides ''“Clarifications” of Obscurity: Conditions for Proclus’s Allegorical Reading of Plato’s Parmenides''] Obscurity in Medieval Texts (Krems: Institut für Realienkunde des Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit)&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrobius wrote ''Commentary of the Dream of Scipio'', providing the Middle Ages with the tradition of a favorite topic, the allegorical treatment of dreams.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

Lastly Martianus Capella wrote ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("Marriage of Philology and Mercury"), the title referring to the allegorical union of intelligent learning with the love of letters. It contained short treatises on the "[[seven liberal arts]]" (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music) and thus became a standard textbook, greatly influencing educators and students throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], perhaps the most influential author of [[Late Antiquity]], first introduced readers of his work ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' to the personified Lady Philosophy, the source of innumerable later personified figures (such as Lady Luck, [[Fortuna|Lady Fortune]], etc.)&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

===Early Middle Ages===
After Boethius there exists no known work of allegorical literature until the 12th century. Although allegorical thinking, elements and artwork abound during this period, it was not until the rise of the medieval university in the High Middle Ages that sustained allegorical literature appears again.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
The earliest works were by [[Hugh of St Victor]] (''[[Didascalicon]]'', 1125{{cn|date=February 2018}}), [[Bernard Silvestris]] (''[[Cosmographia (Bernard Silvestris)|Cosmographia]]'', 1147), and [[Alanus ab Insulis]] (''Plaint of Nature'', 1170, and ''Anticlaudianus'') who pioneered the use of allegory (mainly personification) for abstract speculation on metaphysics and scientific questions.

The High and Late Middle Ages saw many allegorical works and techniques. There were four great works from this period.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;
*'''The Four Great Medieval Allegories'''
**''[[Le Roman de la Rose]]''. A major allegorical work, it had many lasting influences on western literature, creating entire new genres and development of vernacular languages.
**''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Ranked amongst the greatest medieval works, both allegorically and as a work of literature; was (and remains) hugely popular.
**''[[Piers Plowman]]''. An encyclopedic array of allegorical devices. Dream-vision; pilgrimage; personification; satire; typological story structure (the dreamer's progress mirrors the progress of biblical history from the Fall of Adam to Apocalypse).
**''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]''. A plot based on an [[anagogical]] allegory; a dreamer is introduced to heavenly Jerusalem. Focus on the meaning of death. A religious response to ''Consolation of Philosophy''.

'''Alma Marie Sullivan Reed''' (1889–1966) was a US journalist.  While working in [[Mexico]] in the 1920s, she fell in love with the governor of Yucatán, [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto]]; however, he was assassinated while she was home in San Francisco preparing for their wedding. Reed was a promoter of the career of [[Mexican muralism|Mexican muralist]] [[José Clemente Orozco]]&lt;ref&gt;Helen Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican: Cultural Relations between the United States and Mexico, 1920-1935''. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 1992, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote a biography of him&lt;ref&gt;Alma M. Reed ''Orozco''. New York: Oxford University Press 1956&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a work on Mexican muralists generally.&lt;ref&gt;Alma M. Reed, ''The Mexican Muralists''. New York: Crown 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

A San Francisco native, Reed was born Alma Sullivan into an Irish Catholic family in 1889. Her marriage to businessman Samuel Payne Reed ended in annulment after he became ill. Outspoken, adventurous and bohemian, she carried what one observer described as the "mystic ailments that sometimes befall the people" of California.

==Journalism career==

She rose to fame as a journalist while writing for the ''San Francisco Call''. An advocate for the disenfranchised, she was responsible for helping change the state's death penalty laws after she wrote a series of articles in 1921 about the death sentence given to a 17-year-old Mexican boy convicted of murder. Her articles led to the state commuting his sentence.
Her writing won her an invitation by Mexican President [[Alvaro Obregón]] to be his guest in Mexico City. While traveling through the Yucatán, she wrote another series of articles on the thefts of Mayan artifacts for the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|Peabody Museum]] at [[Harvard University]] by US explorer and archaeologist Edward Thompson. The articles led the museum to return some of the objects to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Patron==

The ''New York Times'' took notice of the young journalist and hired her to continue reporting from Mexico and later the Middle East. By 1928, she settled in New York City and dubbed her apartment "the Ashram" to honor the Hindu hermitage where sages lived in peace among nature and to pay homage to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s pacifism. Reed was a lifelong supporter and patron of [[José Clemente Orozco]]. Early after establishing the studio, Reed was introduced to Orozco by [[Anita Brenner]].&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Orozco had been living in Manhattan and doing poorly in making a living. She immediately fell in love with his work and gave him a one-man show in September 1928. The financial arrangements with Reed were fraught, with Orozco believing that Reed "was not giving him an adequate share of the proceeds from the sale of his works."&lt;ref&gt;Delpar, ''The Enormous Vogue'', p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; She nonetheless continued to support his career.

Her studio became a gathering place for Mexican artists especially those living in New York. She became friends with Jose L. Gutierrez who was a WPA fresco supervisor and was experimenting at [[Sherwin-Williams]] laboratories with plastic resins, which led to plastic paint formulas developed in 1953 as the first acrylic artist paint called "[[Politec]]."

Not long after the exhibition, she rented a portion of the top floor of the building on East 57th Street and established a formal gallery called "Delphic Studios". She promoted many Mexican artists but she remained the principal patron for Orozco. She also exhibited the Mexican-themed watercolors and oils of Los Angeles artist [[Leo Politi]] in 1937. The one-man exhibit helped launch Politi's career as an author and illustrator of children's books.

An '''anal vibrator''' is a [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] designed for [[sexual stimulation]] of the [[anus]] of both men and women. All anal vibrators have one common feature: they produce a vibrating effect in the [[rectum]] for pleasurable sensations.

Anal vibrators differ from other types of vibrators in that they have a flared base to prevent possible loss in the rectum. The average size of an anal vibrator is smaller than vibrators intended for vaginal penetration and may vary from 4-6&amp;nbsp;inches long and about 1&amp;nbsp;inch wide. As well as other vibrators designed for external and internal stimulation, anal vibrators are usually battery operated: the batteries may be inside the unit or connected by wire to a power pack.

Unlike anal [[dildo]]s, such as butt plugs, anal probes and anal beads, vibrating anal toys may produce various stimulating effects: rotating, vibrating or pulsating, and can have different speed or vibration levels to regulate and adjust the vibrator to various sensations.

==Types of anal vibrators==
* '''Vibrating [[anal probing|anal probes]]'''
Anal probes, with vibrating effect are smaller than usual butt plugs–about the size of a finger, which make them a very helpful anal toy for beginners. Anal probe vibrators may be narrower because their main function is to slide and vibrate.
* '''Vibrating [[butt plug]]s'''
Vibrating butt plugs are made to stay inside the anus to create fullness and vibrating stimulation at the same time. Their advantage is that they can be simply left in for anal stimulation during solo or partners' sex to receive multiple enhancements.
* '''Vibrating [[anal beads]] and balls'''
Vibrating beads and balls are a number of small beads or balls joined together through a long retrievable cord to a power control. They may not only be inserted and pulled out but also vibrate at different speeds.

The '''Archbold Biological Station''' (ABS) is a research institute with a surrounding {{convert|5192.63|acre|km2|0|sing=on}} estate near [[Lake Placid, Florida]], [[United States|USA]].  It includes an extensive area of [[Florida scrub]], a scientifically interesting and highly threatened [[ecosystem]].  It was established in 1941 by [[Richard Archbold]] when his sponsorship of zoological research in [[New Guinea]] was curtailed by the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in the Pacific region.  The Station supports 19 federally listed threatened species, including the Sand Skink (''[[Neoseps|Neoseps reynoldsi]]'') and 13 endemic plant species.  It is a venue for field research and education.

The station and grounds are open to visitors, who must register at the main office.  There are some displays about the property and its history, a video about the biodiversity and conservation of the [[Lake Wales Ridge]], a 1/2 mile nature trail and picnic tables.  Nature and environmental education programs are offered for schools, adults and specialty groups.

On July 20, 2007, it was added to the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name=nrhplist/&gt;

Archbold acquired the initial land for the biological research station through his friend [[Donald Roebling]] from his father, [[John A. Roebling II]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohrer, Fred E. [http://www.archbold-station.org/documents/publicationspdf/JARoebling2-biography.pdf "John A. Roebling, II (1867-1952), Builder of the Red Hill Estate (1929-1941), Lake Placid, Florida"], [[Archbold Biological Station]], October 2, 2006, last updated July 17, 2017. Accessed October 24, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, additional land was purchased.

==Climate==
The climate of Archbold Biological Station is classified as [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), with hot, humid summers and warm, dry winters. Due to its location on the well-drained sandy soil of the [[Lake Wales Ridge]], the station experiences unusually low minimum temps, especially during summer. On clear nights, the dry soil of the [[Florida scrub|scrub]] allows for quicker radiational cooling than surrounding lowland areas. The record high and record low are {{convert|103|°F|0}} and {{convert|13|°F|0}}, recorded on July 4, 1998 and January 5, 2001, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71005">[[File:Codes Vaticanus 354.JPG|thumb|right|200px|'''[[Codex Vaticanus 354]]''' S (028), an uncial codex with a Byzantine text, assigned to the Family K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The '''Byzantine text-type''' (also called '''Majority Text''', '''Traditional Text''', '''Ecclesiastical Text''', '''Constantinopolitan Text''', '''Antiocheian Text''', or '''Syrian Text''') is one of several [[Textual criticism#New Testament|text-types]] used in [[textual criticism]] to describe the textual character of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[New Testament]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]]. It is the form found in the largest number of surviving [[manuscript]]s, though not in the oldest. The New Testament text of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], the [[Patriarchal Text]], as well as those utilized in the [[lectionaries]], is based on this text-type. While considerably varying, it also underlies the [[Textus Receptus]] Greek text used for most Reformation-era translations of the New Testament into vernacular languages. Modern translations mainly use [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] editions that conform more often to the [[Alexandrian text-type]].

The Byzantine text is also found in a few modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] editions, as the Byzantine textual tradition has continued in the Eastern Orthodox Church into the present time. The text used by the Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts. It is commonly accepted as standard Byzantine text.

The Byzantine textform is often marked with the abbreviations &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}&lt;/math&gt; or '''Byz'''.

== Manuscripts of the Byzantine text ==

[[File:Codex alexandrinus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Codex Alexandrinus''', the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the Gospels, close to the Family Π (''Luke 12:54-13:4'')]]

For some time following the fourth century different types of text were current in the East, but at the end the Byzantine text "almost wholly displaced the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort. ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'', 1925. p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine text-type has by far the largest number of surviving manuscripts, many of them written in the newer [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower case) style and in [[Polytonic orthography]] handwriting, which had been invented in the 3rd century BC by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] but which took many centuries to catch on outside scholarly circles. For example, of 522 complete or nearly complete manuscripts of the [[General epistles|General Epistles]] collated by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in [[Münster]], [[Germany]], 372 of them attest the Byzantine reading in at least 90% of 98 test places. Amongst the earliest surviving manuscripts, the position is reversed. There are six manuscripts earlier than the 9th century which conform to the Byzantine text-type; of which the 5th century [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (the oldest), is Byzantine only in the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament being Alexandrian. By comparison, the [[Alexandrian text-type]] is witnessed by nine surviving [[uncials]] earlier than the ninth century (including the Codex Alexandrinus outside the Gospels); and is also usually considered to be demonstrated in three earlier [[papyrus|papyri]]. Modern critical editions of the New Testament tend to conform most often to Alexandrian witnesses — especially [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]].

The earliest [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] to witness to a Byzantine text-type in substantial New Testament quotations is [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 349 — 407); although the fragmentary surviving works of [[Asterius the Sophist]] († 341) have also been considered to conform to the Byzantine text,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Fee, "The Use of Greek Patristic Citations in New Testament Textual Criticism: The State of the Question," pp. 344-359 in ''Studies in the Theory and Method of New Testament Textual Criticism'' (ed. Eldon J. Epp and Gordon D. Fee; Studies &amp; Documents 45; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and the incomplete surviving translation of [[Ulfilas|Wulfila]] (d. 383) into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is often thought to derive from the Byzantine text type or an intermediary between the Byzantine and Western text types.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William, 1980, ''An Introduction to the Gothic Language'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysostom and Asterius used text only in 75% agreed with the standard Byzantine text. The second earliest translation to witness to a Greek base conforming generally to the Byzantine text in the Gospels is the Syriac [[Peshitta]] (though it has many Alexandrian and Western readings);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations |year=1977 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=0-19-826170-5 |pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M. Metzger |last2=Ehrman |first2=Bart D. |authorlink2=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=978-0-19-516122-9 |pages= 86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in respect of several much contested readings, such as Mark 1:2 and John 1:18, the Peshitta rather supports the Alexandrian witnesses. Dating from the fourth century, and hence possibly earlier than the Peshitta, is the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] version of the Gospels; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the [[Garima Gospels]] and classified by Rochus Zuurmond as "early Byzantine". Zuurmond notes that, especially in the Gospel of John, the form of the early Byzantine text found in the Ethiopic Gospels is quite different from the later Greek Majority Text, and agrees in a number of places with [[Papyrus 66]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Zuurmond |first1=Rochus |last2=Niccum |first2=Curt |title="The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament" in Bart D. Ehrman and Michael W. Holmes eds "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research" 2nd edn|year=2013|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-23604-2|pages= 231–252}}"One would say that the Ethiopian ''Versio Antiqua'' is basically a Byzantine text, with some Western elements and some remnants of the early Egyptian text.  For lack of a better term one could coin this "early Byzantine".&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the Byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole, and sometimes differs from a Byzantine sub-group of manuscripts that proliferated after the 11th century. Amongst the bulk of later manuscripts however, it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear Byzantine majority reading for each variant; and a Greek New Testament text based on these majority readings — "The Majority Text" — has been produced by [[Zane C. Hodges]] and Arthur L. Farstad, although this text does not correspond to any one particular manuscript.

== Characteristics of the Byzantine text ==
{{see also|List of major textual variants in the New Testament}}

Compared to [[Alexandrian text-type]] manuscripts, the distinct Byzantine readings tend to show a greater tendency toward smooth and well-formed Greek, they display fewer instances of textual variation between parallel [[Synoptic Gospel]] passages, and they are less likely to present contradictory or "[[Lectio difficilior potior|difficult]]" issues of [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Syrian text has all the appearance of being a careful attempt to supersede the chaos of rival texts by a judicious selection from them all." [[Brooke Foss Westcott]], [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]. ''The New Testament In The Original Greek'', 1925. p. 551&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 1:2 reads "As it is written in the prophets..." in the Byzantine text; whereas the same verse reads, "As it is written in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] the prophet..." in all other early textual witnesses. Since the quotation introduced is partly from [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], the Byzantine form of the verse avoids the difficulty that might be adduced were it to be concluded that Mark was presenting a factual inaccuracy.

Another characteristic is the grammar (e.g., οι δε ειπον; in Alexandrian text: οι δε ειπαν) and the different order of words. For example:

John 6:49

: εν τη ερημω το μαννα – codices [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|B]], [[Codex Ephraemi|C]], [[Codex Bezae|D]], T, [[Codex Washingtonianus|W]], [[Codex Koridethi|Θ]]
: το μαννα εν τη ερημω – codices [[Codex Sinaiticus|ﬡ]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|A]], [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|L]], [[Codex Athous Lavrentis|Ψ]], [[Family 1|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Family 13|''f''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]], mss. of the Byzantine text-type

Mark 1:9

: εις τον Ιορδανην υπο Ιωανου – codices ﬡ, B, D
: υπο Ιωανου εις τον Ιορδανην – codices A, W, and manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type

Also, the Byzantine text does not contain verses included by Textus Receptus: Luke 17:36; Acts 8:37; 15:34.

There are no consistent Byzantine witnesses amongst the early New Testament [[papyri (chronology)|papyri]]. Nevertheless, instances of distinctive Byzantine readings are not unusual in the earliest texts — even though they otherwise conform more to other text-types or none. Hence, many (and possibly most) distinctive Byzantine readings are likely to be early in date. Two broad explanations have been offered for this observation:

* that the Byzantine text-type transmits a text closest to the primary form of the New Testament books; whose early manuscript witnesses have not survived, as this text-type predominated in regions where the climate did not favour the preservation of papyrus;
* that the Byzantine text represents a consistent exercise in textual compilation and correction from around the 4th century, the editors having eclectically selected those readings from a range of early manuscripts, that best conformed to their presupposed standards of the characteristics to be expected in the New Testament text.

=== Special cases ===

In Mark 6:33 and Luke 24:53 the Byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Western text. In other cases the situation is more complicated. Mark 1:13 looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Caesarean text.

== Origin of the Byzantine text ==

In order to displace the [[Textus Receptus]] (see the following section) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the Greek New Testament, later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the Byzantine text which formed its base. This [[Westcott-Hort|Wescott and Hort]]'s Introduction accomplished in masterful detail (over the course of 600 pages) as the culmination of 28 years of laborious effort on their part.

They summarize the problem early on in their work (p.&amp;nbsp;45) as follows:
"A theoretical presumption indeed remains that a majority of extant documents is more likely to represent a majority of ancestral documents at each stage of transmission than vice versa." In the discussion that follows, they reason that the "incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work" in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that "every ground for expecting 'a priori' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westcotthort.com/books/Westcott_Hort_-_Introduction_to_the_New_Testament_in_the_Original_Greek_(2nd_1896).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those modern scholars who believe that the Byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs, there is some debate concerning the origin of the Byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use. The suggestions that have been put forward are:

* That [[Lucian of Antioch]] used his [[Textual criticism|text critical]] skills to produce a [[recension]]. ([[Jerome]] makes reference to Lucian's recension of the Old Testament only. Wescott and Hort favored this theory.)
* That [[Constantine I]] paid for the wide distribution of manuscripts which came from a common source. (There are several references by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to Constantine paying for [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|manuscript production]]).
* That after the [[Western Roman Empire]] stopped using Greek, and because of [[Barbarian]] and [[Muslim]] invasions, eliminating the possibility for either [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] or [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]] to exercise any further influence on the text of the Greek New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

(See also [[State church of the Roman Empire]].)

The standard Byzantine text used by the Eastern, Greek-speaking Greek Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century. However, some are earlier and a few papyri are also classified here. The early Byzantine text is near to the Alexandrian text in that it differs from the late Byzantine text in roughly 3000 places. Kurt Aland did not consider early Byzantine families such as E and Π to be classified as Byzantine manuscripts. He placed some of them into Category III of the Greek New Testament manuscripts. Aland placed all manuscripts with standard Byzantine text into Category V.

== The Textus Receptus ==

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by [[Erasmus]] and published by [[Johann Froben]] of Basel on March 1, 1516 ([[Novum Instrumentum omne]]). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglot]], Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the Byzantine text-type. Six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources, he back-translated from the Latin [[Vulgate]], and Erasmus also introduced many readings from the Vulgate and [[Church Fathers]]. This text came to be known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' or ''received text'' after being thus termed by [[Bonaventura Elzevir]], an enterprising publisher from the Netherlands, in his 1633 edition of Erasmus' text. The New Testament of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible was translated from editions of what was to become the ''Textus Receptus''. The different Byzantine "Majority Text" of Hodges &amp; Farstad  as well as [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] &amp; Pierpont is called "Majority" because it is considered to be the Greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the Greek manuscripts. The Textus Receptus differs from the Majority Text in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent "translatable" differences.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Marlowe states:[http://www.bible-researcher.com/majority.html] ''yet it differs from the Received Text in about a thousand places, most of them being trivial.'' while [[Daniel B. Wallace]] [http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=673] ''has counted 1,838 differences between it and the Textus Receptus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern critical texts ==

[[Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann|Karl Lachmann]] (1850) was the first New Testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the ''Textus Receptus'', relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the [[Alexandrian text-type]]. Although the majority of New Testament textual critics now favor a text that is [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] in complexion, especially after the publication of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]]'s [[Westcott-Hort|edition]], there remain some proponents of the Byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs. These critics include the editors of the Hodges and Farstad text (cited below), and the [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] and Pierpont text. Depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the Alexandrian text-type, then this will differ from the Hodges and Farstad text in around 6,500 readings (Wallace 1989).

To give a feel for the difference between the Byzantine form of text and the [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] text, which is mainly Alexandrian in character, of 800 variation units in the [[Epistle of James]] collected by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]], the Byzantine and Eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places (a rate of 92.3%). Many of the 69 disagreements involve differences in word order and other variants that do not appear as translatable differences in English versions. According to the preface to the [[New King James Version]] of the Bible, the [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Alexandrian text-type]] and the Byzantine text-type are 85% identical (that is, of the variations that occur in any manuscript, only 15% actually differ between these three).

The Byzantine type is also found in modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] editions. A new scholarly edition of the Byzantine Text of John's gospel, (funded by the [[United Bible Societies]] in response to a request from Eastern Orthodox Scholars), was begun in [[Birmingham]], UK. and in 2007, as a result of these efforts, ''The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-According-John-Byzantine-Tradition/dp/1598563076|title=The Gospel According to John in The Byzantine Tradition|author=|editor-first1=Roderic L.|editor-last1=Mullen|editor-first2=Simon|editor-last2=Crisp|editor-first3=D. C.|editor-last3=Parker|date=14 July 2008|publisher=Hendrickson Pub|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Soden divided manuscripts of the Byzantine text into five groups:

* K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, hundreds of minuscules, among them codex [[Minuscule 2|2]], [[Minuscule 3|3]], [[Minuscule 8|8]], 14, 45, 47, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 73, 75, 76, 78, etc.
* K&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, no early minuscules, hundreds of minuscules: 18, 35, 55, 66, 83, 128, 141, 147, 155, 167, 170, 189, 201
* K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (subfamily of K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;) — S V Ω 461
* K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (Family E) — [[Codex Basilensis A. N. III. 12|E]] [[Codex Boreelianus|F]] [[Codex Seidelianus I|G]] [[Codex Seidelianus II|H]]
* I&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; (also K&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), now Family Π — (A) K Y Π; this subgroup is the oldest, but only 5% of manuscripts belong to it. Majority of them have text mixed with other Byzantine subfamilies.

Since the discovery of the [[Papyrus 45]], [[Papyrus 46]], and [[Papyrus 66]], proof is available that occasionally the Byzantine text preserves a reading that dates from early witness. Examples:

Other examples of Byzantine readings were found in p&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; in John 1:32; 3:24; 4:14.51; 5:8; 6:10.57; 7:3.39; 8:41.51.55; 9:23; 10:38; 12:36; 14:17. This supports the views of scholars such as Harry Sturz (1984) and [[Maurice A. Robinson|Maurice Robinson]] (2005) that the roots of the Byzantine text may go back to a very early date. (In 1963 Bruce Metzger had argued that early support for Byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text.)&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''Chapters in the History of New Testament Textual Criticism'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids 1963, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have interpreted this as a rehabilitation of Textus Receptus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''Dean Burgon in the Light of Recent Research''; D. A. Waite, ''Defending the King James Bible'', Bible For Today, Collingswood, New Jersey 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively Byzantine. Daniel Wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and Byzantine readings.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wallace, ''The Majority Text Theory: History, Methods, and Critique'', in Studies &amp; Documents 1995, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30766">'''Constructivist epistemology''' is a branch in [[philosophy of science]] maintaining that scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community, who seek to measure and construct models of the natural world. [[Natural science]] therefore consists of mental constructs that aim to explain sensory experience and measurements.

According to constructivists, the world is independent of human minds, but knowledge of the world is always a human and social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Crotty, M. 1998. ''The Foundations of Social Science Research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process'', Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism opposes the philosophy of [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivism]], embracing the belief that a human can come to know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[accuracy]].

According to constructivists there is no single valid methodology in science, but rather a diversity of useful methods.&lt;ref&gt;(Schofield, n.d.) [http://www.ihrcs.ch/?p=92 Critical Theory and Constructivism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222335/http://www.ihrcs.ch/?p=92 |date=2016-03-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term originates from [[Constructivism (psychological school)|psychology]], [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|education]], and [[social constructivism]].  The expression "constructivist epistemology" was first used by [[Jean Piaget]], 1967, with plural form in the famous article from the "Encyclopédie de la Pléiade" ''Logique et connaissance scientifique'' or "Logic and Scientific knowledge", an important text for [[epistemology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} He refers directly to the mathematician [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]] and his ''radical constructivism''.

The terms ''Constructionism'' and ''constructivism'' are often, but should not be, used interchangeably.  Constructionism is an approach to learning that was developed by Papert; the approach was greatly influenced by his work with Piaget, but it is very different. Constructionism involves the creation of a product to show learning.&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation. [http://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=8751190 Award Abstract #8751190, ''Constructionism: A New Opportunity for Elementary Science Education'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], as well as tables, chairs and atoms are [[social construction|socially constructed]]. [[Marx]] was among the first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of the power of ideas to inform the material realities of people's lives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==History==
Constructivism stems from a number of philosophies. For instance, early development can be attributed to the thought of Greek philosophers such as [[Heraclitus]] (''Everything flows, nothing stands still''), [[Protagoras]] (''Man is the measure of all things''). Protagoras is clearly represented by Plato and hence the tradition as a relativist. The Pyrrhonist sceptics have also been so interpreted. (Although this is more contentious.){{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Following the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with the phenomenology and the event, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] gives a decisive contradiction to Cartesians' epistemology that has grown since Descartes despite [[Giambattista Vico]] calling in ''Scienza nuova'' ("New Science") in 1725 that "the norm of the truth is to have made it". The Enlightenment's claim of the universality of [[Reason]] as the only true source of knowledge generated a Romantic reaction involving an emphasis on the separate natures of races, species, sexes and types of human.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

* [[Gaston Bachelard]], who is known for his physics psychoanalysis and the definition of an "epistemologic obstacle" that can disturb a changing of scientific paradigm as the one that occurred between classical mechanics and Einstein's relativism, opens the teleological way with "The meditation on the object takes the form of the project". In the following famous saying, he insists that the ways in which questions are posed determines the trajectory of scientific movement, before summarizing "nothing is given, all is constructed" : "And, irrespective of what one might assume, in the life of a science, problems do not arise by themselves. It is precisely this that marks out a problem as being of the true scientific spirit: all knowledge is in response to a question. If there  were no question, there would be no scientific knowledge. Nothing proceeds from itself. Nothing is given. All is constructed.", Gaston Bachelard (''La formation de l'esprit scientifique'', 1934). While quantum mechanics is starting to grow, Gaston Bachelard makes a call for a new science in ''Le nouvel esprit scientifique'' (The New Scientific Spirit).
* [[Paul Valéry]], French poet (20th century) reminds us of the importance of representations and action: "We have always sought explanations when it was only representations that we could seek to invent", "My hand feels touched as well as it touches; reality says this, and nothing more".
* This link with action, which could be called a "philosophy of action", was well represented by Spanish poet [[Antonio Machado]]: ''Caminante, no hay camino, se hace camino al andar''.
* [[Ludwik Fleck]] establishes scientific constructivism by introducing the notions of ''thought collective'' (''Denkkollektiv''), and ''thought style'' (''Denkstil''), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects can be described in terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because any thought collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by [[Thomas Kuhn]].

* [[Jean Piaget]], after the creation in 1955 of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva, first uses the expression "constructivist epistemologies" (see above). According to [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]], Jean Piaget is "the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing" (in ''An Exposition of Constructivism: Why Some Like it Radical'', 1990) and "the most prolific constructivist in our century" (in ''Aspects of Radical Constructivism'', 1996).
* [[J. L. Austin]] is associated with the view that [[speech]] is not only passively describing a given reality, but it can change the (social) reality to which it is applied through [[speech act]]s.
* [[Herbert A.

==Constructivism and sciences==
===Social constructivism in sociology===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[International relations]] --&gt;
{{Main|Social constructivism}}
One version of ''social constructivism'' contends that categories of knowledge and reality are actively created by social relationships and interactions. These interactions also alter the way in which scientific episteme is organized.

Social activity presupposes human beings inhabiting shared forms of life, and in the case of social construction, utilizing [[semiotic]] resources ([[meaning-making]] and signifying) with reference to social structures and institutions. Several traditions use the term ''Social Constructivism'': [[psychology]] (after [[Lev Vygotsky]]), [[sociology]] (after  [[Peter L. Berger|Peter Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]], themselves influenced by [[Alfred Schütz]]), [[sociology of knowledge]] ([[David Bloor]]), [[sociology]] of [[mathematics]] ([[Sal Restivo]]), [[philosophy of mathematics]] ([[Paul Ernest]]). [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s later philosophy can be seen as a foundation for ''social constructivism'', with its key theoretical concepts of ''language games'' embedded in ''forms of life''.

===Constructivism in philosophy of science===
[[Thomas Kuhn]] argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, "revolutions" in scientific practice and changes in [[Paradigm shift|"paradigms"]].&lt;ref name=Kuhn2&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions |url=http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |author=Thomas S Kuhn |year=1966 |isbn=0226458121 |edition=2nd&lt;!--the 2nd edition is "enlarged" from the 1st, by addition of a postscript--&gt; |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=A paradigm governs, in the first instance, not a subject matter but rather a group of practitioners. Any study ... must begin by locating the responsible group or groups. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328173641/http://turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/kuhn-ssr-2nded.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, Kuhn suggested that the Sun-centric [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican "revolution"]] replaced the Earth-centric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures, but because of a new "paradigm" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.
{{quote|"But paradigm debates are not really about relative problem-solving ability, though for good reasons they are usually couched in those terms. Instead, the issue is which paradigm should in future guide research on problems many of which neither competitor can yet claim to resolve completely. A decision between alternate ways of practicing science is called for, and in the circumstances that decision must be based less on past achievement than on future promise. ... A decision of that kind can only be made on faith."|Thomas Kuhn|''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', pp 157-8}}

The view of reality as accessible only through models was called [[model-dependent realism]] by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]].&lt;ref name=Koonin&gt;
{{cite book |title=The Logic of Chance: The Nature and Origin of Biological Evolution |author=Eugene V. Koonin |publisher=FT Press Science, a division of Pearson Education, Inc |isbn=013262317X |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvmv2kU6PrYC&amp;pg=PA427|page=427}}
&lt;/ref&gt; While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent  realism says that we can know only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models.&lt;ref name=Mlodinow&gt;
{{Cite book |quote=We shall adopt an approach that we call model-dependent realism. It is based on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs by making a model of the world. When such a model is successful at explaining events, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts that constitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may be different ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with each employing different fundamental elements and concepts. If two such ...theories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to be more real than the other; rather we are free to use whichever model is the most convenient. |title=The Grand Design |author=Stephen Hawking, Leonard Mlodinow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoO9jkV-yzIC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0553907077 |page=8 |year=2011 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
These models evolve over time as guided by scientific inspiration and experiment.

In the field of the social sciences, constructivism as an epistemology urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and in the light of this that they become more open to consider other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to "represent" social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001) argues that social researchers can earn trust from participants and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.

===Constructivism and psychology===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
In [[psychology]], constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as [[education]] and [[psychotherapy]]), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the "associationist" postulate of empiricism, "by which the mind is conceived as a passive system that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces a copy of the order of reality."&lt;ref name="Balbi"&gt;{{cite web |last=Balbi |first=Juan |date=2008 |title=Epistemological and theoretical foundations of constructivist cognitive therapies: post-rationalist developments |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=15–27 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |accessdate=2010-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708205138/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A08-01-6.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

In contrast, "constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding".&lt;ref name="Balbi"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

===Constructivism and education===
{{Main|Constructivism (philosophy of education)}}

[[Joe L. Kincheloe]] has published numerous social and educational books on critical constructivism (2001, 2005, 2008), a version of constructivist epistemology that places emphasis on the exaggerated influence of political and cultural power in the construction of knowledge, consciousness, and views of reality. In the contemporary mediated electronic era, Kincheloe argues, dominant modes of power have never exerted such influence on human affairs. Coming from a [[critical pedagogy|critical pedagogical]] perspective, Kincheloe argues that understanding a critical constructivist epistemology is central to becoming an educated person and to the institution of just social change.

Kincheloe's characteristics of critical constructivism:

*Knowledge is socially constructed: World and information co-construct one another
*Consciousness is a social construction
*Political struggles: Power plays an exaggerated role in the production of knowledge and consciousness
*The necessity of understanding consciousness—even though it does not lend itself to traditional reductionistic modes of measurability
*The importance of uniting logic and emotion in the process of knowledge and producing knowledge
*The inseparability of the knower and the known
*The centrality of the perspectives of oppressed peoples—the value of the insights of those who have suffered as the result of existing social arrangements
*The existence of multiple realities: Making sense of a world far more complex that we originally imagined
*Becoming humble knowledge workers: Understanding our location in the tangled web of reality
*Standpoint epistemology: Locating ourselves in the web of reality, we are better equipped to produce our own knowledges
*Constructing practical knowledge for critical social action
*Complexity: Overcoming reductionism
*Knowledge is always entrenched in a larger process
*The centrality of interpretation: Critical hermeneutics
*The new frontier of classroom knowledge: Personal experiences intersecting with pluriversal information
*Constructing new ways of being human: Critical ontology

===Constructivism and postmodernism===
For some{{who?|date=October 2017}} [[social constructionism]] has been described as a source of the [[postmodern movement]], and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to [[social constructionism]].

From a realist's point of view, both [[postmodernism]] and constructivism can be interpreted as [[relativism|relativist]] theories.

==Constructivist trends==

===Cultural constructivism===
Cultural constructivism asserts that knowledge and reality are a product of their cultural context, meaning that two independent cultures will likely form different observational methodologies.

===Radical constructivism===
{{See also|Francisco Varela|Humberto Maturana|Heinz von Foerster}}
[[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] was a prominent proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, it is up to the individual to "link up" specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what "actually" occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but "circularly conjoined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radicalconstructivism.com|title=Radical Constructivism|author=|date=|website=www.radicalconstructivism.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419043612/http://radicalconstructivism.com/|archivedate=19 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Constructivist Foundations]]'' is a free online journal publishing peer reviewed articles on radical constructivism by researchers from multiple domains.

===Relational constructivism===
{{main|Relational constructivism}}
[[Relational constructivism]] can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. ''self referentially operating cognition''). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.

In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. [[Björn Kraus]] puts it in a nutshell:

{{Zitat|„It is substantial for relational constructivism that it basically originates from an epistemological point of view, thus from the subject and its construction processes. Coming from this perspective it then focusses on the (not only social, but also material) relations under which these cognitive construction processes are performed. Consequently, it‘s not only about social construction processes, but about cognitive construction processes performed under certain relational conditions.“&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35, {{cite web |url=http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015044520/http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948 |archivedate=2017-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Critical constructivism===
A series of articles published in the journal ''Critical Inquiry'' (1991) served as a manifesto for the movement of critical constructivism in various disciplines, including the [[natural science]]s.   Not only truth and reality, but also "[[evidence]]", "[[document]]", "[[experience]]", "[[fact]]", "proof", and other central categories of empirical research (in [[physics]], [[biology]], [[statistics]], [[history]], [[law]], etc.) reveal their contingent character as a social and ideological construction. Thus, a "realist" or "rationalist" interpretation is subjected to criticism.  Kincheloe's political and pedagogical notion (above) has emerged as a central articulation of the concept.

While recognizing the constructedness of reality, many representatives of this critical paradigm deny philosophy the task of the creative construction of reality.  They eagerly criticize realistic judgments, but they do not move beyond analytic procedures based on subtle [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].  They thus remain in the critical paradigm and consider it to be a standard of scientific philosophy per se.

===Genetic epistemology===
{{main|Genetic epistemology}}
[[James Mark Baldwin]] invented this expression, which was later popularized by [[Jean Piaget]]. From 1955 to 1980, Piaget was Director of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva.

==Criticisms==
Numerous criticisms have been leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common one is that it either explicitly advocates or implicitly reduces to [[relativism]]. This is because it takes the concept of truth to be a socially "constructed" (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads to the charge of [[Self-refuting idea|self-refutation]]: if what is to be regarded as "true" is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of [[truth]] must itself be only regarded as being "true" in this society. In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.

Another criticism of constructivism is that it holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, it is impossible to make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.

Social Constructivists{{Who|date=July 2009}} often argue that constructivism is liberating because it either (1) enables oppressed groups to reconstruct "the World" in accordance with their own interests rather than according to the interests of dominant groups in society, or (2) compels people to respect the alternative worldviews of oppressed groups because there is no way of judging them to be inferior to dominant worldviews. As the [[Wittgenstein]]ian philosopher [[Gavin Kitching]]&lt;ref&gt;Kitching, G. 2008. ''The Trouble with Theory: The Educational Costs of Postmodernism''. Penn State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues, however, constructivists usually implicitly presuppose a [[deterministic]] view of language which severely constrains the minds and use of words by members of societies: they are not just "constructed" by language on this view, but are literally "determined" by it. Kitching notes the contradiction here: somehow the advocate of constructivism is not similarly constrained. While other individuals are controlled by the dominant concepts of society, the advocate of constructivism can transcend these concepts and see through them.

{{italic title}}
'''''A Complete Concordance to the Holy Scriptures''''', generally known as '''''Cruden's Concordance''''', is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] of the [[King James Bible]] (KJV) that was singlehandedly created by [[Alexander Cruden]] (1699–1770). The ''Concordance'' was first published in 1737 and has not been [[out of print]] since then.
Two editions of the ''Concordance'' appeared during his lifetime, 1761 and 1769.
(Reference 1955 edition)
Cruden's concordance was first published in 1737, one of the first copies being personally presented to [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]] on November 3, 1737. Cruden began work on his concordance in 1735 whilst a bookseller in London. Cruden worked alone from 7am to 1am every day and completed the bulk of the work in less than a year. The proofreading and layout took a little longer. His brain was occupied with nothing else, so much so that he failed to notice the diminishing stock in his bookshop and the consequent lack of custom. "Was there ever, before or since the year 1737", writes his biographer [[Edith Olivier]], "another enthusiast for whom it was no drudgery, but a sustained passion of delight, to creep conscientiously word by word through every chapter of the Bible, and that not once only, but again and again?".&lt;ref&gt;Olivier, Edith. ''Alexander the Corrector: the eccentric life of Alexander Cruden''. Viking Press, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a remarkable feat, the concordance was not entirely without error. [[The Times]] recorded that Cruden left out [[Children of Eber|Buz]] (brother of Huz) and Sneeze (put under Neeze).&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), ''Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks'', Oxford University Press, 1981, at page 16&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the name "Chloe" was missing until a revised edition was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 1:11&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Archaeology''' at the [[University of York]], England, is a [[academic department|department]] which provides undergraduate and postgraduate courses in [[archaeology]] and its sub-disciplines and conducts associated research. It was founded in 1978 and has grown from a small department based at Micklegate House to more than a hundred undergraduate students based at [[King's Manor]] and with scientific facilities at the '''BioArCh''' centre on the main campus.

==Hosted organisations, research specialities and fieldwork==
The archaeology department hosts several specialist organisations:
*[[Archaeology Data Service]] - an open access digital archive for archaeological research outputs
*[[Internet Archaeology]] - a fully peer-reviewed electronic journal for archaeology
*BioArCh - a specialist centre using scientific and molecular techniques for archaeology
*Centre for Digital Heritage - an interdisciplinary centre studying computer-based approaches to heritage. Working with the universities of [[Aarhus University|Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Leiden University|Leiden]] (Netherlands), [[Lund University|Lund]] (Sweden), [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] (Sweden).
*The ''Post Hole'' -  is an archaeology journal run by students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theposthole.org/about |title=The Post Hole |accessdate=11 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department's faculty has led significant archaeological investigations across [[Great Britain]] and occasionally further afield

The department opened in 1978, 15 years after the [[University of York#History|university]] itself. The first head of department, [[Philip Rahtz]] built a thematic undergraduate programme specialising in the [[Britain in the Middle Ages|British Middle Ages]]. The programme included a 12-week field course in [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt; The department expanded under [[Martin Carver]] after his appointment in 1986. A [[postgraduate]] programme was added and the department moved to [[King's Manor]]. Subsequently, the department has grown in numbers of students, staff and the diversity of its specialisms: adding [[environmental archaeology]], [[prehistory]], [[computational archaeology]], [[archaeological science]] and [[cultural heritage management]].&lt;ref name="Dept History" /&gt;

==Social discrimination==

In the [[binary gender]] system, genderqueerness is unintelligible and abjected.&lt;ref name="ftmborderlands"&gt;Hale, J.C. (1998) "...[O]ur embodiments and our subjectivities are abjected from social ontology: we cannot fit ourselves into extant categories without denying, eliding, erasing, or otherwise abjecting personally significant aspects of ourselves ... When we choose to live with and in our dislocatedness, fractured from social ontology, we choose to forgo intelligibility: lost in language and in social life, we become virtually unintelligible, even to ourselves..." from ''Consuming the Living, Dis(Re)Membering the Dead in the Butch/FtM Borderlands'' in the ''Gay and Lesbian Quarterly'' 4:311, 336 (1998). Retrieved on 2007-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals who identify as a gender that does not fit the traditional binary system tend to experience higher levels of social discrimination. A 2012 study from the [[National LGBTQ Task Force|''National LGBTQ Task Force'']] showed that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to suffer physical assaults (32% vs. 25%), experience police harassment (25% vs. 19%), and suffer sexual assaulted (15% vs. 19%) compared to transgender individuals who identified within the gender binary (i.e., [[Trans man|trans men]] and [[Trans woman|trans women]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/e505652011-001|title=APA Policy Statement: Transgender, Gender Identity, &amp; Gender Expression Non-Discrimination|date=2008|website=PsycEXTRA Dataset|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genderqueer individuals also reported higher rates of harassment in K-12 school (83% vs. 77%), and sexual assault in K-12 schools (16% vs. 11%). This study reported that genderqueer and other non-binary individuals were more likely to be [[people of color]] (30% vs. 23%) and younger (under 45) than binary transgender people (89% vs. 68%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Responders who identified as neither male nor female were less likely to be white and more likely to be multi racial, Black, or Asian, but less likely to be [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latin-American/Spanish in origin]] compared to those who identified as male or female. The study showed that despite genderqueer and other non-nonbinary individuals having received significantly higher education than those who identified within the gender binary, they were more likely to be living in extreme poverty (under $10,000 yearly) than those who identified within the gender binary (21% vs. 14%). They were more likely to be involved in underground economies for income (20% vs. 15%) than those who identified within the gender binary. Respondents disclosed brutal effects of discrimination, which had grave impacts, as 43% of genderqueer participants reported attempting suicide compared to 40% of transgender individuals that identified within the gender binary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Discrimination|Social discrimination]] in the context of discrimination against non-binary and gender non-conforming people includes hate-motivated violence and excusing of such. According to a 2016 study from ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]],'' one of the most common themes of discrimination for genderqueer people is [[binarism]]. Also the incorrect use of preferred gender pronouns, which the study labeled ‘nonaffirmation’ occurs when others do not affirm one’s sense of gender identity. Participants within this study also reported experiencing [[gender policing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadal|first=Kevin L.|last2=Whitman|first2=Chassitty N.|last3=Davis|first3=Lindsey S.|last4=Erazo|first4=Tanya|last5=Davidoff|first5=Kristin C.|date=2016-03-11|title=Microaggressions Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Genderqueer People: A Review of the Literature|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F00224499.2016.1142495|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|language=en|volume=53|issue=4-5|pages=488–508|doi=10.1080/00224499.2016.1142495|issn=0022-4499}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article from the book ''Violence and Gender'', states that this experienced violence and discrimination leads to high levels of stress. This article stated that non-binary participants are less likely to experience hate speech (24.4% vs. 50%) compared to trans men and equally as likely (24.4% vs. 24.4%) as trans women, yet genderqueer/nonbinary participants, along with trans women are more likely than trans men individuals to be concerned about the safety of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Veldhuis|first=Cindy B.|last2=Drabble|first2=Laurie|last3=Riggle|first3=Ellen D.B.|last4=Wootton|first4=Angie R.|last5=Hughes|first5=Tonda L.|date=March 2018|title=“I Fear for My Safety, but Want to Show Bravery for Others”: Violence and Discrimination Concerns Among Transgender and Gender-Nonconforming Individuals After the 2016 Presidential Election|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/vio.2017.0032|journal=Violence and Gender|volume=5|issue=1|pages=26–36|doi=10.1089/vio.2017.0032|issn=2326-7836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Workplace discrimination ==
{{globalize/United States|section|date=October 2018}}

=== United States ===
In the United States of America, unemployment rates for transgender people are approximately twice as high as those for cisgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|title=Injustice At Every Turn: A Report Of The National Transgender Discrimination Survey|last=Grant, Jaime M., Mottet, Lisa A., &amp; Tanis, Justin|date=April 26, 2017|website=thetaskforce.org|archive-url=http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_full.pdf|archive-date=April 26, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the National Transgender Discrimination Survey&lt;ref name="ncte-ntds"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Transgender Discrimination Survey|url=http://www.transequality.org/issues/national-transgender-discrimination-survey|website=National Center for Transgender Equality|accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the LGBTQ+ Task Force, it was found that almost all non-binary persons had experienced discrimination in the workplace. Their findings show that being out as a non-binary person negatively affects that person's employment outcomes. Though non-binary persons have higher unemployment rates than those who identify with a specified gender, masculine non-binary persons who still appear male, or are not "passing as female" generally have a harder time in the work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&amp;context=masters_theses_2|title=Gender Inequality: Nonbinary Transgender People in the Workplace|last=Davidson|first=Skylar|date=April 26, 2017|website=umass.edu|archive-url=http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1331&amp;context=masters_theses_2|archive-date=April 26, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2012 study by the Center for American Progress, 42% of gay employees said they have experienced discrimination of some form in the workplace; 50% of participants reported being harassed at work and 47% reported an adverse job outcome. That includes being fired or denied a promotion. In addition, 32% felt forced to act “traditionally gendered” to keep their jobs and 22% were denied access to bathrooms of choice based in gender identity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electra.lmu.edu:2214/science/article/pii/S0001879117300684?#bb2015|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

19% of non-binary trans persons reported job loss due to anti-transgender bias, and 90% reported experiencing anti-transgender bias on the job. 78% of those who had transitioned during their time at the workplace were happy with their choice to do so, and reported feeling more comfortable at work, although they experienced more discrimination.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter" /&gt;{{rp|11}} 

Not only does discrimination against transgender people in the workplace affect transgender employees, but it also affects the entire workplace team, distracting the victim and the perpetrator from the job itself. In 2001 study by the West Lothian Transgender Support Group, it was found that around 50 percent of transgender people do not survive beyond their thirtieth birthday, with most taking their own lives due to discrimination and others losing their lives from violence of cisgender individuals. The study’s statistic is also known as “the 50 percent rule” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/00483480610670625#|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With that being said, transgender individuals in the U.S. often face workplace discrimination like conflicts related to their bathroom usage, backlash over transitioning genders and being “misgendered” by coworkers. The Center of American Progress in 2012 also found that there is also a substantial amount of public ignorance towards transgender communities, in comparison to LGB community peers. Because of that, negative psychological consequences occur as a result like mental health disparities, higher rates in attempted suicide, and paranoid thinking in public spaces &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00918369.2011.534038|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Columbia University’s study in 2003 found that ideas of perceived discrimination are consistent with models of minority stress. It was also found that sexual minorities, such as the transgender community, are vulnerable to physical and mental health difficulties due to an exposure to chronic life stressors. The study finds that the transgender community in the U.S. possesses pre-conceived notions of rejection, hostility and discrimination from gender identities outside their groups &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0141429999&amp;origin=inward&amp;txGid=47bc7b389eee5f9c9f03fbd56fad13c9|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Health discrimination==

===United States===
Transgender &amp; non-binary peoples generally seek greater care because of the stigma and the lack of knowledge about their experience on the behalf of rural physicians. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=J.|last2=Shaver|first2=John|last3=Stephenson|first3=Rob|date=2016-01-05|title=Outness, Stigma, and Primary Health Care Utilization among Rural LGBT Populations|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701471/|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=11|issue=1|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0146139|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4701471|pmid=26731405}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that being said, non-binary individuals, and members of the LGBTQ community are very tentative when sharing their sexual identities to health care providers in fear of receiving inadequate/unfair treatment. In the 2001 Journal of the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association, the study explores factors associated with disclosure. 88 individuals (76% non-binary) gave responses to a questionnaire asking about their most recent interaction with health care, and how their overall experience was. Of this group, more respondents answered that they avoided answering questions about their sexuality (38%) than honestly disclosing it to their health care provider (37%). The respondents who avoided the questions were in agreement that if they gave out their sexual identity, they would be treated differently or poorly. The overall rates of disclosure to health care providers are low because of the perception that health care settings/providers are threatening and unjust. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eliason|first=Michele J.|last2=Schope|first2=Robert|date=2001|title=&lt;Emphasis Type="Bold"&gt;Original Research:&lt;/Emphasis&gt; Does “Don't Ask Don't Tell” Apply to Health Care?

In the 2015 International Journal of Transgenderism, a big portion of non-binary individuals reported to have experienced discrimination from different types of medical services, including: doctors, emergency rooms, and ambulances. From the study, it was discovered that 20.4% of non-binary individuals experienced discrimination when trying to access doctors and hospitals, 11.9% faced discrimination when attempting to access emergency rooms, and 4.6% when attempting to access the service of an ambulance. Based on these statistics, there is a needed change in how health services treat non-binary patients to minimize the discrimination on these individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kattari|first=Shanna K.|last2=Walls|first2=N.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, non-binary individuals also experience health discrimination. Under the law of the United Kingdom, individuals are considered by the state to be either male or female, the gender that is stated on their birth certificate. This means that non-binary gender is not recognized in UK law. In a 2015 survey conducted by the Scottish Trans Alliance, three main areas were focused on including, non-binary individuals' experiences of medical services. When asked if they had ever experienced problems getting the help that was needed because of their non-binary identity, 56% said that they had. Some examples of this discrimination included refusal of surgery, withholding of treatment, discharging from clinics for being "untreatable," and no treatment due to not having protocol for non-binary individuals. In addition, more than half of the respondents answered that they experienced a delay in their treatment after being honest and open about their non-binary gender identities. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scottishtrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Non-binary-GIC-mini-report.pdf|title=Non-binary people’s experiences

===Australia===
Similarly to the UK, a 2013 survey was designed to examine the healthcare experiences of non binary individuals, and all other members of the LGBTQ community. The survey asked participants to rate their mental and physical health, and how their experiences with psychiatrists, general practitioners, and surgeons were. They rated their experience in terms of comfort, discrimination, and information provided. 10 people given the gender male at birth and 78 given female at birth, yet all identifying as gender diverse or non-binary individuals, completed two separate surveys. 70% of the participants accessed a psychiatrist, and on average rated their experience as just below positive. The individuals assigned female at birth rated their experience worse than those assigned male at birth. After this data was recorded, an analysis of the responses suggested that the positive experiences were due to professional, helpful, knowledgeable, and caring practitioners. Negative experiences were due to the amount of ridiculous or offensive questions asked, and for little to no knowledge on their sexual identity. Overall, these findings indicated that medical professionals are falling short of adequately meeting the needs of non binary individuals. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=Damien W|last2=Coleman|first2=Katrina|last3=Due|first3=Clemence|date=2014-03-06|title=Healthcare experiences of gender diverse Australians: a mixed-methods, self-report survey|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3973980/|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=14|pages=230|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-14-230|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3973980|pmid=24597614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 


==Legal discrimination==
{{distinguish|Legal recognition of non-binary gender}}

===United States===

Despite being more likely to achieve higher levels of education when compared to the general public,&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Non-Binary Identities &amp; the Law {{!}} Transgender Law Center|url = http://transgenderlawcenter.org/archives/10208|website = transgenderlawcenter.org|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}} 90% of non-binary individuals face discrimination, often in the form of harassment in the workplace. Nineteen percent of genderqueer individuals report job loss as a result of their identities.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter"/&gt; Anti-discrimination laws that prohibit discrimination specifically against non-binary individuals do not exist.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} However, [[Title VII]] and the current proposed version of the federal [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] use such terms as "gender identity" and "gender expression", categories under which non-binary individuals fall due to the fact that their gender expression cannot be defined as male or female.&lt;ref name="transgenderlawcenter" /&gt;

In 2004, Jimmie Smith was terminated from the fire department in Salem, Ohio after revealing their diagnosis with Gender Identity Disorder and intentions to undergo a male to female transition. The district court determined the reason for termination was because of their "transexuality" and not their gender non-conformity. The case was appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which overturned that decision and clarified to courts that under Title VII, sex discrimination was to be considered broader than only the traditional assumptions of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reineck|first=Katie|date=2017|title=RUNNING FROM THE GENDER POLICE: RECONCEPTUALIZING GENDER TO ENSURE PROTECTION FOR NON-BINARY PEOPLE.|url=|journal=Michigan Journal of Gender &amp; Law|volume=24|pages=265-322|via=OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W.

====Identity documents====

According to the Transgender Law Center, 70% of transgender people are not able to update their identity documents and one-third of have been harassed, assaulted or turned away when seeking basic services,&lt;ref name=osf-2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Gender Identity Recognition at the Border and Beyond |last1=Skeen |first1=Lisa |url=https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/gender-identity-recognition-border-and-beyond |date=April 5, 2017 |website=Open Society Foundations |publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and one third are not able to update their documents post-transition.

In 2016, the U.S. State Department was sued for denying a passport to [[Dana Zzyym]], who is a veteran and an intersex and non-binary person. Zzyym wrote "intersex" on their passport form instead of male or female, which were the only two available gender fields on the form. Zzyym was denied the passport, which led to LGBTQ advocacy organizations filing a lawsuit against the U.S. State Department on Zzyym's behalf. The advocacy group [[Lambda Legal]] argued for gender-neutral terms and a third option on U.S. passports, arguing that the existing passport fields violated the [[Due Process Clause]] and [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution. The State Department argued that adding additional gender fields to the passport form would prevent the agency's efforts to combat identity theft and passport fraud. The Tenth Circuit Court ruled in favor of Zzyym, the first time in U.S. history that the federal government recognized non-binary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/intersex-dana-zzyym-passport-decision/|title=Judge rules in favor of intersex veteran who was denied passport|website=PBS NewsHour|date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, the District of Columbia, New York City, New York State, Iowa, Vermont, Oregon and Washington State have currently removed the surgical requirement to complete a change on a birth certificate. In these states, to change the gender on a birth certificate, one must fill out a standardized form but legal or medical approvals are not required. In Washington D.C., the applicant fills out the top half of the form and a health or social service professional must fill out the bottom half. A person may face obstacles obtaining a court order in order to make a change to documents in other states. Tennessee is the only state that has a specific statute that forbids altering the gender designation on a birth certificate due to gender surgery, while Idaho and Ohio have the same prohibition, but via court decision rather than by statute; and in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, a court ruled that gender markers could not be changed on identity documents under any circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-identity-document-faq|title=FAQ About Identity Documents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lambda-state&gt;{{cite web |title=Changing Birth Certificate Sex Designations: State-By-State Guidelines |author=&lt;!--staff writers, no byline--&gt; |url=https://www.lambdalegal.org/know-your-rights/article/trans-changing-birth-certificate-sex-designations |date=February 3, 2015 |website=Lambda Legal |publisher= |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, the Gender Recognition Act of 2017 was introduced in the State Senate in Sacramento in January 2017, and signed into law by governor [[Jerry Brown]] on October 19.  The law recognizes a third gender option known as "non-binary" which may be used on state-issued documents such as driver's licenses to more accurately reflect a person's gender. Senate bill SB179 was originally drafted by State Senators [[Toni Atkins]] and [[Scott Wiener]].  The law also makes it easier for existing documents to be changed, by removing requirements for sworn statements by physicians and replacing it with a sworn attestation by the person seeking to make the change to their documents.  The Executive Director of Equality California commented, "It is up to an individual—not a judge or even a doctor—to define a person's gender identity."&lt;ref name="Gutierrez-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill seeks 3rd gender option on licenses, birth certificates |last1=Gutierrez |first1=Melody |url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Calif-lawmakers-seek-nonbinary-gender-10886782.php |date=January 26, 2017 |website=SFGate |publisher=[[Hearst Communications|Hearst]] |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowerman-2017"&gt;{{cite web |title=Female, male or non-binary: California legally recognizes a third gender on identification documents |last1=Bowerman |first1=Mary |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/10/19/female-male-non-binary-california-legally-recognizes-third-gender-identification-documents/779188001/ |date=January 26, 2017 |website=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett]] |accessdate=October 26, 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two US citizens to receive a court decreed gender of non-binary were in Oregon and California. In [[Oregon]], [[Jamie Shupe]] was able to declare their sex as non-binary in June 2016 after a brief legal battle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.portlandmercury.com/images/blogimages/2016/06/15/1466024211-shupe_ruling.pdf|title=Case No.: 16CV13991: In The Matter Of The Sex Change Of Jamie Shupe, Petitioner|last=Holmes Hehn|first=Amy|date=2016-06-10|work=Portland Mercury|access-date=2018-11-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160626085558/https://www.portlandmercury.com/images/blogimages/2016/06/15/1466024211-shupe_ruling.pdf|archive-date=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/jamie-shupe-first-non-binary-person-oregon|title=Jamie Shupe becomes first legally non-binary person in the US|first=Lauren|last=Dake|date=16 June 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following in Shupe's footsteps, [[California]] resident Sarah Kelly Keenan was also able to legally change their gender marker to non-binary in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/californian-becomes-second-us-citizen-granted-non-binary-gender-status-n654611|title=Californian becomes second US citizen granted 'non-binary' gender status|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After both Shupe and Keenan had success with their cases, more people have been inspired to take on the legal battle of changing their gender to a non-binary marker. With the help of organizations such as [https://www.intersexrecognition.org/ Intersex &amp; Genderqueer Recognition Project] dozens of these petitions have been granted and additional states have changed regulations to provide a third gender option on state ID, birth certificates, and/or court orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.intersexrecognition.org/resources|title=igrp {{!}} RESOURCES|website=igrp|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

Non-binary is not recognized as a legal gender in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Legal_gender#UK|title=Legal gender - Nonbinary.org|website=nonbinary.org|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gender Recognition Act 2004]] allowed people to apply to the [https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate Gender Recognition Panel] for a change of gender after living as the gender they wished to show on all their legal documents and being given a diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] by at least two health professionals. However, this change of gender only allowed for a change from male to female or vice versa.

In 2006 the [[Identity Cards Act 2006]] was introduced, which issued documents to UK residents and linked them back to the National Identity Register database. When the issue of transgender people and their assigned vs. actual gender came up, it was said that transgender people would be issued two cards, each with a separate male and female gender marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmpublic/identity/100706/am/100706s01.htm|title=House of Commons Public Bill Committee : Identity Documents Bill|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also said that eventually the hope for some was that the identity cards would get rid of the gender markers altogether. The [[Identity Documents Act 2010]] made all these cards invalid and called for their immediate destruction.

=== Canada ===
In 2002, the [[Northwest Territories]] was the first of [[Canada]]’s provinces to explicitly include gender identity as a protected group from discrimination under the law, followed by [[Manitoba]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cossman|first=Brenda|date=January 2018|title=Gender identity, gender pronouns, and freedom of expression: Bill C-16 and the traction of specious legal claims|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/utlj.2017-0073|journal=University of Toronto Law Journal|volume=68|issue=1|pages=37–79|doi=10.3138/utlj.2017-0073|issn=0042-0220}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, every Canadian province and territory had included similar changes to their discrimination laws.

In 2017, Canada passed [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]] which formally recognized non-binary gender people and granted them protection under the law towards discrimination on the grounds of “gender identity” and “gender expression.”

===Australia===
The Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 did not explicitly protect non-binary persons from discrimination until the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Intersex Status) Act of 2013, which prohibited any discrimination on the grounds of “gender identity” and “intersex status.” This amendment also removed the use of “other” and “opposite sex” in exchange for broader terms like “different sex.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bennet|first=Theodore|date=2014|title='NO MAN'S LAND': NON-BINARY SEX IDENTIFICATION IN AUSTRALIAN LAW AND POLICY.|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=37|pages=847-873|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the [[Australian High Court]] legally recognized non-binary as a category for people to identify with on legal documents. After a citizen named Norrie made a request for a third gender identity on legal documents and was eventually denied, Norrie chose to take the matter up with Australia's [[Human Rights Commission]] and their [[Court of Appeal]]. After a four-year long legal battle beginning in 2010, Norrie finally won the case. From this and the legalizing of the matter in [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory]] made the decision to pass a law which recognized non-binary identities. Though this is a step in a positive direction for non-binary identifying Australians, the law currently lacks concise policies on marriage licenses and recognition of partnership for non-binary people. Because of this, Australians registered as non-binary may not be able to legally marry.

In addition to marriage issues, the non-binary marker for Australian citizens requires proof of [[gender confirmation surgery]]. Because non-binary people live outside of the [[gender binary]], they may not wish to obtain gender confirmation surgery. The people not wishing to do so ultimately will not be able to register as non-binary until this portion of the law is amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/recognition-of-nonbinary-gender-in-australian-high-court|title=Australian High Court Legally Recognizes Nonbinary Gender Identities -- But The News Isn't All Good|date=April 8, 2014|author= S.E. Smith|work=xoJane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With much of existing Australian legislature being crafted around a binary interpretation of sex, this “third-sex” approach has lead to complications with how laws interact with this new classification. In response, steps towards the de-emphasis of sex within legislation are being taken by removing sexual identification from legal areas that do not have a necessity for it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Divinity''' is the study of [[Christianity|Christian]] and other [[theology]] and [[Christian ministry|ministry]] at a [[school]], [[divinity school]], [[university]], or [[seminary]].  The term is sometimes a [[synonym]] for theology as an academic, speculative pursuit, and sometimes is used for the study of applied theology and ministry to make a distinction between that and academic theology. It most often refers to [[Christianity|Christian]] study which is linked with the [[professional degree]]s for [[ordination|ordained]] ministry or related work, though it is also used in an academic setting by other faith traditions.

==Areas and specializations==

Divinity can be divided into several distinct but related disciplines. These vary, sometimes widely, from church to church and from one faith tradition to another, and even among various programs within a particular church. A typical program will include many of the following:

===Philosophical theology===
* [[Systematic theology]]
* [[Dogmatic theology]]
* [[Moral theology]] or [[Christian ethics]]
* [[Natural theology]]
* [[Sacrament|Sacramental theology]]

===Practice of worship===
* [[Liturgics]]
* [[Homiletics]]
* [[Sacred music]]

===Ministry in the field===
* [[Pastoral theology]]
* [[Pastoral counseling]]
* [[Religious education]] techniques

===Scriptural study and languages===
{{See also|Sacred language}}
* [[Biblical studies]] or [[Sacred Scripture]]
* [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]]
* [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]]
* [[Latin]]
* [[Old Church Slavonic]]

===Miscellany===
* [[Canon law]]
* [[History of Christianity|Church history]]
* [[Ecclesiology]]

==Degrees ==

Studying divinity usually leads to the awarding of an [[academic degree]] or a [[professional degree]].  Such degrees, particularly in modern times the [[Master of Divinity]], are prerequisites for ordained ministry in most [[Christian denominations]] and many other faith communities. The exception to this is all "plain" churches such as the [[Amish]], [[Old German Baptist Brethren]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Dunkard Brethren]], and many others. In fact, such churches hold to the belief that seminaries are an institution of man and not supported by Holy Scripture. Students earn such degrees at a free-standing [[seminary]], theologate or [[divinity school]], or at a university.

'''Dysgraphia''' is a deficiency in the ability to write, primarily [[handwriting]], but also coherence.&lt;ref&gt;Chivers, M. (1991). "Definition of Dysgraphia (Handwriting Difficulty). ''Dyslexia A2Z''. Retrieved from http://www.dyslexiaa2z.com/learning_difficulties/dysgraphia/dysgraphia_definition.html&lt;/ref&gt; Dysgraphia is a transcription disability, meaning that it is a writing disorder associated with impaired handwriting, orthographic coding ([[orthography]], the storing process of written words and processing the letters in those words), and finger sequencing (the movement of muscles required to write).&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berninger |first=V.W. |author2=B.J. Wolf |year=2009 |title= Teaching students with dyslexia and dysgraphia: Lessons from teaching and science |pages=1–240 |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Paul H. Brooks Publishing Co. |isbn= 978-1-55766-934-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It often overlaps with other learning disabilities such as [[speech impairment]], [[attention deficit disorder]], or [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name= "Nicolson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicolson RI, Fawcett AJ |title=Dyslexia, dysgraphia, procedural learning and the cerebellum |journal=Cortex |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=117–27 |date=January 2011 |pmid=19818437 |doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2009.08.016 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM-IV), dysgraphia is characterized as a [[learning disability]] in the category of written expression when one's writing skills are below those expected given a person's age measured through intelligence and age-appropriate education. The DSM is not clear in whether or not writing refers only to the motor skills involved in writing, or if it also includes orthographic skills and spelling.&lt;ref name= Nicolson /&gt;

The word ''dysgraphia'' comes from the Greek words ''dys'' meaning "impaired" and γραφία ''graphía'' meaning "writing by hand".&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;

There are at least two stages in the act of writing: the linguistic stage and the motor-expressive-praxic stage. The linguistic stage involves the encoding of auditory and visual information into symbols for letters and written words. This is mediated through the [[angular gyrus]], which provides the linguistic rules which guide writing. The motor stage is where the expression of written words or [[grapheme]]s is articulated. This stage is mediated by Exner's writing area of the frontal lobe.&lt;ref name="pmid19847902"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Roux FE, Dufor O, Giussani C, etal |title=The graphemic/motor frontal area Exner's area revisited |journal=Annals of Neurology |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=537–45 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19847902 |doi=10.1002/ana.21804 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with dysgraphia can often write on some level and may experience difficulty with other [[fine motor skill]]s, such as tying shoes. However, dysgraphia does not affect all fine motor skills. People with dysgraphia often have unusual difficulty with handwriting and spelling&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; which in turn can cause writing fatigue.&lt;ref name= Nicolson /&gt; They may lack basic grammar and spelling skills (for example, having difficulties with the letters p, q, b, and d), and often will write the wrong word when trying to formulate their thoughts on paper. The disorder generally emerges when the child is first introduced to writing.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; Adults, teenagers, and children alike are all subject to dysgraphia.&lt;ref name= "Dysgraphia"&gt;[http://www.ncld.org/ld-basics/ld-aamp-language/writing/dysgraphia NCLD Editorial Staff. (2010). "What is Dysgraphia?" ''National Center for Learning Disabilities''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysgraphia should be distinguished from [[agraphia]], which is an acquired ''loss'' of the ability to write resulting from brain injury, stroke, or progressive illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/agraphia | title=agraphia | publisher=the Free Dictionary by Farlex | accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Dysgraphia is nearly always accompanied by other [[learning disabilities]] such as [[dyslexia]] or [[attention deficit disorder]],&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berninger |first1= VW |last2= May |first2= MO |title=Evidence-based diagnosis and treatment for specific learning disabilities impairing written and/or oral language |journal=J Learn Disabil |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=167–83 |year=2011 |pmid=21383108 |doi=10.1177/0022219410391189 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dys-add.com/videos/dyslexiaSymptomsSolutions_Part02.html|title=Bright Solutions - Free On-Line Videos|author=|date=|website=www.dys-add.com|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this can impact the type of dysgraphia a person might have. There are three principal subtypes of dysgraphia that are recognized. There is little information available about different types of dysgraphia and there are likely more subtypes than the ones listed below. Some children may have a combination of two or more of these, and individual symptoms may vary in presentation from what is described here.  Most common presentation is a motor dysgraphia/agraphia resulting from damage to some part of the motor cortex in the parietal lobes.

===Dyslexic===
People with dyslexic dysgraphia have illegible spontaneously written work. Their copied work is fairly good, but their spelling is usually poor. Their finger tapping speed (a method for identifying fine motor problems) is normal, indicating that the deficit does not likely stem from [[cerebellum|cerebellar]] damage.

===Motor===
[[File:Dysgraphia.jpg|thumbnail|Dysgraphia can be difficult to diagnose because the handwriting starts out clear and slowly degrades, making the writer appear lazy.]]
Motor dysgraphia is due to deficient [[fine motor skill]]s, poor dexterity, poor [[muscle tone]], or unspecified motor clumsiness. Letter formation may be acceptable in very short samples of writing, but this requires extreme effort and an unreasonable amount of time to accomplish, and it cannot be sustained for a significant length of time, as it can cause arthritis-like tensing of the hand. Overall, their written work is poor to illegible even if copied by sight from another document, and drawing is difficult. Oral spelling for these individuals is normal, and their finger tapping speed is below normal. This shows that there are problems within the fine motor skills of these individuals. People with [[developmental coordination disorder]] may be dysgraphic. Writing is often slanted due to holding a pen or pencil incorrectly.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;

===Spatial===
A person with spatial dysgraphia has a defect in the understanding of space. They will have illegible spontaneously written work, illegible copied work, and problems with drawing abilities. They have normal spelling and normal finger tapping speed, suggesting that this subtype is not fine motor based.

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms to dysgraphia are often overlooked or attributed to the student being lazy, unmotivated, not caring, or having delayed visual-motor processing. In order to be diagnosed with dysgraphia, one must have a cluster, but not necessarily all, of the following symptoms:&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* Cramping of fingers while writing short entries
* Odd wrist, arm, body, or paper orientations such as bending an arm into an L shape
* Excessive erasures
* Mixed upper case and lower case letters
* Inconsistent form and size of letters, or unfinished letters
* Misuse of lines and margins
* Inefficient speed of copying
* Inattentiveness over details when writing
* Frequent need of verbal cues
* Relies heavily on vision to write 
* Difficulty visualizing letter formation beforehand  
* Poor legibility
* Poor spatial planning on paper
* Difficulty writing and thinking at the same time (creative writing, taking notes)
* Handwriting abilities that may interfere with spelling and written composition
* Difficulty understanding homophones and what spelling to use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faust|first1=Miriam|title=The Handbook of the Neuropsychology of Language|publisher=Wiley - Blackwell|pages=912|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEWVqdNFL4cC&amp;pg=PA912&amp;lpg=PA912&amp;dq=homophones+and+dysgraphia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1NxgxjoqWl&amp;sig=1lPYB3M6CaFRqf4roMciLkySDns&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj659zmhf3KAhXCOCYKHSfhBzkQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=homophones%20and%20dysgraphia&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Having a hard time translating ideas to writing, sometimes using the wrong words altogether
* May feel pain while writing (cramps in fingers, wrist and palms)&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;
}}
Dysgraphia may cause students emotional trauma often due to the fact that no one can read their writing, and they are aware that they are not performing to the same level as their peers. Emotional problems that may occur alongside dysgraphia include impaired [[self-esteem]], lowered [[self-efficacy]], heightened anxiety, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt; They may put in extra efforts in order to have the same achievements as their peers, but often get frustrated because they feel that their hard work does not pay off.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt;

Dysgraphia is a hard disorder to detect as it does not affect specific ages, gender, or intelligence.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt; The main concern in trying to detect dysgraphia is that people hide their disability behind their verbal fluency because they are ashamed that they cannot achieve the same goals as their peers.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt; Having dysgraphia is not related to a lack of [[cognitive ability]],&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; and it is not uncommon in intellectually gifted individuals, but due to dysgraphia their intellectual abilities are often not identified.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt;

===Associated conditions===

There are some common problems not related to dysgraphia but often associated with dysgraphia, the most common of which is stress.  Often children (and adults) with dysgraphia will become extremely frustrated with the task of writing specially on plain paper (and spelling); younger children may cry, pout, or refuse to complete written assignments.  This frustration can cause the child (or adult) a great deal of stress and can lead to stress-related illnesses. This can be a result of any symptom of dysgraphia.&lt;ref name= Dysgraphia/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt;

==Causes==

Dysgraphia is a biologically based disorder with genetic and brain bases.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; More specifically, it is a [[working memory]] problem.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt; In dysgraphia, individuals fail to develop normal connections among different brain regions needed for writing.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt; People with dysgraphia have difficulty in automatically remembering and mastering the sequence of motor movements required to write letters or numbers.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; Dysgraphia is also in part due to underlying problems in orthographic coding, the orthographic loop, and graphmotor output (the movements that result in writing) by one's hands, fingers and executive functions involved in letter writing.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; The orthographic loop is when written words are stored in the mind's eye, connected through sequential finger movement for motor output through the hand with feedback from the eye.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Several tests exist to diagnose dysgraphia like Ajuriaguerra scale, BHK for children or teenagers, DASH and HHE scale &lt;ref name="Asselborn 2018"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/s41746-018-0049-x| issn = 2398-6352| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 42| last1 = Asselborn| first1 = Thibault| last2 = Gargot| first2 = Thomas| last3 = Kidziński| first3 = Łukasz| last4 = Johal| first4 = Wafa| last5 = Cohen| first5 = David| last6 = Jolly| first6 = Caroline| last7 = Dillenbourg| first7 = Pierre| title = Automated human-level diagnosis of dysgraphia using a consumer tablet| journal = npj Digital Medicine| accessdate = 2018-09-30| date = 2018-08-31| url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-018-0049-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

With digital tablets like [[Wacom]] devices, it is now possible to measure the position, tilt and pressure in real time. From theses features, it is possible to compute automatic features like speed, shaking and train a classifier to diagnose automatically children with atypical writing &lt;ref name="Asselborn 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-09-software-disabilities.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Treatment==
Treatment for dysgraphia varies and may include treatment for motor disorders to help control writing movements. The use of [[occupational therapy]] can be effective in the school setting, and teachers should be well informed about dysgraphia to aid in carry-over of the occupational therapist's interventions. Treatments may address impaired memory or other neurological problems. Some physicians recommend that individuals with dysgraphia use computers to avoid the problems of handwriting. Dysgraphia can sometimes be partially overcome with appropriate and conscious effort and training.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt;  The International Dyslexia Association suggests the use of kinesthetic memory through early training by having the child overlearn how to write letters and to later practice writing with their eyes closed or averted to reinforce the feel of the letters being written. They also suggest teaching the students [[cursive]] writing as it has fewer reversible letters and can help lessen spacing problems, at least within words, because cursive letters are generally attached within a word.

==School==
There is no special education category for students with dysgraphia;&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; in the United States, The National Center for Learning Disabilities suggests that children with dysgraphia be handled in a case-by-case manner with an [[Individualized Education Program]], or provided individual accommodation to provide alternative ways of submitting work and modify tasks to avoid the area of weakness.&lt;ref name= Dysgraphia /&gt;  Students with dysgraphia often cannot complete written assignments that are legible, appropriate in length and content, or within given time.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; It is suggested that students with dysgraphia receive specialized instructions that are appropriate for them, this means that each set of instructions may be different for each child. Children will mostly benefit from explicit and comprehensive instructions, help translating across multiple levels of language, and review and revision of assignments or writing methods.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt; Direct, explicit instruction on letter formation and guided practice will help students achieve automatic handwriting performance before they use letters to write words, phrases, and sentences.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; Some older children may benefit from the use of a personal computer or a laptop in class so that they do not have to deal with the frustration of falling behind their peers.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt;

It is also suggested by Berninger that teachers with dysgraphic students decide if their focus will be on manuscript writing (printing), or [[keyboarding]]. In either case, it is beneficial that students are taught how to read cursive writing as it is used daily in classrooms by some teachers.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; It may also be beneficial for the teacher to come up with other methods of assessing a child's knowledge other than written tests; an example would be oral testing. This causes less frustration for the child as they are able to get their knowledge across to the teacher without worrying how to write their thoughts.&lt;ref name= Dysgraphia /&gt;

The number of students with dysgraphia may increase from 4 percent of students in primary grades, due to the overall difficulty of handwriting, and up to 20 percent in middle school because written compositions become more complex. With this in mind, there are no exact numbers of how many individuals have dysgraphia due to its difficulty to diagnose.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2009"/&gt; There are slight gender differences in association with written disabilities; overall it is found that males are more likely to be impaired with handwriting, composing, spelling, and orthographic abilities than females.&lt;ref name="Berninger 2011"/&gt;

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) doesn't use the term dysgraphia but uses the phrase "an impairment in written expression" under the category of "specific learning disorder". This is the term used by most doctors and psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.understood.org/en/learning-attention-issues/child-learning-disabilities/dysgraphia/understanding-dysgraphia | title=Understanding Dysgraphia | work=Understood.org | accessdate=September 22, 2016 | author=Patino, Erica}}&lt;/ref&gt; To qualify for special education services, a child must have an issue named or described in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). While IDEA doesn't use the term "dysgraphia", it describes it under the category of "specific learning disability". This includes issues with understanding or using language (spoken or written) that make it difficult to listen, think, speak, read, write, spell or to do mathematical calculations.

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===

[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|location=New York; London|isbn=0-393-32363-3|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] wrote about a hanging in [[Newgate Prison]] in 1840, and "taught an even wider public that executions are obscene entertainments".&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt;

[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}
}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M. Schulz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ "Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning", ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a popular comic called ''[[Peanuts]]''&lt;ref&gt;Films have been made of the ''Peanuts'' cartoons, including one [[The Peanuts Movie|released in 2015]] to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip.&lt;/ref&gt; about the relationships among a cast of child characters;&lt;ref&gt;The philosophical and theological implications of Schulz's work were explored in: {{cite book|last=Short|first=Robert L.|title=The Gospel According to Peanuts|year=1965|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Westminster|isbn=0-664-22222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Leunig]] who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate [[social criticism]]. The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

=== Comedy ===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
[[File:Dictator charlie3.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] impersonating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for comic effect in the [[satire|satirical]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]
[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly structured role of [[jester]] consisted of verbal humour, including [[teasing]], jests, [[insult]], ridicule, and [[obscenity]] and [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] humour such as [[slapstick]] and horseplay in the presence of an audience."&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In medieval times, all comic types{{snd}} the [[buffoon]], jester, [[hunchback]], [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], jokester, were all "considered to be essentially of one comic type: the fool", who while not necessarily funny, represented "the shortcomings of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hokenson|first=Jan Walsh|title=The Idea of Comedy: History, Theory, Critique|year=2006|publisher=Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp|location=Cranbury, New Jersey|isbn=0-8386-4096-6|pages=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornback|first=Robert|title=The English clown tradition from the middle ages to Shakespeare|year=2009|publisher=D.S.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as [[joke]]s, [[pun]]s, [[parody]], [[wit]], [[observational humor]], or the unexpected effect of [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Penny|title=The Cambridge introduction to Shakespeare's comedies|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-85668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=David|title=Shakespeare's practical jokes: an introduction to the comic in his work|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8387-5680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One-liner joke]]s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In [[farce]], the comedy is a primary purpose.

The meaning of the word "comedy" and the audience's expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Ashley|title=The role of the chou ("clown") in traditional Chinese drama: comedy, criticism, and cosmology on the Chinese stage|year=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=0-7734-5303-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple physical comedy such as [[slapstick]] is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages. However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-32706-8&lt;!-- (set)--&gt;|editor=Charney, Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expectations about the performance and their engagement with it have changed over time ('''1''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=John|title=Musical theatre: a history|year=2008|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=0-8264-2860-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in England during the 18th century, "the prejudice against actresses had faded"&lt;ref name=Ackroyd&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ackroyd|first=Peter|title=London: The Biography|year=2000|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0-385-49771-7}} p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe generally, going to the theatre, once a socially dubious activity, became "a more respectable middle-class pastime"&lt;ref name=Frame&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Frame|first=Murray|title=The St. Petersburg Imperial Theaters: Stage and State in Revolutionary Russia, 1900–1920|year=2000|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co, Inc.

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

==== Cinema and film ====
{{Main|Film}}
[[File:Munken kino (kinolerret).jpg|thumb|left|Film audiences are typically seated in comfortable chairs arranged in close rows before a projection screen. Norway (2005)]]

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].&lt;ref name=Byrnes&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Pompeii, Noah and Exodus: The sword giveth again|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/pompeii-noah-and-exodus-the-sword-giveth-again-20140327-35jm4.html|work=Film|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1930s to 1950s, movies and radio were the "only mass entertainment" but by the second decade of the 21st century, technological changes, economic decisions, risk aversion and globalisation reduced both the quality and range of films being produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Losing the plot|last = Byrnes|first = Paul|date = 12 December 2015|work = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = |via = |pages = 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated [[visual effects]] and CGI techniques, for example, rather than humans, were used not only to create realistic images of people, landscapes and events (both real and [[Fantasy|fantastic]]) but also to animate non-living items such as [[Lego]] normally used as entertainment as a game in physical form.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite web|last=Maddox|first=Garry|title=The Lego Movie: Hit off the old block | url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/the-lego-movie-hit-off-the-old-block-20140327-35jek.html|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creators of ''[[The Lego Movie]]'' "wanted the audience to believe they were looking at actual Lego bricks on a tabletop that were shot with a real camera, not what we actually did, which was create vast environments with digital bricks inside the computer."&lt;ref name=Maddox/&gt; The convergence of computers and film has allowed entertainment to be presented in a new way and the technology has also allowed for those with the personal resources to screen films in a [[home cinema|home theatre]], recreating in a private venue the quality and experience of a public theatre. This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance craze" even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Andrew David |title=Shanghai's Dancing World: Cabaret Culture and Urban Politics, 1919–1954 |year=2010 |publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong |location=Sha Tin, Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-996-373-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned{{snd}} but did not stop{{snd}} dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and [[barn dance]]s."&lt;ref name="Wulff" /&gt; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like [[burlesque]], they were suggestive,&lt;ref name="Butters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butters|first=Gerald R.|title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915–1966|year=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-0-8262-1749-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because, like the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]], they were associated with [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Pruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "African American dancers were typically banned from performing in [[minstrel show]]s until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Constance Valis|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7397">'''Aletheic relativism''' argues that truth itself is relative. This form of relativism has its own particular problem, regardless of whether one is talking about truth being relative to the individual, the position or purpose of the individual, or the conceptual scheme within which the truth was revealed. This problem centers on what Mandelbaum (1962) termed the "self-excepting fallacy." Largely because of the self-excepting fallacy, few authors in the philosophy of science currently accept aletheic cognitive relativism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muncy|first=James A.|last2=Fisk|first2=Raymond P.|date=1987|title=Cognitive Relativism and the Practice of Marketing Science|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1251141|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=51|issue=1|pages=20–33|doi=10.2307/1251141}}&lt;/ref&gt;. '''Factual relativism''' (also called '''epistemic relativism''', '''epistemological relativism''', '''alethic relativism''' or '''cognitive relativism''') is a way to [[reasoning|reason]] where [[fact]]s used to [[theory of justification|justify]] any [[proposition|claim]]s are understood to be [[relativism|relative]] and [[subjectivism|subjective]] to the perspective of those [[evidence|proving]] or [[falsify]]ing the proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Iris Einheuser, [http://www.ub.edu/grc_logos/archive/conferences/relativismabouttruth/Abstract5(Einheuser).pdf "Varieties of Relativism: Indexical, Propositional and Factual"], from the Logos conference on RELATIVIZING UTTERANCE TRUTH, Barcelona, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
One school of thought compares scientific knowledge to the mythology of other cultures, arguing that it is merely our society's set of myths based on societal assumptions. For support, [[Paul Feyerabend]]'s comments in ''[[Against Method]]'' that "The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing" and "First-world science is one science among many" (from the introduction to the Chinese edition)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|title=Against method|date=1992|publisher=Verso|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780860916468|page=3|edition=Repr}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes cited, although it is not clear if Feyerabend meant them to be taken entirely seriously.

The [[strong program]] in the [[sociology of science]] is (in the words of founder [[David Bloor]]) "impartial with respect to truth and falsity".&lt;ref name="Philosophy Science"&gt;{{cite web|title=PhilosophyScience2|url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/philosophyscience2.htm|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Bloor and [[S. Barry Barnes|Barry Barnes]] have said "For the relativist [such as us] there is no sense attached to the idea that some standards or beliefs are really rational as distinct from merely locally accepted as such."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationality and relativism|date=1982|publisher=MIT press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262580618|pages=27–28|editor1=Hollis, Martin |editor2=Lukes, Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, [[Bruno Latour]] has claimed that "Since the settlement of a controversy is the ''cause'' of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome&amp;nbsp;– Nature&amp;nbsp;– to explain how and why a controversy has been settled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Latour|first=Bruno|title=Science in action : how to follow scientists and engineers through society|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674792913|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yves Winkin, a Belgian professor of communications, responded to a popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper ''Le Soir'' that "There is no transcendent truth. [...] It is not surprising that these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, I think that, in this context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokal|first=Alan|title=Fashionable nonsense&amp;nbsp;: postmodern intellectuals' abuse of science|date=1998|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=9781466862401|page=100|author2=Bricmont, Jean }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of science Gérard Fourez wrote in that "What one generally calls a fact is an interpretation of a situation that no one, at least for the moment, wants to call into question."&lt;ref&gt;Fourez, Gérard (1992). ''La Construction des sciences, 2eme edition revue''. Brussels:De Boeck Université.&lt;/ref&gt;

British archaeologist Roger Anyon told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "science is just one of many ways of knowing the world...  The [[Zuni people|Zuni]]'s world view is just as valid as the archeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Johnson (writer)|Johnson, George]].

== Criticism ==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Cognitive relativism is unfalsifiable and has been criticized by both [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic philosophers]] and [[Science|scientists]].

Cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]'' has advocated [[model-dependent realism]], which bears close resemblance to a relativist position, as a means of reconciling apparent inconsistencies between different iterations of [[M-Theory]].

[[Larry Laudan]]'s book ''Science and Relativism''&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Relativism: Dialogues on the Philosophy of Science'', {{ISBN|978-0-226-46949-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines the various philosophical points of view on the subject in the form of a dialogue.

'''Generalized Environmental Modeling System for Surfacewaters''' or '''GEMSS''' is a [[public domain software]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemss.com/gemss.html GEMSS] on gmmss.com ''"The model is in the public domain, available on request, and has been used worldwide."''&lt;/ref&gt; application published by ERM. It has been used for hydrological studies throughout the world.&lt;ref name="bortone p24"&gt;Bortone, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GEMSS has been used for ultimate heat sink analyses at [[Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant]], and [[Arkansas Nuclear One]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] it has been applied at [[PPL Corporation | PPL Corporation's]] [[Brunner Island Steam Electric Station]] on the lower [[Susquehanna River]], [[Exelon | Exelon’s]] Cromby and [[Limerick Generating Station|Limerick]] Generating Stations on the [[Schuylkill River]], and at several other electric power facilities. River applications for electric power facilities have been made on the Susquehanna (Brunner Island), the [[Missouri River|Missouri]](Labadie Power Station), the Delaware (Mercer and Gilbert Generating Station), the Connecticut ([[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]]), and others.

Applications of GEMSS and its individual component modules have been accepted by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Canada.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is the sole hydrodynamic model listed in the model selection tool database{{which|date=March 2016}} for hydrodynamic and chemical fate models that can perform 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D time-variable modeling for most waterbody types, consider all state variables and include the near- and far-fields. GEMSS can also provide GUI’s, grid generation, and GIS linkage tools and has strong documentation.&lt;ref name="water quality models fitzpatrick"&gt;Fitzpatrick, J., et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
GEMSS includes a grid generator and editor, control file generator, 2-D and 3-D post processing viewers, and an animation tool. It uses a [[database]] approach to store and access model results. The database approach is also used for field data; as a result, the GEMSS viewers can be used to display model results, field data or both, a capability useful for understanding the behavior of the prototype as well as for calibrating the model. The field data analysis features can be used independently using GEMSS modeling capability.

===Modeling techniques===
A GEMSS application requires two types of data: (1) spatial data (primarily the waterbody shoreline and [[bathymetry]], but also locations, elevations, and configurations of man-made structures) and (2) temporal data (time-varying [[boundary value|boundary condition]] data defining tidal elevation, inflow rate and temperature, inflow constituent concentration, outflow rate, and meteorological data.&lt;ref name="bortone p24"/&gt; All [[deterministic model]]s, including GEMSS, require uninterrupted time-varying boundary condition data. There can be no long gaps in the datasets and all required datasets must be available during the span of the proposed simulation period.

For input to the model, the spatial data is encoded primarily in two input files: the control and bathymetry files. These files are [[georeferencing|geo-referenced]]. The temporal data is encoded in many files, each file representing a set of time-varying boundary conditions, for example, meteorological data for surface heat exchange and [[wind shear]], or inflow rates for a [[tributary]] stream. Each record in the boundary condition files is stamped with a year-month-day-hour-minute address. The data can be subjected to [[quality assurance]] procedures by using GEMSS to plot, then to visually inspect individual data points, trends and outliers. The set of input files and the GEMSS executable constitute the model application.

== History ==
[[File:Mutand dAguila Joan Castejon Wax on Paper 1982 100x81.jpg|thumb|220px|'Mutant eagle', wax on paper, by Joan Castejon.]]
The Grup d' Elx artists began their training in an precarious artistic scenario. Its activity was a task that built a bridge between modernity and vertebrate and radical vanguard, which for them was inseparable from a social transition out of the [[Francoist]] dictatorship.  In this sense, as the members of El Paso  or [[Dau al set]], the artists of the Grup d' Elx conducted an art in which there are several components that are part of a common denominator: primacy of intense expressiveness, intentional reduction of color to a minimum and, finally, the belief in an artistic poetics of engagement centered on human beings and their social situation. In fact, one of its most representative members, [[Joan Castejón]], was imprisoned for four years.&lt;ref name="Así era entonces."&gt;{{cite news

The group was inspired by the activity of other postwar artistic groups such as [[Dau al Set]] and [[Grup Parpalló]]. Members of Grup d'Elx included [[Joan Castejón]], Albert Agulló, Antoni Coll y Sixto Marco.

The group dissolved in 1973.

The '''Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine''' was founded in 2009 by [[Donald Singer]] and [[Michael Hulse]]. The founders "wished to draw together national and international perspectives on three major historical and contemporary themes uniting the disciplines of poetry and medicine: medicine as inspiration for the writings of poets; effects of poetic creativity on the experience of illness by patients, their families, friends, and carers; and poetry as therapy".&lt;ref name="pmid20333814"&gt;{{cite journal

==Background==
The Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine provides international awards for unpublished poems in English by any living poet. There are seven main awards in the Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine. Three awards are given for international health students or international Health Service-related professionals, including clinicians, educators, researchers, and biomedical scientists.  Three awards are given for open international entries. The International Hippocrates Prize for Young Poets was launched in 2012, and is also given for an unpublished poem on a medical theme.&lt;ref name="hippocrates-poetry.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hippocrates-poetry.org/hippocrates-prize/ |title=Hippocrates Prize |publisher=Hippocrates Initiative for Poetry and Medicine |first1=Donald RJ |last1=Singer |work=Homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2017 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine was held in partnership with the Arts and Humanities Initiative&lt;ref&gt;https://artsandhumanities.hms.harvard.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Harvard Medical School]]. The 2018 Hippocrates Prize for Poetry and Medicine was awarded in [[Chicago]] in partnership with the Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities at Northwestern University’s [[Feinberg School of Medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/poetry2018&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Poetry Foundation]], the Arts and Humanities Initiative at [[Harvard Medical School]] and the [[Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthpolicyandtechnology.org/article/S2211-8837(18)30169-2/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Hippocrates poetry and medicine initiative was awarded the 2011 [[Times Higher Education]] award for Excellence and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/hybrid.asp?typeCode=581&amp;pubCode=1&amp;navcode=175 |title=Education news, resources and university jobs for the academic world |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cunnane |first=Sarah |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=418247&amp;c=1 |title=Sheffield named ‘University of the Year’ at annual THE Awards |publisher=Times Higher Education |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/warwick_team_inspired/ |title=Warwick team inspired poetry competition win the Arts in the 2011 Times Higher Education awards, announced on 24 November 2011 in London.ns national award |publisher=.warwick.ac.uk |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2012-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The quotation marks and em-dash are part of the story's title --&gt;
'''''"If This Goes On—"''''' is a [[science fiction]] novella by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], first serialized in 1940 in [[Astounding (magazine)|''Astounding Science-Fiction'']] and revised and expanded for inclusion in the 1953 collection ''[[Revolt in 2100]]''. The novella shows what might happen to Christianity in the United States given mass communications, applied psychology, and a hysterical populace. The novel is part of Heinlein's [[Future History (novel)|''Future History'']] series.

In 2016 the story won the 1941 [[Hugo Award|Retro-Hugo Award]] for Best Novella of 1940 at the 2016 WorldCon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1941-retro-hugo-awards/ 1941 Retro-Hugos] at the Hugo Awards website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story is set in a future [[theocratic]]  American society, ruled by the latest in a series of fundamentalist Christian "Prophets". The First Prophet was Nehemiah Scudder, a backwoods preacher turned [[President of the United States|President]] (elected in 2012), then [[dictator]] (no elections were held in 2016 or later).

John Lyle, a junior army officer under the Prophet, is stationed at the Prophet's capital of [[New Jerusalem#In popular culture|New Jerusalem]]. Devout at this point, he finds himself questioning his faith when he falls for one of the Prophet's Virgins, Sister Judith. Judith, new to the vocation, faints when she is called upon to render sexual service to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light. John confides in his far more worldly roommate, Zeb Jones, who is not only not shocked, but who assists John. A clandestine meeting with Judith goes awry when they are forced to kill a spy, leaving them no choice but to seek aid from the Cabal, an underground revolutionary movement (Judith's friend, Sister Magdalene, is a member). The two men are inducted into the Cabal, while remaining on duty in their army posts. Judith is arrested and tortured as part of the investigation into the death of the spy, and John and Zeb rescue her, though leaving enough clues that John is soon arrested and tortured himself. He gives little away, and is himself rescued by the Cabal. Zeb and Magdalene have evaded arrest, thanks to a clandestine distress signal that John manages to leave for Zeb while being arrested.

Judith is spirited out of the country before John regains consciousness, and John is given a false identity in order to make his way to Cabal headquarters. He is detected en route, forced to flee, and arrives safely after several misadventures. He finds that Zeb and Magdalene, who he assumes are a couple, have made their way there before him. All take on significant roles in bringing to fruition the revolutionary plot, John as an aide to the commander, General Huxley.

While working there, John receives a literal [[Dear John letter|"Dear John" letter]] from Judith, informing him of her impending marriage to a Mexican man she met while getting refuge in his country. He learns that Zeb and Magdalene have no marriage plans, and begins a romance with Magdalene.

The revolutionary plot is mostly successful, and the country, other than New Jerusalem, is seized. But the capital must also be conquered lest it serve as a rallying point for loyalists. Even as constitutional discussions go on, tempered to provide the greatest possible individual freedom (this is the origin of the 'Covenant' mentioned in other Heinlein works), the new regime's troops prepare to take New Jerusalem. John and Magdalene are married just before the assault.

During the fight, Huxley is wounded, and John must take over temporary command, though not entitled by rank to do so. He gives the orders that bring victory. He then turns over command to the senior unwounded general, and leads a squad invading the Prophet's private quarters. They find that he has been viciously killed by his own Virgins.

==Freemasonry==
The Cabal uses terminology associated with [[Freemasonry]], and there are hints that the Masons are actually one of the groups involved in the loosely organized revolt against the government. (Heinlein himself was not a Mason,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/FAQrah.html FAQ: Heinlein the Person&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but had considered joining the Masons as a young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.sf.written/r8ezDGQDfMM/R-jJIVm6HbEJ|title=Re: Heinlein and freemasonry?|date=October 13, 2006|author=Bill Patterson|newsgroup=rec.arts.sf.written|message-id=1155484574.561507.148190@m79g2000cwm.googlegroups.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Critical reception==
[[Damon Knight]] wrote of the novel:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|year=1967|title=[[In Search of Wonder]]|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Revolution...has always been a favorite theme in science fiction.  It's romantic, it's reliable, and—as a rule—it's as phony as a Martian princess.

Who but Heinlein ever pointed out, as he does here in detail, that a modern revolution is big business?  And who but Heinlein would have seen that fraternal organizations, for thirty years the butt of highbrow American humor, would make the perfect nucleus for an American underground against tyranny?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Connections with other works by Heinlein==
While set in Heinlein's ''Future History'', the story is self-contained and has little connection with other works in the series. However, it is noted in ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' that, during the time of this story, the secret of the Howard Families was held close (being a prize that was beyond the power of the Prophet to confiscate), and also that the Cabal assisted in helping the Howards maintain their Masquerade, the concealment of the existence of the Howards. [[Lazarus Long]] specifically mentions that he spent the period of the Interregnum, when the Prophets ruled the United States and space travel was forbidden, mostly on Venus.

The story also depicts the start of the negotiations which would lead to the Covenant, the somewhat idealized basis for government depicted in "[[Coventry (short story)|Coventry]]", "[[Misfit (short story)|Misfit]]" and in ''Methuselah's Children''.

Scudder was previously mentioned in passing in the short story "[[Logic of Empire]]" and later on in Heinlein’s final novel ''[[To Sail Beyond the Sunset]]''. A story about the rise of Scudder, "The Sound of His Wings", is contained in the Future History timeline, but was never written by Heinlein, who stated in the afterword to ''Revolt in 2100'': "I will probably never write the story of Nehemiah Scudder, I dislike him too much". Also, a story called "The Stone Pillow", which would have depicted the earlier foredoomed opposition to the Theocracy, never got written, Heinlein noting that there was "too much tragedy in real life".

The 1940 version of ''"If This Goes On—"'' was believed to be Heinlein's first novel&lt;ref&gt;# {{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the unpublished work ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' was discovered in 2003.&lt;ref name="rule20030831"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/newsFUTL.html | title=The finding and publishing of "For Us, the Living" | publisher=The Heinlein Society | date=2003-08-31 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Rule, Deb Houdek}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the earlier, unpublished novel Scudder, though coming very close to gaining power, is stopped at the last moment by the mobilization of Libertarians.

Ward Carson wrote: "In ''For Us, The Living'', space colonization waits until the end of the Twenty-First Century and Scudder is defeated; in the ''Future History'' it happens a century earlier and Scudder takes over the US. Heinlein made no explicit remark on this, but a causal connection could be made: in the Future History the bold individualistic Americans emigrated into space in the end of the Twentieth Century, and were not present in America to stop it from falling into the fanatic's hands".&lt;ref&gt;Ward G. Carson, "The Formative Years of Science Fiction" in Ed Woods (ed.) ''Round Table on Speculative Literature'', London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A remote village named Pali in [[Andhra Pradesh]] is struck by an unknown disease, with several villagers dying each month. The village Tantrik ([[Rao Ramesh]]) predicts a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Siddhappa ([[Shafi (actor)|Shafi]]) with the duty to find a man with such supernatural power and bring him to their village.

Meanwhile, Alluri Seetarama Raju ([[Mahesh Babu]]) is a [[Taxicab|cab]] driver who lives in [[Hyderabad]] with his grandfather ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), a teacher. He is currently in [[Rajasthan]] in search of the family of a man named Bilavar Singh. In his journey, he meets a [[Gemini TV]] reporter Baabji ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]), who comes to Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary. Raju introduces himself to Baabji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. He describes a woman named Subhashini ([[Anushka Shetty]]), whom he considers brings bad luck to him. Previously, he encountered her in various occasions in which she damages his taxi due to her reckless driving. Raju lands in the hospital one day when Subhashini mixes an [[epsom salt]] [[laxative]] in Raju's [[coffee]], thinking it meets her at a [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]] to collect the compensation for his taxi's damages from her, though this was meant for someone else. One day, he drives two men, [[geology]] scientist Dr. Paranji and his assistant Bilavar to their destination the [[Geological Survey of India]]. But he sees them getting gunned down by some henchmen, and Bilavar falls out of a window and lands on Raju's taxi, destroying it. Since Bilavar has insurance, Raju's boss tells him to deliver the insurance check of Rs. 5,00,000 to Bilavar's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get Rs. 1,00,000 in return to pay for his car damages.

Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, [[business magnate]] Durga Prasad ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), brings her a match, another business magnate GK's ([[Prakash Raj]]) son ([[Amit Tiwari]]). The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong business partnership. GK's son takes her to Rajasthan for a date. Subhashini runs away after she sees a [[condom]] drop from his pocket. GK finds out about it, informs Prasad, and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman Govardhan ([[Subbaraju]]) to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. Subhashini finds Raju and Baabji and learns she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Baabji, Raju, and a [[botanist]] Tom Cruise ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) find Girdwala and hand the check to Bilavar's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the Rs. 1,00,000 when he sees the family's poverty. Tom remains in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant. Baabji goes away with his shooting team but does not offer them a ride.

As Raju and Subhashini return, Govardhan's men stab Raju and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. Raju survives, fights, and kills almost all of Govardhan's men. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa finds him and believes he is the God after seeing the omens. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as their God. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali, and that the villagers see him as the supernatural godsend who will rescue the village. Initially reluctant to help them out, he escapes to Hyderabad, where he hands over Subhashini to her father. After realizing Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju puts fate to the test and when he understands the concept of deityhood and god, he makes it a goal to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village. After tracking down a doctor, the dean of the medical college run by GK, Govardhan, and GK's lawyer Miriyam ([[Brahmanandam]]), Raju discovers the [[plastic]] factory in Pali deposits its wastes in the drinking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. GK actually wants the villagers in Pali to die, which was why he had the Government's medical camp removed periodically. He finds GK's assistant ([[Veda Sastry|Archana]]) and suspects she has something to do with GK's plan as she did not get into his taxi along with Paranji, indicating she knew beforehand that he was going to be killed. Raju inquires her about GK's intentions, who reveals that Paranji discovered earlier that there is a large [[iridium]] deposit under Pali, which is worth billions, and informed GK about it.

Despite GK's warning to Paranji of not revealing it to anybody else, he tries to inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he was killed which was why GK sent Govardhan to kill him. Raju was lured to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to Bilavar's family and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate on their own to avoid suspicion, which was why he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste.

GK kills his assistant and Govardhan for their failures. He then heads to Pali to kill all the villagers. The village head warns GK that Raju is their God, that he would bring death to GK, and keep Pali's population at 534, not letting any more die in the process. Raju arrives at Pali with Sidhappa. GK shoots Sidhappa and kills him, reducing the population to 533. Before dying, Siddhappa looks into Raju's eyes, dying after. Raju kills GK's goons and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK starts escaping with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck after Raju curses him to die. The village head reveals Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village, because although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534. The film ends with a new flag being put up in honor of the new birth.

==Critical reception==
[[Sify]] rated 3 out of 5 explained "No doubt, Mahesh is the cynosure of the movie, shouldering the entire responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-khaleja-review-review-telugu-14958111.html |title=Movie Review:Mahesh Khaleja- Review |publisher=Sify.com |accessdate=4 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723072603/http://www.sify.com/movies/mahesh-khaleja-review-review-telugu-14958111.html|archivedate=23 July 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MSN]] rated 2.5 out of 5 and described the film as "just an above average venture", commenting, "''Mahesh Khaleja'' is worth a watch for Mahesh's strong screen presence and charisma. Mahesh carries off his role with elan and looks superb too. Anushka looks pretty but doesn't share a good on-screen chemistry with Mahesh. The first half of the film is dull. It does pick up pace in the second half but the narration is inconsistent and tedious. The climax is little better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.in.msn.com/southcinema/reviews/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4450135&amp;page=2 |title=Watch 'Mahesh Khaleja' for Mahesh Babu's charisma – 2 – Reviews &amp;#124; South Cinema &amp;#124; MSN India Entertainment |publisher=Entertainment.in.msn.com |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019173456/http://entertainment.in.msn.com/southcinema/reviews/article.aspx?cp-documentid=4450135&amp;page=2|archivedate=19 October 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rediff]] gave a 2.5 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/07/south-mahesh-khaleja-review.htm |title=Mahesh Khaleja: Mahesh Babu's show all the way – Rediff.com Movies |publisher=Movies.rediff.com |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN-IBN]] gave a negative review stating "The movie is all about Mahesh Babu and he occupies almost every frame in the movie. Back after a gap of 4 years, Mahesh looks great with stylish costumes. The movie deals with a serious theme but director Trivikram Srinivas mixes it with a lot of unnecessary situational comedy which dilutes the intensity of the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/telugu-review-khaleja-fails-to-pack-a-punch/132981-47-79.html |title=Telugu Review: Khaleja fails to pack a punch – Reviews – Telugu reviews – ibnlive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kurt Aland''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|FBA|size=100%}} (28 March 1915 – 13 April 1994) was a [[Germany|German]] theologian and [[Biblical studies|biblical scholar]] who specialized in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism]]. He founded the ''[[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]]'' (Institute for New Testament Textual Research) in [[Münster]] and served as its first director from 1959–83. He was one of the principal editors of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|Nestle-Aland – Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' for the [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] and ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|The Greek New Testament]]'' for the [[United Bible Societies]].

== Life ==

Aland was born in [[Berlin]]-[[Steglitz]]. He started studying theology in 1933 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in Berlin (he also studied philology, archaeology, and history). On 23 March that year he was examined before the ''Bruderrat'' (council of brothers) in the ''[[Bekennende Kirche]]'' (Confessing Church). During his studies, he worked for the journal of the Confessing Church, ''Junge Kirche'' (Young Church). In an ideological brochure, ''Wer fälscht?'' (Who is lying?), written against [[Mathilde Ludendorff]], he confirmed the position of the Confessing Church and identified with them. In 1939 he studied for his bachelor's degree under the guidance of [[Hans Lietzmann]]. In 1940 he was released from military service; and in 1941, after Lietzmann's death, he took over the responsibilities of editing the ''Theologische Literaturzeitung'' (the only German theological magazine at that time). He graduated that same year, and in 1944 was ordained as minister of the parish of [[Berlin-Steglitz]].

After [[World War II]], Aland became a lecturer on the theological faculty of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. In 1947 he was appointed professor ordinarius in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle (Saale)]].

Aland disapproved of the Marxist government of [[East Germany]], and was persecuted as a result. In 1953 he was accused of smuggling watches to [[West Berlin]] and was kept under arrest for three months. Aland frequently spoke out against various forms of state oppression directed at churches and also demanded freedom of speech in East Germany. In July 1958, he lost his job at the university. However, in September of that year, he successfully escaped to West Berlin. His 8000-volume library was incorporated into the University Library.

In 1958 he became a professor at the [[University of Münster]], Germany. Aland rejected a professorship of the [[University of Chicago]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;''Kurt Aland - In Memoriam'', 1995, p. 15'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Archive of the University of Münster/Germany''&lt;/ref&gt; In Münster he founded the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] ("Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung") in 1959, which he directed until 1983. Furthermore, he founded the world's first "[[Bible Museum Münster|Bible Museum]]" in 1979, which was unique in the world for many years. His institute achieved worldwide recognition by publishing the ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|Nestle-Aland - Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' and ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece#Editions|The Greek New Testament]]'' for the [[United Bible Societies]].

Aland was married twice. His first marriage was to Ingeborg Aland (they had three children together). In 1972 he married [[Barbara Aland]]. He died in [[Münster (Westfalen)|Münster]], [[Germany]] in 1994.

Kurt Aland was representative of increasing specialism within theological-historical studies.&lt;ref name= "odin"&gt;{{Citation | first = Karl-Alfred | last = Odin | contribution = Entdecker und Wissenschaftorganisator von hohen Gnaden | title = Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung | date = 28 March 1985 | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of New Testament research, his work (and also the work that he did together with his wife [[Barbara Aland]] in the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in Münster) is internationally acclaimed.

The focus of his work began as an intense and adventurous search for old manuscripts on several expeditions to abbeys in Russia and Greece (amongst others). He discovered numerous manuscripts of the New Testament, whose evaluation is still in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | format = [[Portable document format|PDF]] | URL = http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Reden/DE/Horst-Koehler/Reden/2009/12/20091209_Rede2_Anlage.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2 | title = Speech of the President of Germany | first = Horst | last = Köhler | date = 2009-12-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most notable among his work was the newly arranged edition of ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' (Greek New Testament) in 1979 (also called Nestle-Aland).&lt;ref name= "odin" /&gt; This textual foundation for the New Testament exemplifies a scholarly mentality aimed at achieving the highest possible convergence with the "original text."

Furthermore, he acted in the Hermann-Kunst-Stiftung, which was founded in 1964 by Hermann Kunst, a good friend of Aland. Many important figures within politics and economics participated in the sponsorship of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]].

Another priority in his life was church history, being concerned with the early church, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and movements such as [[pietism]] and revivalism.

Aland received critical acclaim for his profundity and comprehensive knowledge of the textual sources for the New Testament. His contemporary presence is relevant, having contributed to modern scientific methodology.&lt;ref name= "odin"/&gt; Aland was of the opinion that every work within historical research stands on its adherence to reliability and accessibility.

The archives (''[[Nachlass]]'') of Kurt Aland are provided in the University Archives of the [[University of Münster]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Uni Münster | language = de | URL = http://www.uni-muenster.de/Archiv/jahresbericht2014.html | title = Jahresbericht | year = 2014}}.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Language exposure''' is the act of making language readily available to children during the critical early years of [[language learning]]. The theory of the [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]] for language exposure states that there is a certain window where children are able to and must learn a [[first language]], or multiple languages.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This exposure allows the brain to fully develop linguistic skills and leads to [[language fluency]] and [[language comprehension|comprehension]] later in life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Mayberry, Rachel I. "Early language acquisition and adult language ability: What sign language reveals about the critical."&amp;nbsp;The Oxford handbook of deaf studies, language, and education&amp;nbsp;2 (2010): 281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Much of the research on language exposure, the critical period, and [[language acquisition]] are based on spoken languages and children who are hearing. In reality, these same ideas translate to deaf children as well. Language exposure is essential during the critical period for language acquisition for all children. Deaf children tend to face more hardships when it comes to ensuring that they will receive this input of language in formative years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Language and development==
[[American Sign Language]] has only fairly recently been recognized as an official language. This recognition came about with research done around the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&amp;sid=991858|title=LibGuides. Sign Language. ASL: Academic acceptance and official recognition.|last=Henry|first=Sarah Hamrick, Laura Jacobi, Patrick Oberholtzer, Elizabeth|website=libguides.gallaudet.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; that proved that signed languages are in fact technical languages, with structure and [[grammar]] to match that of spoken language.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Meier, Richard P. "Language acquisition by deaf children."&amp;nbsp;American Scientist&amp;nbsp;79.1 (1991): 60-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, manual and verbal languages are all indeed full languages, with common properties like [[syntax]] and grammar. They both also use the same area of the brain in the [[left hemisphere]]. For years it was known that the left hemisphere dealt with speech, but now it is specifically the details of language organization that seem to be processed here.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Petitto, Laura Ann, et al. "Speech-like cerebral activity in profoundly deaf people processing signed languages: implications for the neural basis of human language."&amp;nbsp;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&amp;nbsp;97.25 (2000): 13961-13966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deaf brain develops at the same rate as the hearing brain when learning language. Deaf babies [[Babbling|babble]] on their hands the same way hearing babies babble with their mouths,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and they acquire language in the same timeframe. This is true neurologically and behaviorally. In both areas they hit the same milestones around the same times.

Developments other than linguistic development, such as [[cognitive development]]s, actually develop independent of whether or not the deaf child is exposed to, learns, or develops language at all. Deaf children's bodies and minds develop normally outside of language ability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mayberry, Rachel I. "Cognitive development in deaf children: The interface of language and perception in neuropsychology."&amp;nbsp;''Handbook of neuropsychology''&amp;nbsp;8.Part II (2002): 71-107.
&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the lack of exposure to language, although independent of other developmental processes, is a problem for many deaf children, as language development is still crucial. Deaf children are an at-risk population for not receiving language during the critical period for learning language. This can be due to schooling options, their parent's inability to communicate, or lack of continuous and unlimited exposure to [[sign language]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Humphries, Tom, et al. "Ensuring language acquisition for deaf children: What linguists can do."&amp;nbsp;Language&amp;nbsp;90.2 (2014): e31-e52.&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive, neurological, and regular development of children who happen to be deaf is completely normal. It is only that their access to an input language that is much more limited in comparison to a child learning a spoken language. This is due to the mainly hearing world we live in. However, if deaf children do receive that language acquisition during the critical period of language learning in the way that they're supposed to, the [[sensory loss]] of not being able to hear is not debilitating or harmful to their development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Providing language exposure ==
=== From birth ===

About 90% of deaf or hard of hearing children are born to hearing parents. Only 10% are born to deaf parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing|title=Quick Statistics About Hearing|date=2015-08-18|work=NIDCD|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore only about 10% of deaf children have language exposure in their natural form of communication, without restriction, from birth. When a child is born deaf or hard of hearing, there are newborn hearing [[Newborn screening|screening]] practices that inform the parents whether or not the baby has [[hearing loss]] within the first few weeks after the baby is born. If a baby is diagnosed with hearing loss, hospitals usually provide access to a team that includes primary care physicians, audiologists, and other health care providers to help the family decide which path is most appropriate for their family or their child to ensure that the baby develops normally with language. However, some physicians report that they aren't confident about informing the parents of children who have hearing loss about the potential choices for their child&lt;ref&gt;Moeller, Mary Pat; Karl R. White; and Lenore Shisler. 2006. Primary care physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to newborn hearing screening. Pediatrics 118.1357–70.&lt;/ref&gt; other than just referring them to an audiologist. Based on that, there seems to be a lack of knowledge and education about the Deaf community for physicians and families alike.  

=== Cochlear implants and exposure ===

Many doctors recommend families with babies diagnosed with hearing loss see an [[audiologist]]. On one hand, people view this referral as an attempt to fix the pathological problem of hearing loss. On the other hand, some people view the referral and denial of allowing the baby to stay deaf as an intrusion on the child's potential life in the Deaf community. This is because audiologists specializes in the perception of sound. This could lead to ignoring the possibility that the child just may need someone to help them thrive in the Deaf community. Recently, there has been heated debate over research on [[cochlear implant]]s. This surgery is a common recommendation for children born deaf or hard of hearing, in order to attempt to get the child to hear, understand, and use spoken language rather than sign language. The debate mostly centers around the view that deafness is a problem that needs to be fixed. Members of the Deaf community, proud of their culture and language, see this as an insult and excessive means of forced conformity to the hearing world. Others view it as a very real possibility to open doors and give children the opportunity to function with more accessibility in a hearing society. In regards to language exposure, there has been recent research&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Karl R.|last2=Cooper|first2=Louis Z.|date=2017-07-01|title=Opportunities and Shared Decision-Making to Help Children Who Are Deaf to Communicate|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/140/1/e20171287|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=140|issue=1|pages=e20171287|doi=10.1542/peds.2017-1287|issn=0031-4005}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that when given a cochlear implant, a child's use of only spoken language leads to higher intellectual development results in comparison to children who mix spoken language learning with sign language as well. However, this research&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; does note that they haven't studied children of parents who use sign language fluently, and give their child unlimited exposure to sign. 

=== Grade school ===

Unlimited language exposure includes having education options available in one's own language. The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] states that a public education should be provided to each child with a disability in the "least restrictive environment" for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor65310|title=A Guide to Disability Rights Laws|website=www.ada.gov|access-date=2017-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a broad statement, this is up to interpretation. Often this means that children with hearing loss get access to public schools with an interpreter. The qualifications of this interpreter are required, but since they are not stated specifically, usually [[K-12]] interpreters aren't the most qualified to be teaching a child, as those qualifications mean those interpreters are more expensive for schools to provide. Additionally, going to a public school that is a majority of hearing students isolates the deaf child and does not provide unlimited access to their language. There are few schools that teach all in sign language, such as [[The Learning Center for the Deaf]] in Framingham, MA. Other deaf schools may teach in an [[oralist]] method, prohibiting signing and focusing only on speech, a [[Total Communication|total communication]] method, with a [[Contact sign|pidgin sign language]] accompanying a speaking teacher, also known as [[simultaneous communication]], and a [[bilingual]] approach that includes both sign and speech, but in a separated way.&lt;ref&gt;Gascon-Ramos, M. (2008). Wellbeing in deaf children: A framework of understanding.&amp;nbsp;''Educational &amp; Child Psychology'',&amp;nbsp;''25''(2), 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later language ability ==
There has been other research&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; done about fluent sign language users and their ability to pick up spoken language later in life. The results show that sign language as a first language produces equal language skills later on in life, whether it be reading, learning a second language, or basic linguistic skills, as long as it is learned in the critical period of language acquisition. 

Additionally, learning sign language alongside another language has been proven to produce the same development as a bilingual child who learns two spoken languages.&lt;ref&gt;Petitto, Laura Ann, et al. "Bilingual signed and spoken language acquisition from birth: Implications for the mechanisms underlying early bilingual language acquisition."&amp;nbsp;Journal of child language&amp;nbsp;28.2 (2001): 453-496.&lt;/ref&gt; This furthers the idea that exposing a child to sign language is comparable to exposing a child to spoken language. Again, the criteria for both of these languages being that they are learned during the critical period and with full exposure to learn the language fluently. When any language is learned in this way, language development is the same across the board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20488">[[File:Hierarchical Model Mental Lexicon.png|thumb|right|280px|Adapted from the Hierarchical Model of Collins and Quillian (1969)]]

The '''mental lexicon''' is defined as a mental dictionary that contains information regarding a word's meaning, pronunciation, syntactic characteristics, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackendoff|first=R.S|title=Foundations of Language: Brain, Meaning, Grammar, and Evolution|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mental lexicon is a construct used in [[linguistics]] and [[psycholinguistics]] to refer to individual speakers' lexical, or word, [[Mental representation|representations]]. However, not all scientists agree as to the utility of the mental lexicon as a scientific construct.

The mental lexicon differs from the [[lexicon]] in that it is not just a general collection of words; instead, it deals with how those words are activated, stored, processed, and retrieved by each speaker. An individual's mental lexicon changes and grows as new words are learned and is always developing, but there are several theorists that argue exactly how this occurs. Some theories about the mental lexicon include the spectrum theory, the [[dual-coding theory]], [[Chomsky]]'s [[Universal grammar|nativist theory]], as well as the semantic network theory. Scientists also study the areas of the brain involved in lexical representations. The following addresses some of the physiological, social, and linguistic aspects of the mental lexicon.

Recent studies have also shown the possibility that the mental lexicon can shrink as an individual ages, limiting the number of words they can remember and learn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima,|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time.|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology|year=2010|volume=25|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of a second mental lexicon (L2) in bilingual speakers has also emerged as a topic of interest, suggesting that a speaker's multiple languages are not stored together, but as separate entities that are actively chosen from in each linguistic situation.&lt;ref name=jiang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Nan|title=Lexical Representation and Development in a Second Language|journal=Applied Linguistics|year=2000|volume=21|pages=47–77|doi=10.1093/applin/21.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of inquiry==
Although the mental lexicon is often called a mental "dictionary", in actuality, research suggests that it differs greatly from a dictionary. For example, the mental lexicon is not organized alphabetically like a dictionary; rather, it seems to be organized in a more complex manner, with links between phonologically and semantically related lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Jean"&gt;{{cite book | author = Aitchison, Jean | title = Words in the Mind: An Introduction to the Mental Lexicon | location = Malden, MA | publisher = Blackwell | year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is suggested by evidence of phenomena such as [[slips of the tongue]], which showed that replacing words such as ''anecdote'' for ''antidote''.&lt;ref name = "Jean"/&gt;

Also, while dictionaries contain a fixed number of words to be counted, and remain outdated as language is continually changing, the mental lexicon consistently updates itself with new words and word meanings, while getting rid of old, unused words. The active nature of the mental lexicon makes any dictionary comparison unhelpful.&lt;ref name = "CLA"&gt;{{cite book | title = Contemporary Linguistic Analysis (5th Custom Edition for U of A) | publisher = Pearson Custom Publishing | location = Toronto, ON | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research is continuing to identify the exact way that words are linked and accessed. A common method to analyze these connections is through a [[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]  task.&lt;ref name="CLA"/&gt;

'''Lexical Decision Tasks''' have been used for many years to access how the mental lexicon is structured. Participants in this task are required to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to a string of letters presented on a screen to say if the string is a non-word or a real word.&lt;ref name=altman&gt;{{cite book|last=Altman|first=Gerry|title=The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0198523777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reaction times from this task indicate that certain words are more "active" in participants' minds after related words have been presented. An example of this would be to present the word "bread" to the participant and then see an decreased reaction time later to the word "butter". Since the word "bread" had activated all related words, including "butter", this decreased reaction time demonstrates that related words are stored closely in the mental lexicon.&lt;ref name=altman /&gt; By doing lexical decision tasks, researchers have been able to analyze what words are stored with what related counterparts, and what can activate these words.

==Theories and perspectives==
Not all linguists and psychologists believe in the mental lexicon's existence and there is much controversy over the concept. One theory about the mental lexicon states that it organizes our knowledge about words "in some sort of dictionary."&lt;ref name="Access"&gt;{{ cite book | title = Accessing the Mental Lexicon | url = http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090807014649/http://homepage.mac.com/gerry_altmann/babel/assets/Chapter-6.pdf | archivedate = 2009-08-07 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another states that the mental lexicon is "a collection of highly complex neural circuits".&lt;ref name = "Access"/&gt; The latter, '''Semantic Network Theory''', proposes the idea of ''spreading activation'', which is a hypothetical mental process that takes place when one of the nodes in the semantic network is activated, and proposes three ways this is done: priming effects, neighborhood effects, and frequency effects, which have all been studied in depth over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Kenneth|author2=Chambers|title=Lexical Access and Naming Time|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=627–635|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(73)80042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marslen-Wilson|first=William|title=Functional Parallelism in Spoken Word-Recognition|journal=Cognition|date=March 1987|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=71–102|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(87)90005-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Priming''' is a term used in Lexical Decision Tasks that accounts for decreased reaction times of related words. Interchangeable with the word "activation" in many cases, priming refers to the ability to have related words assist in the reaction times of others. In the example above, the word bread "primed" butter to be retrieved quicker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Traxler|first=Matthew|title=Introduction to Psycholinguistics: Understanding Language Science|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405198621}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Neighborhood Effects''' refer to the activation of all similar "neighbors" of a target word. Neighbors are defined as items that are highly confusable with the target word due to overlapping features of other words. An example of this would be that the word "game" has the neighbors "came, dame, fame, lame, name, same, tame, gale, gape, gate, and gave," giving it a neighborhood size of 11 because 11 new words can be constructed by only changing 1 letter of "game". The neighborhood effect claims that words with larger neighborhood sizes will have quicker reaction times in a lexical decision task suggesting that neighbors facilitate the activation of other neighborhood words.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Sally|title=Frequency and Neighborhood Effects on Lexical Access: Activation or Search?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=September 1989|volume=15|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.15.5.802|pages=802–814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Frequency Effects''' suggest that words that are frequent in an individual's language are recognized faster than words that are infrequent. Forster and Chambers, 1973, found that high frequency words were named faster than low frequency ones, and Whaley, 1978 found that high frequency words were responded to faster than low frequency ones in a lexical decision task.&lt;ref name="Access"/&gt;

In the '''spectrum theory''', at one end "each phonological form is connected to one complex semantic representation", at the opposite end, homonyms and polysemes have their "own semantic representation[s]".&lt;ref name = "Brown"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brown, S. W | title = Polysemy in the Mental Lexicon. Colorado Research in Linguistics | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | year = 2008 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ling/CRIL/Volume21_Issue1/paper_BROWN.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The middle of the spectrum contains the theories that "suggest that related senses share a general or core semantic representation".&lt;ref name = "Brown"/&gt; The "[[dual coding theory]] (DCT)"&lt;ref name = "Paivio"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paivio, A | title = Dual coding theory and the mental lexicon | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 205–230 | year = 2010 | doi=10.1075/ml.5.2.04pai}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts multiple and [[common coding theory|common coding theories]]. DCT is "an internalized nonverbal system that directly represents the perceptual properties and affordances of nonverbal objects and events, and an internalized verbal system that deals directly with linguistic stimuli and responses".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt; Similarly, we do not observe words "as elements in a data structure" that are "retrieved from memory, but rather as stimuli that alter mental states".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Elman, J. L | title = Lexical knowledge without a lexicon? | journal = The Mental Lexicon | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–33 | year = 2011 | doi=10.1075/ml.6.1.01elm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others work around Chomsky's theory that "all syntactic and semantic features are included directly in the abstract mental representation of a lexical word".&lt;ref name = "Paivio"/&gt;

==Development==

=== First language development ===
[[File:Chart updated.jpg|thumb|Average vocabulary size of an English-speaking child by age.]]One aspect of research on the development of the mental lexicon has focused on vocabulary growth. Converging research suggests that at least English children learn several words a day throughout development. The figure at left illustrates the growth curve of a typical English-speaking child's vocabulary size.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;

The words acquired in the early stages of language development tend to be nouns or nounlike, and there are some similarities in first words across children (e.g., ''mama, daddy, dog'').&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt; [[Fast mapping]] is the idea that children may be able to gain at least partial information about the meaning of a word from how it is used in a sentence, what words it is contrasted with, as well as other factors. This allows the child to quickly hypothesize about the meaning of a word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heibeck|first=Tracy|author2=Ellen M. Markman|title=Word Learning in Children: An Examination of Fast Mapping|journal=Child Development|year=1987|volume=58|pages=1021–1034|doi=10.2307/1130543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that, despite the [[fast mapping]] hypothesis, words are not just learned as soon as we are exposed to them, each word needs some type of activation and/or acknowledgement before it is permanently and effectively stored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= G.A |year= 1986|title= Dictionaries in the mind |journal= Language and Cognitive Processes |volume= 1|issue=3 |pages=171–185 |doi=10.1080/01690968608407059}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the word may be accurately stored in their mental lexicon, and they can recognize when an adult produces the incorrect version of the word, but they may not be able to produce the word accurately.&lt;ref name = "CLA"/&gt;{{Clear}}

As a child acquires their vocabulary, two separate aspects of the mental lexicon develop named the [[lexeme]] and the [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]].&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt; The lexeme is defined as the part of the mental lexicon that stores morphological and formal information about a word, such as the different versions of spelling and pronunciation of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levelt | first=Willem| authorlink = Willem Levelt | title=Accessing Words in Speech Production: Stages, Processes and Representations|journal=Cognition|year=1992|volume=42|issue=1–3|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(92)90038-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lemma is defined as the structure within the mental lexicon that stores semantic and syntactic information about a word, such as part of speech and the meaning of the word. Research has shown that the lemma develops first when a word is acquired into a child's vocabulary, and then with repeated exposure the lexeme develops.&lt;ref name=jiang /&gt;

[[File:Structure of a lexical entry.png|thumb|The Internal Structure of a Lexical Entry (adapted from [[Willem Levelt|Levelt]] 1989).]]

=== Bilingual development ===

The development of the mental lexicon in bilingual children has increased in research over recent years, and has shown many complexities including the notion that bilingual speakers contain additional and separate mental lexicons for their other languages. Selecting between two or more different lexicons has shown to have benefits extending past language processes. Bilinguals significantly outperform their monolingual counterparts on executive control tasks. Researchers suggest that this enhanced cognitive ability comes from continually choosing between L1 and L2 mental lexicons.&lt;ref name=bia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bialystok|first=Ellen|title=Reshaping the Mind: The Benefits of Bilingualism|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2011|volume=65|issue=4|pages=229–235|doi=10.1037/a0025406|pmc=4341987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilinguals have also shown resilience against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, monolinguals being an average of 71.4 years old and the bilinguals 75.5 years old when symptoms of dementia were detected, a difference of 4.1 years.&lt;ref name=bia /&gt;

==Brain==
Studies have shown that the [[temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe|parietal]] lobes in the left hemisphere are particularly relevant for the processing of lexical items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pulvermüller, F. | title = Nouns and verbs in the intact brain: Evidence from event-related potentials and high-frequency cortical responses | journal = Tübingen: Oxford Journals | volume = 9 | pages = 497–506 | year = 1999 | doi=10.1093/cercor/9.5.497}} http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/5/497.short&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are some hypotheses pertaining to semantic comprehension in the brain:

# '''Organized Unitary Content Hypothesis (OUCH):''' this hypothesis posits that lexical items that co-occur with high frequency are stored in the same area in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adorni, R. |author2=Proverbio, A. | title = New insights into name category-related effects: is the age of acquisition a possible factor? | journal = Milan: BioMed Central | volume = 5 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmc=2726156 | pmid=19640289 | doi=10.1186/1744-9081-5-33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Domain-Specific Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis uses the theory of evolution to posit that certain categories that have an evolutionary advantage over others (such as useful items like tools) have their specialized and functionally dissociated neural circuits in the brain.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;
# '''Sensory/Functional Hypothesis:''' this hypothesis posits that the ability to identify (i.e. be able to recognize and name) living things depends on visual information, while the ability to identify non-living things depends on functional information. Thus this hypothesis implies that modality-specific subsystems compose an overarching semantic network of lexical items.&lt;ref name = "Adorni"/&gt;

==Impaired access ==

[[Anomic aphasia]], [[aphasia]] ([[expressive aphasia|expressive]] + [[receptive aphasia]]) and [[Alzheimer's disease]] can all affect recalling or retrieving words.  Anomia renders a person completely unable to name familiar objects, places and people,&lt;ref name = "Speech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speech-therapy-on-video.com/receptiveaphasia.html |title=Improving Receptive Aphasia: Your Source of Information and solutions |publisher=Speech-therapy-on-video.com |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a involves specific naming difficulties; sufferers of anomia have difficulties recalling words.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Anomia is a lesser level of dysfunction, a severe form of the "tip-of-the-tongue" phenomenon where the brain cannot recall the desired word.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Stroke, head trauma and brain tumors can cause anomia.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt;

Expressive and receptive aphasia are neurological language disorders.&lt;ref name = "Diseases"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alldiseases.org/what-is-a-dysnomia/ |title=What Is A Dysnomia? |publisher=Alldiseases.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressive aphasia limits the ability to convey thoughts through the use of speech, language or writing.&lt;ref name = "Speech"/&gt; Receptive aphasia affects a person's ability to comprehend spoken words, causing disordered sentences that have little or no meaning and which can include addition of [[nonce words]].&lt;ref name = "Diseases"/&gt;

Harry Whitaker states that Alzheimer's disease patients are forgetful of proper names. Patients have difficulty generating names, especially with phonological tasks such as words starting with a certain letter.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"&gt;{{cite book | author = Whitaker, Harry A | title = Concise Encyclopedia of Brain and Language  | chapter =  Alzheimer's Disease | pages = 19–22| location = Oxford, UK: Elsevier Ltd | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also have word-retrieval difficulties in spontaneous speech but still have relatively preserved naming of presented stimuli.&lt;ref name = "Whitaker"/&gt; Later, loss of naming of low-frequency lexical items occurs. Eventually, the loss of ability to comprehend and name the same lexical item indicates semantic loss of the lexical item.

== Shrinking ==

The majority of current research focuses on the acquisition and functioning of the mental lexicon, without much focus on what happens to the mental lexicon over time. Current studies suggest that as individuals age, they become less capable of storing and remembering words indicating that their "mental dictionary" is, in fact, shrinking. One study showed that the size of a Japanese woman's healthy mental lexicon of kanji shrank at a rate of approximately 1% per year between ages 83 and 93 on average. This was tested through a simple naming task once when the subject was 83, and then again at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takashima|first=H|author2=J Yamada|title=Shrinkage of the mental lexicon of Kanji in an elderly Japanese woman: The effect of a 10-year passage of time |year=2010|volume=25|issue=1|pages=105–115|doi=10.1007/s10823-009-9106-x|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other considerations==

===Storage of acronyms===

As research on the mental lexicon continues to expand into our modern world of abbreviations, researchers have begun to question whether the mental lexicon has the capacity to store acronyms as well as words. Using a lexical decision task with acronyms as priming words, researchers saw that acronyms could in fact prime other related information. This finding suggests that acronyms are stored alongside their related information in the mental lexicon just as a word would be. Research also demonstrated that these acronyms would still prime related information despite inaccurate capitalization (i.e. bbc had the same priming effects as BBC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brysbaert|first=M|author2=S Speybroeck |author3=D Vanderelst |title=Is there room for the BBC in the mental lexicon? On the recognition of acronyms.|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2009|volume=62|issue=9|pages=1832–1842|doi=10.1080/17470210802585471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oswald Mathias Ungers''' (12 July 1926 &amp;ndash; 30 September 2007) was a German [[architect]] and [[architectural theory|architectural theorist]], known for his [[rationalism (architecture)|rationalist]] designs and the use of cubic forms. Among his notable projects are museums in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne.

==Biography==
Oswald Mathias Ungers was born in [[Kaisersesch]] in the [[Eifel]] region. From 1947 to 1950 he studied architecture at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)|University of Karlsruhe]] under [[Egon Eiermann]]. He set up an architectural practice in [[Cologne]] in 1950, and opened offices in [[Berlin]] in 1964, [[Frankfurt]] in 1974 and [[Karlsruhe]] in 1983.

He was a professor at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] from 1963 to 1967 and served as the dean of the faculty of architecture from 1965 to 1967. In 1968 he moved to the United States, where he became the chair of the department of architecture at [[Cornell University]] from 1969 to 1975. In 1971 he became a member of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. He was also a visiting professor at [[Harvard University]] (1973 and 1978) and the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (1974/75). He returned to Germany in 1976, becoming a visiting professor at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] (1979/80) and a full professor at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] (1986).

Oswald Mathias Ungers died on 30 September 2007 from [[pneumonia]]. He was married to Liselotte Gabler (1926–2010) and had one son ([[Simon Ungers]]) and two daughters.

'''Petroleum engineering''' is a field of [[engineering]] concerned with the activities related to the production of [[hydrocarbons]], which can be either [[crude oil]] or [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="pet eng 2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm#tab-2|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the [[Upstream (oil industry)|''upstream'']] sector of the oil and gas industry. [[Hydrocarbon exploration|Exploration]], by earth scientists, and petroleum engineering are the oil and gas industry's two main subsurface disciplines, which focus on maximizing economic recovery of hydrocarbons from subsurface reservoirs. [[Petroleum geology]] and [[geophysics]] focus on provision of a static description of the hydrocarbon reservoir rock, while petroleum engineering focuses on estimation of the recoverable volume of this resource using a detailed understanding of the physical behavior of oil, water and gas within porous rock at very high pressure.

The combined efforts of geologists and petroleum engineers throughout the life of a hydrocarbon accumulation determine the way in which a reservoir is developed and depleted, and usually they have the highest impact on field economics. Petroleum engineering requires a good knowledge of many other related disciplines, such as geophysics, petroleum geology, [[formation evaluation]] ([[well logging]]), [[drilling]], [[economics]], [[reservoir simulation]], [[reservoir engineering]], well engineering, [[artificial lift]] systems, completions and [[petroleum production engineering]].

Recruitment to the industry has historically been from the disciplines of physics, chemical engineering and mining engineering. Subsequent development training has usually been done within oil companies.

== Overview ==
The profession got its start in 1914 within the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers]] (AIME). The first Petroleum Engineering degree was conferred in 1915 by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petroleum Engineering|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454409/petroleum-engineering#toc64689|publisher=Britannica|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the profession has evolved to solve increasingly difficult situations. Improvements in computer modeling, materials and the application of statistics, probability analysis, and new technologies like [[horizontal drilling]] and [[enhanced oil recovery]], have drastically improved the toolbox of the petroleum engineer in recent decades. Automation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/topics/?topic=14|title=Drilling Automation|last=|first=|date=December 14, 2017|website=Journal of Petroleum Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; sensors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=2295|title=JPT Flow Sensor Technology Seeks to Replace the Coriolis Meter|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and robots&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=2313|title=JPT Competing Companies Building Robots to Place Receivers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spe.org/en/jpt/jpt-article-detail/?art=3209|title=JPT Robot Removes Operators From Extreme Environments|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; are being used to propel the industry to more efficiency and safety. 

Deep-water, arctic and desert conditions are usually contended with. High temperature and high pressure (HTHP) environments have become increasingly commonplace in operations and require the petroleum engineer to be savvy in topics as wide-ranging as thermo-hydraulics, geomechanics, and intelligent systems.

The [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) is the largest [[professional society]] for petroleum engineers and publishes much technical information and other resources to support the oil and gas industry. It provides free online education (webinars), mentoring, and access to SPE Connect, an exclusive platform for members to discuss technical issues, best practices, and other topics. SPE members also are able to access the SPE Competency Management Tool to find knowledge and skill strengths and opportunities for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/memberbasics/documents/ResourceGuide.pdf|title=SPE Member Resource Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE publishes peer-reviewed journals, books, and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/publications/|title=Publications {{!}} The Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE members receive a complimentary subscription to the ''Journal of Petroleum Technology'' and discounts on SPE's other publications.&lt;ref name="spe benefits"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/members/benefits.php|title=Professional Membership Benefits {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPE members also receive discounts on registration fees for SPE organized events and training courses.&lt;ref name="spe benefits"/&gt; SPE provides scholarships and fellowships to undergraduate and graduate students. 

According to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statics, petroleum engineers are required to have a bachelor's degree in engineering, generally a degree focused on petroleum engineering is preferred, but degrees in mechanical, chemical, and civil engineering are satisfactory as well.&lt;ref name="pet eng"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petroleum engineering education is available at many universities in the [[United States]] and throughout the world - primarily in oil producing regions.

=== Petroleum engineering salaries ===
Petroleum engineering has historically been one of the highest paid engineering disciplines, although there is a tendency for mass layoffs when oil prices decline and waves of hiring as prices rise. SPE annually conducts a [[salary survey]]. In 2017, SPE reported that the average SPE professional member reported earning USD $194,649 (including salary and bonus), and the average base pay was USD $151,122.&lt;ref name="spe salary survey1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/oil-and-gas-salary-survey/|title=Oil and Gas Pay {{!}} Salary Survey {{!}} Society of Petroleum Engineers|website=www.spe.org|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average base pay reported in 2016 was $143,006.&lt;ref name="spe salary survey1"/&gt; Base pay and other compensation was on average was highest in the United States where the base pay was USD $174,283. Drilling and production engineers tended to make the best base pay, USD $160,026 for drilling engineers and USD $158,964 for production engineers. Base pay on average ranged from USD $96,382-174,283.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spe.org/industry/docs/2017-Salary-Survey-Highlight-Report.pdf|title=2017 SPE Membership Salary Survey Highlight Report-November 2017|last=|first=|date=January 3, 2018|website=Society of Petroleum Engineers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are still significant gender pay gaps, but in 2017 more than half of female respondents reported an increase in base pay received since 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2016, the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the median pay for petroleum engineers was USD $18,230, or roughly $61.65 per hour.&lt;ref name="pet eng"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pet eng 5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/petroleum-engineers.htm#tab-5|title=Petroleum Engineers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same summary projects that there will be 15% job growth in this field from 2016 to 2026.&lt;ref name="pet eng 5"/&gt; Also in 2016, ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' named petroleum engineering the top college major in terms of highest median annual wages of college-educated workers (age 25-59).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2016-05-17/top-10-college-majors-that-earn-the-highest-salaries|title=Top 10 College Majors That Earn the Highest Salaries|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2018|website=U.S. News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[National Association of Colleges and Employers]] survey showed petroleum engineers as the highest paid 2010 graduates, at an average annual salary of $125,220.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naceweb.org/Press/Releases/Top-Paid_Majors_Among_College_Class_of_2010_(3-11-10).aspx |title=NACE: |publisher=Naceweb.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For individuals with experience, salaries can range from $170,000 to $260,000. They make an average of $112,000 a year and about $53.75 per hour. In a 2007 article, Forbes.com reported that petroleum engineering was the 24th best paying job in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/06/04/jobs-careers-compensation-lead-careers-cx_pm_0604jobs.html |title=America's Best- And Worst-Paying Jobs |publisher=Forbes.com |date= 2007-06-04|accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Sub-disciplines ==
Petroleum engineers divide themselves into several types:&lt;ref name="pet eng 2"/&gt;
* [[Reservoir engineers]] work to optimize production of oil and gas via proper placement, production rates, and enhanced oil recovery techniques.
* [[Drilling engineering|Drilling engineers]] manage the technical aspects of drilling exploratory, production and injection wells.
* [[Subsurface engineer|Completion engineers]] (also known as subsurface engineers) work to design and oversee the implementation of techniques aimed at ensuring wells are drilled stably and with the maximum opportunity for oil and gas production. 
* [[Petroleum production engineering|Production engineers]] manage the interface between the reservoir and the well, including perforations, sand control, downhole flow control, and downhole monitoring equipment; evaluate [[artificial lift]] methods; and select surface equipment that separates the produced fluids (oil, natural gas, and water).

'''Popular history''' is a broad and somewhat ill-defined [[genre]] of [[historiography]] that takes a popular approach, aims at a wide readership, and usually emphasizes [[narrative]], [[Personality type|personality]] and vivid detail over scholarly analysis. The term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and, thus, less accessible to the general reader.

Some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics, or former academics, that have (according to one writer) "become somehow abstracted from the academic arena, becoming cultural commentators".&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, Jerome (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=hexpdOj8t80C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=%22popular+historian%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yvNFz2kvUh&amp;sig=io51iX8gENuqr0egzP2J9JpLwGM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZBSxSpqCKYmf8Qbh7MHCDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22popular%20historian%22&amp;f=false ''Consuming History: Historians and Heritage in Contemporary Popular Culture''], [[Routledge]], pg 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Many worked as journalists, perhaps after taking an initial degree in history.

Popular historians may become nationally renowned or best-selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as "public historians". Many authors of "official histories" and "authorized biographies" would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures.

Popular historians aim to appear on the "general lists" of general publishers, rather than the [[university press]]es that have dominated [[academic publishing]] in recent years. Increasingly, popular historians have taken to television where they are able, often accompanying a series of documentaries with a [[tie-in]] book.

==Examples==
Recent examples of American popular historians with academic affiliations include [[Stephen Ambrose]], [[Doris Kearns Goodwin]] and [[Pauline Maier]]. Non-academics include [[Bruce Catton]], [[Shelby Foote]], [[David McCullough]], [[Daniel Boorstin]] and [[Barbara Tuchman]].

Recent examples of British popular historians who are also academics include [[Niall Ferguson]], [[Christopher Hibbert]] and [[Simon Schama]], and – from a previous generation – [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], [[E. P. Thompson]], [[A. J. P. Taylor]] (an early pioneer of history on television) and [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]. Much of [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]'s output was also directed at a popular audience.

[[John Julius Norwich]], [[Nirad Chaudhuri]], [[Ramchandra Guha]], [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are popular historians who have never been academics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7578">'''Professional courtesy''' generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cji.edu/site/assets/files/1921/professionalcourtesy.pdf|title=Professional Courtesy Ethics in Policing|last=McVay|first=Jerold A.|date=2012-04-22|website=Crim. Justice Institute|publisher=Univ. of Arkansas|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.&lt;ref name="KBA"&gt;{{cite web| title = Code of Professional Courtesy| work = Kentucky Bar Association| url = http://www.kybar.org/Default.aspx?tabid=228| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medicine==
In 1803, [[Thomas Percival]] wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.

Among [[physician]]s, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members.&lt;ref name="ama"&gt;{{cite web| title = AMA Code of Medical Ethics, E-6.13, Professional Courtesy| work = | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?| accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jones, MD, PhD, MHA|first = James|last2 = McCullough, PhD|first2 = Laurence|last3 = Richman, MA|first3 = Bruce|date = 2004-05-01|title = Ethics of Professional Courtesy|url = http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(04)00144-2/pdf|journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume = 39|issue = 5|pages = 1140–1141|doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2004.01.035|pmid =|lay-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom dates back to [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;Rathbun, Katharine C., M.D.; Richards, Edward P. III, J.D.; ''Professional Courtesy''; Missouri Medicine; 1998;95:18-20; [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Articles/Professional_Courtesy.html (on-line)].&lt;/ref&gt; well before physicians reached middle-class income levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hawleytroxell.com/2011/12/professional-courtesy-problems/|title = Professional Courtesy Problems - Hawley Troxell - Health Law|last =|first =|date =|year = 2011|publisher = Hawley Troxell - Health Law|access-date = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?|title=Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 6.13 - Professional Courtesy|last=|first=|date=1994-06-01|website=American Medical Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law enforcement ==
The term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement "professional courtesy":

First, some states (such as [[California]]) issue "confidential [[Vehicle registration plate|plate]]s" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge.&lt;ref name = "Corrupt"&gt;{{cite web| title = Special license plates shield officials from traffic tickets| work = ocregister.com|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dmv-police-confidential-2011354-program-records | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy "discretion", and [[federal law]] assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.&lt;ref name = "DUI Cops"&gt;{{cite news| title = A broken system works in favor of cops busted for DUI| work = seattlepi.com|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/specials/undueinfluence/326446_dui06.html | accessdate = 2009-06-02| first1=Eric| last1=Nalder| first2=Lewis| last2=Kamb| first3=P-I| last3=Investigative| date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a "family card" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member.  Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way.&lt;ref name = "police"&gt;{{cite web| title = Professional Courtesy| work = NJLawman.com|url = http://njlawman.com/Feature%20Pieces/Professional%20Courtesy.htm| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leoprocards.com/|title=LEOProCards|work=|accessdate=2012-08-05}}http://leoprocards.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619001525/http://leoprocards.com/ |date=2012-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theater ==
Until the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity]] and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org AEA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This applies as well to ''bona fide'' producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.

'''Rae Linda Brown''' (1953 &amp;ndash; 2017) was an American [[musicologist]].

As a scholar, archivist and editor Rae Linda Brown conducted research on topics in [[American classical music]], [[Black Music]] and African-American classical music. Brown authored books and academic treatises on [[Florence Price]] and [[William Grant Still]]. As a professor and administrator Brown led in the creation of new academic programs at the [[University of California, Irvine]], [[Loyola Marymount University]], and [[Pacific Lutheran University]].

[[File:Abu Simbel main temple.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Abu Simbel temples|Great Temple of Abu Simbel]] (ca. 1280 BCE), one of the earliest examples of rock-cut architecture.]]
'''Rock-cut architecture''' is the creation of structures, buildings, and sculptures by excavating solid [[Rock (geology)|rock]] where it naturally occurs.  Rock-cut architecture is designed and made by man from the start to finish.  In India and China, the terms 'cave' and 'cavern' are often applied to this form of man-made architecture.  However, caves and caverns, that began in natural form, are not considered to be 'rock-cut architecture' even if extensively modified.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ching, [[Mark Jarzombek]], Vikramaditya Prakash, ''A Global History of Architecture'' (Wiley, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Although rock-cut structures differ from traditionally built structures in many ways, many rock-cut structures are made to replicate the facade or interior of traditional architectural forms. Interiors were usually carved out by starting at the roof of the planned space and then working downward. This technique prevents stones falling on workers below.  The three main uses of rock-cut architecture were [[temples]] (like those in [[Indian rock-cut architecture|India]]), [[tombs]] (like those in [[Petra]], [[Jordan]]) and cave dwellings (like those in [[Cappadocia]], [[Turkey]]).

Some rock-cut architecture, mostly for [[Rock-cut tombs|tombs]], is excavated entirely in chambers under the surface of relatively level rock. If the excavation is instead made into the side of a cliff or steep slope, there can be an impressive facade, as found in [[Lycia]]n tombs, Petra, [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and elsewhere.  The most laborious and impressive rock-cut architecture is the excavation of tall free-standing monolithic structures entirely below the surface level of the surrounding rock, in a large excavated hole around the structure. [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] in India and [[Monolithic church#Lalibela|Lalibela]] in [[Ethiopia]] (built by the [[Zagwe dynasty]]) provide the most spectacular and famous examples of such structures.

Rock-cut architecture, though intensely laborious with ancient tools and methods, was presumably combined with quarrying the rock for use elsewhere; the huge amounts of stone removed have normally vanished from the site.  Rock-cut architecture is also said to be cut, hewn, etc., "from the living rock".&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged'', under "living".&lt;/ref&gt;  Another term sometimes associated with rock-cut architecture is [[monolithic architecture]], which is rather applied to free-standing structures made of a single piece of material. Monolithic architecture is often rock-cut architecture (e.g. [[Ellora Kailasanathar Temple]]) but monolithic structures might be also cast of artificial material, e.g. [[concrete]].

The [[Gommateshwara statue]] ([[Bahubali]]), the largest monolithic statue in the world, at [[Shravanabelagola]], [[Karnataka]], India, was built in 983 AD and was carved from a large single block of granite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturalindia.net/monuments/gomateswara.html Statue of Gomateswara]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unbelievableinfo.com/2013/12/worlds-biggest-monolithic-statue.html World's biggest monolithic Statue]&lt;/ref&gt;  In many parts of the world there are also [[rock relief]]s, [[relief]] sculptures carved into rock faces, outside caves or at other sites.

==History==
[[Image:MidasSehri.Tomb.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Midas Monument]], a [[Phrygia]]n rock-cut tomb dedicated to [[Midas]] (700 BCE).]]
Ancient monuments of rock-cut architecture are widespread in several regions of world. Alteration of naturally formed caverns, although distinct from completely carved structures in the strict sense, date back to the neolithic period on several Mediterranean islands e.g. [[Malta]] ([[Hypogeum of Ħal-Saflieni]]), [[Sardinia]] (Anghelu Ruju, built between 3,000 and 1,500 BCE) and others.

Large-scale rock-cut structures were built in [[Ancient Egypt]]. Among these monuments was the Great Temple of [[Ramesses II]], known as [[Abu Simbel]], located along the Nile in [[Nubia]], near the borders of [[Sudan]] about 300 kilometers from [[Aswan]] in [[Egypt]]. It dates from about the [[19th Dynasty]] (ca. 1280&amp;nbsp;BCE), and consists of a monumentally scaled facade carved out of the cliff and a set of interior chambers that form its sanctuary.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Dodson. ''Egyptian Rock-Cut Tombs''. Shire Publications 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 8th century, the [[Phrygia]]ns started some of the earliest rock-cut monuments, such as the [[Midas monument]] (700 BCE), dedicated to the famous Phrygian king [[Midas]].&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Search84"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roller |first1=Lynn E. |title=In Search of God the Mother: The Cult of Anatolian Cybele |date=1999 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520919686 |pages=84-110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e9r2semlxPwC&amp;pg=PA84 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century BCE, the [[Lycians]], who inhabited southern Anatolia (now [[Turkey]]) built hundreds of [[rock-cut tombs]] of a similar type, but smaller in scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lycianturkey.com/lycian_tombs.htm Lycian tombs]&lt;/ref&gt; Excellent examples are to be found near [[Dalyan]], a town in Muğla Province, along the sheer cliffs that faces a river. Since these served as tombs rather than as religious sites, the interiors were usually small and unassuming. The ancient [[Etruscans]] of central Italy also left an important legacy of rock-cut architecture, mostly tombs, as those near the cities of [[Tarquinia]] and [[Vulci]].
[[File:Tomb of Avshalom in the Kidron Valley;.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Tomb of Absalom]] ([[Kidron Valley]]), with [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut lower half]]]]
The creation of [[rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel]] began in the 8th-century BCE and continued through the Byzantine period. The [[Tomb of Absalom]] was constructed in the 1st century AD in the [[Kidron Valley]] of [[Jerusalem]].

[[File:Lomas_Rishi_entrance.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lomas Rishi]], one of the first rock-cut caves in [[India]], 250 BCE.]]
Rock-cut architecture occupies a particularly important place in the history of Indian Architecture. The earliest instances of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], the [[Barabar caves]], date from about the 3rd to the 2nd century BCE. They were built by the [[Buddhist]] monks and consisted mostly of multi-storey buildings carved into the mountain face to contain living and sleeping quarters, kitchens, and monastic spaces.&lt;ref&gt;S.  Nagaraju ''Buddhist Architecture of Western India, c. 250&amp;nbsp;BC – AD&amp;nbsp;300'' (Agam Kala Prakashan, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these monastic caves had shrines in them to the Buddha, bodhisattvas and saints.&lt;ref&gt;Vidya  Dehejia,  ''Early Buddhist Rock Temples; a Chronology.'' (Cornell University Press, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt; As time progressed, the interiors became more elaborate and systemitized; surfaces were often decorated with paintings, such as those at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]]. At the beginning of the 7th century [[Hindu]] rock-cut temples began to be constructed at Ellora. Unlike most previous examples of rock-cut architecture which consisted of a facade plus an interior, these temples were complete three-dimensional buildings created by carving away the hillside. They required several generations of planning and coordination to complete. Other major examples of rock-cut architecture in India are at [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] and [[Pataleshwar]].

[[File:Petra Jordan BW 21.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Al Khazneh]]'' or the [[Treasury]] at Petra.]]
The [[Nabataeans]] in their city of [[Petra]], now in Jordan, extended the Western Asian tradition, carving their temples and tombs into the yellowish-orange rock that defines the canyons and gullies of the region. These structures, dating from 1st century BCE to about 2nd century CE, are particularly important in the history of architecture given their experimental forms.&lt;ref&gt;Rababeh, Shaher M. Rababeh,  ’’How Petra was Built: an Analysis of the Construction Techniques of the Nabataean Freestanding Buildings and Rock-cut Monuments in Petra, Jordan (Oxford, England: Archaeopress), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Here too, because the structures served as tombs, the interiors were rather perfunctory. In Petra one even finds a theater where the seats are cut out of the rock.

[[File:Longmen-grottoes-longmen-mountain-from-a-distance.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Mount Longmen as seen from Manshui Bridge to the southeast.]]
The technological skills associated with making these complex structures moved into China along the trade routes. The [[Longmen Grottoes]], the [[Mogao Caves]], and the [[Yungang Grottoes]] consist of hundreds of caves many with statues of Buddha in them. Most were built between 460–525 AD. There are extensive rock-cut buildings, including houses and churches in [[Cappadocia]], Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;Spiro  Kostof, ''Caves of God: the Monastic Environment of Byzantine Cappadocia'' (MIT Press, 1972). Vidya  Dehejia, (Cornell University Press,  1972)&lt;/ref&gt; They were built over a span of hundreds of years prior to the 5th century CE. Emphasis here was more on the interiors than the exteriors.

[[File:Bete_Giyorgis_Lalibela.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the 13 rock-hewn churches at [[Lalibela]], [[Ethiopia]], entirely cut out of the rock surface (c.1000 CE).]]
Another extensive site of rock-cut architecture is in [[Monolithic church#Lalibela|Lalibela]], a town in northern [[Ethiopia]]. The area contains numerous [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Orthodox churches]] in three dimensions, as at Ellora, that were carved out of the rock. These structures, which date from the 12th and 13th centuries CE and which are the last significant examples of this architectural form, ranks as among the most magnificent examples of rock-cut architecture in the world, with both interior and exterior brought to fruition.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

==Art ==
Ancient rock cut tombs, temples and monasteries often have been adorned with frescoes and reliefs. The high resistance of natural cliff, skilled use of plaster and constant microclimate often have helped to preserve this art in better condition than in conventional buildings. Such exceptional examples are the ancient and early medieval frescoes in such locations as [[Bamyan Buddhas|Bamyan Caves]] in Afghanistan with the most ancient known oil paintings in the world from 8th century AD, [[Ajanta Caves]] in India with well preserved [[tempera]] paintings from 2nd century BCE, Christian frescoes on [[Churches of Göreme, Turkey]] and numerous other monuments in Asia, Europe and Africa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4701">'''SQLf''' is a [[SQL]] extended with [[Fuzzy set|fuzzy set theory]] application for expressing flexible ([[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]]) queries to traditional (or ″Regular″) Relational Databases. Among the known extensions proposed to SQL, at the present time, this is the most complete, because it allows the use of diverse fuzzy elements in all the constructions of the language SQL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=SQLf: a relational database language for fuzzy querying|journal=IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems|date=1995|volume=3|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1109/91.366566|issn=1063-6706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=Knowledge Management in Fuzzy Databases|date=2000|publisher=Physica-Verlag HD|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-7908-1865-9|pages=171–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQLf is the only known proposal of flexible query system allowing linguistic quantification over set of rows in queries, achieved through the extension of SQL nesting and partitioning structures with fuzzy quantifiers. It also allows the use of quantifiers to qualify the quantity of search criteria satisfied by single rows. Several mechanisms are proposed for query evaluation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=SQLf Query Functionality on Top of a Regular Relational Database Management System|date=2000|pages=171–190|doi=10.1007/978-3-7908-1865-9_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most important being the one based on the derivation principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bosc|first1=P.|last2=Pivert|first2=O.|title=On the efficiency of the alpha-cut distribution method to evaluate simple fuzzy relational queries|journal=World Scientific Publishing|date=1995|pages=251–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consists in deriving classic queries that produce, given a threshold ''t'', a ''t''-cut of the result of the fuzzy query, so that the additional processing cost of using a fuzzy language is diminished.

== Basic block ==
The fundamental querying structure of SQLf is the multi-relational block. The conception of this structure is based on the three basic operations of the [[relational algebra]]: [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]], [[cartesian product]] and [[Selection (relational algebra)|selection]], and the application of fuzzy sets’ concepts. The result of a SQLf query is a fuzzy set of rows that is a fuzzy relation instead of a regular relation.
A basic block in SQLf consists of a &lt;code&gt;[[Select (SQL)|SELECT]]&lt;/code&gt; clause, a &lt;code&gt;[[From (SQL)|FROM]]&lt;/code&gt; clause and an optional &lt;code&gt;[[Where (SQL)|WHERE]]&lt;/code&gt; clause. The semantic of this query structure is:
* The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the projection. It specifies the relations’ attributes (or attribute expressions) that will be selected. The resulting table is a fuzzy set and it is given in decreasing ordered of satisfaction degree. 
* The &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; clause specifies also a calibration that is intended to restrict the set of rows retrieved. There are two kinds of calibrations: quantitative and qualitative. In quantitative calibration the user specifies the number of results to be retrieved, so that the query will retrieve the rows with highest membership degrees up to the number of required answers. In qualitative calibration the user specifies a minim level of satisfaction that must have any retrieved row.
* The &lt;code&gt;FROM&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the Cartesian Product. The consult is made on the Cartesian Product of the relations that are specified in this clause. 
* The &lt;code&gt;WHERE&lt;/code&gt; clause corresponds to the selection. It specifies the condition for which the satisfaction degree will be calculated. Rows that do not satisfy at all the condition are rejected. This condition is a fuzzy predicate that may involve any attribute of the relations.

The following is an example of a &lt;code&gt;SELECT&lt;/code&gt; query that returns a list of hotels that are cheap. The query retrieves all rows from the ''Hotels'' table that satisfice the fuzzy predicate ''cheap'' defined by the fuzzy set &lt;big&gt;μ&lt;/big&gt;=({{math|∞|size=100%}}, {{math|∞|size=100%}}, 25, 30). The result is sorted in descending order by the membership degree of the query.

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
SELECT name, address
  FROM  Hotels
  WHERE price = cheap;
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''SciShow''''' is a series of science-related videos on [[YouTube]]. The program is mainly  hosted by [[Hank Green]] of the [[VlogBrothers]] and [[Michael Aranda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leib|first=Bart|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/03/scishow-crash-course/|title=Scishow &amp; Crash Course: Why Isn’t School This Cool?|publisher=''Wired''|work=Geekdad|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SciShow'' was launched as an [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eördögh|first=Fruzsina|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/hank-green-vlogbrothers-scishow-youtube/|title=Watch the premiere of Hank Green's SciShow|publisher=''Daily Dot''|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosting and production==
[[File:Hank Green Vlogbrothers 2016.jpg|thumb|Hank Green, host of ''SciShow'']]
Though Green hosts the majority of episodes, the show has alternate hosts; [[Michael Aranda]] has been with the show since its inception, and Olivia Gordon  of the Missoula Insectarium joined in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Ancient Human Fossils!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqeu49ENGYw|website=SciShow|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=11 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to her move to Chicago, [[Emily Graslie]] of ''The Brain Scoop'', also occasionally hosted on the channel. There have also been guest appearances by [[Lindsey Doe]], who hosts ''Sexplanations'', another channel launched by Green; and by longtime SciShow staffer Stefan Chin, who since 2018 has been a regular host. ''SciShow'' has grown since its 2012 launch; since then it has employed a full editorial, production, and operations staff.&lt;ref name=businessinsideradcampaign&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Madeline|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/how-scishow-and-hank-green-landed-a-national-ad-campaign-from-youtube-2014-10|title=Meet The Science Nerd Whose Face Is About To Be Plastered On YouTube Ads Everywhere|publisher=''Business Insider''|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SciShow Space'' has three rotating hosts: Hank Green, Reid Reimers, and Caitlin Hofmeister.

''SciShow Kids'' is primarily hosted by Jessi Knudsen Castañeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SciShow Kids|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/scishowkids|website=Youtube|publisher=SciShow|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''SciShow  Psych'' is co-hosted by Hank Green and Brit Garner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmH9IANu_no

==Promotion and funding==
The channel was launched as an "[[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|original channel]]", which meant that [[YouTube]] funded the channel.&lt;ref name=marketwired1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/vlogbrother-hank-green-launches-science-channel-as-one-youtubes-much-publicized-original-1602880.htm|title=Vlogbrother Hank Green Launches Science Channel as One of YouTube's Much-Publicized Original Programming Channels|publisher=''Market Wired''|date=January 3, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hale|first=Mike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/arts/television/youtubes-original-channels-take-on-tv.html|title=Genres Stretch, for Better and Worse, as YouTube Takes On TV|publisher=''New York Times''|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's initial grant was projected to expire in 2014, and in response, on September 12, 2013 ''SciShow'' joined the viewer-funding site ''Subbable'', created in part by Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE10lpp8O0|title=SciShow Needs You!|publisher=''YouTube''|work=SciShow|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eifler|first=Emily|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/multimedia/article.jsp?essid=124879|title=Crowdfunding Matures with a Lesson from Public Broadcasting|publisher=''KQED''|date=August 20, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the channel landed a national advertisement deal with YouTube. The educational program was featured on platforms such as billboards and television commercials, as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSimone|first=Evan|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/10/hank-green-will-soon-be-stalking-you-with-science/|title=Hank Green Will Soon Be Stalking You With Science|publisher=''New Media Rockstars''|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green details that the advertisements had a positive effect on ''SciShow'', stating, "My Twitter exploded, our followers and subscribers exploded."&lt;ref name=businessinsideradcampaign/&gt;

After [[Patreon]] acquired ''Subbable'', the channel switched over to Patreon where it continues to receive support in exchange for various perks. ''SciShow'' currently has over five thousand patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patreon.com/scishow|title=SciShow is creating YouTube Videos about Science {{!}} Patreon|work=Patreon|access-date=2017-03-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Paleontology}}
'''Sclerochronology''' is the study of physical and chemical variations in the accretionary hard tissues of [[invertebrate]]s and coralline red algae, and the temporal context in which they formed. It is particularly useful in the study of marine [[paleoclimatology]].  The term was coined in 1974 &lt;ref&gt;Buddemeier, R. W., Maragos, J. E., and Knutson, D. W. 1974. Radiographic studies of reef coral exoskeletons: Rates and patterns of coral growth. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology 14, 179-199.&lt;/ref&gt; following pioneering work on nuclear test atolls by Knutson and Buddemeier&lt;ref&gt;Knutson, D. W., Buddemeier, R. W., and Smith, S. V. 1972. Coral Chronometers: Seasonal Growth Bands in Reef Corals. Science 177, 270-272.&lt;/ref&gt; and comes from the three Greek words ''scleros'' (hard), ''chronos'' (time) and ''logos'' (science), which together refer to the use of the hard parts of living organisms to order events in time. It is, therefore, a form of [[stratigraphy]]. Sclerochronology focuses primarily upon [[individual growth|growth]] patterns reflecting annual, monthly, fortnightly, tidal, daily, and sub-daily (ultradian) [[wikt:increment|increment]]s of time.

The regular time increments are controlled by [[Circadian rhythm|biological clock]]s, which, in turn, are caused by environmental and astronomical pacemakers. 

Familiar examples include annual bandings in [[coral reef|reef coral]] [[skeleton]]s or annual, fortnightly, daily and ultradian growth increments in [[mollusk]] shells as well as annual bandings in the ear bones of fish, called [[otolith]]s. Sclerochronology is analogous to [[dendrochronology]], the study of [[tree ring|annual rings in trees]], and equally seeks to deduce organismal [[Biological life cycle|life history]] traits as well as to reconstruct records of environmental and climatic change through space and time.

The science of sclerochronology as applied to hard parts of various organism groups is now routinely used for paleoceanographic and paleoclimate reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;Schöne, B.R., Oschmann, W., Kröncke, I., Dreyer, W., Janssen, R., Rumohr, H., Houk, S.D., Freyre Castro, A.D., Dunca, E. and Rössler, J. (2003). North Atlantic Oscillation dynamics recorded in shells of a long-lived bivalve mollusk. Geology 31, 1237–1240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wanamaker, A.D. Jr., Kreutz, K.J., Schöne, B.R., Pettigrew, N., Borns, H.W., Introne, D.S., Belknap, D., Maasch, K.A. and Feindel, S. 2008. Coupled North Atlantic slopewater forcing on Gulf of Maine temperatures over the past millennium. Climate Dynamics 31, 183-194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corrège, T., Gagan, M.K., Beck, J.W., Burr, G.S., Cabioch, G &amp; Le Cornec, F. 2004. Interdecadal variation in the extent of South Pacific tropical waters during the Younger Dryas event. Nature 428, 927-929.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halfar, J., Steneck, R.S., Joachimski, M, Kronz, A. &amp; Wanamaker A.D. Jr. 2008. Coralline red algae as high-resolution climate recorders. Geology, 36, 463-466.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black, B.A., Copenheaver, C.A., Frank, D.C., Stuckey, M.J. and Kormanyos, R.E. 2009. Multi-proxy reconstructions of northeastern Pacific sea surface temperature data from trees and Pacific geoduck. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology 278, 40–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study includes isotopic and elemental proxies, sometimes termed sclerochemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Gröcke D. R. and D. P. Gillikin, (2008). Advances in mollusc sclerochronology and sclerochemistry: tools for understanding climate and environment. Geo-Marine Letters 28: 265-268.&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in imaging techniques have now realised the potential to decipher coral banding at daily resolution,&lt;ref&gt;Gill, I. P., Dickson, J. A. D., and Hubbard, D. K. 2006. Daily banding in corals: Implications for paleoclimatic reconstruction and skeletonization. Journal of Sedimentary Research 76, 683-688.&lt;/ref&gt; although biological 'vital' effects may blur the climate signal at such a high resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Juillet-Leclerc, A., Reynaud, S., Rollion-Bard, C., Cuif, J. P., Dauphin, Y., Blamart, D., Ferrier-Pagès, C., and Allemand, D. 2009. Oxygen isotopic signature of the skeletal microstructures in cultured corals: Identification of vital effects.

Seafish was established in the United Kingdom under the [[Fisheries Act 1981]] through the amalgamation of the '''Herring Industry Board''' (founded in 1934)&lt;ref name="HDM"&gt;{{cite news |title=EIGHT MEN—THE HERRING INDUSTRY'S FATE IN THEIR HANDS|work=Hull Daily Mail |date=8 March 1935 |accessdate=18 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19350308/200/0024| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''White Fish Authority''' (founded in 1951).&lt;ref name="AEE"&gt;{{cite news |title=White Fish Authority |work=Aberdeen Evening Express |date=13 February 1951 |accessdate=18 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000445/19510213/059/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, 12 January 1981, column 824. The Minister was Mr [[Alick Buchanan-Smith (politician)|Alick Buchanan-Smith]]. [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/09104458/9 "Scottish Executive website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Seafish has its administrative base in the Scottish city of [[Edinburgh]] and has its research &amp; development base in [[Grimsby]], the UK's main base for the fishing industry and [[frozen food]]. The organisation in Grimsby moved into the new Humber Seafood Institute, run by the [[Grimsby Institute of Further &amp; Higher Education|Grimsby Institute]], on July 2008. It was formerly based on [[St Andrew's Dock|St Andrews Dock]] in Hull.

Seafish carries out research and projects aimed at raising standards, improving efficiency and ensuring the sustainable development of the industry. As well as supplying training and [[Research and development|R&amp;D]], Seafish operates accreditation schemes for [[Fish and chips|fish &amp; chip shop]]s, [[Fisherman|fishermen]], [[wholesalers]] and processors. Seafish has an economics team which collects, interprets and disseminates data about various UK seafood sectors.

==Funding==
Seafish is sponsored by the fisheries departments of the [[Her Majesty's Government|four UK governments]] and is funded by a [[Tax|levy]] across all sectors of the fisheries and seafood industry. This levy is due on all first-hand purchases of sea fish, [[shellfish]], and sea fish products including [[fish meal]] landed in the United Kingdom. This includes imports, which make up more than 75% of UK seafood consumption, as well as the domestic catch landed in the UK, the majority of which is exported.

==Seafish services==

===Economics===
Seafish is a source of economic information for industry and policy makers on the fishing, supply and processing industries conducting surveys and analyses of the UK fleet and processing sectors, including trends in costs and earnings and economics impact multipliers. The Economics department also produces strategic analyses such as the 'Seafood Strategic Outlook' and fleet futures modelling.

===Research and Development===
Seafish carried out research and projects to improve efficiency and seafood quality and obtain best value for money for the UK seafood industry. The 16-strong team is based around the UK.

A number of research and development projects are funded through the Seafish Industry Project Fund. During 2006 and 2007, over £2.5 million has been invested in 47 projects which have funded research and development partnership projects, grant assistance for innovative ideas and bursaries for students.

===Seafood Information Network (SIN)===
Seafish has created SIN, an information portal for the global seafood industry. SIN is an internet-based data source for business, researchers and service providers. http://sin.seafish.org

==Competitions==

The National Fish&amp; Chip Awards recognise shops for producing the best fish and chips in the UK. The competition is split into regional finals and is awarded in late January. It was first awarded in 1988.

===Seafish Friers Quality Award===
An approved inspector checks the fish restaurant for its image, selection of food raw materials, hygiene and cleaning, handling and temperature control, packaging, management systems, and the training schemes provided. If of a high enough calibre, this award is given, which lasts for one year, giving a reasonable indication of inherent quality. The Seafish website allows you to find recognised fish restaurants in local counties and by speciality fish being served.

===Retailer of the Year===
Each year a main supermarket chain is given this award. [[Waitrose]] won it in 2009.

===Seafish Responsible Fishing Scheme===
'''The Seafish Responsible Fishing Scheme''' is a BSi Publicly Available Specification (PAS 72:2006) awarded to individual vessels for vessel operations and traceability in the sea fishing industry. It specifies requirements relating to fishing practices, vessel criteria, crew competence, environmental considerations and record maintenance. It is applicable to the supply chain from the fisherman to the point of first sale. In late 2009 around 500 vessels are involved in the scheme with 325 vessels fully certified covering about 70% of UK landings by weight. The scheme is independently audited by UKAS approved auditors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">'''Situational analysis''' (or '''Situational logic''') is a concept advanced by [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in his [[The Poverty of Historicism]]. ''Situational analysis'' is a process by which a social scientist tries to reconstruct the problem situation confronting an agent in order to understand that agent's choice.

[[Noretta Koertge|Koertge]] (1975) provides a helpful clarificatory summary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This use of this summary is from Boumans and Davis (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

:First provide a description of the situation: 
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''Agent A was in a situation of type C''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
:This situation is then analysed
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''In a situation of type C, the appropriate thing to do is X.''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:The rationality principle may then be called upon:
:&lt;nowiki&gt;''agents always act appropriately to their situation''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:Finally we have the ''explanadum'':
::&lt;nowiki&gt;''(therefore) A did X.''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boumans, M and Davis, John B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23647">The emergence of [[social media]] has changed the way in which political communication takes place in the [[Politics of the United States|United States]]. Political institutions such as politicians, [[political parties]], foundations, institutions, and political [[think tank]]s are all using social media platforms, like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], to communicate with and engage voters. Regular individuals, politicians, "[[pundit]]s" and [[thought leader]]s alike are able to voice their opinions, engage with a wide network, and connect with other likeminded individuals.&lt;ref name="Kearney2013"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Kearney|first=Michael||date=2013|title=Political Discussion on Facebook: An Analysis of Interpersonal Goals and Disagreement|publisher= University of Kansas|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1808/12975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The active participation of social media users has been an increasingly important element in political communication, especially during political elections in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Skogerbø &amp; Arne H. Krumsvik, "Newspapers, Facebook and Twitter: Intermedial agenda setting in local election campaigns," Journalism Practice (2015) 9#3 DOI:10.1080/17512786.2014.950471&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media are changing the nature of political communication because they are tools that can be used to inform and mobilize users in new ways. Users are able to connect directly to politicians and campaign managers and engage in political activities in new ways. Each social media platform is programmed in code by developers, creating a unique digital architecture that influences how politicians and citizens can use the platform for political ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossetta|first=Michael|date=March 2018|title=The Digital Architectures of Social Media: Comparing Political Campaigning on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat in the 2016 U.S. Election|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077699018763307|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=95(2)|pages=471-496|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by simply pressing the "[[like button]]" on [[Facebook]] or by following someone on [[Twitter]], users have the ability to connect with others and express their views in new ways. The option for users to share, like, or [[retweet]] political messages instantly has opened up a new avenue for politicians to reach out to voters. At the same time, social media campaigns can carry risks that are not present on traditional platforms, such as TV or newspaper ads. Whereas the political party controls all of the messaging on a TV or newspaper ad, in a social media campaign, critics and opposing party supporters can post negative comments immediately below campaign messages.

Politicians have a platform to communicate with that is different from the mainstream media. Politicians have the ability to raise large amounts of money in relatively short periods of time through social media campaigns. In 2012 president Obama raised over a billion dollars for his campaign, which broke the fundraising record. Around $690 million was raised through online donations including social media, email, and website donations and more money was raised from small donors than ever before.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Scherer, Michael. “Exclusive: Obama’s 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008.” Time. November 15, 2012. http://swampland.time.com/2012/11/15/exclusive-obamas-2012-digital-fundraising-outperformed-2008/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on elections==

===Early history===
Democrat [[Howard Dean]] is credited with being the first politician to use the Internet for political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;”Campaign 2.0” Webspace at University of Texas at Austin.  April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}  Dean served as the Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and decided to run for president for the 2004 election. Dean is credited with organizing the first campaign website, acting as a virtual headquarters for fundraising and volunteer recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;Hindman, Matthew. “The Real Lessons of Howard Dean: Reflections on the First Digital Campaign.” Perspectives on Politics, 2005, p.121-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s website had a number of online metrics of success including the hits on his homepage, weblogs, campaign sign-ups, house parties and meet ups.&lt;ref&gt;Rospars, Joe. “How Howard Dean’s Scream Helped Obama Land The Presidency.” Time Magazine. July 1, 2014. http://time.com/2946448/howard-dean-scream-obama-president/&lt;/ref&gt; Dean’s supporters hosted house parties and invited individuals to learn about Dean’s campaign. Dean also encouraged use of the website [[Meetup (website)|Meetup]] for his upstart presidential campaign in 2002, making it easy for people "with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet, face to face".&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Individuals would attend face-to-face meetings to learn more about his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Cornfield, Michael. “The Internet and Campaign: A Look Back at the Campaigners”.  Pew Research Center, 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people coming out to Dean's Meetups in 600 location across the country ultimately reached about 143,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 75,000 individuals attended these meet-ups and more than 96% of respondents reported that they wished to become actively involved in Dean’s campaign. The engagement in face-to-face local groups "dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign. The more Meetups people attended, the higher their average donation to the campaign".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/07/tech/web/meetup-2012-campaign-sifry/|title=From Howard Dean to the tea party: The power of Meetup.com|website=CNN|publisher=Cable News Network.|last1=Sifry|first1=Micah|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dean won a "digital" [[primary election]] that was held on [[MoveOn.org]] with 44% of the votes. His success in the primary generated positive coverage by the news media. This early victory was important to the momentum of the campaign. Dean’s campaign was also viewed as a success for his ability to raise large amounts of money in small increments. In January 2004, his campaign had raised $41 million from supporters mostly online. A total of 318,884 individuals contributed to his campaign, with over 61% of the contributions under $200. Less than 1% of individuals gave $2,000, which was the federal limit.&lt;ref name=FEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Contribution Limits for 2003-2004|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/ContributionLimits2003-2004.htm|website=FEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dean’s fundraising behavior was opposite of his rivals. [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] raised $130.8 million in 2003 and 68% of his donations were the maximum donation limit.&lt;ref&gt;Justice, Glen. “Campaign Fund-Raising; Financial Firms are Bush’s Biggest Donors, Study Reports.”The New York Times.  January 9, 2004. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/09/us/2004-campaign-fund-raising-financial-firms-are-bush-s-biggest-donors-study.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political Origins of Facebook===
[[Mark Zuckerberg]] served as a field organizer for Democrat [[John Kerry]] in the 2004 presidential election.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Slotnick, Allison. “Friend the President”.  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Zuckerberg was responsible for [[Get out the vote]] and mobilization efforts.  Facebook was launched the same year. The [[Facebook Platform]] relies on group formation and constant communication, both of which are goals for any political campaign.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[Chris Hughes]], a founding member and developer at Facebook, left the company to work as an advisor for President Barack Obama. While working at Facebook, Hughes designed a Facebook profile for the then presidential candidate. Following his departure, Hughes worked on Obama’s Facebook page and utilized his knowledge of [[content management]] and new developments to outpace other candidates in relation to their online presence.&lt;ref&gt;McGirt, Ellen. “How Chris Hughes helped launch Facebook and the Barack Obama Campaign.” Fast Company Magazine. April 2009. http://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes-helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes created the website MyBarak0bama.com which had a similar layout and concept as Facebook.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== 2008 Presidential Election ===
The 2008 presidential election was the first election in which candidates utilized the Internet and social media as a tool for their campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, David. “How Obama Tapped Into Social Networks’ Power.” New York Times. November 9, 2008. https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10carr.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Then President-elect Barack Obama was the first to use the Internet to organize supporters, advertise, and communicate with individuals in a way that had been impossible in previous elections.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Miller, Claire Cain. “How Obama’s Internet Campaign Changed Politics.” New York Times. November 7, 2008. http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/how-obamas-internet-campaign-changed-politics/&lt;/ref&gt; Obama utilized sites like [[YouTube]] to advertise through videos. The videos posted on YouTube by Obama’s were viewed for 14.5 million hours.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramirez, Jessica. “The YouTube Election.” Newsweek. November 9, 2008. http://www.newsweek.com/youtube-election-85069&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Presidential Election===
By the 2012 election more candidates were utilizing a wider array of social media platforms.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Fouhy, Beth. “Elections 2012: The Social Network, Presidential Campaign Edition.” Huffington Post. April 17, 2011 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/17/elections-2012-social-media_n_850172.html&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians were now on social networking sites like [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]] and other new social media tools and [[mobile apps]]. Some of the candidates used social media sites to announce their candidacy. [[Barack Obama]] emailed a video to 13 million when he announced his intention to run for re-election and [[Mitt Romney]]  sent out a [[Tweet (Twitter)|tweet]].&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Other candidates posted on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to announce their candidacy.

There is a clear difference between the Obama and Romney campaign's presence on social media throughout the 2012 campaign. In October 2012, President Obama had over 20 million followers on [[Twitter]] and Romney had 1.2 million. On [[Facebook]] Obama had over 29 million likes on his page and Romney had 7.9 million. On [[Instagram]] Obama had 1.4 million followers and Romney had 38,000 followers. President Obama had higher followers on all of his other social media accounts including [[Spotify]] [[Pinterest]] and [[YouTube]],&lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Jenna. “The Presidential Campaign on Social Media.” The New York Times. October 8, 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/08/technology/campaign-social-media.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; though research suggests merely following Obama or Romney on social media sites such as Facebook may have had little influence on voter behaviors.&lt;ref name="Pennington2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pennington|first1=Natalie|last2=Winfrey|first2=Kelly| last3=Warner|first3=Benjamin|last4=Kearney|first4=Michael|title=Liking Obama and Romney (on Facebook): An experimental evaluation of political engagement and efficacy during the 2012 general election|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=44|year=2015|pages=279–283|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.032}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama also utilized his social media accounts more than any other candidate online.&lt;ref&gt;“How the Presidential Candidates Use the Web and Social Media: Obama Leads but Neither Candidate Engages in Much Dialogue with Voters.” Pew Research Center Journalism &amp; Media. August 15, 2012 http:// www.journalism.org/2012/08/15/how-presidential-candidates-use-web-and-social-media/&lt;/ref&gt; He actively posted more on Twitter, YouTube and on his personal website [[blog]].

President Obama’s campaign thrived on online donations in both 2008 and 2012. In 2008 3.95 million people donated to president Obama’s campaign.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; That number reached 4.4 million people during his 2012 campaign. The total online donation also rose from $500 million in 2008 to $690 million in 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===2016 Presidential campaign===
{{main|Social media in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign}}

===Limitations and constraints===
[[Social media]] has been used in political campaigns ranging from small local elections to larger-scale presidential elections. According to [[Wael Ghonim]], social media can reinforce pre-existing beliefs rather than promote new ones. Social media, while a great source of gathering volunteers and money, serves the main purpose of affirming political beliefs and strengthening a political base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another limitation of the way social media is used in political campaigns is that politicians cannot control the conversation. According to a study by Miguel del Fresno García, Alan J. Daly, and Sagrario Segado Sánchez-Cabezudo, regular friends and followers hold high levels of influence on social media, instead of blogs and campaign pages. Users with the most influence over social media fall into three different categories: users who disseminate knowledge, those who engage other people, and those who lead conversations. These three types of users are the ones who others tend to follow and listen to through social media. Therefore, for political campaigns to truly reach as many people as possible, political groups first need to get those three users talking about their campaigns on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

While "critics [may] worry that governance by social media will cheapen the power of the presidency by substituting hashtag activism for serious policymaking," President Obama's Administration has been credited with successfully "[leveraging] the opportunities of the digital age to maximum political advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2015/05/26/heres-how-the-first-president-of-the-social-media-age-has-chosen-to-connect-with-americans/|title=Here's how the first president of the social media age has chosen to connect with Americans|website=The Washington Post|publisher=WP Company LLC|last1=Eilperin|first1=Juliet|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
Scandals have been a part of the American political system since its inception (see [[List of federal political scandals in the United States]]). [[Political scandals]] are events that capture a lot of attention and eventually disappear over and are the source of intense public communication. The media has subsequently played an important role in both the breaking of these stories and the coverage they receive. In recent decades there have been an increased number of scandals relating to the Internet and social media.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Arsenault, Amelia. “Scandal Politics in the New Media Environment” Analytical Note: Scandal Politics Review. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most notable political scandal related to social media has been the demise of Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]] in 2011. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, sent a link of a suggestive photograph to a woman on his public Twitter account. The tweet and picture were then sent to [[Andrew Breitbart]] , a conservative blogger, who posted them to his website before Weiner had a chance to take the tweet down.&lt;ref&gt;Altman, Alex. “Weinergate: Anatomy of Social Media Scandal” Time.  May 31, 2011. http://swampland.time.com/2011/05/31/weinergate-anatomy-of-a-social-media-scandal/&lt;/ref&gt; Within days the Anthony Weiner incident became national news. The scandal, nicknamed [[Weinergate]],  is widely considered to be the first political sex scandal to come about as a result of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, William. “Weinergate’s Lasting Impact: The First Big Social Media Political Sex Scandal.” Huffington Post. June 7, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/weinergates-lasting-impac_b_872585.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political scandals have emerged as a result of social media. [[Joe Miller (Alaska politician)|Joe Miller]] a Senate candidate from Alaska tweeted about decorating his office prior to any announcement that he had won the race.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southwestern University''' (also referred to as '''Southwestern''' or '''SU''') is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]]. Formed in 1873 from a revival of collegiate charters granted in 1840, Southwestern is the oldest university in Texas. The school is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]] with a  [[nonsectarian]] curriculum. Southwestern offers 40 bachelor's degrees in the arts, sciences, fine arts, and music as well as interdisciplinary and pre-professional programs. The university is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] and the [[National Association of Schools of Music]].

The university is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]], the [[Associated Colleges of the South]], the [[Council of Independent Colleges]], and is a signatory of the [[Talloires Declaration]].

==History==
[[File:CullenOld.png|right|thumb|The Roy and Lillie Cullen Building shortly after completion]]
[[File:Mood 1910.png|right|thumb|Students in front of [[Mood-Bridwell Hall]] in 1910]]

Prior to assuming the university's current form, charters had been granted by the [[Texas Legislature]] (Texas Congress 1836–1845) to establish four educational institutions: [[Rutersville College]] of [[Rutersville, Texas]], ''Wesleyan College'' of [[San Augustine, Texas]], [[McKenzie College (Texas)|McKenzie College]] of [[Clarksville, Texas]], and [[Soule University]] of [[Chappell Hill, Texas]].

In 1873, the union of these four institutions opened in Georgetown as ''Texas University''.&lt;ref name="To Survive and Excell, Chapter VI. Fulfillment of the Vision: Southwestern University"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=William B.|title=To Survive and Excel|year=2006|publisher=Southwestern University|location=Georgetown, TX|pages=59–75|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/library/documents/ToSurviveAndExcel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing to reserve that name for a proposed state university in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]], the Texas Legislature instead granted a charter in 1875 under the name ''Southwestern University'' as a continuation of the charters for Rutersville, Wesleyan, McKenzie, and Soule. The university considers its founding date to be 1840 when Rutersville College opened. Southwestern thus claims to be the oldest university in Texas and the second oldest coeducational liberal arts college west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].

Southwestern was a charter member of the [[Southwest Conference]] in 1915. [[Southern Methodist University]] was Southwestern's main rival for several decades in remembrance of an unsuccessful attempt to relocate Southwestern to Dallas which instead resulted in the establishment of SMU. When SMU's student population became much larger, students at Southwestern began considering [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] and [[Austin College]] to be the school's main rivals. After World War II, Southwestern transformed itself into a small liberal arts institution, discontinuing its post-graduate degrees, disbanding the football team, and rebuilding much of the campus with a massive capital campaign. The endowment rose substantially.

Southwestern has a history of drawing prolific lecturers to campus, including [[William Jennings Bryan]], [[Helen Keller]], [[bell hooks]], and alumnus [[J. Frank Dobie]].

==Academics==
The university offers 40 majors and 36 minors divided between the Brown College of Arts and Sciences and the Sarofim School of Fine Arts. In addition to traditional academic majors, Southwestern offers [[interdisciplinary]], independent, and paired majors as well as pre-professional programs in Engineering, Law, Medicine, and [[Theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/|title=Southwestern University: Academics|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/departments.php|title=Southwestern University: Departments|accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013-2014 school year, total student enrollment was at 1,536, with a gender distribution of about 60 percent female and 40 percent male. Of the entering first-year students in Fall 2013, 37 percent were in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class with an average SAT score of 1166 (*writing section not included). While the majority of students come from Texas (89 percent),  the remaining 11 percent come from 23 other states and 6 countries. Minority students constitute 33 percent of the student body.&lt;ref name="Southwestern University Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwestern.edu/about/profile.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002035810/http://www.southwestern.edu/about/profile.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 2, 2013 |title=Southwestern University Profile |accessdate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The student to faculty ratio is 11:1, with an average class size of 15 students. Ninety-nine percent of the tenured or tenure-track faculty hold a doctorate or highest degree in their fields. Collaborative research and publication with students is common.&lt;ref name="Southwestern University Profile"/&gt;

===Research===
Southwestern hosts two interdisciplinary academic exhibitions each year to showcase research by students at Southwestern and researchers across the country. The ''Brown Symposium'' held in the early spring is an academic conference attracting guest lecturers and panelists. All Brown Symposium speakers present research that shares the symposium's theme for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/brownsymposium/|title=Brown Symposium|accessdate=December 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155719/http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/brownsymposium/|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Creative Works Symposium'' held near the end of the spring semester offers undergraduate students an opportunity to display their own research as a formal oral presentation, panel discussion, poster presentation, art exhibit, or technology demonstration. These student presentations are often the culmination of senior capstone projects, independent studies, collaborations with a faculty member, or a requirement for receiving research grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/studentworks/|title=Student Works Symposium|accessdate=December 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420003938/http://www.southwestern.edu/academics/studentworks/|archivedate=April 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
Southwestern University is located in [[Georgetown, Texas]], about 30 miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The campus comprises 700 acres (2.8&amp;nbsp;km²) mostly located north of [[Texas State Highway 29|University Avenue]], although the eastern portion of these lands remains largely undeveloped with some portions serving as an EcoLab where faculty and students conduct research. The main campus is organized around a central academic mall formed by a semi-circular grassy area bounded by a pedestrian walkway and academic buildings. Residence halls and on-campus apartments are located to the east and northwest of the academic mall. Sports fields, support facilities, and parking are on the periphery of the main campus.

===Notable buildings===
[[File:Rutlo 3772831372 Southwestern.jpg|thumb|The [[Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building]] in 2009]]
[[File:Dustinc 263451159 Southwestern.jpg|thumb|The Lois Perkins Chapel situated along the Academic Mall]]
The [[Hugh Roy and Lillie Cullen Building]] (formerly called the Administration Building) was built in 1898 in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The Cullen Building currently houses the administration, business office, alumni relations, and classrooms. Throughout various times in its history, it has also housed the campus [[auditorium]], gymnasium, chapel, and library. It is named in honor of [[Hugh Roy Cullen]] and his wife.

[[Mood-Bridwell Hall]], originally a men's [[dormitory]], was completed in 1908 and currently houses classrooms, faculty offices, a computer lab, the Debbie Ellis Writing Center, and an indoor [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]]. Mood-Bridwell is included in the Cullen Building's listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

The [[A. Frank Smith Library Center]] opened in 1939 as the [[Cody Memorial Library]] and was built as part of a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project. It was expanded in 1966 and again in 1989, receiving the new name as a result of the second expansion. In addition to books and periodicals, the library houses a film and audio collection, 24-hour computer lab, maps, sheet music, and special collections for Texas history and culture, [[John Tower]], [[J. Frank Dobie]], [[Jessie Daniel Ames]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Aaron Burr]], [[Edward Blake]], [[Thomas Bewick]], and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwestern.edu/library/special-collections/collections.html|title=Special Collections in Smith Library Center|accessdate=October 23, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527135104/http://www.southwestern.edu/library/special-collections/collections.html|archivedate=May 27, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lois Perkins Chapel]] was built in 1950 and includes an [[Aeolian-Skinner]] [[pipe organ]]. [[Stained glass]] windows along the east and west sides depict [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] leaders and [[Methodist]] leaders with seals for the educational institutions they were affiliated with.

The [[McCombs Campus Center]] opened in 1998, replacing the Bishops' Memorial Student Union Building and University Commons. It includes dining facilities, the campus bookstore, [[ballroom]]s, and student organization offices. It is named for billionaire entrepreneur and Southwestern alum [[Red McCombs]].

The [[Fayez Sarofim]] School of Fine Arts is housed in the Alma Thomas Fine Arts Building, originally built in 1956 on the former property of the Texas rancher [[John Wesley Snyder (Texas)|John Wesley Snyder]], a Southwestern University benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fsn13|title=H. Allan Anderson of Lubbock, Texas, "John Wesley Snyder"|work=[[The Handbook of Texas]]|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fine Arts Building (FAB) has been renovated multiple times, most recently in 1998 and 2008. The FAB houses the 700-seat Alma Thomas Theater, the smaller Jones Theater, the Caldwell-Carvey Foyer, numerous practice rooms, art studios, a black box theater, and an instrumental rehearsal hall.

The [[Wilhelmina Cullen Admission Center]] opened in 2009, moving the admissions office out of the Roy and Lillie Cullen Building. It is Southwestern's first "green" building and was designed to receive Gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification. Some of the building's features include a bamboo floor in the lobby area, skylights in the center of the building, solar-powered sink faucets and reflective roof shingles. Southwestern plans to turn the area in the original Cullen Building formerly occupied by the Admission Office into a museum. The Admissions Center was named after Wilhelmina Cullen, the daughter of Roy and Lillie Cullen.

==Student activities and organizations==

There are over 90 student organizations on campus. The school hosts chapters of 16 academic honor societies, including a chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and the founding chapter of the [[Alpha Chi]] honor society. The national co-ed service fraternity [[Alpha Phi Omega]] also has a chapter. Several groups on campus participate in social activism and awareness on campus and in the Austin area, including College Democrats, Students for Environmental Activism and Knowledge (SEAK), Latinos Unidos, EBONY, and [[Amnesty International]]. Religious groups on campus include the national [[Christian fraternity]] Kappa Upsilon Chi, Christian sorority [[Sigma Phi Lambda]], Jewish Student Association, Muslim Student Organization, and Buddhist Meditation Group. Other groups include Habitat for Humanity, Model U.N., and German Club.

===Student government===
Student government is primarily handled by the Student Congress, with each member elected to represent students living in residence halls, Greek houses, and at-large for students living off-campus. The Student Congress is headed by a president elected through popular vote. An independent organization, Student Foundation, serves as a liaison between students, faculty, alumni, and the university's administration. A panel of students and faculty maintain the university's [[honor code]], replacing the Student Judiciary which previously adjudicated violations of the honor code.

===Greek life===

Southwestern hosts eight national social [[fraternities and sororities]] governed by the North-American Interfraternity Council (IFC) and the National Panhellenic Council (NPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southwestern.edu/studentlife/orgs/greek.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218022453/http://southwestern.edu/studentlife/orgs/greek.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-02-18|title=Southwestern University: Student Life|work=southwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; All fraternities occupy houses on the western side of the campus. The sororities do not have dedicated housing, although they maintain chapter rooms in the Lord Caskey Center. Southwestern has a deferred rush allowing incoming students to become familiar with the campus before formal recruitment begins in the early spring. About 1/3 of the student life is involved in Greek life.&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/southwestern-university-3620&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable people==

===Contributors===
Southwestern has had many financial and non-financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. During the Great Depression, a conditional gift from Southwestern alumna Louisa Carothers Wiess substantially increased the university's endowment and motivated the university to pay off all its debts. While serving in Congress, [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]] helped Southwestern acquire the Navy V-12 Program during World War II at a time when the university was struggling financially. Former student [[Red McCombs]] contributed financial support for the campus center and an apartment complex. The Brown Foundation, Cullen Foundation, and Mabee Foundation have contributed financial support for multiple construction projects.

Since the mid-90's every year the law firm Surana and Surana International Attorneys have hosted, administered &amp; sponsored over a  hundred  moot court competitions (the count is till 2013 and continuing) in partnership with India's  leading law schools. This project is one of the largest of its kind in the world by any law firm. In the academic initiatives taken by corporates, Surana &amp; Surana stands as a benchmark in the whole legal fraternity.

==History==
The '''Surana and Surana Moots''' project was initiated by the founder of Surana and Surana International Attorneys, P.S.Surana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtnext.in/News/City/2016/04/23234516/Dont-lose-principles-for-quick-money.vpf&lt;/ref&gt; One day in the late 80's, Honb'le Justice Krishna Iyer during his stay with the Surana family, spoke at length about the need to nurture young advocates with good advocacy skills. He was also concerned about the fact that bright young law graduates were joining the corporate sector, thereby depriving the Bar of a steady flow of good talent. This prompted  Mr. Surana  to plan  a well structured  &amp; transparent moot court competition platform for  law students  to develop skills in oral and  written  advocacy  as well as legal research. The cases prepared for the competitions are based on either emerging or unsettled areas of law. This requires participants to come up with innovative arguments which in turn helps develop new jurisprudence. Members of the higher &amp; lower judiciary have participated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International moot court competition starts at PU|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/international-moot-court-competition-starts-at-pu/411754/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in these moots  and have greatly  appreciated  the efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moot Court contests conclude|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100906/cth1.htm|publisher=Tribune Chandigarh|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Surana &amp; Surana in developing legal skills among  generations of  budding lawyers.

A '''target drone''' is an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]], generally [[Teleoperation|remote controlled]], usually used in the training of [[anti-aircraft]] crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avonds.com/Target%20Drones.htm |title=Avonds Scale Jets - Target Drones |publisher=Avonds.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest drones was the British [[De Havilland Tiger Moth#Training|DH.82 Queen Bee]], a variant of the Tiger Moth trainer aircraft operational from 1935. Its name led to the present term "drone".{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In their simplest form, target drones often resemble radio-controlled model aircraft. More modern drones may use [[countermeasures]], [[radar]], and similar systems to mimic manned aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vectorsite.net/twuav_02.html |title=Target Drones |publisher=Vector Site |date= |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More advanced drones are made from large, older missiles which have had their warheads removed.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In the United Kingdom, obsolete [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]] jet and propeller-powered aircraft (such as the [[Fairey Firefly]], [[Gloster Meteor]] and de Havilland [[Sea Vixen]] used at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] [[Llanbedr Airport|Llanbedr]] between the 1950s and 1990s) have also been modified into remote controlled drones, but such modifications are costly.  With a much larger budget, the U.S. military has been more likely to convert retired aircraft or older versions of still serving aircraft (e.g., [[F-4 Phantom II|QF-4 Phantom II]] and [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|QF-16 Fighting Falcon]]) into remotely piloted targets for [[USAF]], [[USN]] and [[USMC]] use as Full Scale Aerial Targets or FSATs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fencecheck.com/content/index.php?title=The_Final_Mission:_The_USAF%92s_QF-4_Target_Drones]{{Dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_versions_article29.html|title=F-16 Versions - QF-16|website=www.f-16.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''virgin cleansing myth''' (also referred to as the '''virgin cure myth''', '''virgin rape myth''', or simply '''virgin myth''') is the belief that having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with a [[virgin]] [[girl]] cures a man of [[HIV/AIDS]] or other [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Rape of individuals with disability: AIDS and the folk belief of virgin cleansing | journal = The Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9422 | year = 2004 | pages = 1663–1664 | author = Groce, Nora E. | author2 = Trasi, Reshma | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604162880 | accessdate = 2011-12-29 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16288-0 | pmid=15158626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala says the [[myth]] is a potential factor in [[infant rape]] by HIV-positive men in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Leclerc-Madlala 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = On The Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine | journal = African Journal of AIDS Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | pages = 87–95 | author = Leclerc-Madlala, Suzanne | url = http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/Health/Aids/LeclercMadlala-S_Virgin_cleansing_myth_HIV-AIDS_ethnomedicine.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-29 | doi=10.2989/16085906.2002.9626548| pmid = 25871812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to young girls, who are presumed to be virgins because of their age, people who are "blind, deaf, physically impaired, intellectually disabled, or who have mental-health disabilities" are sometimes raped under the erroneous presumption that individuals with disabilities are sexually inactive and therefore virgins.&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004" /&gt;

==History==
The myth was first reported in 16th century [[Europe]] and gained prominence in 19th century [[Victorian England]] as a cure for [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]] among other sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Earl-Taylor 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = HIV/AIDS, the stats, the virgin cure and infant rape | journal = Science in Africa: Africa's First On-Line Science Magazine | year = 2002 | author = Earl-Taylor, Mike | url = http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120115094218/http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm | archive-date = 2012-01-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin is unknown, but historian [[Hanne Blank]] writes that the idea may have evolved from [[Christian]] legends of [[Consecrated virgin|virgin]]–[[Christian martyrs|martyrs]], whose purity served as a form of protection in battling [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Blank 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Virgin: The Untouched History | author = Blank, Hanne | year = 2007 | publisher = Bloomsbury USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-59691-010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
People all over the world have heard this myth, including in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Asia]], Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004" /&gt;

A survey by the [[UNISA|University Of South Africa (UNISA)]] in South Africa found that 18 percent of laborers thought that having sex with a virgin cures HIV/AIDS. An earlier study in 1999 by sexual health educators in [[Gauteng]] reported that 32 percent of the survey participants believed the myth.&lt;ref name="IRIN 2002"&gt;{{Cite news | title = SOUTH AFRICA: Focus on the virgin myth and HIV/AIDS | author = IRIN | year = 2002 | publisher = IRIN | url = http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=39838 | accessdate = 2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Betty Makoni of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, the myth is perpetuated by traditional healers advising HIV-positive men to cure their disease by having sex with virgin girls.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2006"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Staging sex myths to save Zimbabwe's girls | author = Vickers, Steve | publisher = BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6076758.stm | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | date=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zimbabwe, some people also believe that the blood produced by raping a virgin will cleanse the infected person's blood of the disease.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2006" /&gt;

In 2002, psychologist Mike Earl-Taylor wrote that the virgin cure myth may explain the staggering rise in child or infant rapes in [[South Africa]], which is facing an HIV/AIDS [[epidemic]].&lt;ref name="Earl-Taylor 2003" /&gt; [[UNICEF]] has attributed the rape of hundreds of girls to the virgin cleansing myth.&lt;ref name="CNN 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Child rape survivor saves 'virgin myth' victims | author = CNN | publisher = CNN | url = http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-04/living/cnnheroes.betty.makoni_1_young-girls-raped-youngest-girl?_s=PM:LIVING | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | date = 2009-10-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120127030305/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-04/living/cnnheroes.betty.makoni_1_young-girls-raped-youngest-girl?_s=PM%3ALIVING | archive-date = 2012-01-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is unknown exactly how common the myth is and to what degree rapes happen because of the belief in it. The claim that the myth drives either HIV infection or [[child sexual abuse]] in Africa is disputed by researchers [[Rachel Jewkes]] and Helen Epstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61858-4/fulltext |title=The myth of the virgin rape myth |date=2009-10-24  |accessdate=2013-09-21 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61858-4 |volume=374 |issue=9699 |journal=The Lancet |page=1419|last1=Epstein |first1=Helen |last2=Jewkes |first2=Rachel }} "In the current South African case, this claim is predicated on racist assumptions about the amorality of African men..."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by research on convicted sex offenders in Malawi, where no evidence was found to support the idea that the virgin cleansing myth prompted any rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mtibo C, Kennedy N, Umar E |title=Explanations for child sexual abuse given by convicted offenders in Malawi: no evidence for "HIV cleansing" |journal=Child Abuse Negl |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=142–6 |year=2011 |pmid=21353703 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.10.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of education==
Ignorance with regards to HIV and AIDS infection serves as a barrier to prevention in numerous African nations.&lt;ref name="Connor 1999"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Focus AIDS: The myth that sex with a virgin can cure HIV | author = Connor, Steve | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/focus-aids-the-myth-that-sex-with-a-virgin-can-cure-hiv-1116662.html | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | location=London | date=1999-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has helped women such as [[Betty Makoni]] speak out against the myth and attempt to dissuade people from believing the virgin cleansing myth.&lt;ref name="Mullins 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'Virgin Myth' Behind Zimbabwe Child Rapes | author = Mullins, K.J. | year = 2009 | publisher = Digital Journal | url = http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/273698 | accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Silver Linings: One Woman Takes On The 'Virgin Myth.' Many Others Perpetuate It | author = Stein, Sadie | year = 2009 | publisher = Jezebel | url = http://jezebel.com/5283195/silver-linings-one-woman-takes-on-the-virgin-myth-many-others-perpetuate-it | accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, culture-based gender roles that prize innocence and ignorance in girls and that accept [[sexual licentiousness]] in men promote this myth.  Other cultural factors, such as girls being married to older men, increase the likelihood of  HIV [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] {{Citation needed|reason=Who says, what in particular.

==In popular culture==

The virgin cleansing myth is referenced in the Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. The minor character Mattumbo is stopped from raping a baby based on the belief that sex with a virgin will cure his AIDS. During the song "Making Things Up Again", Elder Cunningham tells Mattumbo that raping babies is against God's will, and invents a passage in the [[Book of Mormon]] in which God tells [[Joseph Smith]] to instead have sex with a frog to cure his AIDS.
