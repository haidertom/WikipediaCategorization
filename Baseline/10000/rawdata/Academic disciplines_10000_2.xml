'''''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels''''', full title: ''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels: With a View to Prove Their Common Origin, and to Restore the Text of Their Archetype''. The book was published in 1877 by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott on behalf of his deceased colleague William Hugh Ferrar.

[[William Hugh Ferrar]] (1826–1871) before his death collated four [[Minuscule Greek|minuscules]] (Greek handwritten [[Lower case|cursive]] texts) to demonstrate that they shared a common provenance. The four collated minuscules are: [[Minuscule 13|13]], [[Minuscule 69|69]], [[Minuscule 124|124]], [[Minuscule 346|346]] (known as [[Family 13]] or ''Ferrar Family''). Ferrar intended to establish that these four codices are derived from a common archetype, and to exhibit as nearly as possible the actual text of this [[archetype]] of these four minuscules, a text, therefore, more ancient and authoritative than of any of these manuscripts separately.

The book was published in 1877 by [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott|T. K. Abbott]] on behalf of William Hugh Ferrar, who had died six years previous.

In [[narrative theory]], '''actant''' is a term from the [[actantial model]] of [[Semiotics|semiotic]] analysis of [[narrative]]s. The term also has uses in linguistics, sociology, computer programming theory, and astrology.

==In narratology==
[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] (1917–1992), professor of [[semiotics]], is widely credited with producing the [[actantial model]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[[Algirdas Julien Greimas|Greimas, Algirdas Julien]] [1966] ''Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greimas (1973)  "Actants, Actors, and Figures." On Meaning: Selected Writings in Semiotic Theory. Trans. Paul J. Perron and Frank H, Collins. Theory and History of Literature, 38. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1987. 106-120.&lt;/ref&gt; This model reveals the structural roles typically performed in story telling; such as "hero, villain (opponent of hero), object (of quest), helper (of hero) and sender (who initiates the quest)." Each of these roles fulfill an integral component of the story, or, narrative. Without the contribution of each actant, the story may be incomplete. Thus, an "actant" is not simply a character in a story, but an integral structural element upon which the narrative revolves.

An actant can also be described as a [[binary opposition]] pairing, such as a hero paired with a villain, a dragon paired with a dragon slaying sword, a helper paired with an opponent. Actantal relationships are therefore incredibly useful in generating problems within a narrative that have to be overcome, providing contrast, or in defining an antagonistic force within the narrative. However, the same character can simultaneously have a different actant (or way of concern) in regard to a different sequence of action, event or episode in the story. Therefore, it should be distinguished from a character's consistent role in the story like the [[archetype]] of a [[Character (arts)|character]]. The concept of actant is important in [[structuralism]] of [[narratology]] to regard each situation as the minimum independent unit of story.

{{quote|[Linguistically], ''Actants have a kind of phonemic rather than a phonetic role: they operate on the level of function, rather than content. That is, an actant may embody itself in a particular character (termed an acteur) or it may reside in the function of more than one character in respect of their common role in the story's underlying 'oppositional' structure. In short, the deep structure of the narrative generates and defines its actants at a level beyond that of the story's surface content.''|Terence Hawkes|''Structuralism and Semiotics'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1977), p. 89}}

===As defined by Julia Kristeva===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
In 1969 [[Julia Kristeva]] also attempted to understand  the dynamic development of the situations in [[narrative]]s with [[Greimas]]'s actantial model. She thought the subject and the object can exchange positions, and accordingly the supporter and the opponent can exchange positions too. Furthermore, the pair of subject and object sometimes exchanges its  position with the pair of supporter and opponent. There are, however, multiple overlapping situations in narrative at a given time. To contend with the overlapping situations present in all narrative structure, she called the potential actant shifts not "change", but "transformation." This should not be confused with Greimas's own transformational model, another narratological framework.&lt;ref&gt;Venancio, Rafael Duarte Oliveira, Narrative between Action and Transformation: A. J. Greimas' Narratological Models (December 3, 2016). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2879907&lt;/ref&gt;

===As defined by Vladimir Propp===
Independently, researching Russian folklores, [[Vladimir Propp]] also provided the "7 act spheres":
#Aggressor
#Donor
#Auxiliary
#Princess and the father
#Committer
#Hero
#Bogus hero
However, these are not the types of the person in the story, but rather patterns of behavior: the same person may sometimes as one "sphere", and at other times as a different "sphere".

==In linguistics==

Linguist [[Lucien Tesnière]] considered the function of a verb as most important in [[dependency grammar]] and invented the term "actant", various persons that accompany a verb:
#"prime actant", the [[nominative case]]
#"second actant", the [[accusative case]]
#"third actant", the [[dative case]]
This concept of actant is similar to that of [[argument (linguistics)|argument]].

[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] redefined actants as the 3 pairs "Modulations":
#The Actant-Subject and the Actant-Object of Action.
#The Actant-Sender and the Actant-Receiver of Information
#The Actant-Supporter and the Actant-Oppositionist of Volition.

==In sociology==

In [[sociology]], the semiotic term "actant" was incorporated into the [[actor-network theory]] by [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Michel Callon]], the activity of which is described as "mediation" or "translation".&lt;ref&gt;(cf. "On actor-network theory. A few clarifications", ''Soziale Welt'', 47, 1996, p. 369-382)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In astrology==
Since ancient times, [[astrology]] considered and analyzed the position of the persons concerning a situation with the symbols of the celestial objects and constellations. [[Georges Polti]] counted up the needed positions in his famous ''[[The Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations]]''. [[Étienne Souriau]] reduced them to only 6 positions named "[[dramaturgic functions]]" with astrological symbols:
#"The Leo", the thematic powered.
#"The Sun", the valued.
#"The Earth", the wished obtainer.
#"The Mars", the oppositionist.
#"The Libra", the judge of the situation.
#"The Moon", Auxiliary.

[[File:Adastral Park.jpg|thumb|The main complex at Adastral Park.]]
'''Adastral Park''' is a science campus based on part of the old [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Royal Air Force Station]] at [[Martlesham Heath]] near [[Ipswich]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Suffolk]].

When the site opened it was known as the [[Post Office Research Station]], but it was subsequently renamed '''BT Research Laboratories''' or '''BT Labs''' and later '''Adastral Park''' to reflect an expansion in the organisations and activities co-located with [[BT Labs]] at the campus.

==History==
The original laboratories (when BT was part of the [[Post Office Ltd.|Post Office]]) were first opened by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1975.  Prior to this the [[Post Office Research Station]] was located at [[Dollis Hill]]. 

Martlesham Heath was originally chosen as the location for a research facility because the surrounding countryside was relatively flat and therefore ideal for testing the radio-based communication systems in vogue at the time.

Initially research was carried out into postal sorting and delivery technology and telecommunications. After the Post Office was split apart and prior to British Telecom's privatisation in the early 1980s, the research concentrated on telecommunications.

In keeping with the stellar theme of the site name, buildings on site are named after stars or constellations (an example being the Main Laboratory Block now named the Orion building). The Orion building is easily recognisable from the nearby [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12 road]] with its {{convert|200|ft|m}} radio  tower, now named Pegasus tower, dominating the skyline.

The change to the current name occurred in the late 1990s with the aim of turning the site into a high technology business park no longer exclusively for the use of BT. The name was created by Stewart Davies, the CEO of the BT business (BT Exact Technologies) headquartered at the site at that time. It is derived from the motto of the [[Royal Air Force]]—''per ardua ad astra'' ("through adversity to the stars"). The Royal Air Force were prior residents of the site, as [[RAF Martlesham Heath]]. Experimental aircraft test flights flew from the airfield and the name was meant to reflect this. In March 2001, [[University College London]], Faculty of Engineering Sciences, chose Adastral Park to set up the first-ever postgraduate research and teaching centre on an industrial campus which existed until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/ucl_set_to_leave_suffolk_research_park_1_202294|title=UCL set to leave Suffolk research park}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the transformation of the business park many of the old buildings were removed and during the landscaping, car parks were moved to the perimeter of the site with the centre being transformed with open park land and a water feature to provide a 'park' feel to the complex. The site accommodates approximately 4000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BT Celebrates 40 years of innovation at Adastral Park|url=https://atadastral.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/bt-celebrates-40-years-of-innovation-at-adastral-park.pdf|website=www.atadastral.co.uk|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Use==

Companies based at Adastral Park besides [[British Telecom]] ([[BT Research]]) include:

*[[Juniper_Networks]]
*[[Alcatel-Lucent]]
*[[GENBAND]]
*[[Cisco]]
*[[Fujitsu]]
*[[Huawei]]
*[[O2 plc]]
*[[Arqiva]]
*[[Centre for Integrated Photonics (CIP)|CIP]]
* Milner Strategic Marketing Ltd

There is also a satellite earth station (operated by Arqiva)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arqiva.com/products-and-services/satellite-solutions/contact-us-489 Contact Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217130210/http://www.arqiva.com/products-and-services/satellite-solutions/contact-us-489 |date=December 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; - the location was chosen for the visibility of satellites on the eastern horizon.  In total there are currently 98 high-tech companies based at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atadastral.co.uk/|title=Home - BT Adastral Park|author=|date=|website=atadastral.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adastral New Town==
Over many years BT has put forward various proposals and plans to expand the business park activities. In June 2001, a framework for expanding the business park was created, but it was not linked to building any residential housing on the site. At the time BT forecast 3000–3500 additional jobs by about 2010. As recently as 2007, BT said that they could develop the business park without the need for the income from selling land for housing.

In 2006, [[Suffolk Coastal|Suffolk Coastal District Council]] (SCDC) rejected a planning application for 120 log cabins on a site next to Waldringfield Road. The rejection was on the grounds that it was too near the [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] amongst other reasons, and would result in an unacceptable increase in visitor numbers to a sensitive areas. BT initially objected on the grounds that it would interfere with their radio test area, although BT subsequently withdrew their objection provided the developer created a protective earth bund, rejected by SCDC.

BT subsequently lodged a planning application for 2000 houses to be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Redevelopment of Adastral Park|url=http://www.suffolkcoastal.gov.uk/yourdistrict/planning/devcontrol/adastralpark/default.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its closest the site comes within {{convert|88|m}} of an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adastral Park Redevelopment Project: Greenfields under threat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/18/7|newspaper=The Guardian|date=5 November 2010 &lt;!-- 15.54 GMT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are several sites of special status close by, such as Newbourne Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suffolk Wildlife Trust " Reserves &amp; Visitor Centres " Newbourne Springs |url=http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/reserves-and-visitor-centres/newbourne-springs/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327085344/http://www.suffolkwildlifetrust.org/reserves-and-visitor-centres/newbourne-springs |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allofeeding''' is a type of [[Evolutionary models of food sharing|food sharing]] [[Behavior|behaviour]] observed in [[Cooperative breeding|cooperatively breed]]ing species of [[bird]]s. Allofeeding refers to a parent, sibling or unrelated adult bird feeding [[altricial]] [[hatchling]]s, which are dependent on [[parental care]] for their survival.&lt;ref name="barrows"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yaXMBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE9ePx_sHRAhWLq1QKHUJ1CC8Q6AEINjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=Animal Behavior Desk Reference|last=Barrows|first=Edward M.|publisher=CRC Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4398-3652-1|edition=3rd|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding also refers to food sharing between adults of the same species.&lt;ref name="handicap"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ImjqhNqjiqsC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=evolution+of+allofeeding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-jfi2gMLRAhVIhlQKHVOQAHE4ChDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20allofeeding&amp;f=false|title=The Handicap Principle: A Missing Piece of Darwin's Puzzle|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|last2=Zahavi|first2=Avishag|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-19-510035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allofeeding can occur between mates during mating rituals, [[Courtship display|courtship]], egg laying or incubation, between peers of the same species, or as a form of parental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan M.|date=1980|title=Demand Behavior: A New Interpretation of Courtship Feeding|jstor=1367395|journal=The Condor|volume=82|issue=3|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/1367395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halley|first=Matthew R.|last2=Holmes|first2=Aaron L.|last3=Robinson|first3=W.

While Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows allofeed to reduce [[predation]] during incubation, Sichuan Jays allofeed to increase a female’s nutritional level prior to egg laying, and Chinstrap Penguins allofeed to strengthen the bond between the pair during chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jing|first=Yu|last2=Fang|first2=Yun|last3=Strickland|first3=Dan|last4=Lu|first4=Nan|last5=Sun|first5=Yue-Hua|date=2009|title=Alloparenting in the Rare Sichuan Jay (Perisoreus Internigrans) - Cuidado Aloparental en la Especie Rara Perisoreus internigrans|journal=The Condor|volume=111|issue=4|pages=662–667|doi=10.1525/cond.2009.080114|jstor=10.1525/cond.2009.080114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mori|first=Yoshihisa|last2=Kokubun|first2=Nobuo|last3=Shin|first3=Hyoung-Chul|last4=Takahashi|first4=Akinori|date=2010-10-01|title=An observation of between-mates feeding behaviour in chick-guarding chinstrap penguins|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|journal=Polar Biology|language=en|volume=33|issue=10|pages=1437–1438|doi=10.1007/s00300-010-0842-8|issn=0722-4060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While parental allofeeding is a common form of parental care among many species of birds, the practice is not inherently restricted to biological parents and their young, and is often done for reasons unrelated to the well-being of the chicks. Arabian Bablers, for instance, peer allofeed in an attempt at increasing their social rank, whereas the King Penguin considers those 'non-breeders' who allofeed chicks to be  altruistic and highly revered. And the far more practical Barn Owl, of course, peer allofeeds merely to reduce sibling rivalry/competition during meal times.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carlisle|first=Tamsie R.|last2=Zahavi|first2=Amotz|date=1986-04-01|title=Helping at the nest, allofeeding and social status in immature arabian babblers|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00299665|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=339–351|doi=10.1007/BF00299665|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roulin|first=A.|last2=Monstiers|first2=B.

Although many species of birds exhibit allofeeding, there are some species that do not perform allofeeding, such as Siberian Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

== Allofeeding between mates ==
Many species of migratory [[songbird]]s display allofeeding during the [[incubation period]].&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; During the incubation period, a male songbird will feed its mate, while she sits on the eggs through beak-to-beak interaction.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is suggested to be adaptive because the male is indirectly investing in its offspring.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; The male uses its energy to forage and retrieve food, and to feed the female.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This behaviour of the male reduces nutritional stress of the female because it reduces the amount of time the female spends foraging.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; In addition, the allofeeding behaviour decreases the number of times a female has to leave the nest, which in turn extends the incubation period and reduces the risk of nest being detected by a predator.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Overall, allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased fitness and is therefore considered advantageous.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; However, Nolan (1958) theorizes that allofeeding is a non-adaptive and is derived from anticipatory parental care.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

Allofeeding during the incubation period can also transpire through both the male and the female interchangeably feeding each other via beak-to-beak interactions, while a mate receiving the food incubates the eggs.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Once feeding is completed, the recipient now becomes the feeder and the mate that was just foraging incubates the eggs. For example, Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows (''Spizella breweri breweri'') allofeed in this manner.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; A recent study by Halley et al., 2015, examined allofeeding in twenty-four nests of Sagebrush Brewer’s Sparrows.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study revealed that allofeeding occurred at low frequencies (55%) in nests with biparental incubation and no allofeeding occurred in uniparental nests.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; This study suggests that allofeeding is an intraspecific signal required to maintain social bonds between mates, in addition to increasing the nutrition levels of females and concealment of the nest.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Furthermore, the study found that incubation sessions per hour were higher in biparental nests with allofeeding than in biparental nests without allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; These findings indicate that allofeeding is beneficial because it reduces the risk of predation from visually oriented predators through increased nest concealment,&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; which can maximize the fitness of males while increasing the fitness of females.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

There have been many documented observations of allofeeding between mates (mate allofeeding).&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; However, in penguins allofeeding between mates is rare.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; In 2010, [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguins]] (''P. antarctica'') allofeeding was reported during the period of chick guarding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The researchers witnessed a male feeding a female, which had a large chick in its nest.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; The behaviour was engaged by the female frequently pecking the side of the male’s bill to stimulate the male to regurgitate its food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; This resulted in the male regurgitating its food into the female’s open mouth. This allofeeding behaviour was identical to the manner in which a chick begs its parent for food.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Notably, during this behaviour the female kept the attention of male when the chick tried to gain the male’s attention.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; It is proposed that mate allofeeding in Chinstrap Penguins was performed to strengthen the bond between the pair.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

Allofeeding between mates can also occur during courtship.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding occurs in half of bird subfamilies and mainly appears in monogamous bird species.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Courtship allofeeding is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs or increase a female’s nutritional level before laying eggs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; For example, in the Sichuan Jay ([[Sichuan jay|''P. internigrans'']]), females are fed by only one male during courtship.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is suggested that allofeeding the female during courtship, increases a female’s nutritional level before egg laying.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This behaviour was also recorded in the Grey Jays (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Other species of birds display allofeeding during courtship. Additionally, courtship allofeeding in some birds species is hypothesized to strengthen the bond between pairs.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

== Allofeeding and parental care ==

=== ''Aptenodytes patagonicus'' ===
[[File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Emperor-feeding_hg.jpg|thumb|Emperor Penguin (''Aptenodytes patagonicus)'' feeding its offspring]]
A parent feeding a non-biological chick via bill-to-bill interactions is a form of allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lecomte|first=Nicolas|last2=Kuntz|first2=Gregoire|last3=Lambert|first3=Nicolas|last4=Gendner|first4=Jean-Paul|last5=Handrich|first5=Yves|last6=Maho|first6=Yvon Le|last7=Bost|first7=Charles-André|title=Alloparental feeding in the king penguin|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347205004173|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=71|issue=2|pages=457–462|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jouventin|first=Pierre|last2=Barbraud|first2=Christophe|last3=Rubin|first3=Michel|title=Adoption in the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1023–1029|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80102-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental allofeeding occurs in all altricial species of birds to ensure proper growth, development, and to prevent starvation of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eggers|first=Sönke|last2=Griesser|first2=Michael|last3=Ekman|first3=Jan|date=2005-01-01|title=Predator-induced plasticity in nest visitation rates in the Siberian jay (Perisoreus infaustus)|url=http://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/16/1/309/206728/Predatorinduced-plasticity-in-nest-visitation|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|pages=309–315|doi=10.1093/beheco/arh163|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of allofeeding has been shown to be a form of parental care in some species, such as in King Penguins ([[King penguin|''A. patagonicus'']]).&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguins are pelagic seabirds.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; King Penguin chicks form dense groups called crèches during winter for social thermoregulation when food availability is low.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The formation of crèches results from the parents interchangeably leaving starving chicks to gather food from the sea.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; A study by Lecomte et al., 2015 examined the allofeeding behaviour in King Penguins, in which they marked the white underbellies of 74 non-breeding adults and 103 breeding pairs with a unique dark colouring called dye-mark code of Nyanzol-D.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) found 22% of the marked adults feed 65% of the chicks in crèches, revealing that allofeeding behaviour was most common during the breeding season.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Lecomte et al. (2015) also identified that most of the 22% of adult King Penguins demonstrating allofeeding behaviour were unable to successfully breed along with few breeders performing the behaviour.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The allofeeding behaviour resulted in more feedings for chicks,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; which is consistent with study by Pierre et al. (1994) that showed that allofeeding in penguins increases the chick growth rate from 35g/day to 190g/day.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; From these results, Lecomte et al., (2015) concluded that allofeeding increased the survival rate of chicks in crèches.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The results imply that parental allofeeding in King Penguins is an altruistic behaviour, where allofeeding benefits the young at a cost to the non-biological parent.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Notably, no direct benefits to the non-biological parents have been described.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; The cost of allofeeding non-biological chicks resulted in no detrimental effects to the fitness of the [[Alloparenting|alloparent]], because the cost of allofeeding is low (several grams) when compared to the nutritional costs of an adult king penguin, which is several kilograms.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; However, it is suggested that allofeeding many chicks may cost each chick lost meals that can cause negative effects on the fitness of allofed chicks.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In addition, allofeeding decreases when non-biological parents had offspring.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== ''Pseudomonas antarctica'' ===
The [[Chinstrap penguin|Chinstrap Penguin]] (''P. antarctica'') is another species of penguin that displays allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Allofeeding in the Chinstrap Penguin has been observed between the female and its offspring.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt; Similar to mate allofeeding in this species, the offspring of a female will peck the side of the female’s bill to signal the female to regurgitate its food into the chick's open mouth.&lt;ref name=":54" /&gt;

=== ''Perisoreus internigrans'' ===
In Sichuan Jays ([[Sichuan jay|''P. Internigrans'']]), females are not the only sex that participates in the allofeeding of their offspring.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; During their first week of life, the chicks are only fed by the male.&lt;ref name=":73"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://britishbirds.co.uk/article/studies-of-less-familiar-birds-162-siberian-jay/|title=Studies of less Familiar birds 162 Siberian Jay - British Birds|last=Blomgren|first=Arne Blomgren|date=|work=British Birds|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male forages and stores food in a pouch within its throat. At the nest, the male regurgitates the semi-digested food from its pouch into the mouths of its chicks.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; After the first week, the male continues to feed the chicks while the female begins feeding the chicks.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The female uses the same method as the male.&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt;

== Peer allofeeding ==

=== ''Turdoides sqamiceps'' ===
There have been many reported cases of allofeeding between siblings in several species of birds.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; For example, the Arabian Babblers ([[Arabian babbler|''T. sqamiceps'']]) are a territorial, desert inhibiting species of bird that participate in cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; In this species, non-breeders show numerous types of cooperative behaviour, including allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Adult and immature Babblers, as well as previous and newly fledged Babblers, will frequently engage in allofeeding behaviour.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Carlisle et al. (1986) revealed that Arabian Babblers participate in peer allofeeding in order to increase social rank, which increases fitness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This allofeeding behaviour is supported by the Zahavi's hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; An individual (a dominate Babbler) can increase in social rank by allofed a subordinate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; On the contrary, an individual (a subordinate Babbler) can decrease in social rank when they are allofed by a dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;  Subordinate Babblers have been observed refusing to be allofeed by dominate Babbler.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The refusal resulted in the dominate Babbler becoming aggressive with the subordinate - hitting or chasing the subordinate.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Dominate Babblers also showed the same aggressive behaviours when a subordinate tried to allofeed it.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== ''Tyto alba'' ===
Another species that exhibits peer allofeeding is the [[Barn owl|Barn Owl]] (''T. alba'').&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Barn Owl nest siblings establish a hierarchy for the sharing of food resources via vocal negotiations.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; It is suggested that Barn Owl nest siblings show peer allofeeding to reduce sibling competition in the food sharing hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Peer allofeeding observed in 60 nestling pairs revealed that the behaviour occurs by a donor sibling placing the food item on the ground in front of the receiver sibling, which transfers the food item to its bill using its talons.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; Alternatively, the donor sibling uses its bill to place the food item in the bill of the receiver sibling.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt; As well, peer allofeeding behaviour in Barn Owl siblings is proposed to increase the [[inclusive fitness]] of the peer performing the allofeeding.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;

== Intraspecific allofeeding ==

=== ''Perisoreus Internigrans'' ===
[[File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Perisoreus_canadensis_feeding_at_nest.jpg|thumb|Gray Jays (''Perisoreus canadensis)'' feeding offspring at the nest]]
Intraspecific allofeeding in Sichuan Jays (''[[Sichuan jay|P. internigrans]]'') is performed during the nestling and fledging period by non-breeders.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; One to three non-breeders support a nesting breeding pair by feeding the chicks, regurgitating the food from their throat pouches.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":73" /&gt; In 2009, Jing et al. determined that two non-breeders contributed to 44% of feedings in the nest of two Sichuan Jays.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  Jing et al. (2009) suggest that allofeeding behaviour contributes to increased nest survival.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

In Sichuan Jays, allofeeding is hypothesized to be evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In this species, two to three non-breeders will allofeed the young of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; The large body mass (21% heavier than Siberian Jays) of the Sichuan Jays, and the presence of more than one non-breeder, allows one non-breeder to ward off a predator while another non-breeder protects the young from additional predators.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Both the large body mass of the non-breeders and the presence of multiple non-breeders reduces the risk of injury or death when predators are encountered.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefits of allofeeding the young outweighs the cost of injury or death of the non-breeder and/or chick when more than one non-breeder is present.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Peer allofeeding has also been observed in the Gray Jay (''[[Grey jay|P. canadensis]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Gray Jay, non-breeders allofeed the young after fledging.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

Not all species of jays allofeed their young, such as the Siberian Jay (''[[Siberian jay|P. infaustus]]'').&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; In the Siberian Jays, non-breeders do not allofeed the chicks of a breeding pair.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; It is predicted that Siberian Jays do not display allofeeding because the cost of predation is too high.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; Siberian Jays are continuously threatened by a more dangerous predators, the Eurasian Sparrowhawk and Northern Goshawk, then Gray Jays, which are threatened by Eurasian red squirrel.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;  One non-breeder per breeding pair and the small size (21% less body mass than the Sichuan Jays) of the Siberian Jays, in combination with continuous risk of predation, reveals that the non-breeding Siberian Jays are unable to confront predators and protect the nest simultaneously.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This indicates that the cost of allofeeding the young is more costly to the non-breeder when one non-breeder is present because an encounter with a predator increases the risk of injury and death of both the young and the non-breeder.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This reveals that the benefit of allofeeding the young does not exceed the cost of injury or death of non-breeder and/or young.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt; This is consistent with the predator-avoidance hypothesis, suggesting that the cost of allofeeding in the Siberian Jays prevents allofeeding from being evolutionary selected.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;

[[Image:0008MAN-KourosHead2.jpg|left|thumb|Head of a kouros in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] bearing a typical '''archaic smile'''.]]

The '''Archaic smile''' was used by Greek Archaic sculptors,&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; especially in the second quarter of the 6th century BCE, possibly to suggest that their subject was alive, and infused with a sense of well-being. One of the most famous examples of the Archaic Smile is the [[Kroisos Kouros]]. 

The dying warrior from the west pediment of the Temple of Aphaia, Aegina, Greece is an interesting context as the warrior is near death.

In the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] Period of [[ancient Greece]] (roughly 600&amp;nbsp;BCE to 480&amp;nbsp;BCE), the art that proliferated contained images of people who had the archaic smile.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During those two centuries before the mid-5th century BCE, the archaic smile was widely sculpted, as evidenced by statues found in excavations all across the Greek mainland, Asia Minor, and on islands in the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; It has been theorized that in this period, artists felt it either represents that they were blessed by the gods in their actions, thus the smile, or that it is similar to pre-planned smiles in modern photos.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.
[[Image:Moscophoros22.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Moscophoros]]'' of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], ca 570 BCE]]
The significance of the convention is not known, although it is often assumed that for the Greeks this kind of smile reflected a state of ideal health and well-being. It is best anthropological practice to assume expertise in execution of craft and to look for formal/stylistic reasons why cultural artifacts appear as they do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veronica2305.tripod.com/Archaic%20Age.htm Middle Archaic Phase(Smile)] Retrieved 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been suggested that it is simply the result of a technical difficulty in fitting the curved shape of the mouth to the somewhat blocklike head typical of Archaic sculpture. Richard Neer theorizes that the Archaic Smile may actually be a marker of status since aristocrats of multiple cities throughout Greece were referred to as the ''Geleontes'' or "smiling ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are alternative views to the archaic smile being "flat and quite unnatural looking". This is how [[John Fowles]] describes the archaic smile in his novel ''[[The Magus (novel)|The Magus]]'' (Chapter 23): "...full of the purest metaphysical good humour [...] timelessly intelligent and timelessly amused. [...] Because a star explodes and a thousand worlds like ours die, we know this world is. That is the smile: that what might not be, is [...] When I die, I shall have this by my bedside. It is the last human face I want to see." To viewers habituated to [[realism (arts)|realism]], it could be seen as a movement towards naturalism.

A '''bestiary''', or '''''bestiarum vocabulum''''', is a [[compendium]] of beasts. Originating in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], bestiaries were made popular in the [[Middle Ages]] in illustrated volumes that described various animals and even rocks. The [[natural history]] and illustration of each beast was usually accompanied by a moral lesson. This reflected the belief that the world itself was the Word of God, and that every living thing had its own special meaning. For example, the [[pelican]], which was believed to tear open its breast to bring its young to life with its own blood, was a living representation of [[Jesus]]. The bestiary, then, is also a reference to the [[symbol]]ic language of [[animals in Christian art|animals in Western Christian art]] and literature.

==History==
The earliest bestiary in the form in which it was later popularized was an anonymous 2nd century [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] volume called the ''[[Physiologus]]'', which itself summarized ancient knowledge and wisdom about animals in the writings of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors such as [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]'' and various works by [[Herodotus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Solinus]], [[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] and other naturalists.

Following the ''Physiologus'', Saint [[Isidore of Seville]] (Book XII of the ''[[Etymologiae]]'') and [[Saint Ambrose]] expanded the religious message with reference to passages from the [[Bible]] and the [[Septuagint]]. They and other authors freely expanded or modified pre-existing models, constantly refining the moral content without interest or access to much more detail regarding the factual content. Nevertheless, the often fanciful accounts of these beasts were widely read and generally believed to be true. A few observations found in bestiaries, such as the [[Bird migration|migration]] of birds, were discounted by the natural philosophers of later centuries, only to be rediscovered in the modern scientific era.

Medieval bestiaries are remarkably similar in sequence of the animals of which they treat. Bestiaries were particularly popular in [[England]] and [[France]] around the 12th century and were mainly compilations of earlier texts. The [[Aberdeen Bestiary]] is one of the best known of over 50 manuscript bestiaries surviving today.

Bestiaries influenced early [[heraldry]] in the Middle Ages, giving ideas for [[charge (heraldry)|charges]] and also for the artistic form. Bestiaries continue to give inspiration to coats of arms created in our time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Stephen|editor-last=Friar|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry|location=London|year=1987|publisher=[[A &amp; C Black|Alphabooks/A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=0 906670 44 6|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two illuminated [[Psalter]]s, the [[Queen Mary Psalter]] ([[British Library]] Ms. Royal 2B, vii) and the [[Isabella Psalter]] (State Library, [[Munich]]), contain full Bestiary cycles. The bestiary in the Queen Mary Psalter is found in the "marginal" decorations that occupy about the bottom quarter of the page, and are unusually extensive and coherent in this work. In fact the bestiary has been expanded beyond the source in the Norman bestiary of Guillaume le Clerc to ninety animals. Some are placed in the text to make correspondences with the [[psalm]] they are illustrating.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen Mary psalter: a study of affect and audience By Anne Rudloff Stanton, p44ff, Diane Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also made his own bestiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Selections from the Bestiary of Leonardo da Vinci | first1=Oliver |last1=Evans |journal=The Journal of American Folklore |volume=64 |number=254 |date=Oct–Dec 1951 |pages=393–396 |jstor=537007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''volucrary'' is a similar collection of the symbols of birds that is sometimes found in conjunction with bestiaries. The most widely known volucrary in the Renaissance was [[Johannes de Cuba]]'s ''Gart der Gesundheit''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Cuba|first1=Jean|title=Garden Of Health|date=1501|publisher=Verard Antoine (Paris)|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2100150b|archiveurl=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb386198123|archivedate=2007|language=French|format=758 scanned pages with black &amp; white illustrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes 122 birds and which was printed in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;''Hortus sanitatis deutsch.'' Mainz (Peter Schöffer) 1485; Neudrucke München 1924 and 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bestiary content==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Medieval bestiaries often contained detailed descriptions and illustrations of species native to Western Europe, exotic animals and what in modern times are considered to be imaginary animals. Descriptions of the animals included the physical characteristics associated with the creature, although these were often physiologically incorrect, along with the Christian morals that the animal represented. The description was then normally followed with an artistic illustration of the animal as described in the bestiary.

Bestiaries were organized in different ways based upon the text. The descriptions could be organized by animal groupings, such as terrestrial and marine creatures, or presented in an alphabetical manner. However, the texts gave no distinction between existing and imaginary animals. Descriptions of creatures such as [[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[basilisk]], [[griffin]] and [[caladrius]] were common in such works and found intermingled amongst accounts of bears, boars, deer, lions, and elephants.

This lack of separation has often been associated with the assumption that people during this time believed in what the modern period classifies as nonexistent or "[[imaginary creatures]]". However, this assumption is currently under debate, with various explanations being offered.

Some scholars, such as Pamela Gravestock, have written on the theory that medieval people did not actually think such creatures existed but instead focused on the belief in the importance of the Christian morals these creatures represented, and that the importance of the moral did not change regardless if the animal existed or not.

The contents of medieval bestiaries were often obtained and created from combining older textual sources and accounts of animals, such as the ''[[Physiologus]]'', with newer observations and writings. In this way, the content of such written works was constantly added to and built upon.

==Modern bestiaries==
In modern times, artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Saul Steinberg]] have produced their own bestiaries. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote a contemporary bestiary of sorts, the ''[[Book of Imaginary Beings]]'', which collects imaginary beasts from bestiaries and fiction. Nicholas Christopher wrote a literary novel called "The Bestiary" (Dial, 2007) that describes a lonely young man's efforts to track down the world's most complete bestiary. [[John Henry Fleming]]'s ''Fearsome Creatures of Florida''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fearsomecreatures.com |title=Fearsome Creatures of Florida by John Henry Fleming |website=Fearsomecreatures.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Pocol Press, 2009) borrows from the medieval bestiary tradition to impart moral lessons about the environment. [[Caspar Henderson]]'s The Book of Barely Imagined Beings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barelyimaginedbeings.com |title=The Book of Barely Imagined Beings |website=Barelyimaginedbeings.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Granta]] 2012, [[Chicago University Press]] 2013), subtitled "A 21st Century Bestiary," explores how humans imagine animals in a time of rapid environmental change. In July 2014, Jonathan Scott wrote The Blessed Book of Beasts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rna.org/news/184377/Beasts-from-the-East.htm |title=Religion News Association &amp; Foundation |website=Rna.org |date=2016-11-21 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Christian Publications, featuring 101 animals from the various translations of the Bible, in keeping with the tradition of the bestiary found in the writings of the Saints, including Saint John Chrysostom.

The '''Bielefeld School''' is a group of German historians based originally at [[Bielefeld University]] who promote [[social history]] and [[political history]] using quantification and the methods of [[political science]] and [[sociology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lorenz, Chris "Wehler, Hans-Ulrich" pages 1289–1290 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'', Volume 2 page 1289&lt;/ref&gt;  The leaders include [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]], [[Jürgen Kocka]] and [[Reinhart Koselleck]]. Instead of emphasizing the personalities of great historical leaders, as in the conventional approach, it concentrates on socio-cultural developments. History as "historical social science" (as Wehler described it) has mainly been explored in the context of studies of German society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The movement has published the scholarly journal ''{{ill|Geschichte und Gesellschaft: Zeitschrift fur Historische Sozialwissenschaft|de|Geschichte und Gesellschaft}}'' since 1975.

Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s–60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society"—''Gesellschaftsgeschichte''—has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by Wehler and his Bielefeld School as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the [[modernization theory]] of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''German Studies Review'' 1984 7(3): 451-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte==
''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' (1987–) is Wehler's comprehensive 5-volume history of German society in the eighteenth-twentieth centuries. Each volume approaches historical processes from a social history perspective, organized under the themes of demographics, economics, and social equality.  His detailed structural analysis of developmental processes supported by a vast body of notes and statistics sometimes obscures the larger context. Nonetheless, patterns of continuity and change in the social fabric are emphasized.   More than a historiographical synthesis of Ranke and Marx (envisioned by some German historians after the catastrophe of World War I), Wehler's work incorporates [[Max Weber]]'s concepts of authority, economy, and culture and strives toward a concept of "total history."

Volumes 1–2 cover the period from feudalism through the Revolution of 1848. Volume 3 ''Von der "Deutschen Doppelrevolution" bis zum Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges 1849–1914'' (1995) employs Wehler's longtime emphasis on a German [[Sonderweg]] or "special path" as the root of Nazism and the German catastrophe in the twentieth century. Wehler places the origins of Germany's path to disaster in the 1860s–1870s, when economic modernization took place, but political modernization did not happen and the old Prussian rural elite remained in firm control of the army, diplomacy and the civil service.  Traditional, aristocratic, premodern society battled an emerging capitalist, bourgeois, modernizing society. Recognizing the importance of modernizing forces in industry and the economy and in the cultural realm, Wehler argues that reactionary traditionalism dominated the political hierarchy of power in Germany, as well as social mentalities and in class relations (Klassenhabitus).  Wehler's ''Deutsche Gesellschaftsgeschichte: Vom Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bis zur Gründung der Beiden Deutschen Staaten 1914–1949'' (2003) is the fourth volume of his monumental history of German society.  The catastrophic German politics between 1914 and 1945 are interpreted in terms of a delayed modernization of its political structures. At the core of Wehler's fourth volume is his treatment of "the middle class" and "revolution," each of which was instrumental in shaping the twentieth century. Wehler's examination of Nazi rule is shaped by his concept of "charismatic domination," which focuses heavily on Adolf Hitler.  The fifth volume will extend to 1990; none of the series has yet been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;A partial summary appears in Hans-Ulrich Wehler, ''The German Empire, 1871–1918'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]] disagreed with the Bielefeld school regarding the Sonderweg thesis. Instead he argued for the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the twentieth century in a "[[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|failed bourgeois revolution]]" in 1848. Influenced by the [[New Left]], Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history in the Imperial period "from below."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore S. Hamerow, "Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History" ''The American Historical Review'', February 1983, Volume 88#1 pages 53–72 quote on page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'', he launched a critique of the "top-down" approach of the Bielefeld School. Evans and the others wanted a perspective from the Left that stressed the importance of the working class by highlighting "the importance of the grass roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, "Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians" in Evans, ed. ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'' (1978) pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; Along with historians [[Geoff Eley]] and [[David Blackbourn]], Evans emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism.&lt;ref&gt;See Evans, ''In Defence of History,'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural turn===
From the 1980s, however, the Bielefeld school was increasingly challenged by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'?

Kocka responded by arguing that social history has become so all-pervasive that it has lost its position as the cutting edge within historiography. He says, "But: in the meantime social historians' approaches, viewpoints, topics and results have been accepted and incorporated by many other historians who would not call themselves social historians. Social history has successfully penetrated its opponents."  He expects to see a return to social history, this time with more cultural and linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Magnússon, (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''biocapacity''' or '''biological capacity''' of an [[ecosystem]] is an estimate of its production of certain biological materials such as [[natural resources]], and its absorption and filtering of other materials such as [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/|website=[[Global Footprint Network]]: Advancing the Science of Sustainability|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yue|first1=Dongxia|last2=Guo|first2=Jianjun|last3=Hui|first3=Cang|title=Scale dependency of biocapacity and the fallacy of unsustainable development|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2013|volume=126|pages=13–19|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.04.022}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; “Useful biological 

Biocapacity is expressed in terms of [[global hectares]] per person, thus is dependent on human population. A global hectare is an adjusted unit that represents the average biological productivity of all productive [[hectares]] on Earth in a given year (because not all hectares produce the same amount of [[ecosystem services]]). Biocapcity is calculated from United Nations population and land use data, and may be reported at various regional levels, such as a city, a country, or the world as a whole. 

For example, there were 12 billion hectares of biologically productive land and water on this planet in 2008. Dividing by the number of people alive in that year, 6.7 billion, gives a biocapacity of 1.8 global hectares per person . This assumes that no land is set aside for other species that consume the same biological material as humans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/ecological_wealth_of_nations_en Ecological Wealth of Nations: Earth's Biocapacity as a new framework for International Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Biocapacity is used together with [[Ecological Footprint]] as a method of measuring [[Human impact on the environment]]. Biocapacity and Ecological Footprint are tools created by the [[Global Footprint Network]], used in sustainability studies around the world.

==Applications of biocapacity==
An increase in global population can result in a decrease in biocapacity.  This is usually due to the fact that the Earth’s resources have to be shared; therefore, there becomes little to supply the increasing demand of the increasing [[population]].&lt;ref name=WWF&gt;{{cite web|title=What does ecological overshoot mean?|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/overshoot/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, this issue can be resolved by [[outsourcing]]. However, resources will run out due to the increasing demands and as a result a collapse of an ecosystem can be the consequence of such actions.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; When the [[ecological footprint]] becomes greater than the biocapacity of the population, a [[ecological deficit|biocapacity deficit]] is suspected.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap&gt;{{cite web|title=Natures regenerative capacity|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/all_publications/living_planet_report/demands_on_our_planet/biocapacity/|website=World Wildlife Fund|publisher=WWF|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'Global biocapacity' is a term sometimes used to describe the total capacity of an ecosystem to support various continuous activity and changes.  When the [[ecological footprint]] of a population exceeds the biocapacity of the environment it lives in, this can be called an 'ecological overshoot'.&lt;ref name=WWFbiocap /&gt;&lt;ref name=RefiningEF&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Venetoulis|first1=Jason|last2=Talberth|first2=John|title=Refining the ecological footprint|journal=Environment, Development and Sustainability|date=5 January 2007|volume=10|issue=4|pages=441–469|doi=10.1007/s10668-006-9074-z}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 report stated that people were using an equivalence of 1.5 Earths to compensate for their needs.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt;  However other sources have suggested that depletion of cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land is not occurring on an aggregate, global level. Hence, virtually all of the ecological overshoot comes from the measure of the rate at which carbon dioxide is accumulating in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does the Shoe Fit? Real versus Imagined Ecological Footprints|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001700|publisher=PLOS biology journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional stresses of [[greenhouse gas]]es, [[climate change]], and [[ocean acidification]] can also aggravate the problem.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; In reference to the definition of biocapacity: 1.5 Earths means [[renewable resource]]s will eventually result in depletion because they are being produced faster and more often than the resources can be re-grown.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; Therefore, it will one year and six months for the resources we use to be able to regenerate again and in addition absorb all the waste we manufactured as well.&lt;ref name=WWF /&gt; So instead of taking one year, we are now in-taking enough [[resource]]s that should last us one year and six months.

In addition, if this matter becomes severe, an [[nature reserve|ecological reserve]] will be set on areas to preserve their ecosystems. Awareness about our depleting resources include: agricultural land, forest resources and rangeland.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hayden|first1=Anders|title=ecological footprint (EF)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1699724/ecological-footprint-EF|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.|accessdate=11 August 2014|date=December 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biocapacity used in correlation to ecological footprint can therefore suggest whether a specific population, region, country or part of a world is living in the means of their capital. Accordingly,§98 the study of biocapacity and ecological footprint is known as the [[ecological footprint|Ecological Footprint Analysis (EFA)]].&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt;

Biocapacity is also affected on the technology used during the year. With new technologies emerging, it is not whether the technology in that year is good or bad but whether how the technology impacts resource supply and demand; which in return affects biocapacity.&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; Hence what is considered “useful” can change from year to year (e.g. use of corn (maize) stover for cellulosic ethanol production would result in corn stover becoming a useful material, and thus increase the biocapacity of maize cropland).

Moreover, environmentalists have created [[ecological footprint|ecological footprint calculators]] for a single person(s) to determine whether they are encompassing more than what is available for them in their population.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hopton|first1=Matthew E.|last2=White|first2=Denis|title=A simplified ecological footprint at a regional scale|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=2012|volume=111|pages=279–286|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.07.005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 August 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, biocapacity results will be applied to their ecological footprint to determine how much they may contribute or take away from sustainable development.

In general, biocapacity is the amount of resources available to people at a specific moment in time to a specific population ([[resource|supply]]) and to differentiate between ecological footprint – that is the demand constructed on behalf of a '''regional ecosystem'''.&lt;ref name=RegionalScale /&gt; Biocapacity is able to determine the human impacts on Earth. By determining productivity of land, hence the resources available for human consumption, biocapacity will be able to predict and perhaps examine the effects on the ecosystems closely based on collected results of human consumption.
.The biocapacity of an area is calculated by multiplying the actual physical area by the yield factor and the appropriate equivalence factor. Biocapacity is usually expressed in [[global hectare|global hectares (gha)]].&lt;ref name=Serres&gt;{{cite web|title=Bioresources, Biocapacity of Ecosystems, and related terms|url=http://institutmichelserres.ens-lyon.fr/spip.php?article37|website=Michel Serres Institute: for resources and public goods|accessdate=11 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since global hectares is able to convert [[Consumer (food chain)|human consumptions]] like food and water into a measurement, biocapacity can be applied to determine the [[carrying capacity]] of the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7124">'''Brain-body interactions''' are patterns of neural activity in the [[central nervous system]] to coordinate the activity between the brain and body. The nervous system consists of [[Central nervous system|central]] and [[Peripheral nervous system|peripheral]] nervous systems and coordinates the actions of an animal by transmitting [[Action potential|signals]] to and from different parts of its body. The [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] are interwoven with the body and interact with other [[organ system]]s through the [[Somatic nervous system|somatic]], [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] and [[Enteric nervous system|enteric]] nervous systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freund|first=Patrick|last2=Friston|first2=Karl|last3=Thompson|first3=Alan J.|last4=Stephan|first4=Klaas E.|last5=Ashburner|first5=John|last6=Bach|first6=Dominik R.|last7=Nagy|first7=Zoltan|last8=Helms|first8=Gunther|last9=Draganski|first9=Bogdan|date=2016|title=Embodied neurology: an integrative framework for neurological disorders|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=139|issue=Pt 6|pages=1855–1861|doi=10.1093/brain/aww076|issn=1460-2156|pmc=4892755|pmid=27105896|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neural pathway]]s regulate brain-body interactions and allow to [[Interoception|sense]] and [[Motor control|control]] its body and interact with the environment.

A '''brand''' is a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes an organization or product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;[[American Marketing Association]] [http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx?dLetter=B Dictionary]. Retrieved 2011-06-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Marketing|publisher=fahy&amp; jobber|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brands are used in [[business]], [[marketing]], and [[advertising]]. '''Name brands''' are sometimes distinguished from generic or [[store brand]]s.

The practice of branding is thought to have begun with the ancient Egyptians who were known to have engaged in [[livestock branding]] as early as 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, H., ''The Miracle Of Man,'' London, Longacre, 1946, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Branding was used to differentiate one person’s cattle from another's by means of a distinctive symbol burned into the animal’s skin with a hot [[branding iron]]. If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. However, the term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that ‘brand’ now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time, the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics and fish sauce.

'''Branding''' is a set of [[marketing]] and communication methods that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand’s identity, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 |title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=17 |pages=4 |year=2008 |last1=Ghodeswar |first1=Bhimrao M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, and therefore branding is one of a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;ranchhod, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by assessing the effectiveness of these branding components.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=Kevin Lane|date=1993-01-01|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|jstor=1252054|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=57|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.2307/1252054}}&lt;/ref&gt; As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is a marketing technique to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; When a customer is familiar with a brand, or favours it incomparably to its competitors, this is when a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation’s balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value, and [[brand valuation]] is an important management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.

The word ‘brand’ is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''commodity brand'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].

==Etymology==
The word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|publication-date=1983|publication-place=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with branding irons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brandingirons.com/index.html |title=The Evolution of Branding | publisher=Branding Irons Unlimited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/slave2.html The branding of slaves.] ''The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities''&lt;/ref&gt;  The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with craftsmen's products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current meaning.

==History==

Branding and labelling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the practice of [[Livestock branding|branding livestock]] in order to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE.&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Khan |first1= Saif Ullah |last2= Mufti |first2= Owais |title= The Hot History &amp; Cold Future of Brands |journal= Journal of Managerial Sciences |volume= 1 |issue= 1 |year= 2007 |pages= 75–87 |url= http://qurtuba.edu.pk/jms/default_files/JMS/1_1/5_saif_ullah.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, purchasers realised that the brand provided information about origin as well as about ownership, and could serve as a guide to quality. Branding was adapted by farmers, potters and traders for use on other types of goods such as pottery and ceramics. Forms of branding or proto-branding emerged spontaneously and independently throughout Africa, Asia and Europe at different times, depending on local conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Seals, which acted as quasi-brands, have been found on early Chinese products of the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BCE); large numbers of seals survive from the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan]] civilization of the Indus Valley (3,300–1,300 BCE) where the local community depended heavily on trade; cylinder seals came into use in [[Ur]] in Mesopotamia in around 3,000 BCE and facilitated the labelling of goods and property; and the use of maker's marks on pottery was commonplace in both ancient Greece and Rome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.5937/markt1503179S |title= The origin and historical development of branding and advertising in the old civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe |journal= Marketing |volume= 46 |issue= 3 |pages= 179 |year= 2015 |last1= Starcevic |first1= Sladjana }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identity marks, such as stamps on ceramics, were also used in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Starcevic, S., "The Origin and Historical Development of Branding and Advertising in the Old Civilizations of Africa, Asia and Europe," ''Marketing,'' Vol. 46, No, 3, 2015, pp 29-46&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has argued that the "consumer packaging functions of protection, utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |page= 107 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; She has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1,500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which consumers used to glean information about the type of goods and the quality. Systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer, which were understood to convey information about product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1177/027467022001009 |title= Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal= Journal of Macromarketing |volume= 22 |pages= 98 |year= 2016 |last1= Twede |first1= Diana }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the [[urban revolution]] in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] in the 4th century BCE, when large-scale economies started mass-producing commodities such as alcoholic drinks, cosmetics and textiles. These ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality-control over commodities, and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, gave way to clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus giving the product a personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/523676 |title= Prehistories of Commodity Branding |journal= Current Anthropology |volume= 49 |pages= 7 |year= 2008 |last1= Wengrow |first1= David }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all historians agree that these markings are comparable with modern brands or labels, with some suggesting that the early pictorial brands or simple thumbprints used in pottery should be termed ''proto-brands''&lt;ref name=MooreReid2008&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/00076790802106299 |title= The birth of brand: 4000 years of branding |journal= Business History |volume= 50 |issue= 4 |pages= 419 |year= 2008 |last1= Moore |first1= Karl |last2= Reid |first2= Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt; while other historians argue that the presence of these simple markings does not imply that mature [[brand management]] practices operated.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

In [[ancient Rome]], a commercial brand or inscription applied to objects offered for sale was known as a [[titulus pictus]]. The inscription typically specified information such as place of origin, destination, type of product and occasionally quality claims or the name of the manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: Latin Words and Phrases, http://www.2qk.net/latin-words-and-phrases.html - "Titulus pictus[:] A titulus pictus is a commercial inscription made on the surface of certain artefacts.

and with the rise of the [[merchant]]'s [[guild]]s the use of marks resurfaced and was applied to specific types of goods. By the 13th century the use of maker's marks had become evident on a broad range of goods. In 1266 makers' marks on bread became compulsory in England.&lt;ref&gt;Martino, T., ''Trademark Dilution,'' Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The Italians used brands in the form of [[watermark]]s on paper in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Colapinto|first= John|title= Famous Names |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/10/03/111003fa_fact_colapinto |accessdate= 9 October 2011|newspaper= The New Yorker|date= 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blind stamp]]s, [[hallmark]]s, and silver-makers' marks - all types of brand - became widely used across Europe during this period.

A characteristic feature of 19th-century mass-marketing was the widespread use of branding, originating with the advent of packaged [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref name=KhanMufti2007/&gt; [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] moved the production of many household items, such as [[soap]], from local communities to centralized [[factory|factories]]. When shipping their items, the factories would literally [[wood branding|brand]] their [[logo]] or company insignia on the barrels used, effectively using a corporate trademark as a quasi-brand.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzkopf, S., "Turning Trade Marks into Brands: How Advertising Agencies Created Brands in the Global Market Place, 1900–1930," ''CGR Working Paper,'' Queen Mary University, London, 18 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Factories established following the [[Industrial Revolution]] introduced mass-produced goods and needed to sell their products to a wider market - that is, to customers previously familiar only with locally produced goods. &lt;ref&gt;Tedlow, R.A. and Jones, G., ''The Rise and Fall of Mass Marketing'', Routledge, N.Y., 1993, Chapter 2; scholars describe this period as the era of "mass marketing"&lt;/ref&gt; It quickly became apparent that a generic package of soap had difficulty competing with familiar, local products. Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realise that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands. &lt;ref&gt;Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., "Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research," Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868-882&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the "cool" factor. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer's recommendation.

The process of giving a brand "human" characteristics represented, at least in part, a response to consumer concerns about mass-produced goods.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, M., ''Brand Failures: The truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time,'' London, Kogan-Page, 2005, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quaker Oats Company]] began using the image of the ''Quaker man'' in place of a trademark from the late 1870s, with great success.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

Other brands which date from that era, such as [[Uncle Ben's]] rice and [[Kellogg's]] breakfast cereal, furnish illustrations of the trend.

By the early 1900s, [[trade press|trade-press]] publications, [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]] and advertising [[expert]]s began producing books and pamphlets exhorting manufacturers to bypass retailers and to advertise direct to consumers with strongly branded messages. Around 1900, advertising guru [[James Walter Thompson]] published a house advertisement explaining [[trademark]] advertising. This was an early commercial explanation of what scholars now recognize as modern branding and the beginnings of brand management.&lt;ref&gt;Petty, R.D., "A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing," in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G. Brian Jones &amp; Mark Tadajewski (eds), Oxon, Routledge, 2016, pp 106-08.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend continued to the 1980s, and {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} is quantified in concepts such as [[value (ethics)|brand value]] and [[brand equity]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} [[Naomi Klein]] has described this development as "brand equity mania".&lt;ref name="nologo" /&gt; In 1988, for example, [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]] purchased [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] for six times what the company was worth on paper. Business analysts reported that what they really purchased was the brand name.

With the rise of [[mass media]] in the early 20th century, companies soon adopted techniques that would allow their messages to stand out; [[slogan]]s, [[mascot]]s, and [[jingle]]s began to appear on [[radio]] in the 1920s and in early [[television]] broadcasting in the 1930s. Soap manufacturers sponsored many of the earliest [[radio drama|radio-drama]] series, and the genre became known as ''[[soap opera]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, M.A., ''Soap Opera History,'' 1st ed., BDD Books; 1991, {{ISBN|0792454510}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1940s manufacturers began to recognize the way in which consumers had started to develop relationships with their brands in a social/psychological/anthropological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Mildred Pierce, [http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm Newmediagroup.co.uk] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206032132/http://newmediagroup.co.uk/pphistory1.htm |date= December 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertisers began to use [[motivational research]] and [[consumer research]] to gather insights into consumer purchasing. Strong branded campaigns for Chrysler and Exxon/Esso, using insights drawn from research into psychology and cultural anthropology, led to some of most enduring campaigns of the 20th-century.&lt;ref&gt;Karmasin, H., "Ernest Dichter’s Studies on Automobile Marketing", in Schwarzkopf, S. and Gries, R. (eds.), ''Ernest Dichter and Motivation Research: New Perspectives on the Making of Post-war Consumer Culture,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 109-125&lt;/ref&gt; Brand advertisers began to imbue goods and services with a personality, based on the insight that consumers searched for brands with personalities that matched their own.&lt;ref&gt;

==Concepts==

Effective branding can result in higher sales of not only one product, but of other products associated with that brand.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} If a customer loves Pillsbury biscuits and trusts the brand, he or she is more likely to try other products offered by the company - such as chocolate-chip cookies, for example. Brand development, often the task of a [[design]] [[team]], takes time to produce.

===Brand names and trademarks===
{{See|Trademark|Trademark symbol}}
[[File:CocaColaBottle.jpg|thumb|''Coca-Cola'' is a brand name, while the distinctive Spencerian script and the contour bottle are trademarked]]
A brand name is the part of a brand that can be spoken or written and ''identifies'' a product, service or company  and sets it apart from other comparable products within a category. A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a "memory heuristic"; a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.

===Corporate brand identity===
Simply, the brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler,|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''. However, that expansion of the meaning of brand identity causes some confusion because it overlaps with other common branding terms, such as brand image, brand personality, and brand meaning. [...] ''Brand identity'' and ''brand image'' are only two of the buzz words that are used and confused by brand experts and brand managers.

&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for a company to exude a strong sense of brand identity, it must have an in-depth understanding of its target market, competitors and the surrounding business environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brand identity includes both the core identity and the extended identity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The core identity reflects consistent long-term associations with the brand; whereas the extended identity involves the intricate details of the brand that help generate a constant motif.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Kotler et al. (2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:

# attributes
# benefits
# values
# personality

A brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a "just do it" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value. Even more extensive than its perceived values is a brand's '''personality'''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Quite literally, one can easily describe a successful brand identity as if it were a person.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This form of brand identity has proven to be the most advantageous in maintaining long-lasting relationships with consumers, as it gives them a sense of personal interaction with the brand &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00913367.2005.10639213 |title=INTEGRATED MARKETING COMMUNICATION (IMC) AND BRAND IDENTITY AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF BRAND EQUITY STRATEGY: A Conceptual Framework and Research Propositions |journal=Journal of Advertising |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=69 |year=2005 |last1=Madhavaram |first1=Sreedhar |last2=Badrinarayanan |first2=Vishag |last3=McDonald |first3=Robert E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collectively, all four forms of brand identification help to deliver a powerful meaning behind what a corporation hopes to accomplish, and to explain why customers should choose one brand over its competitors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Brand personality===

'''Brand personality''' refers to “the set of human personality traits that are both applicable to and relevant for brands.” &lt;ref&gt;Azoulay, A and  Kapferer, J.N., "Do Brand Personality Scales Really Measure Brand Personality?" ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 11, No. 2, 2003 p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Marketers and consumer researchers often argue that brands can be imbued with human-like characteristics which resonate with potential consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/10610421011033467 |title=Impact of brand personality on three major relational consequences (trust, attachment, and commitment to the brand) |journal=Journal of Product &amp; Brand Management |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=114 |year=2010 |last1=Louis |first1=Didier |last2=Lombart |first2=Cindy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such personality traits can assist marketers to create unique, brands that are differentiated from rival brands. Aaker conceptualised brand personality as consisting of five broad dimensions, namely: sincerity (down-to-earth, honest, wholesome, and cheerful), excitement (daring, spirited, imaginative, and up to date), competence (reliable, intelligent, and successful), sophistication (glamorous, upper class, charming), and ruggedness (outdoorsy and tough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151897 |jstor=3151897 |title=Dimensions of Brand Personality |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=347 |year=1997 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research studies have suggested that Aaker's dimensions of brand personality are relatively stable across different industries, market segments and over time. Much of the literature on branding suggests that consumers prefer brands with personalities that are congruent with their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/3151914 |jstor=3151914 |title=The Malleable Self: The Role of Self-Expression in Persuasion |journal=Journal of Marketing Research |volume=36 |pages=45 |year=1999 |last1=Aaker |first1=Jennifer L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2011.07.031 |title=Moderators of the self-congruity effect on consumer decision-making: A meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=65 |issue=8 |pages=1179 |year=2012 |last1=Aguirre-Rodriguez |first1=Alexandra |last2=Bosnjak |first2=Michael |last3=Sirgy |first3=M. Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may distinguish the psychological aspect (brand associations like thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and so on that become linked to the brand) of a brand from the experiential aspect. The experiential aspect consists of the sum of all points of contact with the brand and is termed the consumer's ''[[brand experience]]''. The brand is often intended to create an emotional response and recognition, leading to potential loyalty and repeat purchases. The brand experience is a brand's action perceived by a person.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The psychological aspect, sometimes referred to as the ''brand image'', is a symbolic construct created within the minds of people, consisting of all the information and expectations associated with a product, with a service, or with the companies providing them.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Marketers or product managers responsible for branding seek to develop or align the expectations behind the brand experience, creating the impression that a brand associated with a product or service has certain qualities or characteristics that make it special or unique.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A brand can therefore become one of the most valuable elements in an [[advertising theme]], as it demonstrates what the brand owner is able to offer in the [[market (place)|marketplace]].{{clarify|date=August 2016}} The art of creating and maintaining a brand is called [[brand management]]. Orientation of an entire organization towards its brand is called [[brand orientation]]. Brand orientation develops in response to [[market intelligence]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Careful brand management seeks to make products or services relevant and meaningful to a [[target audience]]. Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price; rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications.&lt;ref&gt;Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp  295-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.

===Brand awareness===

{{Main|Brand awareness}}
[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos and branded advertising. Brands helps customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers &amp; potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.

Brand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing. That is, customers will not consider a brand if they are not aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;Tan, Donald (2010). "Success Factors In Establishing Your Brand" Franchising and Licensing Association. Retrieved from http://www.flasingapore.org/info_branding.php&lt;/ref&gt; Brand awareness is a key component in understanding the effectiveness both of a brand's identity and of its communication methods.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title= integrated marketing communications|last= Chitty|first= Williams|publisher= Thomson|year= 2005|isbn= 0 17 012008 2|location= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful brands are those that consistently generate a high level of brand awareness, as this can often{{quantify|date=August 2016}} be the pivotal factor in securing customer transactions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1002/mar.4220090402|title= A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal= Psychology and Marketing|volume= 9|issue= 4|pages= 263|year= 1992|last1= Percy|first1= Larry|last2= Rossiter|first2= John R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various forms of brand awareness can be identified. Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Marketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').&lt;ref&gt;Belch, G. E., &amp; Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.

* Most companies aim for "'''Top-of-Mind'''" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, "Kleenex", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.
* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category
* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.
* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.

===Brand recognition===

'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product: |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology &amp; Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263–274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.

Brand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's "signature" logo), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].

=== Brand recall===

Unlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market. Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales. Managing brands for [[Value proposition|value creation]] will often involve applying marketing-mix modeling techniques in conjunction with [[brand valuation]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Brand communication===

{{See|Advertising management|Integrated marketing communications|Marketing communications|Promotion (marketing)}}
Although brand identity is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the most fundamental asset to a brand's [[brand equity|equity]], the worth of a brand's identity would become obsolete without ongoing brand communication.&lt;ref&gt;Shirazi A, Lorestani HZ, Mazidi AK. Investigating the effects of brand identity on customer loyalty from social identity perspective. Iranian Journal of Management Studies. 2013;6(2):153-78.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrated marketing communications]] (IMC) relates to how a brand transmits a clear consistent message to its [[stakeholder (disambiguation)|stakeholder]]s .&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Five key components comprise IMC:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

# advertising
# sales promotions
# direct marketing
# personal selling
# public relations

The effectiveness of a brand's communication is determined by how accurately the customer perceives the brand's intended message through its IMC. Although IMC is a broad strategic concept, the most crucial brand communication elements are pinpointed{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to how the brand sends a message and what touch points the brand uses to connect with its customers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One can analyse the traditional communication model into several consecutive steps:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* Firstly, a source/sender wishes to convey a message to a receiver. This source must encode the intended message in a way that the receiver will potentially understand.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 
* After the encoding stage, the forming of the message is complete and is portrayed through a selected channel.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Advertising and promotion: an integrated marketing communications perspective|last= Belch|first= G .E|publisher= McGrawHill Irwin|year= 2012|isbn= |location= New York, NY United States of America|pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In IMC, channels may include media elements such as advertising, public relations, sales promotions, etc.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* It is at this point where the message can often deter from its original purpose as the message must go through the process of being decoded, which can often lead to unintended misinterpretation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Finally, the receiver retrieves the message and attempts to understand what the sender was aiming to render. Often, a message may be incorrectly received due to noise in the market, which is caused by "…unplanned static or distortion during the communication process".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The final stage of this process is when the receiver responds to the message, which is received by the original sender as feedback.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

When a brand communicates a brand identity to a receiver, it runs the risk of the receiver incorrectly interpreting the message. Therefore, a brand should use appropriate communication channels to positively "…affect how the psychological and physical aspects of a brand are perceived" &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Dahlen M, Lange F, Smith T. Marketing communications: A brand narrative approach. West Sussex, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons; 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for brands to effectively communicate to customers, marketers must "…consider all [[touchpoint|touch point]]s, or sources of contact, that a customer has with the brand".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Shimp TA. Integrated marketing communications in advertising and promotion. 8 ed. Mason, OH United States of America: South Western, Cengage Learning; 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2016}} Touch points represent the channel stage in the traditional communication model, where a message travels from the sender to the receiver. Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate - defines a touch point. According to Dalen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the "…potential to add positive - or suppress negative - associations to the brand's equity" &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thus a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilising the best communication channel, is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Brand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 |title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=592 |year=2014 |last1=Uzunoğlu |first1=Ebru |last2=Misci Kip |first2=Sema }}&lt;/ref&gt; One method of brand communication which companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM). EWoM is a relatively new{{when|date=August 2016}} approach identified{{by whom|date=August 2016}} to communicate with consumers. One popular method of eWOM involves [[Social networking service|social networking sites]] (SNSs) such as [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Kim, E., Sung, Y. and Kang, H., 2014. Brand followers' retweeting behavior on Twitter: How brand relationships influence brand electronic word-of-mouth. Computers in Human Behavior, 37, pp.18–25&lt;/ref&gt; A study found that consumers classed their relationship with a brand as closer if that brand was active on a specific social media site (Twitter). Research further found that the more consumers "retweeted" and communicated with a brand, the more they trusted the brand. This suggests that a company could look to employ a [[social-media marketing|social-media campaign]] to gain consumer trust and loyalty as well as in the pursuit of communicating brand messages.

McKee (2014) also looked into brand communication and states that when communicating a brand, a company should look to simplify its message as this will lead to more value being portrayed as well as an increased chance of target consumers recalling and recognizing the brand.&lt;ref&gt;.McKee, S., 2014. Branding Made Simple. [online] Bloomberg Business. Available at: &lt;https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-13/branding-made-simple&gt; [Accessed 6 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Riefler stated that if the company communicating a brand is a global organisation or has future global aims, that company should look to employ a method of communication which is globally appealing to their consumers, and subsequently choose a method of communication with will be internationally understood.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijresmar.2011.11.001 |title=Why consumers do (not) like global brands: The role of globalization attitude, GCO and global brand origin |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=29 |pages=25 |year=2012 |last1=Riefler |first1=Petra }}&lt;/ref&gt; One way a company can do this involves choosing a product or service's brand name, as this name will need to be suitable for the marketplace that it aims to enter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/296297 |title=To Brand or Not to Brand? A Theoretical and Empirical Question |journal=The Journal of Business |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=279 |year=1985 |last1=Sappington |first1=David E. M |last2=Wernerfelt |first2=Birger }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important that if a company wishes to develop a global market, the company name will also need to be suitable in different cultures and not cause offense or be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., 2009. Idea Branding. [online] ''The Economist''. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/14126533&gt; [Accessed 1 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found{{by whom|date=August 2016}} that when communicating a brand a company needs to be aware that they must not just visually communicate their brand message and should take advantage of portraying their message through multi-sensory information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.09.005 |title=The consumer psychology of brands |journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology |volume=22 |pages=7 |year=2012 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Bernd }}&lt;/ref&gt; One article suggests that other senses, apart from vision, need to be targeted when trying to communicate a brand with consumers.&lt;ref&gt;
Anon., 2007. Sensory branding Sound effects. [online] The Economist. Available at: &lt;http://www.economist.com/node/9079881&gt; [Accessed 5 Feb. 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, a jingle or background music can have a positive effect on brand recognition, purchasing behaviour and brand recall.

Therefore, when looking to communicate a brand with chosen consumers, companies should investigate a channel of communication which is most suitable for their short-term and long-term aims and should choose a method of communication which is most likely to be adhered to{{clarify|date=August 2016}} by their chosen consumers.&lt;ref name="Riefler, P. 2012. pp.25"/&gt; The match-up between the product, the [[consumer lifestyle]], and the endorser is important for effectiveness of brand communication.

==Global brand variables==

===Brand name===
[[File:Relationships trade marks – brand.svg|thumb|Relationship between trade marks and brand]]
The term "brand name" is quite often used interchangeably with "brand", although it is more correctly used to specifically denote written or spoken linguistic elements of any product. In this context a "brand name" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through trademark registration - such trademarks are called "Registered Trademarks"{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].

====Types of brand names====
Brand names come in many styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A few include:
* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as "UPS" or "IBM"
* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as "Whole Foods" or "Toys R' Us"
* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as "Reese's Pieces" or "[[Dunkin' Donuts]]"
* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as "Amazon" or "Crest"
* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as "Wii" or "[[Häagen-Dazs]]"
* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as "Volvo" or "Samsung"
* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as "[[Hewlett-Packard]]", "Dell", "Disney", "Stussy" or "Mars"
* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as "[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]" or "[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]"
* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|"Nike"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as "[[Betty Crocker]]"
* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as "[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]", "Wok on Water" or "Eggs Eggscetera"
* '''combination''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as "[[Microsoft]]" ("microcomputer" and "software"), "[[Comcast]]" ("communications" and "broadcast"), "[[Evernote]]" ("forever" and "note"), "[[Vodafone]]" ("voice", "data", "telephone")

The act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]—which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word "copy".

===Brand line===
A brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].


[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.

===Brand identity===
{{Main|Corporate identity}}
The outward expression of a brand – including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance – is brand identity.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand"&gt;Neumeier, Marty (2004), ''The Dictionary of Brand''. {{ISBN|1-884081-06-1}}, pp.20&lt;/ref&gt; Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand – and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Brand" /&gt; The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.

Brand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.

====Visual brand identity====
[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff &amp; Geismar &amp; Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]

A brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement – simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe|Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of "Less is more") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [Lippincott and Margulies], [[Paul Rand]], and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.

Color is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace (O'Connor, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/col.20594 |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=36 |pages=55 |year=2011 |last1=O'Connor |first1=Zena }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brand trust===
Brand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Brand management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33–58 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |accessdate=17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.

''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is a syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of action, behavior, communication and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. Action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in the transferring the trust experience to audiences which have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.

===Brand parity===
Brand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=28 |year=1994 |last1=Richardson |first1=Paul S |last2=Dick |first2=Alan S |last3=Jain |first3=Arun K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.

==Expanding role of brands==
The original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.

Today, brands play a much bigger role. Brands have been co-opted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as powerful symbols in larger debates about economics, social issues, and politics. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Bianca |url= http://merriamassociates.com/2010/12/wikileaks-hacktivism-and-brands-as-political-symbols/ |title= Wikileaks, Hacktivism and Brands as Political Symbols « Merriam Associates, Inc.

===Company name===
Often, especially in the industrial sector, it is just the company's name which is promoted (leading to{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} one of the most powerful statements of branding: saying just before the company's downgrading. This approach has not worked as well for [[General Motors]], which recently overhauled how its corporate brand relates to the product brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |title=General Motors: A Reorganized Brand Architecture for a Reorganized Company « Merriam Associates, Inc. Brand Strategies |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604181905/http://merriamassociates.com/2010/11/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company/ |archivedate=2012-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Exactly how the company name relates to product and services names is known as [[brand architecture]]. Decisions about company names and [[Product naming|product names]] and their relationship depends on more than a dozen strategic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nisha Roy (nisharoy) – Pearltrees |url=http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |title=Brand Architecture: Strategic Considerations « Merriam Associates, Inc. Brand Strategies |publisher=Merriamassociates.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520102618/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/09/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations/ |archivedate=2013-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, a strong brand name (or company name) is made the vehicle for a range of products (for example, [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[Black &amp; Decker]]) or a range of subsidiary brands (such as [[Cadbury]] Dairy Milk, Cadbury Flake, or [[Cadbury Fingers]] in the UK).

===Individual branding===
{{Main|Individual branding}}
Each brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]]), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).

===Challenger brands===
{{main|Challenger brand}}
A challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader or a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset which sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.

===Multiproduct branding strategy===
Multiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all their products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  
Other examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church &amp; Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church &amp; Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. Multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.

====Product line extension====
{{main|Product line extension}}
Product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in a lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.

====Subbranding====
{{main|Subbranding}}
Subbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].

====Brand extension====
{{main|Brand extension}}
Brand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.

====Co-branding====
{{main|Co-branding}}
Co-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.

===Multibranding strategy===
Multibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head &amp; Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestlé]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].

This approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.

====Fighting brands====
{{main|Fighter brand}}
The main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.

===Private branding strategy===

{{main|Store brand}}
Private branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.

In Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.

===Mixed branding strategy===
Mixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. 
For example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the "skin simple" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.

===Attitude branding and iconic brands===
Attitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 2000 book ''[[No Logo]]'',&lt;ref name="nologo"&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} [[Naomi Klein|Klein, Naomi]] (2000) ''[[No logo]]'', Canada: Random House, {{ISBN|0-676-97282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a "fetish strategy". Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben &amp; Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' - brands that are able to gain and retain "meaning beyond the material."&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015. Rethinking Prestige Branding - Secrets of the Ueber-Brands. Kogan Page. p.17. {{ISBN|9780749470036}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathur, S., Kuehlwein, J.P. and Schaefer, W., ''Asia Management Insights,'' Singapore Management University, Vol.3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A great brand raises the bar – it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. – [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:English &amp; Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]

Iconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be "identity brands". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them "iconic brands". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.

There are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):
# "Necessary conditions" – The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.
# "Myth-making" – A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.
# "Cultural contradictions" – Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.
# "The cultural brand management process" – Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.

Schaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Wolf and Kuehlwein, JP. 2015.

==="No-brand" branding===
Recently, a number of companies have successfully pursued "no-brand" strategies by creating packaging that imitates [[generic brand]] simplicity. Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means "No label" in English (from 無印良品 – "Mujirushi Ryohin" – literally, "No brand quality goods"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, a simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Heig, Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive and Survive, pg.216&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130122022144/http://www.emeasee.com/no-brand-brand/|deadurl=yes|title=The ‘no brand’ brand - EMEASEE|date=22 January 2013|archivedate=22 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"No brand" branding may be construed as a type of branding as the product is made conspicuous through the absence of a brand name.
"Tapa Amarilla" or "Yellow Cap" in Venezuela during the 1980s is another good example of no-brand strategy. It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.

==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands&lt;!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] --&gt;===

{{See|Derived demand}}
In this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) "[[Intel Inside]]".

===Brand extension and brand dilution===

{{See|brand extension}}
The existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;
for example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.

Mars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.

There is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.
When [[Coca-Cola]] launched "Diet Coke" and "Cherry Coke", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (P&amp;G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.

The risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Social media brands===
In 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. "We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us – but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see." &lt;ref name="Media Democracy"&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Better-Mousetrap-Invention-Democracy/dp/0749466219], 'The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy' (2013) Simon Pont. Kogan Page. {{ISBN|978-0749466213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multi-brands===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
Alternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the share of the market which will in any case go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as multi-brand strategy.

Individual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what
business the company is in or diluting higher quality products.

[[Procter &amp; Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of "facings" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate—from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).

[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.

===Private labels===

{{See|Private label}}
[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this "own brand" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.

'''Designer Private Labels'''

A relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer’s budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.

In Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and ‘L’ for Lisa Ho.&lt;ref&gt;Schetzer, A., "Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers ‘Collette’ for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research,"Private Label Could be the New Black" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337&lt;/ref&gt; Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her “Petites’ range.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research, "Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion," Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520&lt;/ref&gt; Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frames designed by Peter Morrissey.

===Individual and organizational brands===
With the development of brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.&lt;ref name="The Wall Street Journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is leave social impact so their brand become associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims. Organizational brands have well determined brand guidelines and logo variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|title=AIESEC BLUE BOOK Brand Toolkit|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625183605/http://www.aiesec.it/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AIESEC_Bluebook_Brand_Toolkit.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-25|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal branding====
{{main|Personal branding}}

====Employer branding====
{{main|Employer branding}}

===Crowd sourced branding===
These are brands that are created by "the public" for the business, which is opposite to the traditional method where the business create a brand.

===Personalised branding===

Many businesses have started to use elements of personalisation in their branding strategies, offering the client or consumer the ability to choose from various brand options or have direct control over the brand. Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people. [[AirBNB]] has created the facility for users to create their own symbol for the software to replace the brand's mark known as The Bélo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |title=Airbnb says its new logo belongs to everyone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921204457/http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/2014/07/airbnb-new-logo-belo/ |archivedate=September 21, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nation branding (place branding and public diplomacy)===
{{See|Place branding}}
[[Nation branding]] is a field of theory and practice which aims to measure, build and manage the reputation of countries (closely related to [[place branding]]). Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state "and the successful transference of this image to its exports – is just as important as what they actually produce and sell."

===Destination branding===

Destination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote to themselves. This work is designed to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.

==Doppelgänger brand image (DBI)==
{{Main|Doppelgänger brand image}}
A doppelgänger brand image or "DBI"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''gänger'' (walker).

Doppelgänger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.

Due to the ability of Doppelgänger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.

Examples include:
* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Version of the '''Coca-Cola''' logo crafted to protest their sponsorship of the '''2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar''' and associated human rights abuses (see citation for original Reddit thread featuring the image).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Coke's slogan is "Share Happiness". So I made an ad to remind them of the kind of happiness they're sharing in Qatar. • /r/sports|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/36voua/cokes_slogan_is_share_happiness_so_i_made_an_ad/|website=Reddit|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parody of the '''Pepsi logo as an obese man''' to highlight the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Designer Makes Fun Of Pepsi, Turns Its Logo Into A Fat Man - DesignTAXI.com|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/360382/Designer-Makes-Fun-Of-Pepsi-Turns-Its-Logo-Into-A-Fat-Man/|website=designtaxi.com|accessdate=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''FUH2 campaign''' protesting the Hummer SUV as a symbol of corporate and consumer irresponsibility toward public safety and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FUH2 {{!}} Fuck You And Your H2|url = http://www.fuh2.com |website = www.fuh2.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319105357/http://www.fuh2.com/|archivedate=2016-03-19|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 2006 article "Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelgänger Brand Image", Thompson, Rindfleisch, and Arsel suggest that a doppelgänger brand image can be a benefit to a brand if taken as an early warning sign that the brand is losing emotional authenticity with its market.&lt;ref name="Thompson 50–64"/&gt;

'''Civionics''' is the combination of '''civi'''l engineering with electr'''onics''' engineering, in a manner similar to [[avionics]] ('''avi'''ation and electr'''onics''') and [[mechatronics]] ('''mecha'''nical engineering and elec'''tronics'''). An emerging discipline, the main application area of civionics is currently the use of electronics for [[structural health monitoring]] (SHM) of civil structures, particularly [[photonics]] (Fiber Optic Bragg Grating).

In SHM, Civionics will provide engineers with feedback necessary to aid in optimizing design techniques and understanding infrastructure performance, behaviour and state of condition. The successful integration of intelligent sensing of innovative structures will allow civil structural engineers to expand the design envelope by taking risks to introduce new design concepts, materials and innovation in civil engineering.

Civionic engineering applications include integrating science and technology from both new and traditional disciplines, including [[Civil engineering|civil]], [[Structural engineering|structural]], and [[electronics engineering]]; [[structural health monitoring]], [[deformation monitoring]], [[data acquisition]], [[signal processing]], [[metrology]], [[telemetry]], [[remote sensing]], and other applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">The '''climate gap''' refers to a body of data indicating disparities in how climate change impacts various racial, ethnic and [[socioeconomic]] groups in the United States. The data show that low [[socioeconomic status]] groups and racial and ethnic minorities will experience more negative health and economic impacts from the results of climate change than other populations in the United States. This term, climate gap, was first used in the May 2009 report, “The Climate Gap: Inequalities in How Climate Change Hurts Americans &amp; How to Close the Gap”,&lt;ref&gt;http://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/The_Climate_Gap_Full_Report_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2009/05/global-warming-hurts-poor-people-more.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in a concurrent paper published in the journal, ''Environmental Justice'', by Seth B. Shonkoff, Rachel Morello-Frosch and colleagues entitled, "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies in California".&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. "Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies" in ''California Environmental Justice'' '''2'''(4): 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
'''Disparate health impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity in the next hundred years due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are affected by heat-related illness at greater rates due to factors such as lack of access to air conditioning, lack of transportation, occupations that require outdoor work and the heat-island effect in urban neighborhoods.

Higher temperatures resulting from climate change will also increase chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight, leading to increased concentrations of ambient ozone in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/2007GL031101.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Along with particulate matter, ozone is a primary cause of air pollution-related health effects. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely to live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829091603/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/justice_in_the_air_web.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This pollution will be exacerbated by climate change, and low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lack health insurance,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2006/CARB_Full_0306.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; making them increasingly vulnerable to these elevated levels of air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff SB, Morello-Frosch R, Pastor M, Sadd J. 2009. Environmental Health and Equity Impacts from Climate Change and Mitigation Policies in California: A Review of the Literature. Publication # CEC-500-2009-038-D. Available at: http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/publications/cat/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''Disparate economic impacts of climate change'''&lt;br /&gt;
The proportion of income that low socioeconomic status groups spend on basic necessities such as food, water and energy is already greater than the proportion spent by other populations and is expected to increase as the cost of these necessities increases due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics). 2002. Consumer expenditure
survey. Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, job sectors that employ predominantly low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities such as the agriculture and tourism industries are projected to experience the most dramatic shifts due to climate change, reducing employment opportunities for these populations.&lt;ref&gt;EDD (California Employment Development Department). 2004. Occupational Employment (2002) and Wage (2003) Data, Occupational Employment Statistics Survey Results. Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, due to the lack of access to insurance and emergency credit, less savings, fewer personal resources and disproportionate hardships from previous economic stress, low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are likely to suffer the most pronounced and long-lasting economic impacts from climate change-related extreme weather events such as hurricanes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/6/9/9/pages106994/p106994-1.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Comprehensive planning''' is a process that determines community goals and aspirations in terms of community development. The result is called a comprehensive plan and both expresses and regulates public policies on transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. Comprehensive plans typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The term comprehensive planning is most often used by [[urban planners]] in the United States.

In Canada, comprehensive planning is generally known as strategic planning or visioning. It is usually accompanied by public consultation. When cities and municipalities engage in comprehensive planning the resulting document is known as an [[Official Community Plan]] or OCP for short. (In Alberta, the resultant document is referred to as a Municipal Development Plan.

== History ==
During the earliest times of American history, cities had little power given to them by State governments to control land use. After the [[American Revolution]], the focus on property rights turned to self-rule and personal freedom, as this was a time of very strong personal property rights. Local governments had simple powers which included maintaining law and order and providing basic services. Cities had little power, if any at all, to direct development in the city.

Cities began to focus on the provision of basic services during the 1840s at a time known as the [[Sanitary Reform Movement]]. During this time it became clear that there was a strong relationship between disease and the availability of a quality sewer system. Part of the movement included the development of sanitary survey planning to help bring sewer systems to infected parts of cities. From this planning also developed a new consciousness of townsite location. People began to understand the environmental and social impacts of building cities and developed ways in which to further lower the spread of deadly diseases. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] was a firm believer in the relationship between the physical environment and sanitation, which helped lead to the development of grand parks and open spaces in communities to bring not only recreation, but sanitation as well. The Sanitary Reform Movement is seen by many as the first attempt at comprehensive planning, however it failed to be completely comprehensive because it focused on only one aspect of the city and did not consider the city as a whole.

During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, cities began to urbanize at very high rates. Cities became very dense and full of disease. As a response to the overpopulation and chaotic conditions, planning became a major focus of many large American cities. The [[City Beautiful movement]] was one of the many responses to the decaying city. The movement began in Chicago in 1890 with the [[World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] and lasted until about the 1920s. The focus on the movement was the design and architectural characteristics of the city. Leaders of the movement wanted to push the vision of the ideal city, and demonstrate to the world what cities could look like if they were created to be works of art. The White City was created for the exposition which embodied the visions of the movement with neoclassical designed buildings set against landscaped streets. Visitors to the exhibition began to realize that cities could be much more than dirty, overcrowded places. The movement spread across the United States and influenced many major American cities.

In 1898, [[Ebenezer Howard]] published his book entitled "Tomorrow, a Peaceful Path to Reform," in which he developed the idea of a [[garden city movement|Garden City]]. This city was a planned development which included different land uses and community services. The communities were to be surrounded by a [[green belt]] and included many open spaces and parks within the city. These cities were designed to be completely self-sufficient and focused on decreasing the negative impacts traditional cities had on people's lives. Although these cities were considered to be utopian ideas, two cities were eventually built in this vision, [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]], England. The vision of Ebenezer Howard greatly impacted the idea of city planning in the United States for decades and helped in the development of the idea that cities must be planning comprehensively for growth.

After the turn of the twentieth century, American cities began to see the need for local development and growth plans. Influential in this planning was [[Daniel Hudson Burnham]] who re-created the city plan for [[Washington, D.C.]] created by [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] in 1791. The original plan called for grid iron laid streets crossed by diagonal boulevards, squares, plazas, parks, monuments, and sculptures. However, over time this plan was largely ignored and the city had developed against L'Enfant's vision. Burnham was instrumental in recreating the city plan and helping to return the city to its once intended form. In 1903, Burnham helped create the city growth plan for the city of [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and in 1906 he created the city plan for [[San Francisco, California]]. Although these were all city development plans, it was not until 1909 when Burnham created the city plan for Chicago that his plans were comprehensive. [[Burnham Plan|The plan of Chicago]] is known today as the first comprehensive plan and it began a movement of comprehensive planning that emphasized planning as a way to not only make cities more beautiful, but to function better as well.

== Comprehensive planning process ==
Comprehensive Planning typically follows a planning process that consists of eight different steps. By following this process, planners are able to determine a wide range of interconnecting issues that affect an urban area. Each step can be seen as interdependent and many times planners will revise the order to best fit their needs.

===Identifying issues===
The planner must first address the issue they are investigating. "To be relevant, the planning process must identify and address not only contemporary issues of concern to residents, workers, property owners, and business people, but also the emerging issues that will be important in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Larz. (1995) ''Guidelines for Preparing Urban Plans'' Chicago: APA Planners Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, planners determine community issues by involving various community leaders, community organizations, and ordinary citizens.

===Stating goals===
Once issues have been identified by a community, goals can then be established. Goals are community visions. They establish priorities for communities and help community leaders make future decisions which will affect the city. Stating goals is not always an easy process and it requires the active participation of all people in the community.

===Collecting data===
Data is needed in the planning process in order to evaluate current city conditions as well as to predict future conditions. Data is most easily collected from the [[United States Census Bureau]], however many communities actively collect their own data. The most typical data collected for a comprehensive plan include data about the environment, traffic conditions, economic conditions, social conditions (such as population and income), public services and utilities, and land use conditions (such as housing and zoning). Once this data is collected it is analyzed and studied. Outcomes of the data collection process include population projections, economic condition forecasts, and future housing needs.

===Preparing the plan===
The plan is prepared using the information gathered during the data collection and goal setting stages. A typical comprehensive plan begins by giving a brief background of the current and future conditions found in the data collection step. Following the background information are the community goals and the plans that will be used in order to implement those goals into the community. Plans may also contain separate sections for important issues such as transportation or housing which follow the same standard format.
&lt;ref&gt;↔&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating implementation plans===
During this stage of the process different programs are thought of in order to implement the goals of the plan. These plans focus on issues such as cost and effectiveness. It is possible that a variety of plans will result from this process in order to realize one goal. These different plans are known as alternatives.

===Evaluating alternatives===
Each alternative should be evaluated by community leaders to ensure the most efficient and cost-effective way to realize the community's goals. During this stage each alternative should be weighed given its potential positive and negative effects, impacts on the community, and impacts on the city government. One alternative should be chosen that best meets the needs and desires of the community and community leaders for meeting the community goals.

===Adopting a plan===
The community needs to adopt the plan as an official statement of policy in order for it to take effect. This is usually done by the City Council and through public hearings. The [[City Council]] may choose not to adopt the plan, which would require planners to refine the work they did during previous steps. Once the plan is accepted by city officials it is then a legal statement of community policy in regards to future development.

===Implementing and monitoring the plan===
Using the implementation plans defined in the earlier stages, the city will carry out the goals in the comprehensive plan. City planning staff monitor the outcomes of the plan and may propose future changes if the results are not desired.

A comprehensive plan is not a permanent document. It can be changed and rewritten over time. For many fast growing communities, it is necessary to revise or update the comprehensive plan every five to ten years. In order for the comprehensive plan to be relevant to the community it must remain current.

== Legal basis ==
The basis for comprehensive planning comes from the government's duty and right to protect the health and welfare of its citizens.  The power for local governments to plan generally comes from state planning enabling legislation; however, local governments in most states are not required by law to engage in comprehensive planning. State statutes usually provide the legal framework necessary for those communities choosing to participate while allowing others to disengage themselves with the process. The legal provision for comprehensive planning comes from what is called the [[Standard State Zoning Enabling Act]] which was written by the [[United States Department of Commerce]] in the 1920s. This act was never passed by the [[United States Congress]] but was rather a law written for state legislatures to willingly adopt. Many states did choose to adopt the act which provided local governments with the framework to engage in land use planning. Because the act never gave a clear definition for comprehensive planning, the Department of Commerce wrote another act, the Standard City Planning Enabling Act of 1928, which defined more precisely what a comprehensive plan is and how it should be used.

In states that do not require local governments to plan comprehensively, state governments usually provide many incentives to encourage the process at the local level. In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], for example, the state government gives many incentives to local governments to establish comprehensive plans to guide development. Today, almost every county in Georgia has established a plan voluntarily.

However, a comprehensive plan is not usually legally binding.  A community's ordinances must be amended in order to legally implement the provisions required to execute the comprehensive plan.

'''Critical psychology''' is a perspective on psychology that draws extensively on [[critical theory]]. Critical psychology challenges mainstream [[psychology]] and attempts to apply psychological understandings in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology.

One of critical psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is that it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way [[Power (philosophy)|power]] differences between social classes and groups can affect the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people. It does this, in part, because it tends to explain behavior at the level of the individual.

==Origins==
Criticisms of mainstream psychology consistent with current critical psychology usage have existed since psychology's modern development in the late 19th century. Use of the term "critical psychology" started in the 1970s in Berlin at [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. The German branch of critical psychology predates and has developed largely separately from the rest of the field. As of May 2007, only a few works have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1992): ''On Doing Psychology Critically''. Theory and Psychology 2, S.193–204; for further references see also Charles Tolman (1994): ''Psychology, Society and Subjectivity: An Introduction to German Critical Psychology'', London: Routledge &amp; Thomas Teo (1998): ''Klaus Holzkamp and the Rise and Fall of German Critical Psychology''. History of Psychology 1998, Vol. 1, Nr. 3; Wolfgang Maiers (1999): ''Critical Psychology – An Unfinished Modern Project''. In: Wolfgang Maiers et al. (Eds.): ''Challenges to Theoretical Psychology'', 457–66&lt;/ref&gt; The German Critical Psychology movement is rooted in the post-war babyboomers' student revolt of the late '60s; see [[German student movement]]. [[Marx]]'s ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'' played an important role in the German branch of the student revolt, which was centered in [[Berlin]]. Then Berlin was a capitalist city surrounded by communist-ruled [[East Germany]], represented a "hot spot" of political and ideological controversy for the revolutionary German students. The sociological foundations of critical psychology are decidedly Marxist.

===Klaus Holzkamp===
One of the most important and sophisticated books in the field is the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1983): ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; (''Foundations of Psychology'') by [[Klaus Holzkamp]], who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp, who had written two books on theory of science&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1964), ''Theorie und Experiment in der Psychologie''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Theory and Experiment in Psychology''); Klaus Holzkamp (1968): ''Wissenschaft als Handlung. Versuch einer neuen Grundlegung der Wissenschaftslehre''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Science as Action – A new Approach to the Theory of Science'')&lt;/ref&gt; and one on sensory perception&lt;ref name="ekoart"&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1973): ''Sinnliche Erkenntnis. Historischer Ursprung und gesellschaftliche Funktion der Wahrnehmung''. Frankfurt/M.: Athenäum (''Sensory Perception: Historical Origins and Social Functions of Perception''&lt;/ref&gt; before publishing the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie'' in 1983, thought this major work provided a solid [[paradigm]] for psychological research, as he viewed psychology as a pre-paradigmatic scientific discipline ([[T.S. Kuhn]] had used the term "pre-paradigmatic" for [[social science]]).

Holzkamp mostly based his sophisticated attempt to provide a comprehensive and integrated set of categories defining the field of psychological research on [[Aleksey Leontyev]]'s approach to [[cultural–historical psychology]] and [[activity theory]]. Leontyev had seen human action as a result of biological as well as cultural evolution and, drawing on Marx's materialist conception of culture, stressed that individual cognition is always part of social action which in turn is mediated by man-made tools (cultural artifacts), language and other man-made systems of symbols, which he viewed as a major distinguishing feature of human culture and, thus, human cognition. Another important source was Lucien Séve's theory of personality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/seve/index.htm Lucien Seve&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the concept of "social activity matrices" as mediating structure between individual and social reproduction. At the same time, the ''Grundlegung'' systematically integrated previous specialized work done at Free University of Berlin in the '70s by critical psychologists who also had been influenced by Marx, Leontyev and Seve. This included books on [[ethology|animal behavior]]/[[ethology]],&lt;ref&gt;Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 1: Psychogenese und elementare Formen der Tierkommunikation''. (''Natural History of the Psyche 1: Psychogenesis and Elementary Forms of Animal Communication''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus; Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 2: Lernen und Abstraktionsleistungen bei Tieren'' (''Natural History of the Psyche 2: Learning and Abstraction Capabilities in Animals''. Frankfurt/M. Campus; Volker Schurig (1976): ''Die Entstehung des Bewußtseins'' (''The Emergence of Consciousness''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus; . Frankfurt/M.: Campus;&lt;/ref&gt; [[sensory perception]],&lt;ref name="ekoart"/&gt; [[motivation]]&lt;ref&gt;Ute Osterkamp (1975/1976): ''Grundlagen der Psychologischen Motivationsforschung'' (''Foundations of Psychological Research of Motivation'', Frankfurt/M: Campus (2 Volumes)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Seidel (1976): ''Denken. Psychologische Analyse der Entstehung und Lösung von Problemen''. (''Cognition. Psychological Analysis of Formulating and Solving Problems''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; He also incorporated ideas from Freud's [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] into his approach.

One core result of Holzkamp's historical and comparative analysis of human reproductive action, perception and cognition is a very specific concept of meaning that identifies symbolic meaning as historically and culturally constructed, purposeful conceptual structures that humans create in close relationship to material culture and within the context of historically specific formations of social reproduction.

Coming from this phenomenological perspective on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S–R (stimulus–response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach to psychology creates the illusion of "scientific objectivity" while at the same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1987): ''Die Verkennung von Handlungsbegründungen als empirische Zusammenhangsannahmen in sozialpsychologischen Theorien: Methodologische Fehlorientierung infolge von Begriffsverwirrung'' (''Mistaking Reasons for Causes in Theories of Social Psychology: Methodological Errors as a Result of Conceptual Confusion''), Forum Kritische Psychologie 19, Berlin: Argument Verlag, pp. 23–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus, Chapter 1: "Hinführung auf das Verfahren der Problementwicklung" (''Introduction to the Sequence of Presentation''), pp. 17–39&lt;/ref&gt; Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from [[Kurt Lewin]] in Chapter 9 of ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''.

His last major publication before his death in 1995 was about learning.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung'' (''"Learning: Subject-Scientific Foundations"''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject. One important concept Holzkamp developed was "reinterpretation" of theories developed by conventional psychology. This meant to look at these concepts from the standpoint of the paradigm of critical psychology, thereby integrating their useful insights into critical psychology while at the same time identifying and criticizing their limiting implications, which in the case of S–R psychology were the rhetorical elimination of the subject and intentional action, and in the case of cognitive psychology which did take into account subjective motives and intentional actions, [[methodological individualism]]. 

The first part of the book thus contains an extensive look at the history of psychological theories of learning and a minute re-interpretation of those concepts from the perspective of the paradigm of critical psychology, which focuses on intentional action situated in specific socio-historical/cultural contexts. The conceptions of learning he found most useful in his own detailed analysis of "classroom learning" came from cognitive anthropologists [[Jean Lave]] ([[situated learning]]) and [[Edwin Hutchins]] ([[distributed cognition]]). 

The book's second part contained an extensive analysis on the modern state's institutionalized forms of "classroom learning" as the cultural–historical context that shapes much of modern learning and [[socialization]]. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon [[Michel Foucault]]'s '''''[[Discipline and Punish]]'''''. Holzkamp felt that classroom learning as the historically specific form of learning does not make full use of student's potentials, but rather limits her or his learning potentials by a number of "teaching strategies." Part of his motivation for the book was to look for alternative forms of learning that made use of the enormous potential of the human psyche in more fruitful ways. Consequently, in the last section of the book, Holzkamp discusses forms of "expansive learning" that seem to avoid the limitations of classroom learning, such as apprenticeship and learning in contexts other than classrooms.  

This search culminated in plans to write a major work on [[life leadership]] in the specific historical context of modern (capitalist) society. Due to his death in 1995, this work never got past the stage of early (and premature) conceptualizations, some of which were published in the journals ''Forum Kritische Psychologie'' and ''Argument''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Holzkamp (1995): ''Alltägliche Lebensführung als subjektwissenschaftliches Grundkonzept'' ''(Everyday Life Leadership as Basic Concept of a Scientific Theory of the Subject)''. Das Argument, 37. Jahrgang, Heft 6, November/December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===1960s–1970s===
In the 1960s and 1970s the term ''radical psychology'' was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology. Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology. Within psychiatry the term ''[[anti-psychiatry]]'' was often used and now British activists prefer the term ''[[critical psychiatry]]''. ''Critical psychology'' is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.

===1990s===
Starting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book ''Critical Psychology'' by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.  Attention to language and ideological processes, others would argue, is essential to effective critical psychology - it is not simply a matter of applying mainstream psychological concepts to issues of social change.

===Ian Parker===
In 1999 [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]] published an influential manifesto in both the online journal ''Radical Psychology'' and the [[Annual Review of Critical Psychology]]. This manifesto argues that critical psychology should include the following four components:
# Systematic examination of how some varieties of psychological action and experience are privileged over others, how dominant accounts of "psychology" operate ideologically and in the service of power;
# Study of the ways in which all varieties of psychology are culturally historically constructed, and how alternative varieties of psychology may confirm or resist ideological assumptions in mainstream models;
# Study of forms of surveillance and self-regulation in everyday life and the ways in which psychological culture operates beyond the boundaries of academic and professional practice; and
# Exploration of the way everyday "ordinary psychology" structures academic and professional work in psychology and how everyday activities might provide the basis for resistance to contemporary disciplinary practices.

===Critical psychology today===
There are a few international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the no longer published ''International Journal of Critical Psychology''  (continued in the journal Subjectivity) and the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology''. The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology'' runs as an open-access online journal. There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the Asylum Collective. [[David Smail (psychologist)|David Smai]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l was one of the founders of The Midlands Psychology Group, a critical psychology collective who produced a manifesto for a social materialist psychology of distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.midpsy.org/draft_manifesto.htm|title=Draft Manifesto for a Social Materialist Psychology of Distress|last=Midlands Psychology Group|date=|website=midpsy.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at Manchester Metropolitan University, York St Johns University, the University of East London, the University of Edinburgh, the University of KwaZulu Natal, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and the University of West Georgia. Undergraduate concentrations can also be found at the California Institute of Integral Studies and Prescott College.

==Extensions==
Like many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist and feminist roots to benefit from other critical approaches. Consider ecopsychology and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled [[radical psychology]] and [[liberation psychology]]. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of [[Erica Burman]] has been influential.

Various sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations. Perhaps the most extensive are [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology|critical health psychology]] and [[community psychology]].

==Internationally==
An early international overview of critical psychology perspectives can be found in Critical Psychology: Voices for Change, edited by Tod Sloan (Macmillan, 2000).  In 2015, Ian Parker edited the Handbook of Critical Psychology.
===Germany===
At FU-Berlin, critical psychology was not really seen as a division of psychology and followed its own methodology, trying to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox [[Marxist]] base and drawing from Soviet ideas of [[cultural–historical psychology]], particularly [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. Some years ago the department of critical psychology at FU-Berlin was merged into the traditional psychology department.

An April 2009 issue of the Sage journal ''Theory &amp; Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol19/issue2/?etoc Special Issue: German Critical Psychology: Interventions in Honor of Klaus Holzkamp]&lt;/ref&gt; (edited by Desmond Painter, Athanasios Marvakis, and Leendert Mos) is devoted to an examination of German critical psychology.

===South Africa===
The University of KwaZulu-Natal in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], is one of few worldwide to offer a Master's course in critical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukzn.ac.za/psychology/default.asp University of KwaZulu-Natal: Critical psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on "Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.criticalmethods.org/collab/critpsy.htm Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards]&lt;/ref&gt; They have also now started a critical psychology blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://critpsy.blogspot.com/ Critical Psychology] &lt;/ref&gt;

===United States and Canada===
Critical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust ''status quo''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce E. Levine]], [http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/05/14/psychiatrys-manufacture-of-consent/ The Chemical Imbalance Theory and the Antidepressant Explosion - Psychiatry’s Manufacture of Consent], 2014-05-14, ''[[CounterPunch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  No departments of critical psychology exist, with the exception of the Bachelor's Completion Program with a minor in Critical Psychology, offered at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Bachelors_Completion_Program/Minor_in_Critical_Psychology/Critical_Psychology.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121214151955/http://www.ciis.edu/Academics/Bachelors_Completion_Program/Minor_in_Critical_Psychology/Critical_Psychology.html |archivedate=2012-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though critical perspectives are sometimes encountered in traditional universities, perhaps especially within community psychology programs. The University of West Georgia offers a Ph.D. in Consciousness and Society with critical psychology being one of the main three theoretical orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westga.edu/psydept/index_7775.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141008150229/http://www.westga.edu/psydept/index_7775.php |archivedate=2014-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; North American efforts include the 1993 founding of RadPsyNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://radpsynet.org RadPsyNet]&lt;/ref&gt; the 1997 publication of ''Critical Psychology: An Introduction''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dennisfox.net/critpsy/book.html ''Critical Psychology: An Introduction'']&lt;/ref&gt; (edited by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky; expanded 2009 edition edited by Dennis Fox, Isaac Prilleltensky, and Stephanie Austin), the 2001 Monterey Conference on Critical Psychology, and in underlying themes of many contributions to the ''Journal of Social Action in Counseling and Psychology''.

[[File:66a3aDTMFpad.jpg|thumb|The keypads on telephones for the [[Autovon]] systems used all 16 DTMF signals. The red keys in the fourth column produce the A, B, C, and D DTMF events.]]
'''Dual-tone multi-frequency signaling'''&lt;ref name="Dodd1"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/779863446 |title=The essential guide to telecommunications |last=Z. |first=Dodd, Annabel |date=2012 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=9780137058914 |edition=5th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |oclc=779863446}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''DTMF''') is an [[in-band]] [[Signalling (telecommunications)|telecommunication signaling]] system using the voice-frequency band over telephone lines between [[telephone]] equipment and other communications devices and [[Automatic telephone exchange|switching centers]]. DTMF was first developed in the [[Bell System]] in the United States, and became known under the trademark '''Touch-Tone''' for use in [[push-button telephone]]s supplied to telephone customers, starting in 1963.  DTMF is standardized as [[ITU-T]] Recommendation Q.23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |series=Recommendation |id=Q.23 |title=Technical features of push-button telephone sets |url=http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-Q.23/en |publisher=ITU}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in the UK as ''MF4''.

The Touch-Tone system using a [[telephone keypad]] gradually replaced the use of [[rotary dial]] and has become the industry standard for  [[landline]] and mobile service. Other [[multi-frequency]] systems are used for internal signaling within the telephone network.

==Multifrequency signaling==
Prior to the development of DTMF, telephone numbers were dialed by users with a loop-disconnect (LD) signaling, more commonly known as [[pulse dialing]] (dial pulse, DP) in the U.S. It functions by interrupting the current in the [[local loop]] between the telephone exchange and the [[calling party]]'s telephone at a precise rate with a switch in the telephone that is operated by the [[rotary dial]] as it spins back to its rest position after having been rotated to each desired number. The exchange equipment responds to the dial pulses either directly by operating relays, or by storing the number in a digit register recording the dialed number. The physical distance for which this type of dialing was possible was restricted by electrical distortions and was only possible on direct metallic links between end points of a line. Placing calls over longer distances required either operator assistance or provision of special [[subscriber trunk dialing]] equipment. Operators used an earlier type of [[multi-frequency]] signaling.

'''Multi-frequency signaling''' ('''MF''') is a group of signaling methods that use a mixture of two [[pure tone]] (pure [[sine wave]]) sounds. Various MF signaling [[Communications protocol|protocols]] were devised by the [[Bell System]] and [[CCITT]]. The earliest of these were for [[in-band]] signaling between switching centers, where [[Long distance calling|long-distance]] [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]] used a 16-[[Numerical digit|digit]] [[keypad]] to input the next portion of the destination telephone number in order to contact the next downstream long-distance telephone operator. This semi-automated signaling and switching proved successful in both speed and cost effectiveness. Based on this prior success with using MF by specialists to establish long-distance [[telephone call]]s, dual-tone multi-frequency signaling was developed for end-user signaling without the assistance of operators.

The DTMF system uses a set of eight audio frequencies transmitted in pairs to represent 16 signals, represented by the ten digits, the letters A to D, and the symbols ''#'' and ''*''. As the signals are audible tones in the voice frequency range, they can be transmitted through electrical repeaters and amplifiers, and over radio and microwave links, thus eliminating the need for intermediate operators on long-distance circuits.

AT&amp;T described the product as "a method for pushbutton signaling from customer stations using the voice transmission path."&lt;ref&gt;AT&amp;T, ''Compatibility Bulletin No. 105''&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent consumer telephones from interfering with the MF-based routing and switching between telephone switching centers, DTMF frequencies differ from all of the pre-existing MF signaling protocols between switching centers: MF/R1, [[R2 signalling|R2]], CCS4, CCS5, and others that were later replaced by [[Signalling System No 7|SS7]] digital signaling. DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark ''Touch-Tone''. The term was first used by AT&amp;T in commerce on July 5, 1960 and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963, when the first [[push-button telephone]] was made available to the public. It was a registered trademark by AT&amp;T from September 4, 1962 to March 13, 1984. It is standardized by [[ITU-T]] Recommendation [[Q.23]]. In the UK, it is also known as MF4.

Other vendors of compatible telephone equipment called the Touch-Tone feature ''tone dialing'' or ''DTMF'', or used their other trade names such as ''Digitone'' by [[Northern Electric Company]] in Canada.

As a method of [[in-band signaling]], DTMF signals were also used by [[cable television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] to indicate the start and stop times of local commercial insertion points during station breaks for the benefit of cable companies. Until [[out-of-band signaling]] equipment was developed in the 1990s, fast, unacknowledged DTMF tone sequences could be heard during the commercial breaks of cable channels in the United States and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Previously, terrestrial television stations used DTMF tones to control remote transmitters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}  In [[IP telephony]], DTMF signals can also be delivered as either in-band or out-of-band tones,&lt;ref&gt;H. Schulzrinne and T. Taylor, ''RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony Signals'', IETF RFC 4733, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; or even as a part of signaling protocols,&lt;ref&gt;C. Holmberg, E. Burger, H. Kaplan, ''Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO Method and Package Framework'', IETF RFC 6086, January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; as long as both endpoints agree on a common approach to adopt.

The engineers had envisioned telephones being used to access computers and automated response systems.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |first=Keith |last=Houston |title=Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3R2SAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage|date=24 September 2013 |publisher=W. W. Norton |isbn=978-0-393-24154-9 |page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consulted with companies to determine the requirements. This led to the addition of the [[number sign]]&lt;nowiki&gt; (#, ''pound'' or "diamond" in this context, "hash", "square" or "gate" in the UK, and "&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[octothorpe]]&lt;nowiki&gt;'' by the original engineers) and &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[asterisk]] or "star" (*) keys as well as a group of keys for menu selection: A, B, C and D. In the end, the lettered keys were dropped from most phones, and it was many years before the two symbol keys became widely used for [[vertical service code]]s such as *67 in the United States of America and Canada to suppress [[caller ID]].

Public [[payphone]]s that accept credit cards use these additional codes to send the information from the [[magnetic strip]].

The [[Autovon|AUTOVON]] telephone system of the [[United States Armed Forces]] used these signals to assert certain privilege and priority levels when placing telephone calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tech-faq.com/abcd.shtml "What are the ABCD tones?" — Tech FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Precedence is still a feature of military telephone networks, but using number combinations. For example, entering 93 before a number is a priority call.

Present-day uses of the A, B, C and D signals on telephone networks are few, and are exclusive to network control. For example, the A key is used on some networks to cycle through different carriers at will. The A, B, C and D tones are used in radio phone patch and repeater operations to allow, among other uses, control of the repeater while connected to an active phone line.

The *, #, A, B, C and D keys are still widely used worldwide by [[amateur radio]] operators and commercial two-way radio systems for equipment control, repeater control, remote-base operations and some telephone communications systems.

DTMF signaling tones can also be heard at the start or end of some [[VHS]] (Video Home System) cassette tapes. Information on the master version of the video tape is encoded in the DTMF tone. The encoded tone provides information to automatic duplication machines, such as format, duration and volume levels, in order to replicate the original video as closely as possible.

DTMF tones are used in some [[caller ID]] systems to transfer the caller ID information, but in the United States only [[Bell 202 modem|Bell 202]] modulated [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] signaling is used to transfer the data.

==Keypad==
[[File:MultiTone1.png|thumb|right|Combination of 1209 Hz and 697 Hz sine waves, representing DTMF "1"]]
The DTMF [[telephone keypad]] is laid out as a matrix of push buttons in which each row represents the low  frequency component and each column represents the high frequency component of the DTMF signal. The commonly used keypad has four rows and three columns, but a fourth column is present for some applications. Pressing a key sends a combination of the row and column frequencies. For example, the ''1'' key produces a superimposition of a 697 [[hertz|Hz]] low tone and a 1209 Hz high tone. Initial pushbutton designs employed levers, enabling each button to activate one row and one column contact. The tones are decoded by the switching center to determine the keys pressed by the user.

==Decoding==
[[File:1&amp;1 NetXXL powered by FRITZ! - CMD CM8870CSI on mainboard-1833.jpg|thumb|Two CMD CM8870CSI DTMF Receivers]]
DTMF was originally decoded by tuned filter banks. By the end of the 20th century, [[digital signal processing]] became the predominant technology for decoding. DTMF decoding algorithms typically use the [[Goertzel algorithm]]. As DTMF signaling is often transmitted in-band with voice or other audio signals present simultaneously, the DTMF signal definition includes strict limits for timing (minimum duration and interdigit spacing), frequency deviations, harmonics, and amplitude relation of the two components with respect to each other (''twist'').&lt;ref&gt;W. D. Reeves, ''Subscriber Loop Signaling and Transmission Handbook—Analog'', IEEE (1992), p.27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other multiple frequency signals==
National telephone systems define other tones, outside the DTMF specification, that indicate the status of lines, equipment, or the result of calls. Such [[call-progress tone]]s are often also composed of multiple frequencies and are standardized in each country. The Bell System defined them in the [[Precise Tone Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;AT&amp;T, ''Notes on Distance Dialing'', 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Epixenosomes''', also known as '''[[Candidatus]] ''Epixenosoma''''' are a genus of [[bacteria]] in the phylum [[Verrucomicrobia]] that form a [[symbiosis]] with marine [[ciliate]]s of the genus ''[[Euplotidium]]'', where they help to defend their ciliate hosts against predators.  It is a [[Monotypic taxon|monospecific]] genus, containing only the species '''Ca. ''Epixenosoma ejectans'''''.

==Description==
Epixenosomes possess two distinct developmental phases linked to the host cell cycle. Stage I epixenosomes are spherical, 0.5 μm in diameter and are surrounded by two [[Cell membrane|membranes]]. They divide by direct binary [[Fission (biology)|fission]]. Stage II epixenosomes are egg-shaped (2.2 μm in length and 1 μm in width) and show complex organization with different [[cytoplasm]]ic compartments, more complicated than the majority of [[prokaryotic]] organisms. They contain an extrusive apparatus within a [[protein]]aceous matrix, although apparently not membrane-bound, which differs from the remaining [[cytoplasm]]. A functional cell compartmentalization has also been evidenced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosati|first=G.|date=1999|title=Epixenosomes: symbionts of the hypotrich ciliate ''Euplotidium itoi''|url=|journal=Symbiosis|volume=26|pages=1–23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[phylogenetic]] position was originally unclear, because they appeared to have both prokaryote-like traits, such as binary fission, and [[eukaryote]]-like traits, such as intracellular membranes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, [[molecular phylogenetics]] showed that they are actually bacteria from the phylum [[Verrucomicrobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petroni|first=Giulio|last2=Spring|first2=Stefan|last3=Schleifer|first3=Karl-Heinz|last4=Verni|first4=Franco|last5=Rosati|first5=Giovanna|date=2000-02-15|title=Defensive extrusive ectosymbionts of ''Euplotidium'' (Ciliophora) that contain microtubule-like structures are bacteria related to Verrucomicrobia|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/4/1813|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=97|issue=4|pages=1813–1817|doi=10.1073/pnas.030438197|issn=0027-8424|pmid=10660683|pmc=26518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defensive symbiosis with ''Euplotidium''==
Epixenosomes live on the [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] surface of their hosts, marine ciliates in the genus ''Euplotidium''. The name "epixenosomes" comes from the ancient Greek {{lang|el|επι ξενον σομα}}, meaning "external alien body", referring to their extracellular position on the host. The extrusive apparatus ejects its contents when triggered; this process helps to defend the ciliate host against [[Predation|predators]]. Although ''Euplotidium'' can grow and reproduce without epixenosomes, those with epixenosomes have much higher survival when exposed to predators such as the ciliate ''[[Litonotus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosati|first=Giovanna|last2=Petroni|first2=Giulio|last3=Quochi|first3=Silvia|last4=Modeo|first4=Letizia|last5=Verni|first5=Franco|date=1999-05-01|title=Epixenosomes: Peculiar Epibionts of the Hypotrich Ciliate Euplotidium Itoi Defend Their Host Against Predators|journal=Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=278–282|doi=10.1111/j.1550-7408.1999.tb05125.x|issn=1550-7408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

External signals of unknown origin are detected by the membrane receptors located at the top of the organism. The consequent activation of the [[adenylate cyclase]]-[[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] system triggers the ejection of the extrusive apparatus, with the formation of a hollow tube, about 40 μm long, terminating in a head mainly consisting of the apical portion of the epixenosome (the region containing [[DNA]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The extrusive apparatus is surrounded by a basket of tubules. Experiments with [[antitubulin]] drugs and [[Immunocytochemistry|immunocytochemical]] analyses at the optical and electron microscopical level suggested that these tubules consist of [[tubulin]], which is a [[eukaryotic]] [[protein]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although some free-living Verrucomicrobia are reported to have tubulin genes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=Cheryl|last2=Samudrala|first2=Ram|last3=Anderson|first3=Iain|last4=Hedlund|first4=Brian P.|last5=Petroni|first5=Giulio|last6=Michailova|first6=Natasha|last7=Pinel|first7=Nicolas|last8=Overbeek|first8=Ross|last9=Rosati|first9=Giovanna|date=2002-12-24|title=Genes for the cytoskeletal protein tubulin in the bacterial genus Prosthecobacter|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=99|issue=26|pages=17049–17054|doi=10.1073/pnas.012516899|issn=0027-8424|pmid=12486237|pmc=139267}}&lt;/ref&gt; they have not been found to have tubular structures like those of epixenosomes.

A '''gravitational-wave observatory''' (or '''gravitational-wave detector''')  is any device designed to measure [[gravitational waves]], tiny distortions of [[spacetime]] that were first predicted by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] in 1916.&lt;ref name="TG-20140317"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Clark |first=Stuart |title=What are gravitational waves? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/mar/17/gravitational-waves-bicep-inflation-big-bang |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=22 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravitational waves are perturbations in the theoretical curvature of spacetime caused by accelerated masses. The existence of gravitational radiation is a specific prediction of [[general relativity]], but is a feature of all theories of gravity that obey [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schutz|first=Bernard F.|title=Gravitational waves on the back of an envelope|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=52|issue=5|pages=412–419|doi=10.1119/1.13627|bibcode = 1984AmJPh..52..412S |date=1984|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0013-747D-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the 1960s, gravitational-wave detectors have been built and constantly improved. The present-day generation of resonant mass antennas and laser interferometers has reached the necessary sensitivity to detect gravitational waves from sources in the [[Milky Way]]. Gravitational-wave observatories are the primary tool of [[gravitational-wave astronomy]].

A number of experiments have provided indirect evidence, notably the observation of [[binary pulsar]]s, the orbits of which evolve precisely matching the predictions of energy loss through general relativistic gravitational-wave emission. The 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1993|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1993/press.html|publisher=[[Nobel Prize]]|accessdate=6 May 2014|date=13 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==
The direct detection of gravitational waves is complicated by the [[Orders of magnitude (length)|extraordinarily small]] effect the waves produce on a detector. The amplitude of a spherical wave falls off as the inverse of the distance from the source.  Thus, even waves from extreme systems such as merging binary black holes die out to a very small amplitude by the time they reach the Earth. Astrophysicists predicted that some gravitational waves passing the Earth might produce differential motion on the order 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m in a [[LIGO]]-size instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Precision Laser Interferometry in the LIGO Project|last=Whitcomb|first=S.E.|work=Proceedings of the International Symposium on Modern Problems in Laser Physics, August 27-September 3, 1995, Novosibirsk|id=LIGO Publication P950007-01-R|url=http://admdbsrv.ligo.caltech.edu/publications/default.htf?page=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resonant mass antennas==
{{main|Weber bar}}

A simple device to detect the expected wave motion is called a resonant mass antenna – a large, solid body of metal isolated from outside vibrations. This type of instrument was the first type of gravitational-wave detector. Strains in space due to an incident gravitational wave excite the body's [[resonant frequency]] and could thus be amplified to detectable levels. Conceivably, a nearby supernova might be strong enough to be seen without resonant amplification. However, up to 2018, no gravitational wave observation that would have been widely accepted by the research community has been made on any type of resonant mass antenna, despite certain claims of observation by researchers operating the antennas.

There are 3 types of resonant mass antenna that have been built: the room-temperature bar antennas, the cryogenically cooled bar antennas and cryogenically cooled spherical antennas. 

The earliest types of antennas were the room-temperature bar-shaped antennas called [[Weber bar]]; these were dominant in 1960s and 1970s and many were built around the world. It was claimed by Weber and some others in the late 1960s and early 1970s that these devices did observe gravitational waves; however, other experimenters failed to detect gravitational waves with these devices and thus it became consensus that these devices could not detect gravitational waves. &lt;ref&gt;For a review of early experiments using Weber bars, see {{cite journal|first=J.|last=Levine|title=Early Gravity-Wave Detection Experiments, 1960-1975|journal=Physics in Perspective |volume=6|issue=1|pages=42–75|date=April 2004|doi= 10.1007/s00016-003-0179-6|bibcode=2004PhP.....6...42L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation of resonant mass antennas, developed in the 1980s and 1990s, were the cryogenic bar antennas which are also sometimes called Weber bars. There were in the 1990s 5 major cryogenic bar antennas: [[AURIGA]] (Padua, Italy), [[NAUTILUS]] (Rome, Italy), [[EXPLORER]] (CERN, Switzerland), [[Allegro gravitational-wave detector|ALLEGRO]] (Louisiana, USA), [[NIOBE]] (Perth, Australia). In 1997, these 5 antennas run by 4 research groups formed the [[International Gravitational Event Collaboration]] (IGEC) for collaboration. Over the years, many claims of detection of gravitational waves have been made by scientist using cryogenic bar antennas but none of these was accepted by the larger community.

In 1980s there was also a cryogenic bar antenna called [[ALTAIR (gravitational wave detector)|ALTAIR]], which along with a room-temperature bar antenna called [[GEOGRAV]] was built in Italy as a prototype for later bar antennas. GEOGRAV-detector was claimed by its operators to have seen gravitational waves coming from the supernova [[SN1987A]] (along with another room-temperature bar of Weber), but these claims were also dismissed by the wider community.

These modern cryogenic forms of the Weber bar operated with [[SQUID|superconducting quantum interference devices]] to detect vibration (see for example, [[ALLEGRO]]). Some of them are still in operation, for example [[AURIGA]], an ultracryogenic resonant cylindrical bar gravitational wave detector based at [[INFN]] in Italy. The AURIGA and LIGO teams have collaborated in joint observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=AURIGA Collaboration|author2=LIGO Scientific Collaboration |author3=Baggio |title=A Joint Search for Gravitational Wave Bursts with AURIGA and LIGO|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/25/9/095004|date=2008|last4=Cerdonio|first4=M|last5=De Rosa|first5=M|last6=Falferi|first6=P|last7=Fattori|first7=S|last8=Fortini|first8=P|last9=Giusfredi|first9=G| displayauthors = 8|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume=25|issue=9|pages=095004|arxiv=0710.0497|bibcode = 2008CQGra..25i5004B |hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0013-72D5-D }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is the current consensus that current cryogenic Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves. As of 2018, no observation of gravitational waves by cryogenic Weber bars has occurred.

In the 2000s, the third generation of resonant mass antennas, the spherical cryogenic antennas, emerged. 4 spherical antennas were proposed around year 2000 and 2 of them ended up being built (others were cancelled) as downsized versions. The proposed antennas were [[MiniGrail|GRAIL]] (Netherlands, proposal that when downsized became [[MiniGrail|MiniGRAIL]]), [[Truncated Icosahedral Gravitational Wave Antenna |TIGA]] (USA, small prototypes made), [[SFERA]] (Italy), [[Mario Schenberg (Gravitational Wave Detector)|Graviton]] (Brasil, proposal that when downsized became [[Mario Schenberg (Gravitational Wave Detector)|Mario Schenberg]]).

Currently there are 2 cryogenic spherical gravitational wave antennas in the world, the [[MiniGrail|MiniGRAIL]] and the [[Mario Schenberg (Gravitational Wave Detector)|Mario Schenberg]]. These antennas are actually a collaborative effort, having much in common.

MiniGRAIL is based at [[Leiden University]], consisting of an exactingly machined 1150&amp;nbsp;kg sphere cryogenically cooled to 20 mK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minigrail.nl/AboutMiniGRAIL/AboutMiniGRAIL-index.html Gravitational Radiation Antenna In Leiden]&lt;/ref&gt; The spherical configuration allows for equal sensitivity in all directions, and is somewhat experimentally simpler than larger linear devices requiring high vacuum. Events are detected by measuring [[Multipole moments|deformation of the detector sphere]]. MiniGRAIL is highly sensitive in the 2–4&amp;nbsp;kHz range, suitable for detecting gravitational waves from rotating neutron star instabilities or small black hole mergers.&lt;ref name='MiniGRAIL_2000'&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Arlette |last1=de Waard |first2=Luciano |last2=Gottardi |first3=Giorgio |last3=Frossati |title=Spherical Gravitational Wave Detectors: cooling and quality factor of a small CuAl6% sphere - In: Marcel Grossmann meeting on General Relativity |publisher= |place=Rome, Italy |pages= |date=2000 |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Mario Schenberg (Gravitational Wave Detector)|Mario Schenberg]] antenna is located in [[Sao Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

==Interferometers==
[[File:Atomic Interferometry.ogv|thumb|350px|Atomic interferometry.]]
{{gravitational wave observatory principle.svg}}
{{main|Interferometric gravitational wave detector}}
A more sensitive detector uses laser [[interferometry]] to measure gravitational-wave induced motion between separated 'free' masses.&lt;ref&gt;The idea of using laser interferometry for gravitational-wave detection was first mentioned by Gerstenstein and Pustovoit 1963 Sov. Phys.–JETP 16 433. Weber mentioned it in an unpublished laboratory notebook. [[Rainer Weiss]] first described in detail a practical solution with an analysis of realistic limitations to the technique in R. Weiss (1972). "Electromagnetically Coupled Broadband Gravitational Antenna". Quarterly Progress Report, Research Laboratory of Electronics, MIT 105: 54.&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the masses to be separated by large distances (increasing the signal size); a further advantage is that it is sensitive to a wide range of frequencies (not just those near a resonance as is the case for Weber bars). Ground-based interferometers are now operational. Currently, the most sensitive is [[LIGO]] – the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. LIGO has three detectors: one in [[Livingston, Louisiana]]; the other two (in the same vacuum tubes) at the [[Hanford site]] in [[Richland, Washington]]. Each consists of two [[Fabry–Pérot interferometer|light storage arms]] which are 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;kilometers in length. These are at 90&amp;nbsp;degree angles to each other, with the light passing through 1m diameter vacuum tubes running the entire 4&amp;nbsp;kilometers. A passing gravitational wave will slightly stretch one arm as it shortens the other. This is precisely the motion to which an interferometer is most sensitive{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}.

Even with such long arms, the strongest gravitational waves will only change the distance between the ends of the arms by at most roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;meters. LIGO should be able to detect gravitational waves as small as &lt;math&gt;h \approx 5\times 10^{-22}&lt;/math&gt;. Upgrades to LIGO and other detectors such as [[Virgo interferometer|VIRGO]], [[GEO 600]], and [[TAMA 300]] should increase the sensitivity still further; the next generation of instruments (Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo) will be more than ten times more sensitive. Another highly sensitive interferometer ([[KAGRA]]) is currently in the design phase. A key point is that a ten-times increase in sensitivity (radius of "reach") increases the volume of space accessible to the instrument by one thousand. This increases the rate at which detectable signals should be seen from one per tens of years of observation, to tens per year.

Interferometric detectors are limited at high frequencies by [[shot noise]], which occurs because the lasers produce photons randomly; one analogy is to rainfall – the rate of rainfall, like the laser intensity, is measurable, but the raindrops, like photons, fall at random times, causing fluctuations around the average value. This leads to noise at the output of the detector, much like radio static. In addition, for sufficiently high laser power, the random momentum transferred to the test masses by the laser photons shakes the mirrors, masking signals at low frequencies. Thermal noise (e.g., [[Brownian motion]]) is another limit to sensitivity. In addition to these "stationary" (constant) noise sources, all ground-based detectors are also limited at low frequencies by [[seismic]] noise and other forms of environmental vibration, and other "non-stationary" noise sources; creaks in mechanical structures, lightning or other large electrical disturbances, etc. may also create noise masking an event or may even imitate an event. All these must be taken into account and excluded by analysis before a detection may be considered a true gravitational-wave event.

Space-based interferometers, such as [[Laser Interferometer Space Antenna|LISA]] and [[DECIGO]], are also being developed.  LISA's design calls for three test masses forming an equilateral triangle, with lasers from each spacecraft to each other spacecraft forming two independent interferometers. LISA is planned to occupy a solar orbit trailing the Earth, with each arm of the triangle being five million kilometers. This puts the detector in an [[Interplanetary medium|excellent vacuum]] far from Earth-based sources of noise, though it will still be susceptible to shot noise, as well as artifacts caused by [[cosmic ray]]s and [[solar wind]].

An ''atomic gravitational-wave interferometric sensor'' (AGIS) is an alternative means to detect [[gravitational waves]], proposed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Peter L.|title=Comment on "Atomic gravitational wave interferometric sensor"|journal=Physical Review D|volume=84|issue=2|pages=028101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.84.028101|bibcode = 2011PhRvD..84b8101B |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David Marvin Slaughter|chapter=AGIS-LEO |title=Long Baseline Atom Interferometry|date=2011|publisher=Stanford University|pages=41&amp;ndash;98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sense, the easiest signals to detect should be constant sources. Supernovae and neutron star or black hole mergers should have larger amplitudes and be more interesting, but the waves generated will be more complicated. The waves given off by a spinning, bumpy neutron star would be "[[monochromatic]]" – like a [[pure tone]] in [[acoustics]]. It would not change very much in amplitude or frequency.

The [[Einstein@Home]] project is a [[distributed computing]] project similar to [[SETI@home]] intended to detect this type of simple gravitational wave. By taking data from LIGO and GEO, and sending it out in little pieces to thousands of volunteers for parallel analysis on their home computers, Einstein@Home can sift through the data far more quickly than would be possible otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu/ Einstein@Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==High frequency detectors==
There are currently two detectors focusing on detections at the higher end of the gravitational-wave spectrum (10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Hz){{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}: one at [[University of Birmingham]], England, and the other at [[Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare|INFN]] Genoa, Italy. A third is under development at [[Chongqing University]], China. The Birmingham detector measures changes in the polarization state of a [[microwave]] beam circulating in a closed loop about one meter across. Two have been fabricated and they are currently expected to be sensitive to periodic spacetime strains of &lt;math&gt;h\sim{2 \times 10^{-13}/\sqrt{\mathit{Hz}}} &lt;/math&gt;, given as an [[Spectral density|amplitude spectral density]]. The INFN Genoa detector is a resonant antenna consisting of two coupled spherical [[superconducting]] harmonic oscillators a few centimeters in diameter.  The oscillators are designed to have (when uncoupled) almost equal resonant frequencies. The system is currently expected to have a sensitivity to periodic spacetime strains of &lt;math&gt;h\sim{2 \times 10^{-17}/\sqrt{\mathit{Hz}}} &lt;/math&gt;, with an expectation to reach a sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;h\sim{2 \times 10^{-20}/\sqrt{\mathit{Hz}}} &lt;/math&gt;. The Chongqing University detector is planned to detect relic high-frequency gravitational waves with the predicted typical parameters  ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Hz (10&amp;nbsp;GHz) and ''h'' ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Pulsar timing arrays==
{{main article|Pulsar timing array}}
A different approach to detecting gravitational waves is used by [[pulsar timing array]]s, such as the [[European Pulsar Timing Array]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = G. H.| first2 = B.

As a gravitational wave passing through the Earth contracts space in one direction and expands space in another, the times of arrival of pulsar signals from those directions are shifted correspondingly. By studying a fixed set of pulsars across the sky, these arrays should be able to detect gravitational waves in the nanohertz range. Such signals are expected to be emitted by pairs of merging supermassive black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=0812.2721 |last1= Hobbs |first1=G.

==Cosmic microwave background polarization==
{{main article|Cosmic microwave background#Polarization}}
The cosmic microwave background, radiation left over from when the Universe cooled sufficiently for the [[Recombination (cosmology)|first atoms to form]], can contain the imprint of gravitational waves from the [[Chronology of the universe#Very early universe|very early Universe]]. The microwave radiation is polarized. The pattern of polarization can be split into two classes called ''E''-modes and ''B''-modes. This is in analogy to [[electrostatics]] where the electric field (''E''-field) has a vanishing [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and the magnetic field (''B''-field) has a vanishing [[divergence]]. The ''E''-modes can be created by a variety of processes, but the ''B''-modes can only be produced by [[gravitational lensing]], [[gravitational waves]], or scattering from [[Cosmic dust|dust]].

On 17 March 2014, astronomers at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] announced the apparent detection of the imprint [[gravitational waves]] in the [[cosmic microwave background]], which, if confirmed, would provide strong evidence for [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] and the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |authors=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the Universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye

The '''Hamilton Institute''' is a multi-disciplinary research centre at the [[Maynooth University]], named after [[William Rowan Hamilton]], arguably Ireland's most distinguished mathematician.

The Hamilton Institute was formally established in November 2001 under the first round of funding,&lt;ref name="www"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuim"/&gt; by [[Science Foundation Ireland]] (SFI). It was officially opened by Bill Harris, SFI Director-General with the inaugural lecture being given by [[Kevin Warwick]]. Since 2001 the institute has grown in size to around 45 full-time researchers in 2008.&lt;ref name="nuim1"/&gt; From 2001 until 2014 the institute Director was Prof. Douglas Leith. In 2015, Prof. Ken Duffy became the Institute's director. In this period the institute has been successful in winning a number of large research grants, in addition to the original seed funding grant from SFI, including the €4.7M National Communications Network Research Centre,&lt;ref name="www2"/&gt; a €2.5M Systems Biology initiative,&lt;ref name="irishscientist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www3"/&gt; the €2.7M Next Generation Internet project,&lt;ref name="entemp"/&gt; the National Biophotonics Platform&lt;ref name="biophotonics"/&gt; and the €2.2M Network Mathematics initiative.&lt;ref name="networkmaths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="universityscience"/&gt;&lt;ref name="electricnews"/&gt; The institute is also a partner in the €5.8M SFI funded FAME strategic research cluster announced in 2009.&lt;ref name="ofoghlu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www4"/&gt;

The Hamilton Institute's stated aim&lt;ref name="institute"/&gt; is to provide a bridge between [[mathematics]] and its applications in ICT and [[biology]]. It has organised a number of high profile inter-disciplinary workshops including a successful series of biannual International Workshops on Non-negative Matrices &amp; Their Applications,&lt;ref name="emis"/&gt; ( run in 2004,&lt;ref name="hamilton"/&gt; 2006&lt;ref name="hamilton5"/&gt; and 2008&lt;ref name="hamilton6"/&gt;) and a series of International Workshops on Systems Biology (in 2006&lt;ref name="hamilton7"/&gt; and 2008&lt;ref name="hamilton8"/&gt;). The Hamilton Institute has also hosted workshops such as the International Symposium on Positive Systems (POSTA) and International Workshop on Multiple Access Communications (MACOM).

The Hamilton Institute robotic soccer team were Robocup World Champions in 2008,&lt;ref name="robocup-cn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="www9"/&gt; and have regularly fielded Robocup teams since.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">'''Hydric soil''' is [[soil]] which is permanently or seasonally saturated by water, resulting in [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] conditions, as found in [[wetland]]s.

== Overview ==

Most [[soil]]s are [[Wikt:aerobic|aerobic]].  This is important because [[plant]] roots respire (that is, they consume [[oxygen]] and [[carbohydrates]] while releasing [[carbon dioxide]]) and there must be sufficient air—especially oxygen—in the soil to support most forms of [[soil life]].  Air normally moves through interconnected [[porosity|pores]] by forces such as changes in [[atmospheric pressure]], the flushing action of rainwater, and by simple [[diffusion]].

In addition to plant [[root]]s, most forms of soil [[microorganisms]] need oxygen to survive. This is true of the more well-known soil animals as well, such as [[ants]], [[earthworms]] and [[Mole (animal)|moles]]. But soils can often become saturated with water due to rainfall and flooding.  [[soil gas|Gas diffusion in soil]] slows (some 10,000 times slower) when soil becomes saturated with water because there are no open passageways for air to travel.  When oxygen levels become limited, intense competition arises between soil life forms for the remaining oxygen.  When this anaerobic environment continues for long periods during the growing season, quite different biological and chemical reactions begin to dominate, compared with aerobic soils.  In soils where saturation with water is prolonged and is repeated for many years, unique soil properties usually develop that can be recognized in the field.  Soils with these unique properties are called hydric soils, and although they may occupy a relatively small portion of the landscape, they maintain important functions in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schuyt, K. and Brander, L. 2004. Living Waters: Conserving the Source of Life – The Economic Values of theWorld’sWetlands. Amsterdam, the Netherlands: European Union, and Gland, Switzerland: World Wildlife Fund.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plants found in hydric soils often have [[aerenchyma]], internal spaces in stems and rhizomes, that allow atmospheric oxygen to be transported to the rooting zone.&lt;ref&gt;Justin, S. H. F. W. and Armstrong, W. 1987. The anatomical characteristics of roots and plant response to soil flooding. New Phytologist 106: 465–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, many [[wetlands]] are dominated by plants with aerenchyma;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2010. Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation (2nd edition). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; common examples include cattails, sedges and water-lilies.

== Technical definitions ==

=== United States ===

A hydric soil is defined by federal law&lt;ref&gt;Food Security Act(FSA) of 1985 16 U.S.C. Section 3801(a)(2)&lt;/ref&gt; to mean "soil that, in its undrained condition, is saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during a growing season to develop an anerobic condition that supports the growth and regeneration of hydrophytic vegetation".  This term is part of the legal definition of a [[wetland]] included in the [[United States]] [[Food Security Act of 1985]] (P.L. 99-198). This definition is provided in the controlling regulations to the Wetland Conservation Provisions of the FSA of 1985(7 C.F.R 12) and is used by the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service in the administration of the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions ("Swampbuster") contained in the FSA of 1985.   In adopting this definition in 1985, Congress attempted to capture the duration of waterlogged condition of a hydric soil by adding that a hydric soil is waterlogged long enough to support not only the growth of plants adapted to life in anaerobic conditions but also the regeneration of such plants.

Another common definition of a hydric soils is provided by the National Technical Committee of Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as "a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or [[ponding]] long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part."&lt;ref&gt;This definition  (Federal Register, July 13, 1994) replaced the older 1991 version and accomplished two things. First, a soil that is artificially drained or protected (ditches, levees, etc.) is a hydric soil if the soil in its undisturbed state meets the definition of a hydric soil. Estimated soil properties for manipulated soils are based on best professional estimates of the properties thought to exist before manipulation. Second, the link between the definition and criteria was removed.&lt;/ref&gt; The NTCHS hydric soil definition is used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency in their joint responsibilities in the administration of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (1972).

[[File:IASME_Consortium_Logo.png|thumb|The IASME Governance standard was developed by the IASME Consortium|alt=|270x270px]]
'''IASME''' is an [[Information assurance|Information Assurance]] standard that is designed to be simple and affordable to help improve the cyber security of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs). 

The IASME Governance controls are aligned with the [[Cyber Essentials]] scheme and certification to the IASME standard usually includes certification to Cyber Essentials. The standard was developed in 2010 and has proven to be very effective at improving the security of supply chains for large organisations.

== Background ==

IASME Governance was originally developed as an academic-SME partnership that attracted a lot of interest from government and small businesses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consultancyweek.co.uk/2013/03/11/bis-call-for-interest-iasme BIS call for interest: IASME], 11 March 2013 by Consultancy Week Team. Retrieved on 19 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research towards the IASME model was undertaken in the UK during 2009-10,&lt;ref&gt;[http://iasme.co.uk/iasmeesearchfindingsnov10.pdf] "Information Assurance and SMEs: Research Findings to inform the development of the IASME model" Retrieved on 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; after an acknowledgement that the current international information assurance standard ([[ISO/IEC 27001:2013|ISO/IEC 27001]]) was complex for resource-strapped SMEs, providing a weakness in the supply chain. IASME was developed during 2010-11 and was launched later that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcs.org/content/conBlogPost/1857 BCS Security Blog, 15 April 2011],
Retrieved on 14 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been revised regularly to keep pace with changes to the risk environmnent of SMEs. The development process with SMEs was explained in a published international SME conference paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eprints.worc.ac.uk/1600/ IASME: Information Security Management Evolution for SMEs] Retrieved on 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The IASME Governance standard follows the same implementation pattern used by the international standards community including PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) principles &lt;ref&gt;[http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/project-planning-tools/overview/pdca-cycle.html] "Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle&amp;nbsp;— The PDCA cycle" Retrieved on 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the Information Security Management System (ISMS) which provides a management framework. Both are refined and expressed in business terms recognizable by most organisations.

The IASME Governance standard was developed and piloted with the help of small businesses mostly in the West Midlands of the UK with encouraging results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraggleworks.com/news.html?start=5 News&amp;nbsp;— Fraggleworks] Retrieved 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defencemanagement.com/article.asp?id=603&amp;content_name=Cyber,%20Intelligence%20and%20Electronic%20Warfare&amp;article=22071] "Securing the Supply Chain", Retrieved 17 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The standard has been shown to be useful to SMEs both in the UK and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iasme.co.uk/HMGIASMEFINAL.pdf] "Reputation Assured with IASME" Retrieved 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  

Large organisations can use the IASME Governance standard in their supply chains to understand and reduce supplier risk. An article explaining the supply chain benefits has been written by its developer, David Booth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb2bc.co.uk/successful_it_projects/articles/?id=184] "Protecting Information&amp;nbsp;— Your Most Important asset" Retrieved on 27 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Both large and small organisations can use the IASME certification as an alternative to the ISO/IEC 27001 standard. 

== Structure of the standard ==

The standard is managed by [http://www.iasme.co.uk/ The IASME Consortium Ltd] who operate a network of around 150 Certification Bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iasme.co.uk/certification-bodies/|title=Certification Bodies – IASME|last=|first=|date=|website=IASME Consortium|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are licensed to certify candidate organisations.

The standard is available at two levels of assurance: 
* '''IASME Governance Self-assessment'''
**Candidates complete an online questionnaire with around 150 simple questions about their organisation. This is marked by a Certification Body who awards the certification if all of the answers given are compliant with the standard.
* '''IASME Governance Audited (or "IASME Gold")'''
**The candidate organisation is visited by an IASME Certification Body who verifies compliance with the standard and, if appropriate, issues certification.

In 2017, the standard was updated to include additional questions to enable organisations comply with the [[General Data Protection Regulation|General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR)]].

== Comparison with other standards ==

=== ISO/IEC 27001 ===

IASME Governance is a risk-led standard with a similar set of controls as the [[ISO/IEC 27001]] standard. A document is available from IASME that shows this comparison

=== NCSC 10 Steps to Cyber Security ===

IASME Governance maps very closely to the UK Government's [[National Cyber Security Centre (United Kingdom)|NCSC]] [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/10-steps-cyber-security 10 Steps to Cyber Security]. A mapping between the two standards is available&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasme.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/10-Steps-Mapping-to-IASME-v1.0.xlsx|title=Mapping between IASME Governance and 10 Steps to Cyber Security|last=|first=|date=|website=IASME Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyber Assessment Framework ===

The [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/nis-directive-cyber-assessment-framework Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)] has been developed by the UK Government to allow organisations to demonstrate their compliance to the [[NIS Directive]]. The IASME Governance Standard maps closely to the CAF&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iasme.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CAF-Mapping-to-IASME-v1.0.xlsx|title=Mapping between IASME Governance and the CAF / NIS Directice|last=|first=|date=|website=IASME Consortium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Usage of the standard and awards ===
The IASME standard has become a focus of attention, as the information security threat to UK businesses continues to increase, and vulnerabilities in their systems continue to cause expensive data breaches and system failures. The increasing number of newspaper and journal articles on this subject reflect an increased security awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigilance-securitymagazine.com/industry-news/information-security-and-management/3007--iasme-sutcliffe-partner-to-launch-ground-breaking-cyber-security-accreditation-and-liability-insurance-scheme-for-small-businesses]
Vigilance Security Magazine, 14 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/806d7d72-7d16-11e2-adb6-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Lqz0Uo7E Financial Times, 25 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

IASME was specifically mentioned in a keynote speech at the Infosec Europe 2013 event held in London&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chloe-smith-keynote-speech-at-infosec-2013 Cabinet Office, 23 April 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and received an innovation award from Computer Weekly Europe shortly afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240183137/Computer-Weekly-European-User-Awards-for-Security-Winners]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recognised by the [[States of Jersey]] as suitable security standard for the government supply chain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/Government/PublicSectorReform/eGovernment/Pages/SecurityStandards.aspx|title=Security standards|last=Jersey|first=States of|website=www.gov.je|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Ideation''' is the [[creativity|creative]] process of generating, developing, and communicating new ideas, where an [[idea]] is understood as a basic element of thought that can be either visual, concrete, or abstract.&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, 2005, page 613&lt;/ref&gt; Ideation comprises all stages of a thought cycle, from [[innovation]], to development, to actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Graham and Bachmann, 2004, pg 54&lt;/ref&gt;  Ideation can be conducted by individuals, organizations, or crowds. As such, it is an essential part of the [[design process]], both in education and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, in Fowles, 1979, page 15&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Methods of innovation==

The book ''Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas'' (Graham and Bachmann, 2004) proposes the following methods of innovation:

;Problem solution:  This is the most simple method of progress, where someone has found a problem and as a result, solves it.
;Derivative idea:  This involves taking something that already exists and changing it.
;Symbiotic idea:  A symbiotic method of idea creation is when multiple ideas are combined, using different elements of each to make a whole.
;Revolutionary idea:  A revolutionary idea breaks away from traditional thought and creates a brand new perspective.  For example, the writings of [[Copernicus]] (a development of classical Greek thought).
;Serendipitous discovery:  [[Serendipitous]] solutions are ideas which have been coincidentally developed without the intention of the inventor. For example, the discovery of [[penicillin]].
;Targeted innovation:  Creating a targeted innovation deals with a direct path of discovery.  This is often accompanied by intensive research in order to have a distinct and almost expected resolution.  For example, [[linear programming]].
;Artistic innovation:  Artistic innovation disregards the necessity for practicality and holds no constraints.
;Philosophical idea:  The philosophical idea lives in the mind of the creator and can never  be proven. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:0471479446|title= Ideation: The Birth and Death of Ideas|accessdate=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of idea however can still have vast residual effects.  For example, the idea of [[eternal recurrence]].
;Computer-assisted discovery:  This uses a computer in order to widen possibilities of research and numeric possibilities.

This list of methods is by no means comprehensive or necessarily accurate. Graham and Bachmann's examples of revolutionary ideas might better be described as evolutionary; both Marx and Copernicus having built upon pre-existing concepts within new or different contexts.  Similarly, the description provided for artistic innovation represents one perspective.

More-nuanced understandings, such as that expressed by [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]] in ''Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art'', recognize the generative force technical and perceptual limitations provide within specific arts practices.{{Page needed|date=November 2014}}  In [[painting]], for example, technical limitations such as the frame, the surface and the palette, along with perceptual constraints like [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure/ground relationships]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], provide creative frameworks for the painter.  Similarly in music, harmonic scales, meter and time signatures work in tandem with choices of instrumentation and expression to both produce specific results and improvise novel outcomes.

The [[T.O.T.E.|T.O.T.E. model]], an [[iterative]] [[problem solving]] strategy based on [[feedback]] loops, provides an alternative approach to considering the process of ideation.  Ideation may also be considered as a facet of other generative systems, such as [[Emergence]].

==Criticism==

The word "ideation" has come under informal criticism as being a term of meaningless jargon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2008/08/why-jargon-feeds-on-lazy-minds.html|title=Why Jargon Feeds on Lazy Minds|last=Berkun|first=Scott|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2008-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being inappropriately similar to the [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] term for [[suicidal ideation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.themuse.com/advice/10-annoying-buzzwords-the-whole-office-would-be-better-off-without|title=Annoying Tech Jargon to Remove From Your Vocabulary-The Muse|last=Thomson|first=Stephanie|publisher=[[The Daily Muse|The Muse]]|accessdate=16 March 2016|date=2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for Experimental Mathematics (IEM)''' was founded, with the support of the [[Volkswagen]]
Foundation, as a central scientific facility of the former University of Essen, now [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] in 1989.  With the addition of the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]] Foundation Chair on 1 January 1999, the Institute was expanded in the area of Computer Networking Technology. [[A.J. Han Vinck]] is currently the Institute's managing director.

The primary objective of the Institute is to foster interactions between the fields of mathematics, computer science and the engineering sciences. Mathematicians, computer experts and telecommunications engineers are engaged in trans-disciplinary collaboration under one roof. The main areas of research are [[discrete mathematics]], [[number theory]], [[data transmission|digital communication]], and [[computer network|computer networking technology]].

'''Interim Alternative Educational Setting''' ('''IAES''') is a term for an educational setting and program other than the student's current placement that enables the student to continue to receive educational services according to his or her [[Individualized Education Program]].  The Individualized Education Program or [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] is a plan determined by a team who develops a set of modifications for the educational program of a [[special education]] student.  The setting is designed to allow the student to continue progress in the regular [[curriculum]] to meet the goals set out by the IEP and to allow students to receive services and modifications designed to help students address problem behavior.

The '''International Conference on Database Theory''' ('''ICDT''') is an international research conference on foundations of [[database theory]], and has been held since 1982. It is frequently also called as the [[Symposium on Principles of Database Systems|PODS]] of [[Europe]]. Since 2009, ICDT has been held jointly with the EDBT, a research conference on systems aspects of [[data management]]. Until 2009, the conference used to happen biennially. The conference now happens annually at a location typically within Europe. ICDT has been instrumental in developing a flourishing research community within Europe, working on problems in database theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icdt.tu-dortmund.de|title=ICDT: the International Conference on Database Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''KL-ONE''' (pronounced "kay ell won") is a well known [[knowledge representation]] system in the tradition of [[semantic networks]] and [[Frame (Artificial intelligence) | frames]]; that is, it is a [[frame language]]. The system is an attempt to overcome semantic indistinctness in semantic network representations and to explicitly represent conceptual information as a structured inheritance network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = W.

There is a whole family of KL-ONE-like systems. One of the innovations that KL-ONE initiated was the use of a [[deductive classifier]], an automated reasoning engine that can validate a frame ontology and deduce new information about the ontology based on the initial information provided by a domain expert. 

Frames in KL-ONE are called [[concepts]]. These form hierarchies using subsume-relations; in the KL-ONE terminology a [[superclass (computer science)|super class]] is said to subsume its [[Subclass (computer science) | subclasses]]. 
[[Multiple inheritance]] is allowed. Actually a concept is said to be well-formed only if it inherits from more than one other concept. All concepts, except the top concept (usually THING), must have at least one super class. 

In KL-ONE descriptions are separated into two basic classes of concepts: primitive and defined. Primitives are domain concepts that are not fully defined. This means that given all the properties of a concept, this is not sufficient to classify it. They may also be viewed as incomplete definitions. Using the same view, defined concepts are complete definitions. Given the properties of a concept, these are [[necessary and sufficient]] conditions to classify the concept.

The slot-concept is called roles and the values of the roles are role-fillers. There are several different types of roles to be used in different situations. The most common and important role type is the generic RoleSet that captures the fact that the role may be filled with more than one filler.

'''Linked timestamping''' is a type of [[trusted timestamping]] where issued time-stamps are related to each other.

==Description==
Linked timestamping creates time-stamp tokens which are dependent on each other, entangled in some [[authenticated]] [[data structure]]. Later modification of the issued time-stamps would invalidate this structure. The temporal order of issued time-stamps is also protected by this data structure, making backdating of the issued time-stamps impossible, even by the issuing server itself.

The top of the authenticated data structure is generally ''published'' in some hard-to-modify and widely witnessed media, like printed [[newspaper]] or public [[blockchain]]. There are no (long-term) [[Public-key cryptography|private keys]] in use, avoiding [[Public key infrastructure|PKI]]-related risks.

Suitable candidates for the authenticated data structure include:
* Linear [[hash chain]]
* [[Merkle tree]] (binary hash tree)
* [[Skip list]]

The simplest linear hash chain-based time-stamping scheme is illustrated in the following diagram:
[[File:Hashlink timestamping.svg|none|600px]]

The linking-based [[Timestamping authority|time-stamping authority]] (TSA) usually performs the following distinct functions:

;Aggregation
:For increased scalability the TSA might group time-stamping requests together which arrive within a short time-frame. These requests are ''aggregated'' together without retaining their temporal order and then assigned the same time value. Aggregation creates a [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] connection between all involved requests; the authenticating aggregate value will be used as input for the ''linking'' operation.

;Linking
:Linking creates a verifiable and ordered cryptographic link between the current and already issued time-stamp tokens.

[[File:Root of Merkle tree as published in Widely Witnessed Media.png|thumb|321px|right|Example newspaper publication of hash-linked time-stamping service]]

;Publishing
:The TSA periodically ''publishes'' some links, so that all previously issued time-stamp tokens depend on the published link and that it is practically impossible to forge the published values. By publishing widely witnessed links, the TSA creates unforgeable verification points for validating all previously issued time-stamps.

==Security==
Linked timestamping is inherently more secure than the usual, public-key signature based time-stamping. All consequential time-stamps "seal" previously issued ones - hash chain (or other authenticated dictionary in use) could be built only in one way; modifying issued time-stamps is nearly as hard as finding a preimage for the used [[cryptographic hash function]]. Continuity of operation is observable by users; periodic publications in widely witnessed media provide extra transparency.

Tampering with absolute time values could be detected by users, whose time-stamps are relatively comparable by system design.

Absence of secret keys increases system trustworthiness. There are no keys to leak and hash algorithms are considered more future-proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-88702-7_3| isbn = 978-3-540-88701-0| title = Post-Quantum Cryptography| year = 2009| last1 = Buchmann | first1 = J.| chapter = Hash-based Digital Signature Schemes| last2 = Dahmen | first2 = E.| last3 = Szydlo | first3 = M.| pages = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; than modular arithmetic based algorithms, e.g. [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]].

Linked timestamping scales well - hashing is much faster than public key cryptography. There is no need for specific cryptographic hardware with its limitations.

The common technology&lt;ref&gt;See ISO/IEC 18014-1:2002 Chapter 4.2&lt;/ref&gt; for guaranteeing long-term attestation value of the issued time-stamps (and digitally signed data&lt;ref&gt;For example see [[XAdES|XAdES-A]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is periodic over-time-stamping of the time-stamp token. Because of missing key-related risks and of the plausible safety margin of the reasonably chosen hash function this over-time-stamping period of hash-linked token could be an order of magnitude longer than of public-key signed token.

Haber and Stornetta proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00196791 | title = How to time-stamp a digital document | year = 1991 | last1 = Haber | first1 = S. | issue = 2 | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W. S. | journal = Journal of Cryptology | volume = 3| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/haber91how.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 to link issued time-stamps together into linear hash-chain, using a collision-resistant hash function. The main rationale was to diminish [[Timestamping authority|TSA]] trust requirements.

Tree-like schemes and operating in rounds were proposed by Benaloh and de Mare in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Benaloh and de Mare constructed a one-way accumulator&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/3-540-48285-7_24| isbn = 978-3-540-57600-6| title = Advances in Cryptology — EUROCRYPT '93| year = 1994| last1 = Benaloh| chapter = One-Way Accumulators: A Decentralized Alternative to Digital Signatures | first1 = J.| last2 = Mare | first2 = M.| volume = 765| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| pages = 274| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/old/benaloh94oneway.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994 and proposed its use in time-stamping. When used for aggregation, one-way accumulator requires only one constant-time computation for round membership verification.

Surety&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surety.com/&lt;/ref&gt; started the first commercial linked timestamping service in January 1995. Linking scheme is described and its security is analyzed in the following article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/266420.266430 | isbn = 0897919122 | title = Proceedings of the 4th ACM conference on Computer and communications security  - CCS '97 | year = 1997 | last1 = Haber | chapter = Secure names for bit-strings | first1 = S. | last2 = Stornetta | first2 = W.

Skip-list based time-stamping system was implemented in 2005; related algorithms are quite efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1007/11751595_43| isbn = 978-3-540-34075-1| title = Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2006| year = 2006| last1 = Blibech| chapter = A New Timestamping Scheme Based on Skip Lists | first1 = K.| last2 = Gabillon | first2 = A.| volume = 3982| pages = 395| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Sciencef}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provable security===

Security proof for hash-function based time-stamping schemes was presented by Buldas, Saarepera&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
| last = Buldas
| first = Ahto
| last2 = Saarepera
| first2 = Märt

| doi = 10.1007/b104116}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004. There is an explicit upper bound &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; for the number of time stamps issued during the aggregation period; it is suggested that it is probably impossible to prove the security without this explicit bound - the so-called black-box reductions will fail in this task. Considering that all known practically relevant and efficient security proofs are black-box, this negative result is quite strong.

Next, in 2005 it was shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buldas|first1=A.|last2=Laud|first2=P.|last3=Saarepera|first3=M. R.|last4=Willemson|first4=J.|date=|year=2005|title=Universally Composable Time-Stamping Schemes with Audit.|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.2070|journal=LNCS|volume=3650|pages=359–373|doi=10.1007/11556992+26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that bounded time-stamping schemes with a trusted audit party (who periodically reviews the list of all time-stamps issued during an aggregation period) can be made ''universally composable'' - they remain secure in arbitrary environments (compositions with other protocols and other instances of the time-stamping protocol itself).

Buldas, Laur showed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-71677-8_11 | isbn = 978-3-540-71676-1 | title = Knowledge-Binding Commitments with Applications in Time-Stamping | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4450 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 150–165| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.2680}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 that bounded time-stamping schemes are secure in a very strong sense - they satisfy the so-called "knowledge-binding" condition. The security guarantee offered by Buldas, Saarepera in 2004 is improved by diminishing the security loss coefficient from &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

The hash functions used in the secure time-stamping schemes do not necessarily have to be collision-resistant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-75670-5_9 | isbn = 978-3-540-75669-9 | title = Does Secure Time-Stamping Imply Collision-Free Hash Functions? | year = 2007 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Jürgenson | first2 = A.| journal = LNCS| volume = 4784 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 138–150| url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.110.4564}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even one-way;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/11767480_4 | isbn = 978-3-540-34703-3 | title = Do Broken Hash Functions Affect the Security of Time-Stamping Schemes? | year = 2006 | last1 = Buldas | first1 = A.| last2 = Laur | first2 = S.| journal = LNCS| volume = 3989 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | pages = 50–65| url = http://www.cs.ut.ee/~swen/publications/articles/buldas-laur-2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure time-stamping schemes are probably possible even in the presence of a universal collision-finding algorithm (i.e. universal and attacking program that is able to find collisions for any hash function). This suggests that it is possible to find even stronger proofs based on some other properties of the hash functions.

[[File:Hashtree timestamping.svg|thumb|none|600px|Hash tree based linking scheme]]
At the illustration above hash tree based time-stamping system works in rounds (&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t+2&lt;/math&gt;, ...), with one aggregation tree per round. Capacity of the system (&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;) is determined by the tree size (&lt;math&gt;N=2^l&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; denotes binary tree depth). Current security proofs work on the assumption that there is a hard limit of the aggregation tree size, possibly enforced by the subtree length restriction.

==Standards==
[[ISO 18014]] part 3 covers 'Mechanisms producing linked tokens'.

[[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] for Financial Services, "Trusted Timestamp Management and Security" ([[ANSI ASC X9.95 Standard]]) from June 2005 covers linking-based and hybrid time-stamping schemes.

There is no [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]] or standard draft about linking based time-stamping. RFC 4998 (Evidence Record Syntax) encompasses hash tree and time-stamp as an integrity guarantee for long-term archiving.

[[Image:ProteinStructure.jpg|thumb|300px|Chemical structure of a [[polypeptide]] macromolecule]]A '''macromolecule''' is a very large [[molecule]], such as [[protein]], commonly created by the [[polymerization]] of smaller subunits ([[monomers]]). They are typically composed of thousands of [[atoms]] or more. The most common macromolecules in [[biochemistry]] are [[biopolymers]] ([[nucleic acid]]s, proteins, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lipids]]) and large non-polymeric molecules (such as [[lipid]]s and [[macrocycles]]).&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = [[W.H.

==Definition==
{{Quote box
 |title = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition
 |quote = '''Macromolecule'''&lt;br/&gt;'''Large molecule'''

A molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially&lt;br/&gt;comprises the multiple repetition of units derived, actually or conceptually, from&lt;br/&gt;molecules of low relative molecular mass.

;Notes

1. In many cases, especially for synthetic polymers, a molecule can be regarded&lt;br/&gt;as having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a&lt;br/&gt;few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties. This statement&lt;br/&gt;fails in the case of certain macromolecules for which the properties may be&lt;br/&gt;critically dependent on fine details of the molecular structure.&lt;br/&gt;
2. If a part or the whole of the molecule fits into this definition, it may be described&lt;br/&gt;as either ''macromolecular'' or ''polymeric'', or by ''polymer'' used adjectivally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glossary of basic terms in polymer science (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|date=1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2287–2311|doi=10.1351/pac199668122287|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/1996/pdf/6812x2287.pdf|last1=Jenkins|first1=A. D|last2=Kratochvíl|first2=P|last3=Stepto|first3=R. F. T|last4=Suter|first4=U. W}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}
The term ''macromolecule'' (''[[wikt:macro-#Prefix|macro-]]'' + ''molecule'') was coined by [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Hermann Staudinger]] in the 1920s, although his first relevant publication on this field only mentions ''high molecular compounds'' (in excess of 1,000 atoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Staudinger, H. |author2=Fritschi, J. |title=Über Isopren und Kautschuk. 5. Mitteilung. Über die Hydrierung des Kautschuks und über seine Konstitution|doi=10.1002/hlca.19220050517|date=1922|journal=Helvetica Chimica Acta|volume=5|issue=5|pages=785}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the phrase ''polymer'', as introduced by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|Berzelius]] in 1833, had a different meaning from that of today: it simply was another form of [[isomerism]] for example with [[benzene]] and [[acetylene]] and had little to do with size.&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed085p624|title=The Origin of the Polymer Concept|date=2008|last1=Jensen|first1=William B.|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=85|pages=624|issue=5|bibcode = 2008JChEd..85..624J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to describe large molecules varies among the disciplines. For example, while [[biology]] refers to macromolecules as the four large molecules comprising living things, in [[chemistry]], the term may refer to aggregates of two or more molecules held together by [[intermolecular force]]s rather than [[covalent bond]]s but which do not readily dissociate.&lt;ref&gt;van Holde, K.E. (1998) ''Principles of Physical Biochemistry'' Prentice Hall: New Jersey, {{ISBN|0-13-720459-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the standard [[IUPAC]] definition, the term ''macromolecule'' as used in polymer science refers only to a single molecule. For example, a single polymeric molecule is appropriately described as a "macromolecule" or "polymer molecule" rather than a "polymer," which suggests a [[Chemical substance|substance]] composed of macromolecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.iupac.org/reports/1996/6812jenkins/6812basicterms.pdf|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume=68|page=2287|date=1996|author=Jenkins, A. D.|title=Glossary of Basic Terms in Polymer Science|doi=10.1351/pac199668122287|last2=Kratochvíl|first2=P.|last3=Stepto|first3=R. F. T.|last4=Suter|first4=U. W.|issue=12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223103549/http://www.iupac.org/reports/1996/6812jenkins/6812basicterms.pdf|archivedate=2007-02-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their size, macromolecules are not conveniently described in terms of [[stoichiometry]] alone. The structure of simple macromolecules, such as homopolymers, may be described in terms of the individual monomer subunit and total [[molecular mass]]. Complicated biomacromolecules, on the other hand, require multi-faceted structural description such as the hierarchy of structures used to describe [[proteins]]. In [[British English]], the word "macromolecule" tends to be called "'''high polymer'''".

==Properties==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
Macromolecules often have unusual physical properties that do not occur for smaller molecules.


Another common macromolecular property that does not characterize smaller molecules is their relative insolubility in water and similar [[solvent]]s, instead forming [[colloids]]. Many require [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] or particular [[ion]]s to dissolve in water. Similarly, many proteins will [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denature]] if the solute concentration of their solution is too high or too low.

High concentrations of macromolecules in a solution can alter the [[reaction rate|rates]] and [[equilibrium constant]]s of the reactions of other macromolecules, through an effect known as [[macromolecular crowding]].&lt;ref name="Minton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Minton AP |title=How can biochemical reactions within cells differ from those in test tubes? |journal=J. Cell Sci. |volume=119 |issue=Pt 14 |pages=2863–9 |date=2006 |pmid=16825427 |doi=10.1242/jcs.03063}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes from macromolecules [[excluded volume|excluding]] other molecules from a large part of the volume of the solution, thereby increasing the [[activity (chemistry)|effective concentrations]] of these molecules.

== Linear biopolymers ==

All [[Organism|living organisms]] are dependent on three essential [[biopolymers]] for their biological functions: [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[proteins]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-2936-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Berg, Jeremy Mark |author2=Tymoczko, John L. |author3=Stryer, Lubert |title = Biochemistry, 7th ed.

Fourth edition is available online through the NCBI Bookshelf: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mboc4 link]&lt;/ref&gt; The simple summary is that [[Central dogma of molecular biology|DNA makes RNA, and then RNA makes proteins]].

DNA, RNA, and proteins all consist of a repeating structure of related building blocks ([[Nucleotides|nucleotide]]s in the case of DNA and RNA, [[amino acids]] in the case of proteins). In general, they are all unbranched polymers, and so can be represented in the form of a string. Indeed, they can be viewed as a string of beads, with each bead representing a single nucleotide or amino acid monomer linked together through [[Covalent bond|covalent chemical bonds]] into a very long chain.

In most cases, the monomers within the chain have a strong propensity to interact with other amino acids or nucleotides. In DNA and RNA, this can take the form of Watson-Crick [[base pair]]s (G-C and A-T or A-U), although many more complicated interactions can and do occur.

Because of the double-stranded nature of DNA, essentially all of the nucleotides take the form of [[Watson-Crick pairs|Watson-Crick base pair]]s between nucleotides on the two complementary strands of the [[Double-Helix|double-helix]].

In contrast, both RNA and proteins are normally single-stranded. Therefore, they are not constrained by the regular geometry of the DNA double helix, and so fold into complex [[Biomolecular structure|three-dimensional shape]]s dependent on their sequence. These different shapes are responsible for many of the common properties of RNA and proteins, including the formation of specific [[Binding site|binding pockets]], and the ability to catalyse biochemical reactions.

==== DNA is optimised for encoding information ====
[[DNA]] is an information storage macromolecule that encodes the complete set of [[Nucleic acid sequence|instructions]] (the [[genome]]) that are required to assemble, maintain, and reproduce every living organism.&lt;ref name="isbn978-0062730992"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Golnick, Larry |author2=Wheelis, Mark. |title = The Cartoon Guide to Genetics|publisher = Collins Reference|isbn = 978-0-06-273099-2|oclc = |doi = |date=1991-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA and RNA are both capable of encoding genetic information, because there are biochemical mechanisms which read the information coded within a DNA or RNA sequence and use it to generate a specified protein. On the other hand, the sequence information of a protein molecule is not used by cells to functionally encode genetic information.&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|5}}

DNA has three primary attributes that allow it to be far better than RNA at encoding genetic information. First, it is normally double-stranded, so that there are a minimum of two copies of the information encoding each gene in every cell. Second, DNA has a much greater stability against breakdown than does RNA, an attribute primarily associated with the absence of the 2'-hydroxyl group within every nucleotide of DNA. Third, highly sophisticated DNA surveillance and repair systems are present which monitor damage to the DNA and [[DNA repair|repair]] the sequence when necessary. Analogous systems have not evolved for repairing damaged RNA molecules. Consequently, chromosomes can contain many billions of atoms, arranged in a specific chemical structure.

==== Proteins are optimised for catalysis ====

[[Proteins]] are functional macromolecules responsible for [[Enzyme catalysis|catalysing]] the [[Metabolism|biochemical reaction]]s that sustain life.&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|3}} Proteins carry out all functions of an organism, for example photosynthesis, neural function, vision, and movement.&lt;ref name="isbn978-1593272029"&gt;{{cite book |author = Takemura, Masaharu|title = The Manga Guide to Molecular Biology|publisher = [[No Starch Press]]|location = |year = 2009|pages = |isbn = 978-1-59327-202-9|oclc = |doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The single-stranded nature of protein molecules, together with their composition of 20 or more different amino acid building blocks, allows them to fold in to a vast number of different three-dimensional shapes, while providing binding pockets through which they can specifically interact with all manner of molecules. In addition, the chemical diversity of the different amino acids, together with different chemical environments afforded by local 3D structure, enables many proteins to act as [[enzymes]], catalyzing a wide range of specific biochemical transformations within cells. In addition, proteins have evolved the ability to bind a wide range of [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] and [[coenzymes]], smaller molecules that can endow the protein with specific activities beyond those associated with the polypeptide chain alone.

==== RNA is multifunctional ====
[[RNA]] is multifunctional, its primary function is to [[Protein synthesis|encode proteins]], according to the instructions within a cell’s DNA.&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} They control and regulate many aspects of protein synthesis in [[eukaryote]]s.

RNA encodes genetic information that can be [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into the amino acid sequence of proteins, as evidenced by the messenger RNA molecules present within every cell, and the RNA genomes of a large number of viruses. The single-stranded nature of RNA, together with tendency for rapid breakdown and a lack of repair systems means that RNA is not so well suited for the long-term storage of genetic information as is DNA.

In addition, RNA is a single-stranded polymer that can, like proteins, fold into a very large number of three-dimensional structures. Some of these structures provide binding sites for other molecules and chemically-active centers that can catalyze specific chemical reactions on those bound molecules. The limited number of different building blocks of RNA (4 nucleotides vs &gt;20 amino acids in proteins), together with their lack of chemical diversity, results in catalytic RNA ([[ribozymes]]) being generally less-effective catalysts than proteins for most biological reactions.

[[Carbohydrates|Carbohydrate]] macromolecules ([[polysaccharide]]s) are formed from polymers of [[monosaccharides]].&lt;ref name="Stryer_2002"/&gt;{{Rp|11}} Because monosaccharides have multiple [[functional groups]], polysaccharides can form linear polymers (e.g. [[cellulose]]) or complex branched structures (e.g. [[glycogen]]). Polysaccharides perform numerous roles in living organisms, acting as energy stores (e.g. [[starch]]) and as structural components (e.g. [[chitin]] in arthropods and fungi). Many carbohydrates contain modified monosaccharide units that have had functional groups replaced or removed.

[[Polyphenol]]s consist of a branched structure of multiple [[Phenols#Naturally occurring|phenolic]] subunits. They can perform structural roles (e.g. [[lignin]]) as well as roles as [[secondary metabolites]] involved in [[Cell signaling|signalling]], [[plant pigment|pigmentation]] and [[plant toxin|defense]].

Polymers may be prepared from inorganic matter as well as for instance in [[inorganic polymer]]s and [[geopolymer]]s. The incorporation of inorganic elements enables the tunability of properties and/or responsive behavior as for instance in [[smart inorganic polymers]].

'''Medicine Unboxed''' is a project arising from a view that good medicine demands more than scientific and technical expertise, and that it necessitates ethical judgment, an understanding of human experience, empathy, professionalism and wisdom.

==History==
Medicine Unboxed is a not-for-profit organisation that has held eight international conferences (Unboxing Medicine, 2009; Stories, Language and Medicine, 2010; Medicine and Values, 2011; Belief, 2012; Voice, 2013; Frontiers, 2014; Mortality, 2015; Wonder, 2016; MAPS, 2017) in [[Cheltenham]], UK. The aim of Medicine Unboxed is to explore "understanding medicine through the arts and humanities", and engage the public and front-line [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] staff with a view of medicine that is infused and elaborated by the humanities, with a view to promoting dialogue around the goals and values of medicine within society. Contributors to the conferences include artists, writers, the clergy, poets, philosophers, lawyers, linguists, musicians, theatre, ethicists, academics and doctors. 

Medicine Unboxed is curated by Dr. Sam Guglani, Consultant Oncologist at [[Gloucestershire Royal Hospital|Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust]], that supports the organisation along with the [[Wellcome Foundation]]. The Creative Director is [[Peter_James_Thomas|Peter Thomas]]. Its advisors are Dr. Sean Elyan and Dame Janet Trotter and its patrons are [[Jo Shapcott]] and [[Raymond Tallis]]. 

Medicine Unboxed has been widely reported in the medical press including ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/19/studying-arts-literature-doctors-humane-competent-mid-staffs{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''[[The Lancet]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61351-9 |title=Outside of the box |journal=The Lancet |volume=374 |issue=9686 |pages=282 |year=2009 |last1=Guglani |first1=Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00773-4 |title=All or nothing? |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=10006 |pages=e34 |year=2015 |last1=Potter |first1=Christopher }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00771-0 |title=Words on the borders of the body |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=10006 |pages=1816 |year=2015 |last1=Gross |first1=Philip }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00545-0 |title=The given world |journal=The Lancet |volume=386 |issue=10004 |pages=1622 |year=2015 |last1=Guglani |first1=Samir }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Medical Journal]] Online&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.bmj.com/medical-humanities/2009/08/15/medicine-unboxed-conference-october-19th-2009/{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lapidus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapidus.org.uk/Nov10.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321120334/http://www.lapidus.org.uk/Nov10.php |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oxidation of [[inorganic compound]]s is the strategy primarily used by [[chemolithotroph]]ic microorganisms to obtain energy in order to build their structural components, survive, grow and reproduce. Some inorganic forms of reduced sulfur, mainly sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S/HS&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and elemental sulfur (S&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;), can be oxidized by chemolithotrophic sulfur-oxidizing [[prokaryote]]s, usually coupled to the [[Redox|reduction]] of oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) or nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fry B, Ruf W, Gest H, Hayes JM|date=1988|title=Sulfur isotope effects associated with oxidation of sulfide by O2 in aqueous solution|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0168-9622(88)90001-2|journal=Isotope Geoscience|volume=73|issue=3|pages=205–10|doi=10.1016/0168-9622(88)90001-2|pmid=11538336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgin|first=Amy J.|last2=Hamilton|first2=Stephen K.|date=2008|title=NO3−-Driven SO42− Production in Freshwater Ecosystems: Implications for N and S Cycling|journal=Ecosystems|volume=11|issue=6|pages=908–922|doi=10.1007/s10021-008-9169-5|name-list-format=vanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the sulfur oxidizers are [[autotroph]]s that can use reduced sulfur species as electron donors for carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) fixation. The microbial oxidation of sulfur is an important link in the [[Sulfur cycle|biogeochemical cycling of sulfur]] in environments hosting both abundant reduced sulfur species and low concentrations of oxygen, such as marine sediments, oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) and hydrothermal systems.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016"&gt;{{cite book|title=Geomicrobiology of sulfur| vauthors = Fike DA, Bradley AS, Leavitt WD  | publisher=Ehrlich's Geomicrobiology | edition = Sixth |year=2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==
The oxidation of hydrogen sulfide has been considered one of the most important processes in the environment, given that the oceans have had very low oxygen and high sulfidic conditions over most of the Earth's history. The modern analog ecosystems are deep marine basins such as those in the Black Sea, near the Cariaco trench and the Santa Barbara basin. Other zones of the ocean that experience periodic anoxic and sulfidic conditions are the upwelling zones off the coasts of Chile and Namibia, and hydrothermal vents, which are a key source of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to the ocean.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luther|first=George W.|last2=Findlay|first2=Alyssa J.|last3=Macdonald|first3=Daniel J.|last4=Owings|first4=Shannon M.|last5=Hanson|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Beinart|first6=Roxanne A.|last7=Girguis|first7=Peter R.|date=2011|title=Thermodynamics and kinetics of sulfide oxidation by oxygen: a look at inorganically controlled reactions and biologically mediated processes in the environment|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=2|pages=62|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2011.00062|issn=1664-302X|pmc=3153037|pmid=21833317}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sulfur oxidizing microorganisms (SOM) are thus restricted to upper sediment layers in these environments, where oxygen and nitrate, which are electron acceptors with high [[redox potential]]s are available.

Although the biological oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds competes with abiotic chemical reations (e.g. the iron-mediated oxidation of sulfide to iron sulfide (FeS) or [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1130/0-8137-2379-5.63|title=Sulfide oxidation in marine sediments: Geochemistry meets microbiology.

Given that the maximal concentrations of oxygen, nitrate and sulfide are usually separated in depth profiles, many SOM cannot directly access their energy sources (reduced sulfur species) and electron acceptors at the same time. This limitation has led SOM to develop different morphological adaptations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The large sulfur bacteria (LSB) of the family ''[[Beggiatoa]]ceae'' ([[Gammaproteobacteria]]) have been used as model organisms for benthic sulfur oxidation. They are known as 'gradient organisms', that are indicative of hypoxic (low oxygen) and sulfidic (rich in reduced sulfur species) conditions. They internally store large amounts of nitrate and elemental sulfur to overcome the spatial gap between oxygen and sulfide. Some of the ''Beggiatoaceae'' are filamentous and can thus glide between oxic/suboxic and sulfidic environments, while the non-motile ones rely on nutrient suspensions, fluxes, or attach themselves to bigger particles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some marine non-motile LSB are the only known free-living bacteria that have two carbon fixation pathways: the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]] (used by plants and other photosynthetic organisms) and the reverse [[tricarboxylic acid cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winkel|first=Matthias|last2=Salman-Carvalho|first2=Verena|last3=Woyke|first3=Tanja|last4=Richter|first4=Michael|last5=Schulz-Vogt|first5=Heide N.|last6=Flood|first6=Beverly E.|last7=Bailey|first7=Jake V.|last8=Mußmann|first8=Marc|date=2016|title=Single-cell Sequencing of Thiomargarita Reveals Genomic Flexibility for Adaptation to Dynamic Redox Conditions|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00964/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|language=English|volume=7|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.00964|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4914600|pmid=27446006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another evolutionary strategy of SOM is to partner up with motile eukaryotic organisms. The symbiotic SOM provides carbon and, in some cases, bioavailable nitrogen to the host, and gets enhanced access to resources and shelter in return. This lifestyle has evolved independently in sediment-dwelling [[ciliate]]s, [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], [[nematode]]s, [[flatworm]]s and [[Bivalvia|bivalves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubilier|first=Nicole|last2=Bergin|first2=Claudia|last3=Lott|first3=Christian|date=2008|title=Symbiotic diversity in marine animals: the art of harnessing chemosynthesis|journal=Nature Reviews.

Similarly, two pathways for the oxidation of sulfite (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) have been identified:

* The rDsr pathway, used by some microorganisms in the [[Chlorobi]] (green sulfur bacteria), [[Alphaproteobacteria|''Alpha'']], [[Betaproteobacteria|Beta]] and ''Gammaproteobacteria'', in which sulfide is oxidized to sulfite by means of a reverse operation of the dissimilatory sulfite reduction (Dsr) pathway.

* The direct oxidation of sulfite to sulfate by a type of mononuclear molybdenum enzyme known as sulfite oxidoreductase.

On the other hand, at least three pathways exist for the oxidation of [[thiosulfate]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) :

In any of these pathways, oxygen is the preferred [[electron acceptor]], but in oxygen-limited environments [[nitrate]], oxidized forms of iron and even organic matter are used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rivett MO, Buss SR, Morgan P, Smith JW, Bemment CD | title = Nitrate attenuation in groundwater: a review of biogeochemical controlling processes | journal = Water Research | volume = 42 | issue = 16 | pages = 4215–32 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18721996 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2008.07.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria normally perform oxygenic photosynthesis using water as electron donor.

=== Oxidation of sulfide  ===
Sulfide oxidation can proceed under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. Aerobic sulfide-oxidizing bacteria usually oxidize sulfide to sulfate and are obligate or facultative chemolithoautotrophs. The latter can grow as [[heterotroph]]s, obtaining carbon from organic sources, or as autotrophs, using sulfide as the electron donor (energy source) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt; The oxidation of sulfide can proceed aerobically by two different mechanisms: [[substrate-level phosphorylation]], which is dependent on [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP), and [[oxidative phosphorylation]] independent of AMP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Chemolithotrophy | vauthors = Wood P | veditors = Anthony C | title = Bacterial Energy Transduction | location = London, U.K. | publisher = Academic Press | pages = 183–230 |year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been detected in several ''Thiobacilli'' (''T. denitrificans'', ''T. thioparus, T. novellus'' and ''T. neapolitanus''), as well as in ''Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The biochemistry of inorganic compounds of sulphur. | vauthors = Roy AB, Trudinger PA | publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The archaeon ''Acidianus ambivalens'' appears to possess both an ADP-dependent and an ADP independent pathway for the oxidation of sulfide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmermann P, Laska S, Kletzin A | title = Two modes of sulfite oxidation in the extremely thermophilic and acidophilic archaeon acidianus ambivalens | journal = Archives of Microbiology | volume = 172 | issue = 2 | pages = 76–82 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10415168 | doi = 10.1007/s002030050743 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, both mechanisms operate in the chemoautotroph ''Thiobacillus denitrificans'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminuddin M | title = Substrate level versus oxidative phosphorylation in the generation of ATP in Thiobacillus denitrificans | journal = Archives of Microbiology | volume = 128 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–25 | date = November 1980 | pmid = 7458535 | doi = 10.1007/BF00422300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can oxidize sulfide to sulfate anaerobically using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminuddin M, Nicholas DJ |date=1974|title=Electron Transfer during Sulphide and Sulphite Oxidation in Thiobacillus denitrificans |journal=Microbiology|volume=82|issue=1|pages=115–123|doi=10.1099/00221287-82-1-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in turn reduced to dinitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aminuddin M, Nicholas DJ | title = Sulphide oxidation linked to the reduction of nitrate and nitrite in Thiobacillus denitrificans | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 325 | issue = 1 | pages = 81–93 | date = October 1973 | pmid = 4770733 | doi = 10.1016/0005-2728(73)90153-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other anaerobic strains that can perform a similar process were identified as similar to ''Thiomicrospira denitrificans'' and ''Arcobacter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gevertz D, Telang AJ, Voordouw G, Jenneman GE | title = Isolation and characterization of strains CVO and FWKO B, two novel nitrate-reducing, sulfide-oxidizing bacteria isolated from oil field brine | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 2491–501 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10831429 | pmc = 110567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the heterotrophic SOB are included species of ''Beggiatoa'' that can grow mixotrophically, using sulfide to obtain energy (autotrophic metabolism) or to eliminate metabolically formed hydrogen peroxide in the absence of catalase (heterotrophic metabolism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burton SD, Morita RY | title = Effect of Catalase and Cultural Conditions on Growth of Beggiatoa | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 88 | pages = 1755–61 | date = December 1964 | pmid = 14240966 | pmc = 277482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other organisms, such as the Bacteria ''Sphaerotilus natans'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skerman VB, Dementjeva G, Carey BJ | title = Intracellular deposition of sulfur by Sphaerotilus natans | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 504–12 | date = April 1957 | pmid = 13428683 | pmc = 314609 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the yeast ''Alternaria'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skerman VB, Dementjev G, Skyring GW | title = Deposition of sulphur from hydrogen sulphide by bacteria and yeast | journal = Nature | volume = 179 | issue = 4562 | pages = 742 | date = April 1957 | pmid = 13418779 | doi = 10.1038/179742a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are able to oxidize sulfide to elemental sulfur by means of the rDsr pathway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belousova EV, Chernousova EI, Dubinina GA, Turova TP, Grabovich MI | title = [Detection and analysis of sulfur metabolism genes in Sphaerotilus natans subsp. sulfidivorans representatives] | journal = Mikrobiologiia | volume = 82 | issue = 5 | pages = 579–87 | date = 2013 | pmid = 25509396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxidation of elemental sulfur ===
Some Bacteria and Archaea can aerobically oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt; ''Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans'' and ''Thiobacillus thioparus'' can oxidize sulfur to sulfide by means of an oxygenase enzyme, although it is thought that an oxidase could be used as well as an energy saving mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suzuki I, Silver M | title = The initial product and properties of the sulfur-oxidizing enzyme of thiobacilli | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 122 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–33 | date = July 1966 | pmid = 5968172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the anaerobic oxidation of elemental sulfur, it is thought that the Sox pathway plays an important role, although this is not yet completely understood.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedrich CG, Rother D, Bardischewsky F, Quentmeier A, Fischer J | title = Oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds by bacteria: emergence of a common mechanism? | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 67 | issue = 7 | pages = 2873–82 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11425697 | pmc = 92956 | doi = 10.1128/AEM.67.7.2873-2882.2001 | url = http://aem.asm.org/content/67/7/2873 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thiobacillus denitrificans'' uses oxidized forms on nitrogen as terminal electron acceptor instead of oxygen, and ''A. ferrooxidans'' uses ferrous iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brock TD, Gustafson J | title = Ferric iron reduction by sulfur- and iron-oxidizing bacteria | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 567–71 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 825043 | pmc = 170307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxidation of thiosulfate and tetrathionate ===
Most of the chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria that can oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfate are also able to oxidize thiosulfate to sulfate as a source of reducing power for carbon dioxide assimilation. However, the mechanisms that they utilize may vary, since some of them, such as the photosynthetic purple bacteria, transiently accumulate extracellular elemental sulfur during the oxidation of tetrathionate before oxidizing it to sulfate, while the green sulfur bacteria do not.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt; A direct oxidation reaction (''T. versutus'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lu W-P.|first=|date=1986|title=A periplasmic location for the bisulfiteoxidizing multienzyme system from Thiobacillus versutus.|url=|journal=FEMS Microbiol Lett|volume=34|pages=313–317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as others that involve sulfite (''T. denitrificans'') and tetrathionate (''A. ferrooxidans'', ''A. thiooxidans'' and ''Acidiphilum acidophilum'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronk|first=J|date=1990|title=Oxidation of reduced inorganic sulphur compounds by acidophilic thiobacilli|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-1097(90)90540-7|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|volume=75|issue=2-3|pages=293–306|doi=10.1016/0378-1097(90)90540-7|issn=0378-1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;'')'' as intermediate compounds, have been proposed. Some mixotrophic bacteria only oxidize thiosulfate to tetrathionate.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt;

The mechanism of bacterial oxidation of tetrathionate is still unclear and may involve sulfur [[disproportionation]], during which both [[sulfide]] and [[sulfate]] are produced from reduced sulfur species, and hydrolysis reactions.&lt;ref name="Fike_2016" /&gt;

== Isotope fractionations ==
The [[Isotope fractionation|fractionation]] of [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope]]s during microbial [[sulfide]] oxidation (MSO) has been studied to assess its potential as a proxy to differentiate it from the abiotic oxidation of [[sulfur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Knöller K, Vogt C, Feisthauer S, Weise SM, Weiss H, Richnow HH|date=November 2008|title=Sulfur cycling and biodegradation in contaminated aquifers: insights from stable isotope investigations|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=42|issue=21|pages=7807–12|pmid=19031864}}&lt;/ref&gt; The light isotopes of the elements that are most commonly found in organic molecules, such as &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;S, form bonds that are broken more easily than bonds between the corresponding heavy isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S . Because there is a lower energetic cost associated with the use of light isotopes, enzymatic processes usually discriminate against the heavy isotopes, and, as a consequence, biological [[Isotope fractionation|fractionations of isotopes]] are expected between the reactants and the products. A normal [[kinetic isotope effect]] is that in which the products are depleted in the heavy isotope relative to the reactants (low heavy isotope to light isotope ratio), and although this is not always the case, the study of isotope fractionations between enzymatic processes may allow tracing the source of the product.

=== Fractionation of oxygen isotopes ===
The formation of [[sulfate]] in aerobic conditions entails the incorporation of four oxygen atoms from water, and when coupled with [[dissimilatory nitrate reduction]] (DNR) -the preferential reduction pathway under anoxic conditions- can have a contribution of [[oxygen]] atoms from [[nitrate]] as well. The δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value of the newly formed sulfate thus depends on the δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value of the water, the isotopic fractionation associated with the incorporation of oxygen atoms from water to [[sulfate]] and a potential exchange of oxygen atoms between sulfur and nitrogen intermediates and water.&lt;ref name="Poser_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poser A, Vogt C, Knöller K, Ahlheim J, Weiss H, Kleinsteuber S, Richnow HH | title = Stable sulfur and oxygen isotope fractionation of anoxic sulfide oxidation by two different enzymatic pathways | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 48 | issue = 16 | pages = 9094–102 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25003498 | doi = 10.1021/es404808r }}&lt;/ref&gt; MSO has been found to produce small fractionations in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O compared to water (~5‰). Given the very small fractionation of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O that usually accompanies MSO, the relatively higher depletions in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O of the sulfate produced by MSO coupled to DNR (-1.8 to -8.5 ‰)  suggest a [[kinetic isotope effect]] in the incorporation of oxygen from water to [[sulfate]] and the role of [[nitrate]] as a potential alternative source of light oxygen.&lt;ref name="Poser_2014" /&gt; The fractionations of oxygen produced by sulfur disproportionation from elemental sulfur have been found to be higher, with reported values from 8 to 18.4‰, which suggests a kinetic isotope effect in the pathways involved in oxidation of elemental sulfur to sulfate, although more studies are necessary to determine what are the specific steps and conditions that favor this fractionation. The table below summarizes the reported fractionations of oxygen isotopes from MSO in different organisms and conditions.

=== Fractionation of sulfur isotopes  ===
Aerobic MSO generates depletions in the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S of sulfate, that have been found to be as small as −1.5‰ and as large as -18‰. For most microorganisms and oxidation conditions, only small fractionations accompany either the aerobic or anaerobic oxidation of sulfide, elemental sulfur, thiosulfate and sulfite to elemental sulfur or sulfate. The phototrophic oxidation of sulfide to thiosulfate under anoxic conditions also generates negligible fractionations. In the chemolithotrophs ''Thiobacillus denitrificans'' and ''Sulfurimonas denitrificans'', MSO coupled to DNR has the effect of inducing the SQR and Sox pathways, respectively. In both cases, a small fractionation in the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S of the sulfate, lower than -4.3‰, has been measured. [[Sulfate]] depletion in &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S from MSO could be used to trace [[sulfide]] oxidation processes in the environment, although it does not allow a discrimination between the SQR and Sox pathways.&lt;ref name="Poser_2014" /&gt;  The depletion produced by MSO coupled to DNR is similar to up to -5‰ depletion estimated for the &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S in the sulfide produced from rDsr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunner|first=Benjamin|last2=Bernasconi|first2=Stefano M.|last3=Kleikemper|first3=Jutta|last4=Schroth|first4=Martin H. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|title=A model for oxygen and sulfur isotope fractionation in sulfate during bacterial sulfate reduction processes |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=69|issue=20|pages=4773–4785|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2005.04.017|issn=0016-7037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunner|first=Benjamin|last2=Bernasconi|first2=Stefano M.| name-list-format = vanc |date=2005|title=A revised isotope fractionation model for dissimilatory sulfate reduction in sulfate reducing bacteria |journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=69|issue=20|pages=4759–4771|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2005.04.015|issn=0016-7037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, disproportionation under anaerobic conditions generates sulfate enriched in &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;S up to 9‰ and ~34‰ from sulfide and elemental sulfur, respectively. Just as the fractionation of oxygen isotopes reveal, the larger fractionations in sulfate from the disproportionation of elemental sulfur point to a key step or pathway critical for inducing this large kinetic isotope effect. The table below summarizes the reported fractionations of sulfur isotopes from MSO in different organisms and conditions.

A '''notary in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' of the [[Catholic Church]] ([[ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''notarius'') is a person appointed by competent authority to draw up official or authentic documents. These documents are issued chiefly from the official administrative bureaux, the chanceries; secondly, from tribunals; lastly, others are drawn up at the request of individuals to authenticate their contracts or other acts. The public officials appointed to draw up these three classes of papers have been usually called notaries.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, a notary is one who takes notes. Notes are signs or cursory abbreviations to record the words uttered, so that they may be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of persons in positions of importance. It was natural for the science of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.

==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
The title and office existed at the Imperial Court (cf. Cod. Theod., VI, 16, "De primicerio et notariis"), whence they passed into all the royal chanceries, though in the course of time the term notary ceased to be used. This was the case also with the chanceries of the pope, the great episcopal sees, and even every bishopric.

There are grounds for doubting whether the seven regional notaries of the Roman Church, one for each ecclesiastical district of the Holy City, were instituted by St. Clement and appointed by him to record the Acts of the martyrs, as is said in the "Liber Pontificalis";&lt;ref&gt;"Vita Clementis", ed. Duchesne, I, 123&lt;/ref&gt; they date back, however, to an early age.

==''Primicerius'' and ''secundicerius''==
Not only were there notaries as soon as a bureau for ecclesiastical documents was established, but in very ancient days we find these notaries forming a kind of college presided over by a ''primicerius''; the notice of [[Pope Julius I]] in the "Liber Pontificalis" relates that this pope ordered an account of the property of the Church, intended as an authentic document, to be drawn up before the ''primicerius'' of the notaries.

The notaries were in the ranks of the clergy and must have received one of the minor orders; for the notariate is an office and not an order. At intervals the popes entrusted the notaries of their ''curia'' with various missions. Their chief, the ''primicerius'', with whom a ''secundicerius'' is sometimes found later, was a very important personage, in fact, the head of the [[Apostolic Chancery|pontifical chancery]]; during the vacancy of the papal chair, he formed part of the interim Government, and a letter in 640 (Jaffé, "Regesta", n. 2040) is signed (the pope being elected but not yet consecrated) by one "Joannes primicerius et servans locum s. sedis apostolicae".

==Protonotary Apostolic==
{{main|Protonotary Apostolic}}
There were of course many notaries in the service of the pontifical chancery; the seven regional notaries preserved a certain pre-eminence over the others and became the protonotary (also spelled "prothonotaries"), whose name and office continued. The ordinary notaries of the chancery, however, were gradually known by other names, according to their various functions, so that the term ceased to be employed in the pontifical and other chanceries. The prothonotaries were and still are a college of prelates, enjoying numerous privileges; they are known as "participants", but outside of Rome there are many purely honorary prothonotaries. The official duties had insensibly almost ceased; but Pius X in his reorganization of the Roman Curia has appointed participant prothonotaries to the chancery (Const. "Sapienti", 29 June 1908). A corresponding change occurred in the bureaux of the episcopal churches, abbeys, etc.; the officials attached to the chancery have ceased to be known as notaries and are called chancellor, secretary, etc. Lastly, mention must be made of the notaries of the synodal or conciliar assemblies, whose duties are limited to the duration of the assembly.

==Notaries of canonical tribunals==
Society in former times did not recognize the separation of powers; so, too, in the Church the judicial authority was vested in the same prelates as the administrative. Soon, however, contentious matters were tried separately before a specially appointed body.

The courts required a staff to record the transactions; these clerks were likewise notaries. In most civil courts they are, however, called registrars, clerks of the court, etc., but in the ecclesiastical tribunals they retain the name notary, though they are also called '''"actuaries"'''.

Thus the special law of the higher [[ecclesiastical tribunals]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;can. v and xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tribunal of the Roman Rota]] and the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], reorganized by [[Pope Pius X|St. Pius X]], provides for the appointment of notaries for these two tribunals. The reason why the head official charged with drawing up the documents of the [[Holy Office]] is called the notary, as were the clerks who in former times drew up the records of the [[Inquisition]], is, doubtless, that of all the [[Roman Congregations]] the [[Holy Office]] is the only real judicial tribunal.

The notaries of ecclesiastical tribunals are usually clerics; the duties may however be confided to laymen, except in criminal cases against a cleric.

==Public notaries==
Finally, there is the class of persons to whom the term notary is restricted in common parlance, to wit, those who are appointed by the proper authorities to witness the documentary proceedings between private persons and to impress them with legal authenticity. They are not engaged in the chanceries, in order that they may be within easy reach of private individuals; they have a public character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.

Consequently, public notaries may be appointed only by those authorities who possess jurisdiction ''in foro externo'', and have a chancery, e.g. popes, bishops, emperors, reigning princes, and of course only within the limits of their jurisdiction; moreover, the territory within which a notary can lawfully exercise his functions is expressly determined. There were formerly Apostolic notaries and even episcopal notaries, duly commissioned by papal or episcopal letters, whose duty it was to receive documents relating to ecclesiastical or mixed affairs, especially in connection with benefices, foundations, and donations in favor of churches, wills of clerics, etc. They no longer exist; the only ecclesiastical notaries at present are the officials of the Roman and episcopal ''curiae''. Moreover, these notaries were layman, and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] forbids clerics to acts as scriveners.&lt;ref group=note&gt;c. viii, "Ne clerici vel monachi", 1. III, tit. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oriental studies''' is the academic field of study that embraces [[Near East]]ern and [[Far East]]ern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]]. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of [[Islamic studies]], while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called [[Sinology]]. The study of [[East Asia]] in general, especially in the United States, is often called [[East Asian studies]], while the study of [[Israel]] and [[Jews]] are called [[Israel studies]] and [[Jewish studies]] respectively, although they are often considered the same field.

European study of the region formerly known as "the [[Orient]]" had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was an important factor in the Middle Ages. Linguistic knowledge preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures brought back filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by [[Imperialism|imperialist]] attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the [[history of ideas]] in the West, called "[[Orientalism]]". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.

== History of Oriental studies ==

=== Pre-Islam ===
The original distinction between the "West" and the "East" was crystallized in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] of the 5th century BC, when [[Athens|Athenian]] historians made a distinction between their "[[Athenian democracy]]" and the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] monarchy. An institutional distinction between East and West did not exist as a defined polarity before the ''Oriens-'' and ''Occidens''-divided administration of the Emperor [[Diocletian]]'s [[Roman Empire]] at the end of the 3rd century AD, and the division of the Empire into [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking portions. The classical world had intimate knowledge of their [[Ancient Persia]]n neighbours (and usually enemies), but very [[Sino-Roman relations|imprecise]] knowledge of most of the world further East, including the "[[Seres]]" (Chinese). However, there was substantial direct [[Roman trade with India]] (unlike with China) in the Imperial period.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:HaytonRemittingHisReportToThePope.JPG|left|thumb|[[Hayton of Corycus]] remitting his report on the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], to [[Pope Clement V]], in 1307.]]
The [[Spread of Islam|rise of Islam]] and [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century established a sharp opposition, or even a sense of polarity, between medieval European [[Christendom]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] (which stretched from the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]] to [[North Africa]] and [[Al-Andalus|Andalusia]]). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Muslim]]s and [[Jew]]s were considered the "alien" enemies of Christendom. Popular medieval European knowledge of cultures farther to the East was poor, dependent on the wildly fictionalized travels of Sir [[John Mandeville]] and legends of [[Prester John]], although the equally famous, and much longer, account by [[Marco Polo]] was a good deal more accurate.

Scholarly work was initially very largely linguistic in nature, with primarily a religious focus on understanding both [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]] and languages like [[Syriac language|Syriac]] with early Christian literature, but also from a wish to understand [[Arabic language|Arabic]] works on [[Islamic medicine|medicine]], [[Early Islamic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[Islamic science|science]]. This effort, also called the ''[[Studia Linguarum]]'' existed sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, and the "[[Renaissance of the 12th century]]" witnessed a particular [[Latin translations of the 12th century|growth in translations]] of Arabic texts into Latin, with figures like [[Constantine the African]], who translated 37 books, mostly medical texts, from Arabic to Latin, and [[Herman of Carinthia]], one of the translators of the [[Qur'an]]. The [[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete|earliest translation]] of the Qur'an into [[Latin]] was completed in 1143, although little use was made of it until it was printed in 1543, after which it was translated into other European languages. [[Gerard of Cremona]] and others based themselves in [[Al-Andaluz]] to take advantage of the Arabic libraries and scholars there. Later, with the Christian [[Reconquista]] in full progress, such contacts became rarer in Spain. Chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic were briefly established at Oxford, and four other universities following the [[Council of Vienne]] (1312).&lt;ref&gt;''Hebrew to Latin, Latin to Hebrew: the mirroring of two cultures'' 2006 Page 75 Giulio Busi, Freie Universität Berlin. Institut für Judaistik - 2006 "According to the famous decision of the council of Vienne (1311–1312), Oxford was chosen as one of four universities (with Paris, Bologna and Salamanca) where Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Aramaic were to be taught."&lt;/ref&gt;

There was [[Chronology of European exploration of Asia|vague but increasing]] knowledge of the complex civilizations in [[China]] and [[History of India|India]], from which luxury goods (notably [[cotton]] and [[silk]] textiles as well as [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]]) were imported. Although the [[Crusades]] produced relatively little in the way of scholarly interchange, the eruption of the [[Mongol Empire]] had strategic implications for both the [[Crusader kingdoms]] and Europe itself, and led to [[Franco-Mongol alliance|extended diplomatic contacts]]. From the [[Age of Exploration]], European interest in [[Cartography of Asia|mapping Asia]], and especially the sea-routes, became intense, though mostly pursued outside the universities.

=== Renaissance to 1800 ===

[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (徐光啟) (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' (幾何原本) published in 1607.]]
University Oriental studies became systematic during the Renaissance, with the linguistic and religious aspects initially continuing to dominate. There was also a political dimension, as translations for diplomatic purposes were needed, even before the West engaged actively with the East beyond the [[Ottoman Empire]]. A landmark was the publication in Spain in 1514 of the first [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Polyglot Bible]], containing the complete existing texts in [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], in addition to Greek and Latin. At [[Cambridge University]] there has been a [[Regius Professor of Hebrew (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Hebrew]] since 1540 (the fifth oldest regular chair there), and the [[Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic|chair in Arabic]] was founded in about 1643. Oxford followed for Hebrew in 1546 (both chairs were established by Henry VIII). Distinguished scholars included [[Edmund Castell]], who published his ''Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum'' in 1669, whilst some scholars like [[Edward Pococke]] had travelled to the East and wrote also on the modern history and society of Eastern peoples. The [[University of Salamanca]] had Professors of Oriental Languages from at least the 1570s. In France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] initiated a training programme for "Les Jeunes de langues", young linguists with the diplomatic service, like [[François Pétis de la Croix]], who like his father and his son served as Arabic interpreter to the King. Study of the [[Far East]] was pioneered by missionaries, especially [[Matteo Ricci]] and others in the [[Jesuit China missions]], and missionary motives were to remain important, at least in linguistic studies.

During the 18th century Western scholars reached a reasonable basic level of understanding of the geography and most of the history of the region, though knowledge of the areas least accessible to Western travellers, like [[Japan]] and [[Tibet]], and their languages, remained limited. [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers characterized aspects of the pagan East as superior to the Christian West, in [[Montesquieu]]'s ''Lettres Persanes'' or [[Voltaire]]'s ironic promotion of [[Zoroastrianism]]; others, like [[Edward Gibbon]], praised the relative religious tolerance of the Middle East as opposed to the intolerant Christian West, and many, including [[Diderot]] and [[Voltaire]], the high social status of scholarship in [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] China.
The [[Università degli Studi di Napoli "L'Orientale"]] (English: University of Naples "L'Orientale"), founded in Naples, Italy, in 1732, is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent.

The end of the century saw the beginnings in the great increase in study of the [[archaeology]] of the period, which was to be an ever-more important aspect of the field through the next century. [[Egyptology]] led the way, and as with many other ancient cultures, provided the linguists with new material for decipherment and study.

=== Nineteenth century ===
[[File:Kolkata Asiatic Society2.jpg|thumb|The old building of the [[Asiatic Society]] in [[Calcutta]], founded by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] in 1784]]
With a great increase in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing political and economic involvement in the region, and in particular the realization of the existence of [[Indo-European languages|close relations between Indian and European languages]], by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco–British rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as [[James Mill]], denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. [[Karl Marx]], himself of [[Jewish]] origin, characterized the [[Asiatic mode of production]] as unchanging, because of the economic narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. [[Oriental despotism]] was generally regarded in Europe as a major factor in the relative failure of [[progress (history)|progress]] of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004:44&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of the century Western archaeology spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. In the 1850s, for example, the French Government was determined to mount large-scale operations in Assyria  and Mesopotamia to showcase its dominance in the region. An archaeological team led by [[Victor Place]] excavated the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. &lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; This expedition resulted in a pioneering publication entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by [[Victor Place]] and [[Felix Thomas]] and published in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  New national museums provided a setting for important archaeological finds, most of which were in this period bought back to Europe, and put Orientalists in the public spotlight as never before.

The first serious European studies of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]] were by the scholars [[Eugene Burnouf]] and [[Max Müller]]. In that time, the academic [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|study of Islam]] also developed, and, by the mid-19th century, Oriental Studies was a well-established academic discipline in most European countries, especially those with imperial interests in the region. Yet, while scholastic study expanded, so did [[Racism|racist]] attitudes and stereotypes of "inscrutable", "wily" Orientals. This frequently extended to local [[Jewish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] communities, who were also of [[Genetic studies on Jews|Oriental origin]] and widely recognized as such. Scholarship often was intertwined with prejudicial racist and religious presumptions,&lt;ref&gt;J. Go, "'Racism' and Colonialism: Meanings of Difference and Ruling Practice in America's Pacific Empire" in ''Qualitative Sociology' '''27'''.1 (March 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; to which the new [[biology|biological sciences]] tended to contribute until the middle of the following century.

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Experts inspecting the [[Rosetta Stone]] during the [[Second International Congress of Orientalists]] in London, 1874]]
The participation in academic studies by scholars from the newly independent nations of the region itself inevitably changed the nature of studies considerably, with the emergence of [[post-colonial studies]] and [[Subaltern Studies]]. The influence of [[Orientalism]] (in the sense used by Edward Said in his [[Orientalism (book)|book of the same name]]) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re-emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to "a lacuna" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Hippler and Andrea Lueg (eds.), ''The Next Threat: Western Perceptions of Islam'' (Pluto Press/The Transnational Institute, London, 1995), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The post–Cold War era has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the [[Arab world]] and Islam is a threat to that of the West. The essence of this debate reflects a presupposition for which Orientalism has been criticized - that the 'Orient' is defined exclusively by Islam. Such considerations as these were seen to have occurred in the wider context of the way in which many Western scholars responded to international politics in the post–Cold War world; and they were arguably heightened following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, ''Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), pp. 223–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic of this type of response to the end of the [[Cold War]] was the popularization of the '[[clash of civilizations]]' thesis. This particular idea of a fundamental conflict between East and West was first advanced by [[Bernard Lewis]] in an article entitled "The Roots of Muslim Rage", written in 1990. Again, this was seen as a way of accounting for new forms and lines of division in post–Cold War international society. The 'clash of civilizations' approach involved another characteristic of Orientalist thought; namely, the tendency to see the region as being one, homogenous 'civilization', rather than as comprising various different and diverse cultures and strands. It was an idea that was taken on more famously by [[Samuel P. Huntington|Samuel Huntington]] in his 1993 article in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', called "The Clash of Civilizations?".&lt;ref&gt;Zachary Lockman, p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Orientalism}}
The term ''Orientalism'' has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider-caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by [[Edward Said]] in ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=J.J.|title=Oriental enlightenment the encounter between Asian and Western thought|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;For example Thomas R. Trautmann in ''Aryans and British India'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-520-20546-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From "Oriental Studies" to "Asian Studies" ==

{{Unreferenced section|date= February 2012}}
Like the term ''[[Orient]]'', ''Orientalism'' derives from the Latin word ''oriens'' (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). "Orient" is the opposite of ''[[Western world|Occident]]'', a term for the Western world. In terms of the [[Old World]], [[Europe]] was considered the [[Western world|Occident]] (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the [[Orient]] (the east).  Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the [[Middle East]]' was then considered 'the Orient'.  However, use of the various terms and senses derived from "Orient" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between Asia and America have grown; nowadays, Asia usually arrives at the USA from the West.

In most [[North America]]n universities, Oriental Studies has now been replaced by [[Asian Studies]] localised to specific regions, such as [[Middle East]]ern or Near Eastern Studies, [[South Asia]]n studies, and [[East Asia]]n Studies.  This reflects the fact that the Orient is not a single, monolithic region but rather a broad area encompassing multiple [[civilization]]s. The generic concept of Oriental Studies, to its opponents, has lost any use it may have once had and is perceived as obstructing changes in departmental structures to reflect actual patterns of modern scholarship.  In many universities, like Chicago, the faculties and institutions have divided; the Biblical languages may be linked with theological institutes, and the study of ancient civilizations in the region may come under a different faculty to studies of modern periods.

In 2007 the Faculty of Oriental Studies at [[Cambridge University]] was renamed the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, but Oxford still has its [[Oriental Institute, Oxford|Faculty for Oriental Studies]], as do [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Chicago]], [[Pontifical Oriental Institute|Rome]], [[School of Oriental and African Studies|London]] (covering African studies also), and [[Oriental Institute (disambiguation)|other universities]].

Various explanations for the change to "Asian studies" are offered; a growing number of professional scholars and students of Asian Studies are themselves Asian or from groups of Asian origin (like [[Asian American]]s). This change of labeling may be correlated in some cases to the fact that sensitivity to the term "Oriental" has been heightened in a more [[politically correct]] atmosphere, although it began earlier: Bernard Lewis' own department at [[Princeton University]] was renamed a decade ''before'' Said wrote his book, a detail that Said gets wrong.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etc.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/mfs/05/Companion/near_eastern_studies.html Princeton University, Near Eastern Studies department]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   By some, the term "Oriental" has come to be thought offensive to non-Westerners. [[Area studies]] that incorporate not only philological pursuits but [[identity politics]] may also account for the hesitation to use the term "Oriental".

Supporters of "Oriental Studies" counter that the term "[[Asia#Etymology|Asian]]" is just as encompassing as "Oriental," and may well have originally had the same meaning, were it derived from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word for "East" (a more common derivation is from one or both of two Anatolian proper names). Replacing one word with another is to confuse historically objectionable ''opinions'' about the East with the concept of "the East" itself. The terms Oriental/Eastern and Occidental/Western are both inclusive concepts that usefully identify large-scale cultural differences. Such general concepts do not preclude or deny more specific ones.

The '''Pietroasele Treasure''' (or the '''Petrossa Treasure''') found in [[Pietroasele, Buzău]], [[Romania]], in 1837, is a late fourth-century [[Goths|Gothic]] treasure that included some twenty-two objects of gold, among the most famous examples of the polychrome style of [[Migration Period art]]. Of the twenty-two pieces, only twelve have survived, conserved at the [[National Museum of Romanian History]], in [[Bucharest]]: a large eagle-headed [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]] and three smaller ones encrusted with semi-precious stones; a [[patera]], or round sacrificial dish,  modelled with [[Orphic]] figures &lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Joseph. ''The Masks of God: Creative Mythology''. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; surrounding a seated three-dimensional goddess in the center; a twelve-sided cup, [[Ring of Pietroassa|a ring]] with a [[Gothic runic inscriptions|Gothic runic inscription]], a large tray, two other necklaces and a pitcher. Their multiple styles, in which [[Han China|Han Chinese]] styles have been noted in the belt buckles, [[Hellenistic]] styles in the golden bowls, [[Sasanian]] motifs in the baskets, and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] fashions in the fibulae,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Kühn, "Asiatic Influences on the Art of the Migrations" ''Parnassus'' '''9'''.1 (January 1937, pp. 13-16, 43) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; are characteristic of the cosmopolitan outlook of the [[Cernjachov culture]] in a region without defined [[Topography|topographic]] confines.

When [[Alexandru Odobescu]] published his book on the treasure,&lt;ref&gt;Odobescu, Alexandru, ''Le Trésor de Petrossa'', [[Paris]], 1889-1900.&lt;/ref&gt; he considered that such magnificent work could only have belonged to [[Athanaric]] (died 381), leader of the [[Thervings]], a Gothic people. Modern archaeologists cannot connect the hoard with such a glamorous name.

The treasure was shipped to [[Russia]] in December 1916, as [[German Empire|German]] armies advanced through Romania in [[World War I]], and was not returned until 1956.

An atomic analysis of the Pietroasele gold hoard has concluded that from the point of view of Ir/Au, Cu/Au and Ag/Au concentrations the three styles are clustered. At least from the iridium concentration data, the assumption of a Dacian provenance of the hoard raw material is highly improbable as also the hypothesis that Roman imperial gold coins were used for manufacturing Pietroasa artifacts is not in accordance with the elemental concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, 240 (1999) 897 NUCLEAR ANALYSES OF THE PIETROASA GOLD HOARD, Viorel Cojocaru, Cãlin Besliu and Cristina Anton Manea&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3373">A '''piezophile''', also sometimes called a barophile, is an [[organism]] which thrives at [[high pressure]]s,&lt;ref name="DworkinFalkow2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dworkin|first1=Martin|last2=Falkow|first2=Stanley|title=The Prokaryotes: Vol. 1: Symbiotic Associations, Biotechnology, Applied Microbiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hqh43LFTGBQC&amp;pg=PA94|date=13 July 2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-25476-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as deep sea [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]. Piezophile is from the Greek for pressure-lover. They are generally found on [[Seabed|ocean floor]]s, where pressure often exceeds 380&amp;nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (38&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]). Some have been found at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]] where the maximum pressure is roughly 117&amp;nbsp;MPa. The high pressures experienced by these organisms can cause the normal fluid [[cell membrane]] to become waxy and relatively [[Semipermeable membrane|impermeable]] to nutrients. The high pressure decreases the ability of the sub-units of multi-subunit proteins to interact. Thus, large protein complexes must interact to decrease pressure-related effects and regulate processes such as protein and DNA synthesis, which are sensitive to high pressure. Piezophilic bacteria have a high proportion of fatty acids in their cytoplasmic membrane, which allows membranes to remain functional and keep from gelling at high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880685515|title=Brock biology of microorganisms|last=1949-|first=Madigan, Michael T.,|others=Martinko, John M.,, Bender, Kelly S., 1977-, Buckley, Daniel H. (Daniel Hezekiah),, Stahl, David Allan, 1949-|isbn=1292018313|edition=Fourteenth edition, Global|location=Boston|oclc=880685515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These organisms have adapted in novel ways to become tolerant of these pressures in order to [[colonize]] deep sea [[habitats]]. One example, [[xenophyophore]]s, have been found in the deepest ocean trench, 6.6 miles (10,541 meters) below the surface.&lt;ref name="MSN-20111024"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[MSNBC|MSNBC Staff]] |title=Giant amoebas discovered in deepest ocean trench |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44998895/ns/technology_and_science-science |date=22 October 2011 |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=2011-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Barotolerant'' bacteria are able to survive at high pressures, but can exist in less extreme environments as well. ''Obligate barophiles'' cannot survive outside such environments. For example, the ''[[Halomonas]]'' species ''[[Halomonas salaria]]'' requires a pressure of 1000&amp;nbsp;atm (100&amp;nbsp;MPa). Most piezophiles grow in darkness and are usually very UV-sensitive; they lack many mechanisms of DNA repair.

The '''Players Ball''' is an annual gathering of [[pimps]], held in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Other Players Balls take place across the country, most notably in [[Miami]] and [[Atlanta]]. Presently, there are "Players Ball" events in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. On December 16-18th 2011, a Players Ball was hosted in [[Hollywood, CA]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playersball.com/ |title=The Players Ball Hollywood 2011 presented by Bishop Don Magic Juan, Snoop Dogg, &amp; Serious Pimp - Chuuuch!!! |publisher=Playersball.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614191923/http://playersball.com/ |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Bishop Don Juan Players Ball==
The 38th annual official Players Ball 2012 was held Saturday December 8, 2012 at the Key Club, Hollywood, Ca. Nick Cannon was the Dj for the event who is rumored to be in production filming a movie about Bishop Don Juan.

The 35th Anniversary of the Players Ball, was held on Saturday, December 5, 2009 at Chez Roues Banquet Hall in [[Chicago, IL]]. Ditch performed his first Players Ball show there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUDAxa7g1QY |title=Ditch Bishop Don Juan Other Players In Hotel Room Chicago Il.Wmv |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea stemmed from a scene in the 1973 [[blaxploitation]] film, ''[[The Mack]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070350/ The Mack (1973) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the lead character, a [[pimp]] named Goldie, attends The Players Ball in [[Oakland, California]].   Comedian [[Dan Aykroyd]] parodied this event in his film [[Doctor Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085450/ Doctor Detroit (1983) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dave Chappelle]] satirized the event with "The Playa Haters' Ball" on an episode of [[The Chappelle Show]].  The party has been a November tradition since 1974, when pimps from across the country gathered to celebrate the birthday of Don Juan now known as [[Don "Magic" Juan|Bishop Don "Magic" Juan]]. Every year, the award for "Pimp of the Year" is given out. Juan was the winner 13 years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowling |first=Denise |url=http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/2000/01/29/pimps/ |title="Pimpin' is hard work" - Salon.com |publisher=Archive.salon.com |date=2000-01-29 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries==
The Player's Ball was shown in the [[HBO]] documentary ''[[Pimps Up, Ho's Down]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214005/ Pimps Up, Ho's Down (1999) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hughes Brothers]]' documentary, ''[[American Pimp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179074/ American Pimp (1999) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD entitled Master Players Ball was also released in 2006. The DVD featured live scenes from a "Players Ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Players-Ball-Various/dp/B000FFP12W |title=Masters Players Ball: Various: Movies &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===2003 arrests===
In 2015, the Players Ball took place in [[Atlanta, GA]]. A former prostitute by the name of "Tina F." reported that several [[pimp]]s were arrested for having [[Prostitution of children|underage prostitutes]], and claimed "Two years ago in Atlanta, they stopped it and arrested 15 pimps and charged them. One pimp had a 10-year-old girl in his stable." &lt;ref name="tribe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribes.tribe.net/humantrafficking/thread/6856dd15-bc5f-410d-95ab-c12b4e9d8038 |title=Stop Glamorizing Pain - Stop Glamori... - Human Trafficking - tribe.net |publisher=Tribes.tribe.net |date=2005-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 protest===
In 2005, a former prostitute identifying herself as "Brenda Myers-Powell." protested the Players Ball event at Mariella's Banquet Hall on 5th Avenue in [[Maywood, IL]]. Brenda called the event a "ball for child molesters" because she began being trafficked by pimps at the age of 14 and says her experience is a common one.&lt;ref name="tribe1"/&gt;

===Matthew Thompkins indictment===
In 2006, Matthew Thompkins, a former Postal Worker of [[Manhattanville]], NY, was indicted. He was a former "Pimp of the Year" of the annual Players Ball. His aliases included; "Knowledge" and "Daddy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/1129189101.html?dids=1129189101:1129189101&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+2006&amp;author=JEANE+MacINTOSH&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc='PIMP+OF+THE+YEAR'+-+POSTAL+WORKER+BUSTED&amp;pqatl=google |title=Archives - New York Post Online Edition |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While searching his property, Police located two "Pimp of the Year" awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1182229C22A32448&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Las Vegas, Nevada===
A well-known non-pimp Players Ball started in 1999 was thrown in Las Vegas and New Orleans as a private party for businesses attending adult oriented events. The event is organized by D-Money.  The event was thrown twice a year and may coincide with other adult events such as AVN or Internext Expo.  The last players ball event thrown by D-money, who has officially ended the events, was on June 9, 2010.  Official Website http://www.theplayersball.com

A '''poster''' is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface.&lt;ref&gt;[Gosling, Peter. (1999). Scientist's Guide to Poster Presentations. New York: Kluwer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46076-0}}.]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically posters include both [[typography|textual]] and [[graphic]] elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes.  They are a frequent tool of advertisers (particularly of events, musicians, and films), [[propaganda|propagandists]], [[protest]]ors, and other groups trying to communicate a message. Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are generally low-cost compared to the original artwork. The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the 1840s and 1850s when the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] possible.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Eskilson, Graphic Design: A New History, Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 43-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction===
According to the French historian [[Max Gallo]], "for over two hundred years, posters have been displayed in public places all over the world. Visually striking, they have been designed to attract the attention of passers-by, making us aware of a political viewpoint, enticing us to attend specific events, or encouraging us to purchase a particular product or service."&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;Gallo, Max, ''The Poster in History'', (2002) W.W. Norton&lt;/ref&gt; The modern poster, as we know it, however, dates back to the mid-nineteenth century,  when several separate but related changes took place. First, the [[printing]] industry perfected colour [[lithography]] and made [[mass production]] of large and inexpensive images possible. Second, government censorship of public spaces in countries like France was lifted. And finally, advertisers began to market mass-produced consumer goods to a growing populace in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Guffey, Posters: A Global History, Reaktion: 2015, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In little more than a hundred years", writes poster expert John Barnicoat, "it has come to be recognized as a vital art form, attracting artists at every level, from painters like [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Mucha]] to theatrical and commercial designers."&lt;ref name=Barnicoat&gt;Barnicoat, John, ''Posters: A Concise History'', (1985) Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  They have ranged in styles from [[Art Nouveau]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Cubism]], and [[Art Deco]] to the more formal [[Bauhaus]] and the often incoherent [[hippie]] posters of the 1960s.

===Mass production===
Posters, in the form of placards and posted bills, have been used since earliest times, primarily for advertising and announcements. Purely textual posters have a long history: they advertised the plays of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and made citizens aware of government proclamations for centuries.  However, the great revolution in posters was the development of printing techniques that allowed for cheap mass production and printing, including notably the technique [[lithography]] which was invented in 1796 by the German [[Alois Senefelder]]. The invention of lithography was soon followed by [[chromolithography]], which allowed for mass editions of posters illustrated in vibrant colours to be printed.

===Developing art form===
By the 1890s, the technique had spread throughout Europe.  A number of noted French artists created poster art in this period, foremost amongst them [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Jules Chéret]], [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Adolphe Willette]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Louis Anguetin]], [[Alfred Choubrac]], [[Georges de Feure]] and [[Henri-Gabriel Ibels]].&lt;ref&gt;The modern poster by Arsène Alexandre&lt;/ref&gt; Chéret is considered to be the "father" of advertisement placards. He was a pencil artist and a scene decorator, who founded a small lithography office in Paris in 1866. He used striking characters, contrast and bright colours, and created over 1000 advertisements, primarily for exhibitions, theatres, and products. The industry soon attracted the service of many aspiring painters who needed a source of revenue to support themselves.

[[Chéret]] developed a new [[lithographic]] technique that suited better the needs of advertisers: he added a lot more colour which, in conjunction with innovative [[typography]], rendered the poster much more expressive. Not surprisingly, Chéret is said to have introduced sex in advertising or, at least, to have exploited the feminine image as an advertising ploy. In contrast with those previously painted by [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], Chéret's laughing and provocative feminine figures, often called "chérettes," meant a new conception of art as being of service to advertising.

Posters soon transformed the thoroughfares of Paris, making the streets into what one contemporary called "the poor man’s picture gallery."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Marx, Masters of the Poster, 1896–1900 (New York, 1977), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Their commercial success was such that some fine artists took up poster design in earnest.  Some of these artists were, like Alphonse Mucha, in great demand and theatre stars personally selected their own favorite artist to do the poster for an upcoming performance. The popularity of poster art was such that in 1884 a major exhibition was held in Paris.

===Golden age of the poster===

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. By the end of the 19th century, during an era known as the [[Belle Époque]], the standing of the poster as a serious artform was raised even further. Between 1895 and 1900, Jules Chéret created the [[Maîtres de l'Affiche]] (Masters of the Poster) series that became not only a commercial success but is now seen as an important historical publication. [[Alphonse Mucha]] and [[Eugène Grasset]] were also influential poster designers of this generation, known for their [[Art Nouveau]] style and stylized figures, particularly of women. Advertisement posters became a special type of graphic art in the modern age. [[Poster artist]]s such as [[Théophile Steinlen]], [[Albert Guillaume]], [[Leonetto Cappiello]], [[Henri Thiriet]] and others became important figures of their day, their art form transferred to magazines for advertising as well as for social and political commentary.. Indeed, as design historian Elizabeth Guffey notes, “As large, colorful posters began to command the spaces of public streets, markets, and squares, the format itself took on a civic respectability never afforded to Victorian handbills.”&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], posters underwent a slightly different evolution.  By the 1850s,  the advent of the traveling circus brought colorful posters to tell citizens that a carnival was coming to town. While many of these posters were beautifully printed, the earliest were mass-produced woodcuts; that technique, as well as their subject matter, crowded style, and bright colors, was often derided by contemporary critics.   As chromo-lithography began to reshape European posters, American artists began to take the medium more seriously.  Indeed, with work of designers like [[Edward Penfield]], or [[Will Bradley]] gained an audience in Europe as well as America.

==Decline and resurgence==
Challenged by newer modes of advertising, the poster as a communicative form began to decline after the First World War.  Civic groups had long assailed the poster, arguing that the form made public spaces ugly.  But the real threat to posters came from newer forms of advertising.  Mass-market magazines, radio and later television, and bill-boards all cut into advertiser’s marketing budgets. While posters continued to be made and advertised products, they were no longer considered a primary form of advertising.  More and more, posters purpose shifted toward political and decorative uses.

Indeed, by the mid 1960s, posters were reborn as part of a broader counter-cultural shift. By 1968 the poster craze was described as "half way between a passing fashion and a form of mass hysteria." &lt;ref&gt;David Kunzle, Posters of Protest: The Posters of Political Satire in the U.S., 1966–1970 (New York, 1971), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Sometimes called a “second golden age” or "postermania"&lt;ref&gt;Hilton Kramer, ‘Postermania’, New York Times Magazine (11 February 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; however, this resurgence of popularity saw posters used as decoration and self-expression as much as public protest or advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Guffey, op cit, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial uses==

By the 1890s, poster art had widespread usage in other parts of Europe, advertising everything from bicycles to bullfights. Many posters have had great [[artistic merit]].  These include the posters advertising consumer products and entertainment, but also events like the [[World's Fair]]s and [[Colonialism|Colonial]] [[Art exhibitions|Exhibitions]].

===Political uses===
[[File:In God We Trust AFA Poster in New Philadelphia High School.jpg|thumb|right|A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States, "[[In God We Trust]]," in a [[New Philadelphia High School]] classroom.|200px]]
Other times of great turmoil also produced great posters. The first widespread use of illustrated posters for political ends occurred during the First World War.  War bond drives and recruitment posters soon replaced commercial advertisements. German graphic designers, who had pioneered the simple Sachplakat style in the years leading up to the war, applied their talents to the war effort. Artists working for the Allied cause also made over their art in wartime, as well.

The 1960s saw the rise of [[pop art]] and protest movements throughout the West; both made great use of posters and contributed to the poster's revitalization at this time.
Perhaps the most acclaimed posters were those produced by [[France|French]] students during the so-called "''événements''" of May 1968. During the [[May 1968 in France|1968 Paris student riots]] and for years to come, [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick's]] stylized poster of [[Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (based on the photo ''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''), also became a common youthful symbol of rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], in the United States, public schools across the country posted "[[In God We Trust]]" framed posters in their "libraries, cafeterias and classrooms." The [[American Family Association]] supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/02/20/usat-posters.htm |title='In God We Trust' pressed for schools - USA Today |publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poster printing==
Many [[printing]] techniques are used to produce posters. While most posters are mass-produced, posters may also be printed by hand or in limited editions. Most posters are printed on one side and left blank on the back, the better for affixing to a wall or other surface. Pin-up sized posters are usually printed on A3 Standard Silk paper in full colour. Upon purchase, most commercially available posters are often rolled up into a cylindrical tube to allow for damage-free transportation. Rolled-up posters can then be flattened under pressure for several hours to regain their original form.

It is possible to use [[Tiled printing|poster creation software]] to print large posters on standard home or office printers.

==Types of poster designs==
Many posters, particularly early posters, were used for advertising products. Posters continue to be used for this purpose, with posters advertising [[film]]s, [[music]] (both concerts and recorded albums), [[comic book]]s, and [[tourism|travel]] destinations being particularly notable examples.

===Propaganda and political posters===
[[File:German propaganda poster, Upper Silesia Plebiscite 1.jpg|thumb|[[German propaganda]] poster, 1921]]

During the [[World War I|First]] and [[Second World War]]s, recruiting posters became extremely common, and many of them have persisted in the national consciousness, such as the "[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]" posters from the [[United Kingdom]], the "[[Uncle Sam]] wants you" posters from the United States, or the "[[Loose lips sink ships|Loose Lips Sink Ships]]" posters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022072541/http://www.mlcsmith.com/graphics/not_mine/tits.html |date=October 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that warned of foreign spies. Also in Canada, they were widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/warposters/english/introduction.htm |title='Canadian War Poster Collection' |publisher=Digital.library.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posters during wartime were also used for [[propaganda]] purposes, persuasion, and motivation, such as the famous [[Rosie the Riveter]] posters which exhorted women workers to work in factories during World War II. The [[Soviet Union]] also produced a plethora of [[World War II posters from Soviet Union|propaganda posters]],&lt;ref name="spam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://posters.nce.buttobi.net |title=Propaganda posters - Collection of 1400+ POSTERS from Russia, Czech republic, Poland and Cuba |publisher=Posters.nce.buttobi.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which became iconic representations of the [[Great Patriotic War]].
During the democratic [[revolutions of 1989]] in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] the poster was very important weapon in the hand of the opposition. Brave printed and hand-made political posters appeared on the [[Berlin Wall]], on the statue of St. Wenseslas in [[Prague]] and around the unmarked grave of [[Imre Nagy]] in [[Budapest]] and the role of them was indispensable for the democratic change. An example of an influential political poster is [[Shepard Fairey]]'s [[Barack Obama "HOPE" poster]].

===Movie posters===

{{Main article|Film poster}}
The [[film]] industry quickly discovered that vibrantly coloured posters were an easy way to sell their pictures. Today, posters are produced for most major films, and the collecting of movie posters has become a major hobby. The record price for a poster was set on November 15, 2005 when US$690,000 was paid for a poster of [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' from the Reel Poster Gallery in London.&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4438948.stm |title=Lang film poster fetches record |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-11-15 |accessdate=2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other early horror and science fiction posters are known to bring tremendous prices as well, with an example from [[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]] realizing $452,000 in a 1997 [[Sotheby's]] auction,&lt;ref name=metropolis /&gt; and posters from both [[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]] and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] selling for $334,600 in various [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] Auctions.&lt;ref&gt;http://movieposters.ha.com/common/search_results.php?ic=homepage_search&amp;Nty=1&amp;N=54+790+231&lt;/ref&gt; The 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]] 6-sheet poster, of which only 1 copy is known to exist, is considered to be the most valuable film poster in the world.&lt;ref&gt;BIRD GEI Consultoria Idiomas. "http://birdgei.com/2012/02/07/film-posters/"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel posters===
Poster advertising or proposing a travel destination, or simply artistically articulating a place have been made. An example is the [[Beach Town Posters]] series, a collection of Art Deco travel posters of American beach resorts that refer to the advertising style of the 1920s and 1930s.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

====Railway posters====
In the early days of steam railways in Britain, the various rail companies advertised their routes and services on simple printed sheets. By the 1850s, with increasing competition and improvements in printing technology, pictorial designs were being incorporated in their advertising posters. The use of graphic artists began to influence the design of the pictorial poster. In 1905,  the [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) commissioned [[Norman Wilkinson (artist)|Norman Wilkinson]] to produce artwork for a new landscape poster, advertising their rail/steam packet link to Ireland.  In 1908, for the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR),  [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]] produced the famous image of the "Jolly Fisherman" with the "Skegness is so Bracing" slogan.  The development of this commercial art form throughout the first half of the 20th century reflected the changes in British society, along with the changing styles of art, architecture and fashion as well as changing patterns of holidaymaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/Posters.aspx |title=Railway posters - Our collection - National Railway Museum |publisher=Nrm.org.uk |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Event posters===

[[Image:Replacing an advertising poster in London using an articulated platform 02.JPG|thumb|right|Replacing an advertising poster in London using an aerial work platform.]]
Posters advertising events have become common. Any sort of public event, from a rally to a play, may be advertised with posters; a few types of events have become notable for their poster advertisements.

====Boxing posters====
Boxing Posters were used in and around the actual venue to advertise the forthcoming fight, date, ticket prices, and usually consisted of pictures of each boxer. Boxing Posters vary in size and vibrancy, but are not usually smaller than 18x22 inches. In the early days, few boxing posters survived the actual event and have thus become a [[collectible]].

====Concert posters====
Many [[concert]]s, particularly [[rock concert]]s, have custom-designed posters that are used for advertisement of the event. These often become collectors items as well.

===Band/music posters===
Posters that showcase a person's favorite artist or music group are popular in [[teenager]]s' bedrooms, as well as in [[college]] [[dorm room]]s and [[apartment]]s. Many posters have pictures of popular [[rock band]]s and artists.

====Blacklight poster====
{{Main article|Blacklight poster}}
Blacklight posters are designed to have a special effect under a [[blacklight]] (ultraviolet light).

===Pin-up posters===
Pinup posters, "pinups," or cheesecake posters are pictures of attractive women designed to be displayed, first coming to popularity in the 1920s. The popularity of sexy [[pin-up girl]] posters has been erratic in recent decades.  Pin-ups such as [[Betty Grable]] and [[Jane Russell]] were highly popular with soldiers during [[World War II]] but much less so during the [[Vietnam War]]. The late 1970s and into the beginning of the 1980s were boom years for large posters of television actresses, especially [[Farrah Fawcett]] and  [[Cheryl Tiegs]].

===Affirmation posters===
[[File:Goals affirmation poster, Navy · DF-SD-04-09850.JPEG|thumb|An example of an [[Affirmation posters|affirmation poster]]]]
{{Main article|Affirmation posters}}
This refers to decorative posters that are meant to be motivational and inspirational. One popular series has a black background, a scene from nature, and a word such as "Leadership" or "Opportunity." Another version (usually [[picture frame|framed]] and matted) uses a two-image [[hologram]] which changes as the viewer walks past.

===Publications===

====Comic book posters====
The resurgence of [[comic book]] popularity in the 1960s led to the mass production of comic book posters in the 1970s and onward.  These posters typically feature popular characters in a variety of action poses.  The fact that comic books are a niche market means that a given poster usually has a smaller printing run than other genres of poster.  Therefore, older posters may be quite sought after by collectors.  Promotional posters are usually distributed folded, whereas retail posters intended for home decoration are rolled.

===Educational posters===

====Research posters and "poster sessions"====
{{Main article|Poster session}}
Posters are used in academia to promote and explain research work. They are typically shown during conferences, either as a complement to a talk or scientific paper, or as a publication. They are of lesser importance than actual articles, but they can be a good introduction to a new piece of research before the paper is published. They may be considered as [[grey literature]]. Poster presentations are often not [[peer-review]]ed,{{Contradict-inline|article=Poster session|reason=Text in the article on Poster Sessions says that the work usually HAS been peer-reviewed.|date=March 2018}} but can instead be submitted, meaning that as many as can fit will be accepted.

====Classroom posters====
Posters are a standard feature of [[classrooms]] worldwide. A typical school in North America will display a variety, including: advertising tie-ins (e.g. an historical movie relevant to a current topic of study); alphabet and grammar; numeracy and scientific tables; safety and other instructions (such as lab safety and proper hand washing) ; artwork and displays by the students.

It was founded in 1770–71 by the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbons of Naples]] and closed in 1881, 20 years after the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was established.
In 1860 the foundry employed up to 1600 workers.

==Rationale==

There is a need for a [[computer program]] that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] then most currently available models. Therefore, the SahysMod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].&lt;br&gt;
It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in this manual.

SahysMod's [[goal|objective]] is to predict the [[long-term]] hydro-[[salinity]] in terms of general [[Trend estimation|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.&lt;br&gt;
Further, SahysMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and [[Water well|well]] water (e.g. for [[irrigation]]) and it can account for [[farmer]]s' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[subsurface drainage]] systems at varying depths and with varying capacities so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of SahysMod are found in the next section.

== Methods ==

=== Calculation of aquifer conditions in polygons ===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|Example of an aquifer]]

The model calculates the ground water levels and the incoming and outgoing ground water flows between the [[polygon]]s by a numerical solution of the well-known [[Boussinesq approximation (water waves)|Boussinesq equation]]. The levels and flows influence each other mutually.
The ground water situation is further determined by the vertical [[groundwater recharge]] that is calculated from the agronomic [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]]. These depend again on the levels of the [[ground water]].

When semi-confined [[aquifer]]s are present, the resistance to vertical flow in the slowly permeable top-layer and the overpressure in the aquifer, if any, are taken into account.

Hydraulic [[boundary conditions]] are given as [[hydraulic head]]s in the external nodes in combination with the [[hydraulic conductivity]] between internal and external nodes. If one wishes to impose a zero [[flow conditioning|flow condition]] at the external nodes, the conductivity can be set at zero.

Further, [[aquifer]] flow conditions can be given for the internal nodes. These are required when a [[Fault (geology)|geological fault]] is present at the bottom of the aquifer or when flow occurs between the main aquifer and a deeper aquifer separated by a semi-confining layer.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and salt concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other parameters can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Seasonal approach ===

The model is based on seasonal input data and returns seasonal outputs. The number of seasons per year can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. One can distinguish for example dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. Reasons of not using smaller input/output periods are:
#short-term (e.g., daily) inputs would require much information, which, in large areas, may not be readily available;
#short-term outputs would lead to immense output files, which would be difficult to manage and interpret;
#this model is especially developed to predict long-term trends, and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long-term) than on a daily (short-term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#though the precision of the predictions for the future may be limited, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear. For example, it need not be a major constraint to the design of appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by SahysMod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

=== Computational time steps ===

Many [[water balance]] factors depend on the level of the [[water table]], which again depends on some of the water-balance factors. Due to these mutual influences there can be non-linear changes throughout the season. Therefore, the [[computer program]] performs daily calculations. For this purpose, the seasonal water-balance factors given with the inpu] are reduced automatically to daily values. The calculated seasonal water-balance factors, as given in the output, are obtained by summations of the daily calculated values. [[Groundwater]] levels and [[soil salinity]] (the [[state variable]]s) at the end of the season are found by accumulating the daily changes of water and salt storage.

In some cases the program may detect that the time step must be taken less than 1 day for better accuracy. The necessary adjustments are made automatically.

==Data requirements==

=== Polygonal network ===
[[Image:Garmsar.gif|thumb|250px|A polygonal network]]
The model permits a maximum of 240 internal and 120 external [[polygon]]s with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 sides each. The subdivision of the area into polygons, based on nodal points with known [[coordinates]], should be governed by the characteristics of the distribution of the [[crop]]ping, [[irrigation]], [[drainage]] and [[groundwater]] characteristics over the study area.

The nodes must be numbered, which can be done at will. With an index one indicates whether the node is internal or external. Nodes can be added and removed at will or changed from internal to external or vice versa. Through another index one indicates whether the internal nodes have an unconfined or semi-confined aquifer. This can also be changed at will.

Nodal network relations are to be given indicating the neighboring polygon numbers of each node. The program then calculates the surface area of each polygon, the distance between the nodes and the length of the sides between them using the Thiessen principle.

The [[hydraulic conductivity]] can vary for each side of the polygons.

The depth of the [[water table]], the [[rainfall]] and [[salt]] concentrations of the deeper layers are assumed to be the same over the whole polygon. Other [[parameters]] can very within the polygons according to type of crops and cropping rotation schedule.

=== Hydrological data ===
[[Image:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|SahysMod components]]
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like rainfall, [[potential evaporation]], [[irrigation]], use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the aquifer hydrology (e.g., pumping from [[Water well|wells]]). The other [[water balance]] components (like actual evaporation, downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[subsurface drainage]], [[groundwater flow]]) are given as output.

The quantity of drainage water, as output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data) and the height of the water table above the given drain level. This height results from the computed water balance Further, a drainage reduction factor can be applied to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

To obtain accuracy in the computations of the ground water flow (sect. 2.8), the actual evaporation and the capillary rise, the computer calculations are done on a daily basis. For this purpose, the seasonal hydrological data are divided by the number of days per season to obtain daily values. The daily values are added to yield seasonal values.

=== Cropping patterns/rotations ===

The input data on irrigation, evaporation, and surface runoff are to be specified per season for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user:

:A: irrigated land with crops of group A
:B: irrigated land with crops of group B
:U: non-irrigated land with rain-fed crops or fallow land
[[File:Plain of punjab.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]

The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A-type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugar cane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different seasons, e.g. A=[[wheat]] plus [[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer. Non-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U = 1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.

Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes as explained

When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 differs from the fraction A2, B2 and/or U2 in another season, because the irrigation regime changes in the different seasons, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1) but the crops and irrigation quantities may be different and may need to be proportionally adjusted. One may even specify irrigated land (A or B) with zero irrigation, which is the same as un-irrigated land (U).

[[crop rotation|Cropping rotation]] schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.

Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to [[simulate]] the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

=== Soil strata, type of aquifer ===

SahysMod accepts four different reservoirs of which three are in the soil profile:

:s: a surface reservoir,
:r: an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone,
:x: an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone,
:q: a deep reservoir or main [[aquifer]].

The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth, from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be taken equal to the root zone. It can be saturated, unsaturated, or partly saturated, depending on the water balance. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Sahysmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)

The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are horizontal, except the flow to subsurface drains, which is radial.
If a horizontal subsurface drainage system is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).

If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.

The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped [[Water well|wells]], if present, receive their water from the aquifer only. The flow in the aquifer is determined in dependence of spatially varying depths of the aquifer, levels of the water table, and [[hydraulic conductivity]].

SahysMod permits the introduction of ''phreatic'' ([[unconfined aquifer|unconfined]]) and ''semi-confined'' aquifers. The latter may develop a hydraulic over or under pressure below the slowly permeable top-layer ([[aquitard]]).

=== Agricultural water balances ===
[[File:WatBalan.JPG|thumb|250px|Inflow and outflow factors of water into and out from the soil reservoirs needed to find the waterbalances]]
The agricultural [[water balance]]s are calculated for each soil reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir. The three soil reservoirs can be assigned different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data. When, in a particular situation the transition zone or the aquifer is not present, they must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.

The depth of the [[water table]] at the end of the previous time step, calculated from the [[water balance]]s, is assumed to be the same within each [[polygon]]. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into a larger number of polygons.

Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water-balance components. For example, a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of capillary rise, actual evaporation, and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of percolation losses. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water-balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc. This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Sahysmod has been developed into a [[computer program]], in which the computations are made day by day to account for the chain of reactions with a sufficient degree of [[accuracy]].

=== Drains, wells, and re-use ===
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|250px|Parameters of a horizontal subsurfce drainage system]]
The sub-surface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage]] can be accomplished through drains or pumped wells.

The subsurface drains, if any, are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a drainage control factor.

By installing a drainage system with zero capacity one obtains the opportunity to have separate water and salt balances in the transition above and below drain level.

The pumped [[Water well|wells]], if any, are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]].

The drain and well water can be used for [[irrigation]] through a ''(re)use factor''. This may affect the water and salt balance and on the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.

=== Salt balances ===
[[File:Mpbas.gif|thumb|250px|Graphic example of soil salinity trends in the transition zone]]

The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each soil reservoir separately. They are based on their [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balances]], using the salt concentrations of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming groundwater in the aquifer. The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste. In Sahysmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1. The principles used are correspond to those described in the article [[soil salinity control]].

Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different leaching or salt mixing efficiencies to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model (soil)#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated varying their input value.

If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinity, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (through the input), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.

The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the [[precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method. However, but to some extent, it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the [[aquifer]]. In a future version, the precipitation of gypsum may be introduced.

=== Farmers' responses ===

If required, farmers' responses to [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:

# The amount of [[irrigation]] water applied when the water table becomes shallower depending on the kind of crop (paddy rice and non-rice)
# The fraction of irrigated land when the available [[irrigation]] water is scarce;
# The fraction of irrigated land when the [[soil salinity]] increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation;
# The [[groundwater]] abstraction by pumping from [[Water well|wells]] when the water table drops.

The farmers' responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in turn, slows down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately a new equilibrium situation will arise.

The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect first and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

=== Annual input changes ===

The program runs either with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.

The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, cropping rotations), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates a transfer file by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it also possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn randomly from a known rainfall probability distribution and to obtain a stochastic prediction of the resulting output parameters.

Some input parameters should not be changed, like the nodal network relations, the system [[geometry]], the thickness of the soil layers, and the total [[porosity]], otherwise illogical jumps occur in the water and salt balances. These parameters are also stored in the transfer file, so that any impermissible change is overruled by the transfer data. In some cases of incorrect changes, the program will stop and request the user to adjust the input.

==Output data==
[[Image:GOHANAFREQ.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Cumulative frequency distribution of soil salinity]]
[[Image:GarmsarDWT.png|thumb|right|250px|Example of the polygonal mapping facilities using the depth of the watertable]]
The output is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.&lt;br&gt;
As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SahysMod includes [[Cumulative frequency analysis|frequency distributions]] in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .&lt;br&gt; 
The output data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly, through the user menu, that calls selected groups of data either for a certain [[polygon]] over time, or for a certain season over the polygons. &lt;br /&gt;
The model includes mapping facilties of output data. Also, the program has the facility to store the selected data in a [[spreadsheet]] format for further analysis and for import into a [[GIS]] program. &lt;br /&gt;
Different users may wish to establish different cause-effect relationships. The program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]], as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made. This is the reason why the possibility for further analysis through spreadsheet programs was created.&lt;br&gt;
Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

'''Shape notes''' are a  [[music notation]] designed to facilitate congregational and community singing.  The notation, introduced in late 18th century England, became a popular teaching device in American singing schools. Shapes were added to the note heads in written music to help singers find pitches within major and minor scales without the use of more complex information found in key signatures on the staff.

Shape notes of various kinds have been used for over two centuries in a variety of music traditions, mostly sacred but also secular, originating in New England, practiced primarily in the Southern region of the United States for many years, and now experiencing a renaissance in other locations as well.

== Shape notes ==
The idea behind shape notes is that the parts of a vocal work can be learned more quickly and easily if the music is printed in shapes that match up with the [[solfège]] syllables with which the notes of the musical scale are sung.  For instance, in the four-shape tradition used in the [[Sacred Harp]] and elsewhere, the notes of a C major scale are notated and sung{{Efn | The syllables used derive from [[Guidonian hand|Guidonian]] solmization of overlapping hexachords, none of which included the entire diatonic scale (a system also used in Elizabethan England): see [[Solfège#Origin]].}} as follows:

[[Image:TheShapesOfShapeNoteSinging 4ShapeSystem.gif|center||600 px|The C major scale in shape notes]]
A skilled singer experienced in a shape note tradition has developed a fluent triple mental association, which links a note of the scale, a shape, and a syllable.  This association can be used to help in reading the music.
When a song is first sung by a shape note group, they normally sing the syllables (reading them from the shapes) to solidify their command over the notes.  Next, they sing the same notes to the words of the music.

The syllables and notes of a shape note system are relative rather than absolute; they depend on the key of the piece. The first note of a major key always has the triangular Fa note, followed (ascending) by Sol, La, etc. The first note of a minor key is always La, followed by Mi, Fa, etc.

The first three notes of any [[major scale]] – fa, sol, la – are each a tone apart. The fourth to sixth notes are also a tone apart and are also fa, sol, la. The seventh and eighth notes, being separated by a semitone, are indicated mi-fa.  This means that just four shapenotes can adequately reflect the "feeling" of the whole scale.

==Four-shape vs. seven-shape systems==
[[Image:7-note-shape-note-hymnal-2.png|right|thumb|The 7-note system as used in a modern [[Independent Fundamental Baptist]] church hymnal from the [[Southern United States|South]].]]
[[Image:7-note-shape-note-tunebook.png|left|thumb|The 7-note system as used in a traditional tunebook (the Christian Harmony).]]
The system illustrated above is a ''four-shape'' system; six of the notes of the scale are grouped in pairs assigned to one syllable/shape combination.  The ascending scale using the fa, so, la, fa, so, la, mi, fa syllables represent a variation of the hexachord system introduced by the 11th century monk [[Guido of Arezzo]], who originally introduced a six-note scale using the syllables ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la.

The four syllable variation of Guido's original system was prominent in 17th century England, and entered the US in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Marini | 2003}}{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} mistakenly attributes the invention of the syllables to [[Thomas Morley]], who described a four-syllable system in his ''Plain and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke'' (1597).&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, shapes were invented to represent the syllables. (see below).  The other important systems are ''seven-shape'' systems, which give a different shape and syllable to every note of the scale.  Such systems use as their syllables the note names "do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do" familiar to most people.  A few books (e.g. "The Good Old Songs" by C. H. Cayce) present the older seven-note syllabization of "do, re, mi, fa, so, la, si, do". In the seven-shape system invented by [[Jesse B. Aikin]], the notes of a C major scale would be notated and sung as follows:

[[Image:CMajorScaleInAikenShapeSystem.gif|center|400px]]
There are other seven-shape systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Introduction | contribution = Note shapes | contribution-url = http://fasola.org/introduction/note_shapes.html | publisher = Fasola}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{listen |filename=Star in the east solfege.ogg|title=Star in the east|description="Star in the east" done with four-syllable solfege syllables.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

==Effectiveness of shape notes==
A controlled study on the usefulness of shape notes was carried out in the 1950s by George H. Kyme with an experimental population consisting of fourth- and fifth-graders living in California. Kyme took care to match his [[experimental group|experimental]] and [[control group]]s as closely as possible for ability, quality of teacher, and various other factors. He found that the students taught with shape notes learned to [[sight read]] [[statistical significance|significantly]] better than those taught without them. Kyme additionally found that the students taught with shape notes were also far more likely to pursue musical activities later on in their education.&lt;ref&gt;Kyme, "''An experiment in teaching children to read with shape notes''," ''Journal of Research in Music Education'' VIII, 1 (Spring 1960), pp. 3–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape notes and modulation===
Many forms of music employ [[modulation (music)|modulation]], that is, a change of key in mid-piece.  Modulation is problematic for shape-note systems, since the shapes employed for the original key of the piece no longer match the scale degrees of the new key. At least some forms of shape-note music, for instance [[Sacred Harp]] music, generally avoid modulation.{{Sfn | Horn | 1970 | pp = 7–8}}

== Origin and early history ==
{{See also|List of shape-note tunebooks}}
As noted above, the syllables of shape-note systems greatly antedate the shapes.  The practice of singing music to syllables designating pitch goes back to about AD 1000 with the work of [[Guido of Arezzo]]. Other early work in this area includes the cipher notation of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (18th century), and the [[solfège#Tonic sol-fa|tonic sol-fa]] of [[John Curwen]] (19th century).

American forerunners to shape notes include the 9th edition of the [[Bay Psalm Book]] (Boston), and ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes in a Plaine &amp; Easy Method'' by Reverend [[John Tufts (music educator)|John Tufts]].  The 9th edition of the Bay Psalm Book was printed with the initials of four-note syllables (fa, sol, la, me) underneath the staff. In his book, Tufts substituted the initials of the four-note syllables on the staff in place of note heads, and indicated rhythm by punctuation marks to the right of the letters.&lt;ref&gt;Gates 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Shape notes in published music date from late 18th century America, notably tune-books written by Boston composer/singing-master William Billings, engraved, printed, and published by Paul Revere.  They appeared more widely at the beginning of the nineteenth century, when two publications came out using shaped note heads – ''[[The Easy Instructor]]'' by William Little and William Smith in 1801, and ''The Musical Primer'' by Andrew Law in 1803, intended for use in [[singing school]]s.  Little and Smith used the four-shape system shown above.  Law's system had slightly different shapes:  a square indicated ''fa'' and a triangle ''la'', while ''sol'' and ''mi'' were the same as in Little and Smith.  Law's invention was more radical than Little and Smith's in that he dispensed with the use of the staff altogether, letting the shapes be the sole means of expressing pitch.  Little and Smith followed traditional music notation in placing the note heads on the staff, in place of the ordinary oval note heads.  In the end, it was the Little/Smith system that won out, and there is no hymnbook used today that employs the Law system.

[[File:Connelly shapenotes.jpg|thumb|right|An affidavit found on the verso of the title page of some copies of Little and Smith's ''The Easy Instructor, Part II'' (1803)]]
Some copies of ''The Easy Instructor, Part II'' (1803) included a statement, on the verso of the title page, in which John Connelly (whose name is given in other sources as Conly, Connolly, and Coloney) grants permission to Little and Smith to make use in their publications of the shape notes to which he claimed the rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Kiri | last = Miller | title = Traveling Home | publisher = Univ. of Illinois Press | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-JB2iuBPxfsC&amp;lpg=PA209 | page = 209 n. 4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick Hulan writes, "My copy of William Smith's ''Easy Instructor, Part II'' (1803) attributes the invention [of shape notes] to 'J. Conly of Philadelphia'."  And according to David Warren Steel, in ''John Wyeth and the Development of Southern Folk Hymnody'': "This notation was invented by Philadelphia merchant John Connelly, who on 10 March 1798 signed over his rights to the system to Little and Smith."&lt;/ref&gt;  Little and Smith did not themselves claim credit for the invention, but said instead that the notes were invented around 1790 by John Connelly of [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. Andrew Law asserted that he was the inventor of shape notes.

Shape notes proved popular in America, and quickly a wide variety of hymnbooks were prepared making use of them.  The shapes were eventually extirpated in the northeastern U.S. by a so-called "better music" movement, headed by [[Lowell Mason]].{{Sfn | Lowens | Britton | 1953 | ps = "Had this pedagogical tool been accepted by 'the father of singing among the children', Lowell Mason, and others who shaped the patterns of American music education, we might have been more successful in developing skilled music readers and enthusiastic amateur choral singers in the public schools."}}  But in the South, the shapes became well entrenched, and multiplied into a variety of traditions. [[Ananias Davisson]]'s [[Kentucky Harmony]] is generally considered the first Southern shape-note tunebook.

==Rise of seven-shape systems==
By the middle of the 19th century, the "fa so la" system of four syllables had acquired a major rival, namely the seven-syllable "do re mi" system.  Thus, music compilers began to add three more shapes to their books to match the extra syllables.  Numerous seven-shape notations were devised. Jesse B. Aikin was the first to produce a book with a seven-shape note system, and he vigorously defended his "invention" and his patent. The system used in Aikin's 1846 ''Christian Minstrel'' eventually became the standard.  This owes much to the influential Ruebush &amp; Kieffer Publishing Company adopting Aikin's system around 1876.  Two books that have remained in continuous (though limited) use, [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''Christian Harmony'' and M. L. Swan's ''New Harp of Columbia'', are still available.  These books use seven-shape systems devised by Walker and Swan, respectively.

== Currently active shape note traditions ==
{{See also|Sacred Harp}}
Although seven-shape books may not be as popular as in the past, there are still a great number of churches in the American South, in particular [[Southern Baptist]]s, [[Primitive Baptists]], almost all of the non-instrumental [[Churches of Christ]], some [[Free Methodist]]s, [[United Pentecostal]]s, and [[United Baptist]]s in the Appalachian regions of West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky, that regularly use seven-shape songbooks in Sunday worship. These songbooks may contain a variety of songs from 18th-century classics to 20th-century [[gospel music]].  Thus today denominational songbooks printed in seven shapes probably constitute the largest branch of the shape-note tradition.

In addition, nondenominational community singings are also intermittently held which feature early- to mid-20th century seven-shape gospel music such as [[Stamps-Baxter]] hymnals or ''Heavenly Highway''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Heavenly Highway Hymns|url= http://www.brentwoodbenson.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=75608852&amp;&amp;viewtype=songlist|work= Hymn Book|publisher= Stamps-Baxter/Zondervan|accessdate= 11 November 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213134229/http://www.brentwoodbenson.com/product/viewproduct.do?itemid=75608852&amp;&amp;viewtype=songlist|archivedate= 13 December 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these traditions, the custom of "singing the notes" (syllables) is generally preserved only during the learning process at [[singing school]]s and singing may be to an instrumental accompaniment, typically a piano.

The seven-shape system is also still used at regular public singings of 19th-century songbooks of a similar type to the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'', such as ''[[The Christian Harmony]]'' and the ''[[New Harp of Columbia]]''.  Such singings are common in Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, and generally preserve the singing school custom of "singing the notes".

The seven-shape (Aikin) system is commonly used by the [[Mennonite]]s and [[Church of the Brethren|Brethren]]. Numerous songbooks are printed in shaped notes for this market.  They include ''Christian Hymnal'',&lt;ref name="Champagne"&gt;{{cite web|last= Champagne|first= Josh|title= Christian Music|url= http://joshchampagne.com/music.html|accessdate= 11 November 2012|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120911071501/http://www.joshchampagne.com/music.html|archivedate= 11 September 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Christian Hymnary]]'', ''Hyms of the Church'', ''Zion's Praises'',&lt;ref name = "Champagne" /&gt; ''Pilgrim's Praises'', the ''Church Hymnal'',&lt;ref name = "Champagne" /&gt; ''Silver Gems in Song'' and ''[[Harmonia Sacra]]''.

Some African-American churches use the seven-shape note system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Derrick|title=African American Practice of Shape-Note Singing in the United States|journal=Choral Journal|date=2015|volume=56|issue=5|pages=38–51|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=110720055&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-shape tradition that currently has the greatest number of participants is Sacred Harp singing.  But there are many other traditions that are still active or even enjoying a resurgence of interest.  Among the four-shape systems, the ''[[Southern Harmony]]'' has remained in continuous use at one singing in [[Benton, Kentucky]], and is now experiencing a small amount of regrowth.  The current reawakening of interest in shape note singing has also created new singings using other recently moribund 19th-century four-shape songbooks, such as ''[[The Missouri Harmony]]'', as well as new books by modern composers, such as the ''Northern Harmony''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Stoddard | title = About | url = http://stoddardfamily.home.comcast.net/~stoddardfamily/1AboutNH.html | work = Hymn Book | publisher = Northern Harmony | accessdate = 11 November 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090523145523/http://stoddardfamily.home.comcast.net/~stoddardfamily/1AboutNH.html | archivedate = 23 May 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas B. Malone has specialized in the revival of works by Jeremiah Ingalls, and has published a four-shape edition of Ingalls' 1805 ''The Christian Harmony''.  Malone organizes an annual mid-July singing in Newbury, Vermont, where Ingalls was a tavern-keeper and musician between 1789 and 1810.

== Nomenclature==
Shape notes have also been called '''character notes''' and '''patent notes''', respectfully, and '''buckwheat notes''' and '''dunce notes''', pejoratively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowens|first=Irving|last2=Britton|first2=Allen P.|date=1953|title="The Easy Instructor" (1798-1831): A History and Bibliography of the First Shape Note Tune Book|jstor=3344565|journal=Journal of Research in Music Education|volume=1|issue=1|pages=31–55|doi=10.2307/3344565|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/68570/2/10.2307_3344565.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
In commissioning the MIT team to undertake the project that resulted in ''LTG'', the [[Club of Rome]] had two objectives:&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972" /&gt;{{RP|185}}
# Gain insights into the limits of our world system and the constraints it puts on human numbers and activity.
# Identify and study the dominant elements, and their interactions, that influence the long-term behavior of world systems.

==Methodology==
The study used the [[World3]] computer model to simulate the consequence of interactions between the earth and human systems.&lt;ref&gt;The models were run on [[DYNAMO (programming language)|DYNAMO]], a simulation programming language.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul N. (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=K9_LsJBCqWMC&amp;pg=PA366 ''A Vast Machine: Computer Models, Climate Data, and the Politics of Global Warming''] MIT Press {{ISBN|9780262290715}} pp. 366–71&lt;/ref&gt; The model was based on the work of [[Jay Forrester]] of [[MIT]],&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972" /&gt;{{RP|21}} as described in his book ''World Dynamics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forrester|first1=Jay Wright|title=World Dynamics|date=1971|publisher=Wright-Allen Press|isbn=0262560186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was based on five variables: "[[world population|population]], food production, industrialization, pollution, and [[resource depletion|consumption of nonrenewable natural resources]]".&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972" /&gt;{{RP|25}} At the time of the study, all these variables were increasing and were assumed to continue to grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]], while the ability of technology to increase resources grew only [[linear function|linearly]].&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972" /&gt; The authors intended to explore the possibility of a sustainable feedback pattern that would be achieved by altering growth trends among the five variables under three scenarios. They noted that their projections for the values of the variables in each scenario were predictions "only in the most limited sense of the word", and were only indications of the system's behavioral tendencies.&lt;ref name="Peter A. Victor 2008 pp. 92-93"&gt;Peter A. Victor (2008). ''Managing Without Growth'', [[Edward Elgar Publishing]], pp. 92–93, {{ISBN|978-1-84720-078-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the scenarios saw "overshoot and collapse" of the global system by the mid- to latter-part of the [[21st century]], while a third scenario resulted in a "stabilized world".&lt;ref name="CSIRO" /&gt;{{RP|11}}

===Exponential reserve index===
[[File:Terra.png|thumb|right|The planet earth is a finite system, which means it has limited or finite resources]]

A key idea in ''The Limits to Growth'' is the notion that if the rate of resource use is increasing, the amount of reserves cannot be calculated by simply taking the current known reserves and dividing by the current yearly usage, as is typically done to obtain a static index. For example, in 1972, the amount of chromium reserves was 775 million metric tons, of which 1.85 million metric tons were mined annually. The static index is 775/1.85=418 years, but the rate of chromium consumption was growing at 2.6 percent annually, or [[exponential growth|exponentially]].&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972" /&gt;{{RP|54–71}} If instead of assuming a constant rate of usage, the assumption of a constant rate of growth of 2.6 percent annually is made, the resource will instead last
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\ln(1+0.026\times 418)}{0.026} \approx \text{95 years}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the formula for calculating the amount of time left for a resource with constant consumption growth is:&lt;ref&gt;Limits To Growth, pg 60, Derivation: &lt;math&gt; R = \int_0^y C e^{\rho t}\ dt = \frac{C}{\rho} \left(e^{\rho y} - 1\right) &lt;/math&gt; reverts to &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{\ln \left( 1 + \rho \frac{R}{C}\right)}{\rho}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{\ln((r \times s) + 1)}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:''y'' = years left;
:''r'' = 0.026, the [[Continuous compounding#Continuous compounding|continuous compounding]] growth rate (2.6%).
:''s'' = R/C or static reserve.
:''R'' = reserve;
:''C'' = (annual) consumption.

The authors list a number of similar exponential indices comparing current reserves to current reserves multiplied by a factor of five:
:{| class="wikitable"
! colspan="2" | !! colspan="3" | Years
|-valign="top"
!align="left"|Resource!!Consumption, annual growth rate!!Static index!!Exponential index!!5x reserves exponential index
|-
|width="100"|Chromium||width="100" align="right" |2.6%||width="100" align="right" |420||width="100" align="right"|95||width="100" align="right"|154

The static reserve numbers assume that the usage is constant, and the exponential reserve assumes that the growth rate is constant.

The exponential index has been interpreted as a prediction of the number of years until the world would "run out" of various resources, both by environmentalist groups calling for greater conservation and restrictions on use, and by skeptics criticizing the index when supplies failed to run out.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'', p. 121{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oswego.edu/~edunne/200ch17.html Chapter 17: Growth and Productivity-The Long-Run Possibilities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218063522/http://www.oswego.edu/~edunne/200ch17.html |date=2010-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TPPSNVT | work=[[The Economist]] | title=Treading lightly | date=19 September 2002 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112202759/http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TPPSNVT | archivedate=12 November 2007 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bailey|first1=Ronald|title=Science and Public Policy|url=http://reason.com/archives/2004/02/04/science-and-public-policy|accessdate=26 November 2017|work=Reason|date=4 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; What ''The Limits to Growth'' actually has is the above table, which has the ''current reserves'' (that is no new sources of oil are found) for oil running out in 1992 assuming constant exponential growth.  In ''Limits to Growth: The Thirty Year Update'' there are several pages explaining that new resources are found over time and that the ''current reserves'' therefore change but that ultimately resources are finite.  (Earlier editions did explain this as well, but not in as much detail.) The standard model includes a resource base of double that of what they have calculated, but the book includes model runs where the assumed resources are infinite, but those model runs still result in overshoot and collapse from other factors.

==Conclusions==
After reviewing their computer simulations, the research team came to the following conclusions:&lt;ref name="Meadows-1972" /&gt;{{RP|23–24}}
# Given business as usual, i.e., no changes to historical growth trends, the limits to growth on earth would become evident by 2072, leading to "sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity".
# Growth trends existing in 1972 could be altered so that sustainable ecological and economic stability could be achieved.
# The sooner the world's people start striving for the second outcome above, the better the chance of achieving it.

==Criticism==
Criticism of ''LTG'' was immediate. Peter Passell and two co-authors published a 2 April 1972 article in the ''New York Times'' describing ''LTG'' as "...an empty and misleading work .... best summarized ... as a rediscovery of the oldest maxim of computer science: Garbage In, Garbage Out." Passell found the study's simulations to be simplistic, while assigning little value to the role of technological progress in solving the problems of resource depletion, pollution, and food production. They charged that all ''LTG'' simulations ended in collapse, predicted the imminent end of irreplaceable resources, and, finally, that the entire endeavor was motivated by a hidden agenda: to halt growth in its tracks.&lt;ref name="Passell-1972"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Passell|first1=Peter|last2=Roberts|first2=Marc|last3=Ross|first3=Leonard|author-link3=Leonard Ross|title=The Limits to Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/02/archives/the-limits-to-growth-a-report-for-the-club-of-romes-project-on-the.html|accessdate=2 December 2017|work=New York Times|date=1972-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, a group of researchers at the Science Policy Research Unit at the [[University of Sussex]], published ''[[Models of Doom; A Critique of The Limits to Growth]]''. The Sussex group examined the structure and assumptions of the MIT models. They concluded that the simulations were very sensitive to a few key assumptions and suggest that the MIT assumptions were unduly pessimistic. The Sussex scientists concluded that the MIT methodology, data, and projections were faulty and do not accurately reflect reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=H. S.

Wallich]] agreed that growth could not continue indefinitely, but that a natural end to growth was preferable to intervention. Wallich stated that technology could solve all the problems the report was concerned about, but only if growth continued apace. By stopping growth too soon, Wallich warned, the world would be "consigning billions to permanent poverty".&lt;ref name=alan201013 /&gt;

[[Julian Simon]], a professor at the Universities of [[University of Illinois|Illinois]] and, later, [[University of Maryland|Maryland]], argued that the fundamental underlying concepts of the ''LTG'' scenarios were faulty, because the very idea of what constitutes a "resource" varies over time. For instance, wood was the primary shipbuilding resource until the 1800s, and there were concerns about prospective wood shortages from the 1500s on. But then boats began to be made of iron, later steel, and the shortage issue disappeared. Simon argued in his book ''[[The Ultimate Resource]]'' that human ingenuity creates new resources as required from the raw materials of the universe. For instance, copper will never "run out". History demonstrates that as it becomes scarcer its price will rise and more will be found, more will be recycled, new techniques will use less of it, and at some point a better substitute will be found for it altogether.&lt;ref name="Simon-1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Julian|title=The Ultimate Resource|date=August 1981|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=069109389X|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Resource-Julian-Lincoln-Simon/dp/069109389X/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book was revised and reissued in 1996 as ''The Ultimate Resource 2''.&lt;ref name="Simon-1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Julian L|title=The Ultimate Resource 2|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=0691042691| edition=Paperback| url=http://www.juliansimon.com/writings/Ultimate_Resource/|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Solow]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] argued that prediction in ''The Limits to Growth'' was based on a weak foundation of data. Allen Kneese and Ronald Riker of [[Resources for the Future]] (RFF) stated, "The authors load their case by letting some things grow exponentially and others not. Population, capital and pollution grow exponentially in all models, but technologies for expanding resources and controlling pollution are permitted to grow, if at all, only in discrete increments."{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Critics also argue that the authors of the report claimed to accept that the then-known resources of minerals and energy could, and would, grow in the future, and consumption growth rates could also decline. The theoretical expiry time for each resource would therefore need to be updated as new discoveries, technologies and trends came to light. Writing in ''Forbes'', one critic pointed out that "...while we do indeed face hard limits to the availability of metals and or minerals these hard limits are so far away that they're not...something we should worry about..." and that "...everything is substitutable. Absolutely everything is, no exceptions." Thus substituting metals and minerals for fossil fuels is the very basis of renewable energy.&lt;ref name="Worstall-2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Worstall|first1=Tim|title=The Club of Rome's Limits to Growth Updated: Entirely Bizarre|journal=Forbes|date=2012-04-09|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/04/09/the-club-of-romes-limits-to-growth-updated-entirely-bizarre/#10b6207e7394|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positive reviews==
{{quote box
| quote = With few exceptions, economics as a discipline has been dominated by a perception of living in an unlimited world, where resource and pollution problems in one area were solved by moving resources or people to other parts. The very hint of any global limitation as suggested in the report ''The Limits to Growth'' was met with disbelief and rejection by businesses and most economists. However, this conclusion was mostly based on false premises.

In the early years of the 21st century, the tide of opinion regarding ''LTG'' began to swing in a positive direction.&lt;ref name="Bardi-2008" /&gt; Reading ''LTG'' for the first time in 2000, influential energy economist [[Matthew Simmons]] concluded his views on the report by saying, "In hindsight, The [[Club of Rome]] turned out to be right. We simply wasted 30 important years ignoring this work."&lt;ref name="Simmons-2000"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simmons|first1=Matthew R.|title=Revisiting The Limits to Growth: Could the Club of Rome Have Been Correct After All?|url=http://www.mudcitypress.com/PDF/clubofrome.pdf|website=Mud City Press|accessdate=29 November 2017|date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Graham Turner of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) found that the observed historical data from 1970 to 2000 closely match the simulated results of the "standard run" limits of growth model for almost all the outputs reported. "The comparison is well within uncertainty bounds of nearly all the data in terms of both magnitude and the trends over time." Turner also examined a number of reports, particularly by economists, which over the years have purported to discredit the limits-to-growth model. Turner says these reports are flawed, and reflect misunderstandings about the model.&lt;ref name="CSIRO" /&gt;{{RP|37}}

In 2010, Nørgård, Peet and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a "pioneering report", and said that it "has withstood the test of time and, indeed, has only become more relevant."&lt;ref name="Solutions"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nørgård|first1=Jørgen Stig|last2=Peet|first2=John|last3=Ragnarsdóttir|first3=Kristín Vala|title=The History of The Limits to Growth|journal=The Solutions Journal|date=March 2010|volume=1|issue=2|pages=59–63|url=http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/569|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, ''The Guardian'' published an article showing that data collected since LTG's publication in 1972 supports the accuracy of the 1972 projections.&lt;ref name="Turner-2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner |first1=Graham|last2=Alexander |first2=Cathy| title=Limits to Growth was right.

[[Christian Parenti]], writing in 2012, sees parallels between the reception of ''LTG'' and the contemporary climate debate, "That said, ''The Limits to Growth'' was a scientifically rigorous and credible warning that was actively rejected by the intellectual watchdogs of powerful economic interests. A similar story is playing out now around climate science."&lt;ref name="Parenti-2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parenti|first1=Christian|title='The Limits to Growth': A Book That Launched a Movement|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=5 December 2012|issue=24-31 December 2012 issue|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/limits-growth-book-launched-movement/|accessdate=30 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Club of Rome]] has persisted after ''The Limits of Growth'' and has generally provided comprehensive updates to the book every five years.

An independent retrospective on the public debate over ''The Limits to Growth'' concluded in 1978 that optimistic attitudes had won out, causing a general loss of momentum in the environmental movement. While summarizing a large number of opposing arguments, the article concluded that "scientific arguments for and against each position&amp;nbsp;... have, it would seem, played only a small part in the general acceptance of alternative perspectives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandbach|first1=Francis|title=The Rise and Fall of the Limits to Growth Debate|journal=Social Studies of Science|date=1 November 1978|volume=8|issue=4|pages=495–520|doi=10.1177/030631277800800404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, a symposium was held in [[Hanover]], [[Lower Saxony]], entitled "Beyond the Limits to Growth: Global Industrial Society, Vision or Nightmare?" In 1993, ''[[Beyond the Limits]]'' was published as a 20-year update on the original material. ''Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update'' was published in 2004.

In 2008, Graham Turner at the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in Australia published a paper called "A Comparison of 'The Limits to Growth' with Thirty Years of Reality".&lt;ref name="CSIRO"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Graham|date=2008|title=A Comparison of 'The Limits to Growth' with Thirty Years of Reality|journal=Socio-Economics and the Environment in Discussion (SEED). CSIRO Working Paper Series|publisher=Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([[CSIRO]])|volume=2008-09|page=52|issn=1834-5638| doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.05.001|url=http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Environment/Population-Sustainability/SEEDPaper19.aspx|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It compared the past thirty years of data with the scenarios laid out in the 1972 book and found that changes in industrial production, food production, and pollution are all congruent with one of the book's three scenarios—that of "business as usual". This scenario in ''Limits'' points to [[economic collapse|economic]] and [[societal collapse]] in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16058-prophesy-of-economic-collapse-coming-true.html "Prophesy of economic collapse 'coming true'"], by Jeff Hecht, ''[[New Scientist]]'', 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Nørgård, Peet, and Ragnarsdóttir called the book a "pioneering report". They said that, "its approach remains useful and that its conclusions are still surprisingly valid ... unfortunately the report has been largely dismissed by critics as a doomsday prophecy that has not held up to scrutiny."&lt;ref name="Solutions" /&gt;

Also in 2008, researcher Peter A. Victor wrote, that even though the ''Limits'' team probably underestimated [[price mechanism]]'s role in adjusting outcomes, their critics have overestimated it. He states that ''Limits to Growth'' has had a significant impact on the conception of environmental issues and notes that the models in the book were meant to be taken as predictions "only in the most limited sense of the word".&lt;ref name="Peter A. Victor 2008 pp. 92-93"/&gt;

In a 2009 article published in ''[[American Scientist]]'' titled "Revisiting the Limits to Growth After Peak Oil", Hall and Day noted that "the values predicted by the limits-to-growth model and actual data for 2008 are very close."&lt;ref name="American Scientist"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hall|first=Charles A.

[of the ''Limits to Growth''] "standard run" scenario, which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st Century."&lt;ref name="CSIRO" /&gt;

In 2011, [[Ugo Bardi]] published a book-length academic study of ''The Limits to Growth'', its methods and historical reception and concluded that "The warnings that we received in 1972 ... are becoming increasingly more worrisome as reality seems to be following closely the curves that the ... scenario had generated."&lt;ref name="Bardi-2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardi|first1=Ugo|title=The Limits to Growth Revisited|date=2011|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=9781441994158|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=Gj0RmQWGfXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the+limits+to+growth+revisited&amp;pg=PP1&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3}} A popular analysis of the accuracy of the report by science writer [[Richard Heinberg]] was also published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heinberg|first1=Richard|title=The End of Growth: Adapting to Our New Economic Reality|date=2011|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, BC|isbn=0865716951|edition=3rd printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, writing in ''American Scientist'', Brian Hayes stated that the model is "more a polemical tool than a scientific instrument". He went on to say that the graphs generated by the computer program should not, as the authors note, be used as predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanscientist.org/article/computation-and-the-human-predicament|title=Computation and the Human Predicament – The Limits to Growth and the Limits to Computer Modeling|author=Brian Hayes|journal=American Scientist|date=May–June 2012|doi=10.1511/2012.96.186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Graham Turner concluded that "preparing for a collapsing global system could be even more important than trying to avoid collapse."&lt;ref name=turner2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sustainable.unimelb.edu.au/sites/default/files/docs/MSSI-ResearchPaper-4_Turner_2014.pdf |title=Is Global Collapse Imminent? |last=Turner |first=Graham |date=August 2014 |editor-last=Rickards |editor-first=Lauren |website=sustainable.unimelb.edu.au |series=MSSI Research Papers |publisher=Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, The University of Melbourne |location=Melbourne, Australia |page=16 |type=Research Paper No. 4 |format=PDF |isbn=978-0-7340-4940-7 |accessdate=2014-10-19 |quote=Regrettably, the alignment of data trends with the LTG dynamics indicates that the early stages of collapse could occur within a decade, or might even be underway.

In 2016, a report published by the UK [http://limits2growth.org.uk/ All-Party Parliamentary Group on Limits to Growth] concluded that "there is unsettling evidence that society is still following the 'standard run' of the original study – in which overshoot leads to an eventual collapse of production and living standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Jackon |first1=Tim |last2=Webster |first2=Robin |date=April 2016 |title=Limits Revisited: A Review of the Limits to Growth Debate |url=http://limits2growth.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Jackson-and-Webster-2016-Limits-Revisited.pdf |publisher=All-Party Parliamentary Group on Limits to Growth |location=London |access-date=October 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also points out that some issues not fully addressed in the original 1972 report, such as [[climate change]], present additional challenges for human development.

'''''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism''''' is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[economist]] and [[sociologist]]. It was first published in German under the title '''Konfuzianismus und Taoismus''' in 1915 and an adapted version appeared in 1920. An English translation was published in 1951 and several editions have been released since.

It was his second major work on the sociology of [[religion]], after ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''. Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese [[society]] that were different from those of Europe and [[Puritanism]], and posed a question why [[capitalism]] did not develop in China. From the chronological perspective, he concentrated on early period of Chinese history ([[Hundred Schools of Thought]], [[Warring States period]]), during which major Chinese schools of thoughts ([[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]]) were invented. In that period, he focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese [[patrimonialism]] and [[officialdom]], and Chinese religion, as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.&lt;ref name=rb99&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber's choice of topics and analysis inspired further attention and critique. The sociologist of Chinese religion [[C.K. Yang (sociologist)|C.K. Yang]], for instance, wrote that Weber's interpretation is "largely the result of viewing the religious situation in Chinese culture from the view of the Christian world, where religion has a formal organizational system and has occupied a prominent structural position in the organizational scheme of Western society." {{sfnb|Yang|1961|p = 20}}

==Influence and evaluations==
The sociologist Andreas Buss wrote in 1985 that many Western scholars felt the so-called "Weber-thesis” belonged to a “bygone era” yet it continued to inspire discussion and reference. He cautioned that English language scholars would find it difficult to read Weber. One problem is that Weber did not intend the essays on China and India to be read separately or as definitive treatments. His  purpose was to sketch selected elements in Indian or Chinese culture to contrast with and test his essay “The Protestant Ethic and the Rise of Capitalism.” The essay on Confucianism and Taoism was published in English under “misleading” title, ''The Religion of China'', a title which does “not at all reflect Weber’s intentions”. In addition, Buss continued, the translations are of “poor quality”, even a “disgrace”, and add to the misunderstanding that Weber over-generalized.{{sfnb|Buss|1985| p = [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p6k3AAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=weber+religion+of+china+Eisenstadt&amp;ots=XRIZrKL-v8&amp;sig=8o5lwzG3QICGURqiAY_FyPU27Vo#v=onepage&amp;q=weber%20religion%20of%20china%20Eisenstadt&amp;f=false 1-3]}}

==Historical background==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
Weber based much of his analysis on the early period of Chinese history. By 200 B.C., the Chinese [[Sovereign state|state]] had emerged from a loose [[federation]] of [[feudal]] states of the [[Warring States period]] to the unified [[empire]] with [[Patrimonialism|patrimonal]] rule. Confucianism emerged to dominate the other schools that had developed in the fertile social upheavals of pre-imperial China such as Daoism ([[Taoism]]), [[Mohism]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], all of which had criticised Confucianism (c. 400–c. 200 B.C.). One of [[Confucius]]'s disciples, [[Mencius]], (c. 372–c. 289 B.C.) developed a more idealistic version of Confucianism, while [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] (Hsün Tzu, c.313–c.238 B.C.) argued that all inclinations are shaped by acquired language and other social forms. Confucianism rose to the position of an official orthodoxy during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 B.C.–A.D. 220).

When the Han disintegrated, Confucianism fell with it and lay dormant for almost 400 years (A.D. 220-618) as [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]] offered new visions. China was again unified, by the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–906). During the [[Song dynasty|Song (Sung) dynasty]] (960–1279), [[Neo-Confucianism]] flourished — interpreting classical Confucian doctrine in a way that addressed Buddhist and Daoist issues. In the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Wang Yangming]] claimed that the mind projects ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]'' (principle) onto things rather than just noticing external ''li''. 20th-century Chinese intellectuals blamed Confucianism for the scientific and political backwardness of China after the disastrous conflicts with Western military technology at the dawn of the modern era.

==Cities==
Similar to Europe, Chinese [[city|cities]] were founded as [[fort]]s or leader's [[House|residences]] and were the centers of [[trade]] and [[crafts]].&lt;ref name=rb99/&gt; However, they never received political [[autonomy]] and in fact sometimes had fewer rights than villages.&lt;ref name=rb99/&gt; Likewise, its citizens had no special political rights or privileges; the [[Residency (domicile)|resident]] of Chinese cities never constituted a separate [[status class]] like the residents of European cities.&lt;ref name=rb100/&gt;

The lack of city development is partially due to strengths of [[kinship]] ties, which stems from religious beliefs (in [[ancestral spirits]]) and maintaining strong ties to the villages in which one's ancestors lived.&lt;ref name=rb100&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; The [[guild]]s likewise competed against each other for the favour of the [[Emperor]], never uniting in order to fight for more rights.&lt;ref name=rb100/&gt;

==Patrimonialism, officialdom and literati==
Unlike eternally divided Europe, China saw early unification and establishment of imperial government with a centralized [[officialdom]].&lt;ref name=rb101&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rb104"/&gt; Relatively peaceful centuries in the first centuries of Chinese history meant that [[military]] never gained significant authority when the power structure was being formed.&lt;ref name=rb101/&gt; This meant that the focus of struggle for [[political power]] turned from the distribution of land to the distribution of offices, which with their [[fee]]s and [[tax]]es were the most prominent source of income for the holder.&lt;ref name="rb104"/&gt; The state depended on the services of those freely removable and non-hereditary officials, rather than on the service of military ([[knight]]s), like in Europe.&lt;ref name="rb104"/&gt; The officialdom nonetheless had significant powers, and its vested interests were in preserving the ''[[status quo]]'', opposing any reforms or changes, particularly on a governmental level.&lt;ref name="rb104"/&gt;

For the members of the officialdom, it was their rank, or status, which was of prime importance. The 'superior' man ([[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]]) should stay away from the pursuit of wealth (though not from the wealth itself).&lt;ref name=rb124-125&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.124-125&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, becoming a civil servant was preferred to becoming a businessman and granted a much higher status class.&lt;ref name=rb124-125/&gt; Literati did not care about the wealth, although they could and did care about their status. As Weber wrote:

{{cquote|...the "superior" man coveted... a position, not a profit.&lt;ref name=rb124-125/&gt;}}

==Religious organization and the Confucian orthodoxy==
Chinese civilization had no religious [[prophecy]] nor a powerful [[priesthood]] social class.&lt;ref name="rb104"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor was the [[high priest]] of the [[state religion]] and the supreme ruler.&lt;ref name="rb104"/&gt; Weber emphasized that Confucianism tolerated the simultaneous existence of many popular cults and made no effort to organize them as part of a [[religious doctrine]], while nonetheless curtailing the political ambitions of their priests.&lt;ref name=rb103-104/&gt; Instead it taught adjustment to the world.&lt;ref name=rb103-104/&gt;

This forms a sharp contrast with medieval Europe, where the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] was often able to superimpose its will over those of secular rulers, and where the same, singular religion was the religion of rulers, nobility and the common folk.&lt;ref name=rb104/&gt;

==State cult and popular religiosity==
According to Confucianism, the worship of great deities was the affair of the state, ancestral worship is required of all, and a multitude of popular cults are tolerable.&lt;ref name=rb103-104&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.103-104&lt;/ref&gt; Confucianism tolerated [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[mysticism]] as long as they were useful tools for controlling the masses; it denounced them as [[heresy]] and suppressed them when they threatened the established order (hence the opposition to [[Buddhism]]).&lt;ref name=rb133&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.133&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable quality was the avoidance of both irrational ecstasy and excitement, as well as mystic contemplation and metaphysical speculation.&lt;ref name=rb125-126/&gt;

Note that in this context Confucianism can be referred to as the [[state religion|state cult]], and Taoism as the [[popular religion]].&lt;ref name=rb104/&gt;&lt;ref name=rb125-126&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social structure and the capitalist economy==
Weber argued that, while several factors were good for development of a capitalist economy (long periods of peace, improved control of rivers, population growth, freedom to acquire land and move outside of native community, freedom of choosing the occupation), they were outweighed by others (mostly stemming from religion) in China:&lt;ref name=rb116&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;
* technical inventions were opposed on the basis of religion (disturbance of [[ancestral spirits]] leading to bad luck), instead of changing the world, adjusting oneself to it was preferred&lt;ref name=rb115&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.115&lt;/ref&gt;
* sale of land was often prohibited or made very difficult&lt;ref name=rb114&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;
* extended kinship groups (based on religion stressing the importance of family ties and ancestry) protected its members against economic adversities, therefore negatively affecting one's motivation for payment of debts and work discipline&lt;ref name=rb114/&gt;
* those kinship prevented the development of urban status class, hindered legal developments like creation of legal institutions, codification of laws and a jurist status class.&lt;ref name=rb115/&gt;

==Confucianism and Puritanism==
According to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of [[Rationalization (economics)|rational thought]], each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma.&lt;ref name=rb141&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'', University of California Press, 1977, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint, and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.&lt;ref name=rb141/&gt;

However, to both those qualities where just means to the final goal, and here they were divided by a key difference.&lt;ref name=rb141/&gt; The Confucianism goal was "a cultured status position", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are "tools of God".&lt;ref name=rb141/&gt; The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism.&lt;ref name=rb141/&gt; Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian.&lt;ref&gt;George Ritzer (29 September 2009). Contemporary Sociological Theory and Its Classical Roots: The Basics. McGraw-Hill. pp. 37–38. {{ISBN|978-0-07-340438-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.&lt;ref name=rb141/&gt;

'''World Christianity''' or '''global Christianity''' is a term that attempts to convey the global nature of the [[Christianity|Christian]] religion. However, the term often focuses on “non-[[Western Christianity]]” which “comprises (usually the exotic) instances of Christian faith in ‘the [[global South]]’, in Asia, Africa and Latin America.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=2|title=Christianity as a World Religion|author-last1=Kim|author-first1=Sebastian|author-last2=Kim|author-first2=Kirsteen|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or [[diaspora|diasporic]] forms in Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Hanciles2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jehu Hanciles|title=Beyond Christendom: Globalization, African Migration, and the Transformation of the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vmCDAwAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Orbis Books|isbn=978-1-60833-103-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==
The term ''world Christianity'' can first be found in the writings of [[Francis John McConnell]] in 1929 and [[Henry P. Van Dusen]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/human-needs-and-world-christianity/oclc/893126|title=Human needs and world Christianity|last=McConnell|first=Francis John|date=1929|publisher=Friendship Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-christianity-yesterday-today-tomorrow/oclc/823535&amp;referer=brief_results|title=World Christianity: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow|last=Van Dusen|first=Henry P.|date=1947|publisher=Abingdon-Cokesbury Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term would likewise be used by the mission historian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] to speak of the "World Christian Fellowship" and "World Christian Community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/toward-a-world-christian-fellowship/oclc/1149344|title=Toward a world Christian fellowship|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1938|publisher=Association Press|year=|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/emergence-of-a-world-christian-community/oclc/396146|title=The Emergence of a World Christian Community|last=Latourette|first=Kenneth Scott|date=1949|publisher=Yale University Press|year=|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=|language=English|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these individuals, world Christianity was meant to promote the idea of [[Christian mission]]s and [[Ecumenism|ecumenical unity]]. However, after the end of World War II, as Christian missions ended in many countries such as [[North Korea]] and [[China]] and parts of Asia and Africa shifted due to [[decolonization]] and [[Self-determination|national independence]], these aspects of world Christianity were largely lost.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phan|first=Peter C.|author-link=Peter C.

The current usage of the term puts much less emphasis in [[Christian mission|missions]] and [[ecumenism]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A number of historians have noted a twentieth-century "global shift" in Christianity, from a religion largely found in Europe and the Americas to one which is found in the [[Global South|global south]].&lt;ref name="Walls2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNq6BwAAQBAJ|title=Missionary Movement in Christian History: Studies in the Transmission of Faith|first=|date=1996|publisher=Orbis Books|year=|isbn=978-1-60833-106-2|location=|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Andrew F.

Another term that is often used as analogous to "world Christianity" is the term "global Christianity." However, scholars such as [[Lamin Sanneh]] have argued that "global Christianity" refers to a [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] understanding of Christianity that emphasizes the replication of Christian forms and patterns in Europe, whereas "world Christianity" refers to the multiplicity of indigenous responses to the Christian gospel.&lt;ref name="Sanneh2003"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gbz-xMP1zYC|title=Whose Religion Is Christianity?: The Gospel Beyond the West|date=9 October 2003|publisher=Wm.

Some notable figures in the academic study of world Christianity include [[Andrew Walls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding World Christianity: The Vision and Work of Andrew F.

In contrast to these historians, there is a growing number of [[Christian theology|theologians]] who have been engaging the field of world Christianity from the discipline of [[systematic theology]]. Some examples of this include the Pentecostal [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]]&amp;nbsp;and the Catholic [[Peter C. Phan]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8_wCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121|title=The Dialogical Spirit: Christian Reason and Theological Method in the Third Millennium|last=Yong|first=Amos|publisher=James Clark and Co.|year=2015|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=121–148|chapter=Whither Evangelical Theology?
