{{Year nav topic5|1700|music}}

The year '''1700 in music''' involved some significant events.  Much of the music in the 1700s America originated from places such as England, Ireland, Italy, France, and Africa.  Much of the music in this time period were ballads, folk songs, drum signals, and psalms.  Many songs were used as theater songs, recruiting songs, military marches, and even some dance music.  Around this time was when the piano started becoming more and more popular.  Violins, fiddles, and flutes were among the most played and most known instruments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colonialmusic.org/colonial-music-resources/essays/about-early-american-music.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
Many of the most famous composers in classical music history have come out of the 18th century time period.  These include men such as Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Bach Johann Sebastian.  Mozart is considered the "greatest musical genius of all time."  In his lifetime he has been a part of forty-one symphonies, twenty-five string quartets, and nineteen masses.  This was only a fraction of the work he has done.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history1700s.com/index.php/articles/25-society-and-culture/9-18th-century-composers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[National Post]]'' assessed the film at 2.5/4 stars, noting the story's unwavering focus on racial themes was "to the detriment of the film's depth and realism" but noted that video producer Director X "makes the transition to feature film-making look easy".&lt;ref name=NP /&gt;

In 2017, the film was the subject of an episode of ''The Filmmakers'', the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s web talk series on Canadian film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/the-filmmakers/racism-sports-and-the-east-coast-director-x-s-film-exposes-something-dangerous-and-problematic-1.4316912 "Racism, sports and the East Coast: Director X's film exposes something 'dangerous and problematic'"].

'''Adriaen van de Velde''' (bapt. 30 November 1636, [[Amsterdam]]{{snd}}bur. 21 January 1672, Amsterdam), was a Dutch animal and [[Landscape art|landscape painter]], son of [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and brother of [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], the marine painter.

==Life==
Adriaen did not want to become a marine painter so he was trained in the studio of [[Jan Wynants]], the landscape painter. There he made the acquaintance of [[Philip Wouwerman]], who is believed to have aided him in his studies of animals, and to have exercised a powerful and beneficial influence upon his art. Having made exceptionally rapid progress, he was soon employed by his master to introduce figures into his landscape compositions, and he rendered a similar service to [[Meindert Hobbema|Hobbema]], [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Ruisdael]], [[Adriaen Hendriksz Verboom|Verboom]] and other contemporary artists.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
According to Houbraken, he died while in collaboration with [[Jan van der Heyden]] and [[Frederik de Moucheron]], painting animals on their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Link language|nl}}&lt;!--Middle Dutch--&gt; [http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/houb005groo01_01/houb005groo01_01_0348.htm Adriaan vanden Velde biography] in ''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' (1718) by [[Arnold Houbraken]], courtesy of the [[Digital library for Dutch literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Adriaen van de Velde - Agony in the Garden - WGA24475.jpg|thumb|268px|left|Agony in the Garden]]
His favourite subjects were scenes of open pasture land, with sheep, cattle and goats, which he executed with dexterity, with much precision of touch and truth of draughtsmanship, and with clear silvery colouring. He painted a few small winter scenes with skaters, and several religious subjects, such as the ''Descent from the Cross'', for a [[Roman Catholic]] [[schuilkerk|hidden church]] in Amsterdam{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} and ''The Migration of Jacob'' (1663, [[Wallace Collection]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wallacelive.wallacecollection.org/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=64955 | title =Adriaen van de Velde (1636 - 1672), ''The Migration of Jacob'' | last = | first = | date =9 October 2016 | website =Wallace Collection | publisher = | access-date =9 October 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In addition to his paintings, of which nearly two hundred have been catalogued, he executed about twenty [[etching]]s, several of which appear from their dates to have been done in his fourteenth year. They are distinguished by directness of method and by delicacy and certainty of touch. Van de Velde lived in [[Kalverstraat]], near the [[Regulierspoort]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''Ancient South Arabian art''' was the art of the Pre-Islamic cultures of the southern [[Arabian peninsula]], which was produced from the 3rd millennium BC until the 7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus"&gt;Der Brockhaus Kunst. Künstler, Epochen, Sachbegriffe. 3rd revised and expanded edition. F. A. Brockhaus. Mannheim 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and development ==
[[File:Istanbul - Museo archeol. - Iscrizione araba yemenita - sec. III a.C. - Foto G. Dall'Orto 28-5-2006.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Arabian inscription from 3rd century BC South Arabia, in a [[Old South Arabian language]]. [[İstanbul Archaeology Museums]]]]

Old Arabian art experienced its first flourishing at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC at the time of the [[Ancient history of Yemen|South Arabian]] classical culture,&lt;ref&gt;Dated by the [[Ancient history of Yemen#Chronology|long chronology]].&lt;/ref&gt; centred on the kingdoms of the [[Sabaeans]] and [[Minaeans]] in modern [[Yemen]]. The 5th century BC marked the golden age of Saba, whose main centres were [[Ma'rib]] and [[Sirwah]].&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt; The region was known to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] as '[[Arabia Felix]]' (Fortunate Arabia) as a result of its wealth.

In addition to influences from the [[Ancient Near East|Near East]], from the 5th century BC there was a strong [[Ancient Greek art|Greek]] influence, which seems to have played an important role in the continued development of ancient South Arabian art.{{citation needed|date= September 2018}} The Geometric, stylised forms typical of ancient South Arabian art, both in sculpture and in architecture, took on smoother forms form the 5th century BC.{{citation needed|date= September 2018}} The kingdom of the [[Nabataeans]], established in the northern part of the Arabian peninsula in the late 4th century BC acted as an intermediary between the Arabian cultures and those of the [[Mediterranean]].

The kings of [[Himyar| Himyar]] gained control of South Arabia at the end of the 3rd century AD. With the [[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]] in the second half of the 6th century AD, South Arabian art was displaced by early [[Islamic art]].

== Periodisation==
Since scholarship on ancient South Arabia has long concentrated on [[philology|philological]] investigation of [[Old South Arabian]] inscriptions, the material culture of South Arabia has received little scholarly attention, so that little work has been done on the provenance of artefacts. Periodisations have only been developed for some regions and a general periodisation of South Arabian art is not yet possible. As a result, ancient South Arabian artefacts are categorised by stylistic features, not chronology. A general division of South Arabian art into three periods has been proposed by [[Jürgen Schmidt (archaeologist)|Jürgen Schmidt]]. According to him, the first phase sees the individual motifs begin to develop, the second sees the individual artistic forms become canonised, and in the last period there is some influence from foreign styles, particularly Greek art.

== Architecture ==
=== Construction methods===
[[File:Griffon hadhramaut.jpg|thumb|Decorated capital of a pillar from the royal palace of [[Shabwa]]; stratigraphic context: first half of the 3rd century BC.]]
Unlike [[Mesopotamia]], ancient South Arabia was dominated by stone buildings. Only in the coastal areas and the [[Hadhramaut]] capital of [[Shabwa]] were there also large numbers of mudbrick structures. For monumental buildings, large hewn blocks of stone were used, which were fitted together without mortar and unhewn stone which required mortar. [[Lime mortar]], mud, and [[asphalt]] were used as binding materials. In tall walls, vertical lead props and horizontal pins and brackets were inserted as well. Only the exterior face of the stones was smoothed. Larger walls were often double-shelled, with the rough sides of the stones abutting one another inside the wall. Possibly for aesthetic reasons, the walls of monumental structures were sloped, and buttresses or small bastions helped maintain the stability of the wall.

In the 5th century BC, a new kind of stoneworking appeared, in which the edges of the stones were polished, while the centre of the exposed faces were pecked. This 'marginally drafted' style changed over time, making a chronological arrangement of walls built in this style possible.&lt;ref&gt;Gus W. Van Beek, "Marginally Drafted, Pecked Masonry," in: Richard Le Baron Bowen Jr.; Frank P. Albright: ''Archaeological Discoveries in South Arabia'' (''Publications of the American Foundation for the Study of Man'', Volume 2) Hopkins Baltimore, 1958, pp. 287–299.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interior walls were either plastered (sometimes featuring wall paintings) or covered with stone cladding, with paintings imitating ashlar blocks and sometimes even three-dimensional friezes. Little is known about ceiling construction, although [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ing survives in pillbox-graves - simple [[gable]]d roofs decorated with images. 3&amp;nbsp;cm thick translucent marble or alabaster sheets, sometimes with incised decoration, served as window panes.

Columns were a very important structural element. Until the 5th century BC, they were undecorated monoliths with rectangular or square cross-sections. This sort of column is found in the entrance hall of the Awwam temple and Ḥaram-Bilqīs in Ma'rib, for example. From the 5th century BC, the corners were reduced until eventually they became round columns. From the 5th century, columns also had capitals - initially simple plinths, which subsequently developed into various forms.&lt;ref&gt;Grohmann, ''Arabien'' pp. 210–214&lt;/ref&gt; From the 2nd century BC, these forms were significantly influenced by [[Hellenistic]] architecture and later [[Sasanian architecture|Sasanian]] influence is detectable.

=== Secular architecture===
[[File:Shabwa map.svg|thumb|300px|Plan of the inner city of Shabwa]]
Archaeological excavations of ancient South Arabian settlements reveal a highly developed civic culture with complex irrigation techniques. For example, the [[Marib dam]] dates back to the 9th century BC and remains of it are still visible today. Substantial remains from the 6th century BC can still be seen. There were cities with public buildings made from polished limestone blocks with inscriptions naming their builders, along with city gates, fortifications, streets, temples, markets, and royal residences.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt; 

As the inscriptions show, numerous fortified cities (''hagar'') existed in pre-Islamic South Arabia. Archaeology has so far only revealed civic facilities; unfortified settlements have not yet been investigated archaeologically. The cities were often located in valleys on natural or artificial raised areas, which protected them from floods. Cities were also founded on plateaus or at the feet of mountains, as in the case of the Himyarite capital, [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]]. The majority of ancient South Arabian cities were rectangular or nearly rectangular, like Ma'rib and Shabwa. A notable example of this rectangular city plan is the Minaean capital city, [[Qarnawu]].&lt;ref&gt;Grohmann, ''Arabien'', pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt; The rectangular plan of that city has a main street running through the centre and side streets bisecting it perpendicularly at regular intervals, which indicates central planning, either at the time of original foundation or after a destruction event. However, round and entirely irregular city plans are also found. Compared to other Near Eastern cities, the ancient South Arabian cities had a relatively small total area; the largest city of South Arabia, Ma'rib, covered only 110 ha.

All cities were protected by a city wall (two consecutive walls in the case of Shabwa), with at least two gates, which could be protected by towers. The course of the walls, which was either simply structured or included bastions, had to follow the terrain, especially in mountainous regions, and this is what created irregular city plans. Sometimes cities were protected by citadels, as in Shabwa, [[Raidan]], [[Cana, Yemen|Qana']], and the [[Citadel of Rada'a]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Breton: ''Les fortifications d'Arabie méridionale du 7e au 1er siècle avant notre ère'' (''Archäologische Berichte aus dem Yemen'', 8) Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1994 {{ISBN|3-8053-1487-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ruins6.JPG|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Khor Rori]]]]
Due to a lack of archaeological investigation, the civic centres are so far only poorly known. In [[Timna]] in Qataban, there was a large open space inside the southern gate, from which streets ran in various directions. In addition to the normal residential buildings, fortresses, palaces and temples have been detected in various cities. Substantial excavations have only been undertaken at [[Khor Rori]] and Shabwa. At Shabwa, too, a large open space was located on the inside of the gate, with the royal palace located on one side of it. From this open space, a wide street ran directly through the city, with smaller streets crossing this main street at right angles.

In addition to civic fortifications, there are also other fortifications, which were located at important crossroads or key points in the irrigation system. Substantial ruins of such fortresses still exist,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Hermann von Wissmann (geographer)|Hermann von Wissmann]], [[Maria Höfner]]: ''Beiträge zur historischen Geographie des vorislamischen Südarabien'' (Abhandlungen der geistes- und sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Jahrgang 1952, Nr. 4). Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Mainz 1953, pp. 137–139 and photograph 15, where the ruined castle of Ḥuṣn el-ʿUrr in Hadhramaut is described.&lt;/ref&gt; but none have been excavated. Even so it is clear that these fortresses contained residential quarters as well as temples and water sources. To secure whole areas, barrier walls, which blocked passes and similar bottlenecks, were built, like the wall of [[Libna]], which would have blocked the road from Qana' to Shabwa. 

Due to the climate, irrigation systems were necessary for agriculture. The simplest elements of these systems were various kinds of well and cistern. The largest cisterns could hold up to 12,800 m³. For the efficiency of these wells and citadels, canal networks were essential. These collected and stored the water from the [[wadi]]s when it rained. The most impressive example of these structures is the Dam of Ma'rib, which blocked the Wadi Dhana with a span of almost 600 m and channeled its water through two sluice gates into two "primary canals", which distributed it to the fields by means of a network of smaller canals. Such structures have been detected or attested by inscriptions elsewhere as well. In [[Najran]], [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s were carved into the cliffs to lead the water away.

In various places in South Arabia, especially in mountain passes (''manqal''), paved roads were built, which were sometimes many kilometres long and several metres wide.

=== Religious architecture ===
Compared to secular structures, temples are generally better known, so that it has been possible to develop a possible typology and history of development. In the following, the systems proposed by {{ill|Jürgen Schmidt (archaeologist)|de|Jürgen Schmidt (Archäologe)|lt=Jürgen Schmidt}} and (in more detail) M. Jung are described, which take into account both the floor plans and the actual appearance of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Schmidt, "Altsüdarabische Kultbauten." Werner Daum (ed.): ''Jemen''. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck / Umschau-Verlag, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, pp. 81–101. This replaced the typology of {{ill|Adolf Grohmann (Arabist)|de|Adolf Grohmann (Arabist)|lt=Adolf Grohmann}} which only took account of the different types of floor plan; ''Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft, Kulturgeschichte des Alten Orients, Dritter Abschnitt, Vierter Unterabschnitt: Arabien'' (München, 1963), pp. 157 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively few temples have been excavated to date, so these schemas remain provisional.

The oldest south Arabian sanctuaries belong to the prehistoric period and were simple stone [[monolith]]s, sometimes surrounded by stone circles or [[Mortar (masonry)|mortarless]] masonry walls. In a second phase, actual temples were constructed. These temples were simple rectangular stone structures without roofs. Their interiors were initially very different from one another. Some cult buildings at Jabal Balaq al-Ausaṭ sothwest of Ma'rib, which consist of a courtyard and a tripartite [[cella]], provide a link to a temple type found only in Saba, which had a rectangular ground plan and a [[propylon]] and was divided into two parts - an inner courtyard with pillars on three sides and a tripartite cella. Schmidt includes in this type the temple of the moon god [[Wadd]] built around 700 BC between Ma'rib and Sirwah at Wadd ḏū-Masmaʿ, as well as the temple built by [[Yada'il Dharih I]] at [[Al-Masajid (archaeological site)|Al-Masajid]], which is surrounded by a rectangular wall. Later examples of this schema are found at Qarnawu (5th century BC) and {{ill|Al-Huqqa|de|al-Ḥuqqa}} (1st century BC). The entrance hall of the great Temple of [[Awwam]] in Ma'rib might belong to this group. This temple dates from the 9th-5th centuries BC and consisted of an oval ashlar structure which was over 100 metres long and was linked to a rectangular entrance hall, which was surrounded by a [[peristyle]] consisting of 32 five-metre high monolithic pillars. Only a few traces of this structure remain today.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt;

In the other kingdoms, this type contrasted with the [[hypostyle]] 'multi-support temples' which were built with square, rectangular or even assymetrical ground plans and were surrounded by regularly spaced columns. In contrast to the aforementioned Sabaean temples, these structures were not arranged around a cella or an altar. Initially these temple contained six or eight pillars, but later they ranged up to thirty-five. [[Klaus Schippmann]] has identified yet another type: the Hadhramite 'terrace temple', seven examples of which are known to date.&lt;ref&gt;Schippmann, ''Geschichte der alt-südarabischen Reiche'', p. 112. See also Alexander V. Sedov, ''Temples of Ancient Ḥaḍramawt. Arabia Antica 3.'' PLUS, Pisa 2005 {{ISBN|88-8492-211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these temples are accessed by a great stairway, which leads up to an enclosed terrace, on top of which stands a cella with a podium. 

It is still unclear whether there were images of deities, but the statuettes of humans which were dedicated in the sanctuary of Ma'rib demonstrate that highly developed bronze casts existed by the middle of the 1st century, on which the individual donor was recorded by means of an inscription. Stone pedestals with dedicatory inscriptions show that votive statuettes made of precious metals and bronze were created in Himyar until late antiquity. There were also alabaster statuettes - figures wearing smooth, knee-length robes, with their arms outstretched.&lt;ref name="Brockhaus" /&gt;

== Sculpture ==
The most remarkable artworks aside from architecture from pre-Islamic South Arabia are sculptures. In addition to bronze (and occasionally gold and silver), limestone was a common material for sculptures, especially alabaster and marble. Typical features of ancient South Arabian sculpture are cubic base forms, a plump overall shape and very strong emphasis on the head. The rest of the body is often depicted only in a schematic and reduced fashion; often only the upper body is depicted at all. Much South Arabian art is characterised by minimal attention to realistic proportion, which manifests with large ears and a long, narrow nose. In most cases, sculpture in the round and reliefs faced directly at the viewer; in reliefs the frontal perspective typical of [[ancient Egyptian art]], in which the head and legs are depicted from the side, but the torso from the front, is occasionally encountered. Pupils were made of coloured material which was inserted into holes in the eyes. Initially, drapery was not depicted, but later it was indicated by deep grooves or layers. There are no general characteristics in the arrangement of arms and legs.

There are very few examples of large ancient South Arabian sculptures, so the inscription on an over-life-size bronze statue of the son of the Sabaean king {{ill|Dhamar'ali Yuhabirr|de}} is of particular interest. It reveals that the statue was made by a Greek artist and his Arabian assistant. Much more common are small alabaster statues, portraits and reliefs, which generally depict people and more rarely animals or monsters (dragons and winged lions with human heads), and whole scenes in the case of flat reliefs. A particularly popular scene shows a vine bearing grapes with animals or birds nibbling at it and a man who aims a bow at an animal (or variations thereon). Scenes from life are also depicted in reliefs, such as feasts, battles, and musical performances, as well as scenes of the dead meeting with a deity.

== Minor arts ==
[[File:Huqqa wall painting.svg|thumb|150px|Geometric wall painting from the Temple of al-Huqqa (1st century BC)]]
Alongside the larger artworks, ancient South Arabia also produced a whole range of different smaller artefacts. As elsewhere, ceramics were a major medium, but it has not yet been possible to arrange this material typologically or chronologically, so unlike in the rest of the Near East it does not help to date endividual stratigraphic layers. Some general statements are still possible, however. The manufacture of ceramics was very simple; only part of the vessel was turned on a [[potter's wheel]]. Jugs and bowls of various sizes are common, mostly decorated with engraved or dotted motives, but painted patterns and attached bumps, prongs, or even animal heads are also found. In addition to these everyday ceramic items, some pottery figurines have also been found.

Smaller stone artefacts include bottles, oil lamps, vases, and vessels with animal heads as handles. [[Intaglio (sculpture)|Intaglio]]s and imitations of Egyptian [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]]. In addition to these, there are also various friezes attached to various parts of buildings, which include zigzag patterns, tessellations, perpendicular lines, dentils, niches, small false doors, and meanders, as well as floral and figural elements, including series of ibex heads and grape vines. Other common artistic elements in buildings include [[Rosette (design)|rosette]]s and [[volute]]s, ears of corn, and pomegranates. In two excavations, wallpaintings have also been discovered: geometirc paintings in the temple of al-Huqqa and figural paintings from the French excavations at Shabwat. Artefacts in wood have not survived, but stone images of furniture allow us some insight into ancient South Arabian woodworking.

[[File:Hadramitic cup Louvre Inv31931.jpg|thumb|Hadhramite Metal bowl (2nd–3rd century AD)]]
On the other hand, small bronze and copper artefacts are common, including vases and other [[Repoussé and chasing|chased]] copper or bronze vessels, lamps, handles and animal figurines. Jewellery is also common, including partially golden necklaces, gold plates with images of animals and small golden sculptures.

==Numismatics==
[[File:'Amdan Bayyin coin.jpg|thumb|Himyarite coin of [['Amdan Bayyin|ʿAmdan Bayyin]] of Raidan (Type 9)]]
As in other cultures of the ancient 'periphery' which minted coinage, the ancient South Arabian coinage was modeled on [[ancient Greek coinage]]. Silver coinage is well known from South Arabia, while bronze and gold coinages are comparatively rare. The following typology generally follows that of [[Günther Dembski]].&lt;ref&gt;Günther Dembski, Die Münzen der Arabia Felix. In: Werner Daum (Hrsg.): Jemen. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck / Umschau-Verlag, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, S. 132–135, {{ISBN|3-7016-2251-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It must be noted that the numbering of the coin types only partially reflects a certain chronology.
# The oldest South Arabian coinage was probably minted around 300 BC. It consists of imitations of Old style [[Athens|Athenian]] [[tetradrachm]]s, with the head of [[Athena]] on the obverse and an owl, crescent moon, and olive twig on the reverse. Unlike their models, however, the South Arabian coins were marked with indications of their denomination: full units with the lett ''n'', half units with a ''g'', quarters with a ''t'', and eighths with an ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# A somewhat later series has various monograms and/or letters on the reverse whose significance is not yet understood.
# The third, Qatabanian group has a head on both faces, with the name of the minting state, Harib in Timna, on the reverse.
# The next group is probably also Qatabanian. An owl again appears on the reverse, along with the name ''Shahr Hilal'', the letters ''ḏ'' and ''ḥ'', and the 'Yanuf-monogram'.
# Sometime in the 2nd century BC comes the following type, which imitates the New Style Athenian tetradrachms, while retaining the legends and monograms of the earlier coins.
# The sixth type is distiguished from the preceding type, since it has no inscription, only symbols or monograms.
# Perhaps in connection with the [[Arabian_Peninsula_in_the_Roman_era#Aelius_Gallus_expedition|expedition]] of [[Aelius Gallus]] in 25 BC, elements of [[Roman coinage]] appear in this minting. 
# A single Hadhramite group seems entirely different. They depict a bull labelled as the god Sin, the name of the palace ''s&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;qr'', a head with a radiant crown or an eagle, in various arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;On this type and its variants: S. C. H. Munro-Hay, "The coinage of Shabwa (Hadhramawt), and other  ancient South Arabian Coinage in the National Museum, Aden," ''Syria'' 68 (1991) 393-418&lt;/ref&gt;
# This type is particularly significant for the history of South Arabia. It bears a head on the reverse, with the name of a king and minting state (usually [[Raidan]]) and monograms.
# There are some isolated bronze coins which have a head with letters on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. They are probably from Hadhramaut.
The end of South Arabian coinage is not certainly dated, but was probably somewhere around AD 300.

The '''Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection''' is one of the largest research collections devoted to the history and iconography of [[soldier]]s and soldiering, from circa 1500 to 1945. Formerly a private collection, it was donated to the [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/index.php Brown University Library] in 1981.

[[Anne S. K. Brown|Mrs. John Nicholas Brown (Anne Seddon Kinsolving Brown, 1906-1985)]] began collecting [[toy soldier]]s in 1930, but within a few years had moved on to acquiring graphics and monographs depicting or describing military [[uniform]]s. In the years following the [[Second World War]], the collection increased dramatically, so much so that the Brown family were advised to move the archive out of their house for fear of causing structural damage from the weight. Today, the collection is located on the top floor of the [[John Hay Library]] situated on the [[Brown University]] campus.

Besides approximately 5,000 toy soldiers (additional figures can be found in the Annmary Brown Memorial on the Brown campus), the main focus of the collection are over 15,000 prints, drawings, paintings and watercolors. There are also photographs and [[sheet music]] covers. The graphics depict soldiers in battle, on parade, genre scenes, caricatures, military portraits, and uniform studies. Every major country is represented, with France, the United Kingdom, Germany and the German states being the largest sections. Other important parts focus on Austria, Russia, the United States and elsewhere. Complementing the graphic collection are over 20,000 books, and thousands of albums, sketchbooks, scrapbooks and portfolios. The monographs include army lists, regimental histories, biographies, campaign histories, humor, royalty and ceremonies, costume and early travel, uniform books, drill, tactics and regulation. There are many contemporary military regulations as well as a small collection of manuscript material.

'''''Applied Drama''''', also known as '''''Applied Theatre, Interactive Theatre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sant|first=Toni|title=The Applied and Interactive Theatre Guide|date=22 Sep 2006|url=http://www.interactiveimprov.com/aitg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''or '''Applied Drama''' '''and Theatre (ADT)''''' is an [[umbrella term]] for the use of [[drama]] practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|title=Applied Theatre/Drama: an e-debate in 2004|journal=Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance J|date=February 2006|volume=11|issue=1|pages=90–95|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569780500437960#.UZmDvSsa-nk|doi=10.1080/13569780500437960}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often done in non-theatrical spaces, with participants who do not consider themselves to be artists.

There are several forms and practices considered to be under the umbrella of Applied Drama. In all these fields approaches and methods of [[Applied improvisation|Applied Improvisation]] are used. 

==History and definition==
Applied Drama is a term that has been contested{{By whom|date=August 2015}}, gaining popularity towards the end of the 20th century to describe drama practice in an educational, community or therapeutic context.

James Thompson states that "Applied theatre is a participatory theatre created by people who would not usually make theatre. It is, I would hope, a practice by, with and for the excluded and marginalised." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applied Theatre: Bewilderment and Beyond|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Peter Lang|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Oxford|pages = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judith Ackyroyd confirms the inclusion of both of these elements in ADT: "I have identified two features which I believe to be central to our understanding of applied theatre; an intention to generate change (of awareness, attitude, behaviour, etc), and the participation of the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Applied Theatre: Problems and Possibilities|last = Ackroyd|first = Judith|date = 2000|journal = Applied Theatre Researcher|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applied drama can be either scripted or unscripted.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|quote = |title = Applied Theatre, International Case Studies and Challenges for Practice|year = 2009|publisher = Intellect Publishers|location = Briston, UK|page = 7|editor1=Monica Prendergast |editor2=Juliana Saxton }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners focus primarily on improvisation, whereas others  introduce a range of artistic practices, such as developing scripted plays,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cleanbreak.org.uk retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; devised performances,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oilycart.org.uk.retrieved{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or indigenous forms of cultural performance, sometimes combined with new forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example www.charles-royal.com, www.africanperformers.com, www.storyworkshop.org. retrieved 30 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields associated with applied drama==

===Playback Theatre===
{{Main|Playback Theatre}}
[[Playback Theatre]] involves audience or group members telling stories from their lives and viewing them as enacted by actors improvising. It can also be used in conjunction with [[Narrative Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Playback theatre and narrative therapy: introducing a new model|journal=Dramatherapy |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=108–119 |quote=Article elaborates how such integration (Playback theatre with Narrative Therapy) can be achieved and how it can contribute to the process of narrative re-authoring.|doi=10.1080/02630672.2013.821865|year=2013|last1=Barak|first1=Adi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Health Education===
Drama in healthcare is drama created in medical contexts, often with the intention of rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Bernie|title=Using the Creative Arts in Therapy and Healthcare: A Practical Introduction|publisher=Routledge|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of Applied Drama focuses on using theatre to educate, engage, and stimulate healing in medical professionals, patients, and the general public. Theatre and drama in healthcare are tilted towards conscientizing the populace about their health and improving their health and longevity irrespective of status or social stratification. This form of drama is often used to educate people on important health issues such as healthy eating, grief and loss, exercise, and sexual assault prevention. Examples include using actors to [[Role-playing|role-play]] health ailments in order to train healthcare professionals, performing plays focused on [[Preventive healthcare|primary prevention]], and facilitating drama workshops for patients.

===Drama Therapy===
{{Main|Drama therapy}}
[[Drama therapy]] is the use of Applied Drama techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Loretta Gallo-Lopez, Lawrence C. C. Rubin -Play-Based Interventions for Children and Adolescents on the ...  2012- Page 100 "An overview of drama therapy is provided next, along with support for the use of drama therapy with children with ASd."&lt;/ref&gt;

Drama therapy is rooted in a clinical practice, facilitated by licensed clinicians, that stimulates language, cognitive development and builds resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Clinical Applications of Drama Therapy in Child and Adolescent Treatment|last = Weber|first = Anna Marie|publisher = Brunner-Routledge|year = 2005|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |last2 = Haen|first2 = Craig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre for Development===
{{Main|Theatre for Development}}
Theatre for Development uses Applied Drama techniques to facilitate development in [[less developed countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kabaso|first=Sydney|title=Theater for Development in Zambia|year=2013|publisher=Kabsy Digital Media|location=Zambia|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drama in Education ===
{{Confusing section|date=August 2015}}
Drama in Education can allow students to develop an understanding of themselves and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts, The Ontario Curriculum, Grades 1-8|url=http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/curriculum/elementary/arts18curr.pdf|publisher=Ontario Ministry of Education and Training|accessdate=20 May 2013|page=5|quote=Education in the arts is essential to students’ intellectual, social, physical, and emotional growth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathleen Galllagher has argued that 'What is clear is that there is no correct pedagogical model on offer for drama education. [...] In theatre pedagogy, we not only endow experience with meaning, but we are - as players - invited to make manifest our own subjectivities in the world evoked through character and play, a world laden with metaphor and nuance, a world where relationship to other and self-spectatorship are in dynamic and unrelenting interaction.'&lt;ref&gt;See 'Emergent Conceptions in Theatre Pedagogy and Production' in  ''How Theatre Education: Convergences and Counterpoints'' 3-13, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre in Education===
{{Main|Theatre in education}}
{{Overly detailed|date=August 2015|section=yes}}
Theatre in education (TIE) originated in Britain in the mid-1960s. Monica Prendergast and Juliana Saxton cite TIE as "one of the two historic roots of applied theatre practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; TIE typically includes a theatre company performing in an educational setting (i.e. a school) for youth, including interactive and performative moments.

Practitioner Lynn Hoare defines TIE as a combination of "theatrical elements with interactive moments in which audience participants (in or out of role) work with actor-teachers towards an educational or social goal, using the tools of theatre in service of this goal."&lt;ref&gt;Hoare, Lynn. Considering the Form: Fundamental Factors in Devising for Theatre-In-Education. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. n.p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar Helen Nicholson notes that this work "involves professional theatre-makers working with young people in all kinds of educational settings and learning environments, including schools, hospitals, theaters, museums and heritage sites."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Nicholson, Helen, Applied Drama: The Gift of Theatre, Palgrave MacMillan, Basingstoke, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

TIE seeks to educate young people in issues that are relevant to both them and their communities, for example: bullying, dating violence, environmental preservation, and peer conflict resolution. "TIE companies have always been among the most socially conscious of theatre groups, consistently choosing to examine issues they believe to be of direct relevance to the lives of the children with whom they work."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Anthony, and Chris Vine. Learning through Theatre: The Changing Face of Theatre in Education. 3rd ed. New York: Routledge, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Theatre for Dialogue" (TFD) is a more recent term describing a model that was created specifically for the University of Texas at Austin campus community which pulls methods and theory from a variety of applied theatre practices such as TO and TIE. In her thesis, Spring Snyder explains that "Theatre For Dialogue performances explore the intersection between theatre and education as a way to investigate, reflect, provoke dialogue and serve as a rehearsal for reality without asking participants to share their own personal experiences. Although some of the Theatre For Dialogue’s roots originate from an adapted form of Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed’s forum structure, it is Theatre in Education (TIE) that more closely aligns with TFD."&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Spring. A Transformative Classroom Experience: Exploring Campus Mental Health through Theatre For Dialogue. Thesis. University of Texas at Austin. 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prison Theatre===
In prison theatre, practitioners engage offenders in correctional facilities, jails, prisons, and detention centers in exploring drama work often with the objective of education or rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shailor|first1=Jonathan|title=Performing New Lives: Prison Theatre|date=2010|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|quote=In the prison setting, as elsewhere, the needs that theatre addresses are those of self-expression and identity, freedom (of the imagination), creativity, and community.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples include Wabash Valley Correctional Facility’s ''Shakespeare in Shackles'' where maximum security prisoners learn about and perform [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. The University of Texas’ Center for Women and Gender Studies’ Performing Justice Project works with incarcerated female youth to learn about gender and racial justice while devising a play based on the youth’s unique experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drama Workshops for Anger Management and Offending Behaviour|last = Thompson|first = James|publisher = Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year = 1999|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Theatre of the Oppressed ===
{{Main|Theatre of the Oppressed}}The '''Theatre of the Oppressed''' (TO) describes theatrical forms that the Brazilian theatre practitioner Augusto Boal first developed in the 1960s, initially in Brazil and later in Europe. Boal's techniques aim to use theatre as means of promoting social and political change through allowing the audience to take an active role in the creation of the show. Theatre of the Oppressed can include aspects of [[Forum Theatre]], [[Invisible theater|Invisible Theatre]], Legislative Theatre and [[Image theatre|Image Theatre]].

=== Museum Theatre ===
{{Main|Museum theatre}}Museum theatre aims to use theatrical techniques to add emotion and value to the museum experience.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL|url = http://imtal-europe.net/|website = imtal-europe.net|accessdate = 2015-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically more common in cultural institutions like heritage sites, history museums, and science and industry museums.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Hughes. Museum theatre: Communicating with visitors through drama. Heinemann Drama, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genshaft, Lindsay Michelle. "Bridging theatre and visual art: the role of an applied theatre practitioner in a fine art museum." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As with the other forms of applied drama, it can involve a variety of theatrical techniques.&lt;ref name="IMTAL {{!}} IMTAL" /&gt;

The '''Asyut Treasure''' is the name of an important [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] hoard of jewellery found near the city of [[Asyut]], central [[Egypt]]. Discovered in mysterious circumstances in the early twentieth century, the treasure is now divided between the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin|Kunstgewerbemuseum]] in [[Berlin]], the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-and-institutions/kunstgewerbemuseum/home.html Kunstgewerbemuseun website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103235135/http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-and-institutions/kunstgewerbemuseum/home.html |date=November 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=90180&amp;peoA=90180-3-9 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/464070?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=Pectoral&amp;pos=1 Metropolitan Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1909, a large gold hoard from late antiquity was found either at Tomet near Asyut, or at the ancient site of [[Antinopolis|Antinoë]], on the eastern bank of the [[Nile]] in central Egypt. The exact circumstances of the find remain obscure as the treasure was not excavated by professional archaeologists. The very high quality of the pieces, some of which were embossed with medallions of the [[Byzantine Emperor]], link the Asyut Treasure to the imperial court in [[Constantinople]]. The assemblage of gold jewellery was possibly brought from the capital to the supposedly safer environment of Egypt in the early 7th century, before it was hidden there from the [[Arab invasions]] in the mid 7th century.

==Description==
Thirty six objects have been attributed to the treasure that range in date from the third to the sixth century. Twelve pieces came to [[Berlin]], including a large bejewelled [[gorget|pectoral]], two elaborate necklaces and several pairs of bracelets, all the gift of Friedrich Ludwig von Gans in 1912/13. Six objects were donated in 1916 to the [[British Museum]] by Mrs Burns, sister of the philanthropist [[J Pierpont Morgan]]. They include a massive [[Jewellery chain|body-chain]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold_breast_chain.aspx British Museum highlights]&lt;/ref&gt; the largest piece of jewellery known from the early [[Byzantine art|Byzantine period]], plus a matching pair of earrings and necklace, and two spiral bracelets in the form of [[snake]]. The remainder of the treasure is held by the [[Metropolitan Museum]], many of which were donated by Pierpont Morgan in 1917. It includes one of the most famous pieces –  a plain neck ring attached to a frame, set with a large central [[medallion]] of a Byzantine emperor with the obverse showing the figure of [[Constantinopolis]] seated on a throne. Other pieces in the Met include another gold pectoral set with the [[semissis]] of Emperor [[Maurice Tiberius]], and two matching pairs of bracelets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/galleries/medieval/302 Metropolitan Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An-actress-at-her-toilet-or-miss-brazen-just-breecht-john-colley.jpg|300px|thumb|1779 John Colley Playbill of an actress dressing in breeches]]
{{Crossdressing|history}}
A '''breeches role''' (also '''pants role''' or '''trouser role''', ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' or "Hosenrolle") is a role in which an actress appears in male clothing. [[Breeches]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|tʃ|ᵻ|z}}, also "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the standard male garment at the time breeches roles were introduced. 

In opera it also refers to any male character that is sung and acted by a female singer. Most often the character is an adolescent or a very young man, sung by a [[mezzo-soprano]] or [[contralto]].&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Budden J. Breeches part. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The operatic concept assumes that the character is male, and the audience accepts him as such, even knowing that the actor is not. Cross-dressing female characters (e.g., Leonore in ''[[Fidelio]]'' or Gilda in Act III of ''[[Rigoletto]]'') are not considered breeches roles. The most frequently performed breeches roles are Cherubino (''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''), Octavian (''[[Der Rosenkavalier]])'', Hansel (''[[Hansel und Gretel (opera)|Hansel und Gretel]]'') and Orpheus (''[[Orfeo ed Euridice|Orpheus and Euridice]]''), though the latter was originally written for a male singer, first a [[castrato]] and later, in the revised French version, an [[haute-contre]].

Because non-musical stage plays generally have no requirements for vocal range, they do not usually contain breeches roles in the same sense as opera. Some plays do have male roles that were written for adult female actors, and (for other practical reasons) are usually played by women (e.g., ''[[Peter and Wendy|Peter Pan]]''); these could be considered modern-era breeches roles. However, in most cases, the choice of a female actor to play a male character is made at the production level; [[Hamlet#Hamlet as a character|Hamlet]] is not a breeches role, but [[Sarah Bernhardt]] once played Hamlet ''as'' a breeches role. When a play is spoken of as "containing" a breeches role, this ''does'' mean a role where a female character pretends to be a man and uses male clothing as a disguise.

== History ==
When the London theatres re-opened in 1660, the first professional actresses appeared on the public stage, replacing the boys in dresses of the [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] era. To see real women speak the risqué dialogue of [[Restoration comedy]] and show off their bodies on stage was a great novelty, and soon the even greater sensation was introduced of women wearing male clothes on stage. Out of some 375 plays produced on the London stage between 1660 and 1700, it has been calculated that 89, nearly a quarter, contained one or more roles for actresses in male clothes (see Howe). Practically every Restoration actress appeared in trousers at some time, and breeches roles would even be inserted gratuitously in revivals of older plays.

Some critics, such as Jacqueline Pearson, have argued that these [[cross-dressing]] roles subvert conventional [[gender roles]] by allowing women to imitate the roistering and sexually aggressive behaviour of male Restoration [[Rake (character)|rakes]], but Elizabeth Howe has objected in a detailed study that the male disguise was "little more than yet another means of displaying the actress as a sexual object". The epilogue to [[Thomas Southerne]]'s ''Sir Anthony Love'' (1690) suggests that it does not much matter if the play is dull, as long as the audience can glimpse the legs of the famous "breeches" actress [[Susanna Verbruggen|Susanna Mountfort]] (also known as Susanna Verbruggen):

:You'll hear with Patience a dull Scene, to see,
:In a contented lazy waggery,
:The Female Mountford bare above the knee.

Katharine Eisaman Maus also argues that as well as revealing the female legs and buttocks, the breeches role frequently contained a revelation scene where the character not only unpins her hair but as often reveals a breast as well. This is evidenced in the portraits of many of these actresses of the Restoration.

Breeches roles remained an attraction on the British stage for centuries, but their fascination gradually declined as the difference in real-life male and female clothing became less extreme. They played a part in [[Victorian burlesque]] and are traditional for the [[principal boy]] in [[pantomime]].

== Opera ==
Historically, the list of roles that are considered to be breeches roles is constantly changing, depending on the tastes of the opera-going public. In early Italian opera, many leading operatic roles were assigned to a [[castrato]], a male castrated before puberty with a very strong and high voice. As the practice of castrating boy singers faded, composers created heroic male roles in the mezzo-soprano range, where singers such as [[Marietta Alboni]] and Rosamunda Pisaroni specialised in such roles.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt; (See ''[[Serse|Xerxes]]'' below.)

Currently, many castrato roles are being reclaimed by men. As the training and use of [[countertenor]]s becomes more common, there are more men with these very high voices to sing these roles.

Casting directors are left with choices such as whether to cast the young Prince Orlofsky in [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss II's]] ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for a woman or man; both commonly sing the role. When played by a mezzo, the prince looks like a woman, but sounds like a boy. When played by a counter-tenor, he looks like a man, but sings like a woman. This disparity is made even clearer if, as in this case, there is also spoken dialogue.

The term ''Travesty'' (from the Italian ''travesti'', disguised) applies to any roles sung by the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;Budden J. Travesty. In: ''The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.'' Macmillan, London and New York, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is a ''skirt role'', a female character to be played by a male singer, usually for comic or visual effect. These roles are often ugly stepsisters or very old women, and are not as common as trouser roles. As women were not allowed to sing on stage in the [[Papal States]] during the [[Baroque period]], many female operatic roles which premiered in those areas were originally written as skirt roles for [[castrato|castrati]] (e.g. ''Mandane'' and ''Semira'' in [[Leonardo Vinci]]'s [[Artaserse (Vinci)|Artaserse]]). Britten's Madwoman in ''[[Curlew River]]'' and the Cook in Prokofiev's ''[[The Love for Three Oranges]]'' are examples. The role of the witch in Humperdinck's ''[[Hänsel und Gretel (opera)|Hänsel und Gretel]]'', although written for a mezzo-soprano is now more regularly{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} sung by a tenor, who sings the part an octave lower. In the same opera the "male" roles of Hänsel, the Sandman, and the Dewman are however meant to be sung by women.

'''Carl Vincenz Schindler''' (23 October 1821 in [[Vienna]] – 22 August 1842 in [[Laab im Walde]]) was an Austrian [[Military art|military painter]] in the [[Biedermeier]] style. He was sometimes referred to as "Soldaten-Schindler" (Soldier Schindler).

== Life ==
He received his first lessons from his father, the painter and engraver {{ill|Johann Josef Schindler|de}},&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie|31|784||Schindler, Karl|Hermann Arthur Lier|ADB:Schindler, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also encouraged his interest in military subjects. In 1836, he enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]], where he studied with Karl Gsellhofer (1779–1858) and [[Leopold Kupelwieser]]. Later, he took private lessons from his father's friend, [[Peter Fendi]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; It was Fendi who introduced him to the works of the French military painters, [[Hippolyte Bellangé|Bellangé]], [[Nicolas Toussaint Charlet|Charlet]], [[Eugène Lami|Lami]] and [[Auguste Raffet|Raffet]]. In 1839, he had his first exhibition at the Academy.

He was suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and his health was fragile, so he had to interrupt his studies several times. He visited Laab im Walde, to try the "[[Water cure (therapy)|water cure]]", but it was to no avail and he died there at the age of twenty-one.&lt;ref name="O"&gt;[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/BLK%C3%96:Schindler,_Karl Entry from the "Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich"] @ Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than portray battle scenes or heroic acts, he preferred to focus on the soldiers' daily lives, creating a link between military art and [[Genre art|genre]] painting.&lt;ref name="O" /&gt; His works influenced {{ill|Friedrich Treml|de}} and [[August von Pettenkofen]].

'''Carolingian minuscule''' or '''Caroline minuscule''' is a [[hand (handwriting)|script]] which developed as a calligraphic standard in [[Europe]] so that the [[Latin alphabet]] of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]] could be easily recognized by the [[literate]] class from one region to another. It was developed for the first time, in about 780, by a Benedictine monk of [[Corbie Abbey]] (about 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Paris), namely, [[Alcuin of York]].&lt;ref name=Marcia&gt;Colish, Marcia L. Medieval foundations of the western intellectual tradition, 400-1400. Yale University Press, 1999, 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] between approximately 800 AD and 1200 AD. [[codex|Codices]], [[paganism|pagan]] and [[Christian]] texts, and educational material were written in Carolingian minuscule throughout the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The script developed into [[blackletter]] and became obsolete, though its revival in the [[Italian Renaissance]] forms the basis of more recent scripts.

==Creation==
[[File:Minuscule caroline.jpg|thumb|Page of text (folio 160v) from a Carolingian Gospel Book (British Library, MS Add. 11848), written in Carolingian minuscule. Text is [[Vulgate]] [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 23:15-26.]]

The script is derived from [[Uncial script|Roman half uncial]] and the [[insular script]]s that were being used in Irish and English monasteries.  The strong influence of Irish literati on the script can be seen in the distinctively cló-Gaelach (Irish style) forms of the letters, especially a, e, d, g, s and t.

Carolingian minuscule was created partly under the patronage of the Emperor [[Charlemagne]] (hence Carolingian). Charlemagne had a keen interest in learning, according to his biographer [[Einhard]]:

&lt;blockquote lang="la" style="font-style: italic"&gt;Temptabat et scribere tabulasque et codicellos ad hoc in lecto sub cervicalibus circumferre solebat, ut, cum vacuum tempus esset, manum litteris effigiendis adsuesceret, sed parum successit labor praeposterus ac sero inchoatus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote|He also tried to write, and used to keep tablets and blanks in bed under his pillow, that at leisure hours he might accustom his hand to form the letters; however, as he did not begin his efforts in due season, but late in life, they met with ill success.}}

As a part of Charlemagne's educational and religious reforms, and made that every church and monastery should have a copy of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate Bible]]. Charlemagne wanted to make the Vulgate Bible more readable for preachers and easier to copy for scribes. Thus, Marcia Colish explains;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Charlemagne looked first to Anglo-Saxon England for a scholar to head his court school, finding him in Alcuin (c. 730-804). He assigned to Alcuin the correction of the Vulgate. In conjunction with this project, and later in his career when he became abbot of Tours, Alcuin invented a new style of handwriting, the Caroline minuscule (Plate 6). This script was far more legible than earlier medieval hands and an improvement on Roman book hands, since it provided spaces between the words, more extensive punctuation, and a hierarchy of hands, with capitals used for titles, a mix of capitals and lower-case letters for subtitles or chapter headings, and lower case for the body of the text. With the newly corrected Bible, pastors would be able to base their teaching and preaching on what it actually said.&lt;ref name=Marcia /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Charlemagne was never fully literate, he understood the value of literacy and a uniform script in running his empire. Charlemagne sent for the English scholar [[Alcuin of York]] to run his palace school and [[scriptorium]] at his capital, [[Aachen]]. Efforts to supplant [[Merovingian script|Gallo-Roman]] and Germanic scripts had been under way before Alcuin arrived at Aachen, where he was master from 782 AD to 796 AD, with a two-year break. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen, of which the [[Ada Gospels]] provide classic models, and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)]], where Alcuin withdrew from court service as an [[abbot]] in 796 AD and restructured the scriptorium.&lt;ref&gt;The production of the scriptorium at Tours was reconstructed by E.K. Rand, ''A Survey of the Manuscripts of Tours'' (Harvard University Press), 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Carolingian minuscule was uniform, with rounded shapes in clearly distinguishable [[glyph]]s, disciplined and above all, legible. Clear capital letters and spaces between words became standard in Carolingian minuscule, which was one result of a campaign to achieve a culturally unifying standardization across the [[Carolingian Empire]].

Traditional charters, however, continued to be written in a [[Merovingian script|Merovingian "chancery hand"]] long after manuscripts of Scripture and classical literature were being produced in the minuscule hand. Documents written in a local language, like [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] rather than Latin, tended to be expressed in traditional local script.

Carolingian script generally has fewer [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] than other contemporary [[script (styles of handwriting)|scripts]], although the [[ampersand|''et'']] (''&amp;''), ''æ'', ''rt'', ''st'' and ''ct'' ligatures are common. The letter ''d'' often appears in an uncial form with an [[Ascender (typography)|ascender]] slanting to the left, but the letter ''g'' is essentially the same as the modern minuscule letter, rather than the previously common uncial ''ᵹ''. Ascenders are usually "clubbed" – i.e. they become thicker near the top.

The early period of the script, during Charlemagne's reign in the late 8th century and early 9th, still has widely varying letter forms in different regions. The uncial form of the letter ''a'', similar to a double ''c'' (''cc''), is still used in manuscripts from this period. There is also use of punctuation such as the [[question mark]], as in [[Beneventan script]] of the same period. The script flourished during the 9th century, when regional hands developed into an international standard, with less variation of letter forms. Modern [[glyph]]s, such as ''s'' and ''v'', began to appear (as opposed to the "[[long s|long ''s'']]" ''ſ'' and ''u''), and ascenders, after thickening at the top, were finished with a three-cornered wedge. The script began to evolve slowly after the 9th century. In the 10th and 11th centuries, ligatures were rare and ascenders began to slant to the right and were finished with a fork. The letter ''w'' also began to appear. By the 12th century, Carolingian letters had become more angular and were written closer together, less legibly than in previous centuries; at the same time, the modern [[tittle|dotted]] ''i'' appeared. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Image:Freising manuscript.jpg|thumb|A page of the [[Freising manuscripts]], 10th century [[Slovene language|Slovene]] text written in Carolingian minuscules]]

==Spread==
The new script spread through Western Europe most widely where Carolingian influence was strongest. In luxuriously produced [[Lectionary|lectionaries]] that now began to be produced for princely patronage of abbots and bishops, legibility was essential. It reached far afield: the 10th century [[Freising manuscripts]], which contain the oldest [[Slovene language]], the first [[Latin alphabet|Roman-script]] record of any [[Slavic language]], are written in Carolingian minuscule. In [[Switzerland]], Carolingian was used in the Rhaetian and Alemannic minuscule types. Manuscripts written in '''Rhaetian minuscule''' tend to have slender letters, resembling Insular script, with the letters {{angbr|a}} and {{angbr|t}}, and ligatures such as {{angbr|ri}}, showing similar to Visigothic and Beneventan. '''Alemannic minuscule''', used for a short time in the early 9th century, is usually larger and broader, very vertical compared to the slanting Rhaetian type. In [[Austria]], [[Salzburg]] was the major centre of Carolingian script, while [[Fulda]], [[Mainz]], and [[Würzburg]] were the major centres in Germany. German minuscule tends to be oval-shaped, very slender, and slants to the right. It has uncial features as well, such as the ascender of the letter {{angbr|d}} slanting to the left, and vertical initial strokes of {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}}.

In northern Italy, the monastery at [[Bobbio]] used Carolingian minuscule beginning in the 9th century. Outside the sphere of influence of Charlemagne and his successors, however, the new legible hand was resisted by the [[Roman Curia]]; nevertheless the Romanesca type was developed in [[Rome]] after the 10th century. The script was not taken up in England and Ireland until ecclesiastic reforms in the middle of the 10th century; in Spain a traditionalist [[Visigothic script|Visigothic hand]] survived; and in southern Italy a '[[Beneventan script|Beneventan minuscule]]' survived in the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[duchy of Benevento]] through the 13th century, although Romanesca eventually also appeared in southern Italy.

==Role in cultural transmission==
Scholars during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] sought out and copied in the new legible standardized hand many Roman texts that had been wholly forgotten. Most of our knowledge of classical literature now derives from copies made in the [[Scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Over 7000 manuscripts written in Carolingian script survive from the 8th and 9th centuries alone.

Though the Carolingian minuscule was superseded by [[Blackletter|Gothic blackletter]] hands, it later seemed so thoroughly 'classic' to the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the early [[Renaissance]] that they took these old Carolingian manuscripts to be [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] originals and modelled their Renaissance hand, the [[humanist minuscule]], on the Carolingian one.&lt;ref&gt;Berthold Louis Ullman, ''The Origin and Development of Humanistic Script''. (Rome), 1960, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; From there the script passed to the 15th- and 16th-century printers of books, such as [[Aldus Manutius]] of Venice. In this way it forms the basis of our modern lowercase typefaces. Indeed, 'Carolingian minuscule' is a style of [[typeface]], which approximates this historical hand, eliminating the nuances of size of capitals, long descenders, etc.

'''Celtic knots''', called '''Icovellavna''',{{cn|date=October 2016}} ({{lang-ga|snaidhm Cheilteach}}, {{lang-cy|cwlwm Celtaidd}}) are a variety of [[knot]]s and [[Style (visual arts)#Stylization|stylized]] [[graphic]]al representations of knots used for decoration, used extensively in the [[Celt]]ic style of [[Insular art]]. These knots are most known for their adaptation for use in the [[ornament (architecture)|ornament]]ation of Christian [[monument]]s and [[manuscript]]s, such as the 8th-century [[St. Teilo Gospels]], the [[Book of Kells]] and the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]]. Most are [[endless knot]]s, and many are varieties of [[basket weave knot]]s.

== History ==
The use of [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] patterns had its origins in the artwork of the late Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;James Trilling (2001). ''The Language of Ornament''. Thames and Hudson Ltd {{ISBN|0-500-20343-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knot patterns first appeared in the third and fourth centuries AD and can be seen in Roman floor [[mosaics]] of that time. Interesting developments in the artistic use of interlaced knot patterns are found in Byzantine architecture and book illumination, Coptic art, Celtic art, Islamic art, Kievan Rus'ian book illumination, Ethiopian art, and European architecture and book illumination. 

Spirals, step patterns, and key patterns are dominant motifs in Celtic art before the Christian influence on the Celts, which began around 450. These designs found their way into early Christian manuscripts and artwork with the addition of depictions from life, such as [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s and even [[human]]s. In the beginning, the [[pattern]]s were intricate interwoven cords, called [[Braid|plaits]], which can also be found in other areas of [[Europe]], such as [[Italy]], in the 6th century. A [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|fragment]] of a Gospel Book, now in the [[Durham Cathedral]] library and created in northern [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the 7th century, contains the earliest example of true knotted designs in the Celtic manner.

Examples of plait work (a woven, unbroken{{clarify|date=January 2018}} cord design) predate knotwork designs in several cultures around the world,&lt;ref name=georgebain&gt;{{cite book |author=George Bain |title=Celtic art: The methods of construction |year=1951 |publisher=Constable Press|location=London |isbn=|ref=harv}}{{cite book |author=George Bain |title=Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction |year=1973 |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc |location= |isbn=0-486-22923-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the broken and reconnected{{clarify|date=January 2018}} plait work that is characteristic of true knotwork began in northern Italy and southern Gaul and spread to [[Ireland]] by the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sir Edward Sullivan |title=The Book of Kells |year=1986 |publisher=Studio Editions Ltd |location= |isbn=1-85170-035-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style is most commonly associated with the Celtic lands, but it was also practiced extensively in England and was exported to Europe by Irish and Northumbrian monastic activities on the continent. [[J. Romilly Allen]] has identified "eight elementary knots which form the basis of nearly all the interlaced patterns in Celtic decorative art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Romilly Allen |title=Celtic Art in Pagan and Christian Times |year=1933 |publisher=Studio Editions Ltd |location= |isbn=1-85891-075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkythings.org/knotwork/jra-knots.html |title=Eight Basic Knotwork Patterns |accessdate = 2007-01-10 |author=Drew Ivan |date=2005-08-10 |work= |publisher= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times Celtic art is popularly thought of in terms of national identity and therefore specifically Irish, Scottish or Welsh.

Though tattooing was not a Celtic tradition, Celtic knot tattoos became popular in the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/11/25/366584255/the-american-origins-of-the-not-so-traditional-celtic-knot-tattoo The American Origins Of The Not-So-Traditional Celtic Knot Tattoo] NPR, November 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Charlotte Medal - 1788.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charlotte Medal]]

The '''Charlotte Medal''' is a [[silver]] [[medallion]] {{convert|74|mm}} wide, depicting the voyage of the ''[[Charlotte (1784 ship)|Charlotte]]'', with the [[First Fleet]], to [[Botany Bay]], Australia. Its [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts a scene of the ship and its reverse is inscribed with a description of the journey. The medal is said to be the first work of Australian [[Australian art#Colonial art .281770.E2.80.931900.29|colonial art]].&lt;ref name=NationalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/irish_in_australia/exhibition_overview/arriving |title=Arriving |publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]] |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
During the journey the Charlotte visited [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Whilst at anchor, one of the ship's convicts, a [[forger]] and [[mutiny|mutineer]]&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt; by the name of Thomas Barrett was caught giving locals fake coins made from buckles, buttons and spoons. The [[Surgeon-general]] of the Fleet, [[John White (surgeon)|John White]] was impressed with his skill in making these forgeries, without having the apparent means to do so. This led him to commission Barrett to make the medal, to commemorate the journey, possibly from the surgeon's silver [[kidney dish]].&lt;ref name=JournalOfAVoyage&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/setis/id/p00092 |title=Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with sixty-five plates of nondescript animals, birds, lizards, serpents, curious cones of trees and other natural productions |author=White, John |work=|pages=44–45 |publisher=University of Sydney Library |year=1790 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is created in the style of a [[Touch piece]].&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;

==Inscriptions==
The obverse of the medal depicts the ''Charlotte'' at anchor at night in Botany Bay. The inscription reads {{quote|The Charlotte at anchor in Botany Bay Jan'y &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;.20.1788&lt;ref name=NationalMuseum/&gt;}}

The reverse of the medal is inscribed with a journal of the voyage. It reads {{quote|Sailed the Charlotte of [[London]] from [[Spithead|Spit head]] the 13 of May 1787. Bound for Botany Bay in th Island of [[New Holland (Australia)|new holland]] arriv,d at [[Tenerife|Teneriff]] &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;4 of June in Lat 28 13 N Long 16 23 W depart,d it 10 D', arriv,d at rio janeiro 6 of Aug in Lat 22,54 S Long 42,38 W, depart,d it the 5 of Sep' arriv,d at the [[Cape of good hope]] the 14 Oct' in Lat 34 29 S Long 18 29 E depart,d it &lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;13 of Nov' and made the [[South East Cape|South Cape]] of New Holland the 8 of Jan 4 1788 in Lat 43,32 S Long 146,56 E arrivd at Botany Bay the 20 of Jun' the Charlotte in C&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; in Lat 34.00 South Long 151.00 East distance from [[Great Britain|great Britan]] Miles 13106&lt;ref name=NationalMuseum/&gt;}}

==Owners and ANMM purchase==
It is unknown who owned the medal after White. It is possible that he presented it with his voyage findings, or it stayed with his family after his death, but at some point before 1919 it came into the possession of [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine|Princess Victoria]] and [[Prince Louis of Battenberg|Prince Louis]].&lt;ref name=WhatIsCharlotteMedal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.perthmint.com.au/2013/12/05/what-is-the-charlotte-medal-and-why-is-it-of-such-immense-significance-to-australia/ |title=What is the Charlotte medal and why is it of such immense significance to Australia? |author=Coin Collector Blog |publisher=The Perth Mint Australia |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 it was sold via [[Sotheby's|Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge]] to a British [[numismatist]], Henry Baldwin.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine&gt;{{Citation |last =Hosty |first =Kieran  |title =The Charlotte Medal |magazine =Signals: Quarterly Magazine of The Australian National Maritime Museum |pages =10–15  |date =September–November 2008 |url =http://emuseum.anmm.gov.au/media/full/00045213%20Signals%20article.pdf |accessdate =17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 it was sold to an American numismatist, John J Ford.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;

In 1981 it was sold to a [[Melbourne]] dentist, Dr John Chapman, for $15,000 at Spink Sydney Auction. Dr Chapman donated a medal containing a reproduction of the Charlotte Medal to [[Museum Victoria]] to mark its [[Australian Bicentenary|bicentennial]], in 1988.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCreport&gt;{{cite AV media |people =John Chapman, Tracee Hutchison |title =The 7.30 Report &amp;ndash; Historical medals and coins go under the hammer |medium =Television production |publisher =[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |location =Melbourne, Australia |date =10 July 2008 |url =http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2008/s2300524.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NumismatistJournal&gt;{{cite journal |last =Chapman |first =John |title =The Solution of the Charlotte Enigma |journal =Journal of the Numismatic Association of Australia |volume =9 |pages =28–33 |date =1998 |url =http://www.loonyrobot.com/naa-online.com/pdfjournal/Vol9/Vol%209%20Article%204.pdf |accessdate =17 September 2014 |deadurl =yes |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140918052905/http://www.loonyrobot.com/naa-online.com/pdfjournal/Vol9/Vol%209%20Article%204.pdf |archivedate =18 September 2014 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BicentennialMedal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/items/273157/medal-bicentenary-of-the-charlotte-medal-1788-1988-dr-john-chapman-caulfield-south-victoria-australia-1988 |title=Medal &amp;ndash; Bicentenary of the Charlotte Medal 1788&amp;ndash;1988, Dr John Chapman, Caulfield South, Victoria, Australia, 1988 |publisher=Museum Victoria |year=1987 |accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the [[Australian National Maritime Museum]], with funds from the [[Australian Heritage Council|National Cultural Heritage]] Account, authorised through the Australian Government, won an auction for the medal with a bid of $750,000.&lt;ref name=SignalsMagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhatIsCharlotteMedal/&gt; The final price was $873,750, with $200,000 of NCH funding&lt;ref name=AusGovernmentReport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/PMCH_Review_report_final_for_web.doc&amp;rct=j&amp;frm=1&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=rsIZVJymK6Sy7AbUnoGACw&amp;ved=0CDMQFjAHOAo&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXxEeEDAJ3vh1nHzxZIxmYVicbyw |title=Review of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 and Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Regulations 1987 &amp;ndash; Report of public consultation |author=Cultural Property Section |publisher=Australian Government &amp;ndash; Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |date=2009 |accessdate=17 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305013004/http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/pdfs/PMCH_Review_report_final_for_web.doc%26rct%3Dj%26frm%3D1%26q%3D%26esrc%3Ds%26sa%3DU%26ei%3DrsIZVJymK6Sy7AbUnoGACw%26ved%3D0CDMQFjAHOAo%26usg%3DAFQjCNHXxEeEDAJ3vh1nHzxZIxmYVicbyw# |archive-date=5 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This makes it possible that, despite its age, the medal has only been sold four times.

==Copper medal==
A smaller [[copper]] medallion, with a diameter of {{convert|47|mm}}, was created at the same time. The medal was made for White's personal servant, William Broughton and omits the ship scene, being inscribed simply with an abridged version of the journey.&lt;ref name=WhatIsCharlotteMedal/&gt; The medallion was uncovered during house restoration in the early 1940s.&lt;ref name=NumismatistJournal/&gt; It has been suggested that this medal should "rank as equal in rarity and significance" as its silver counterpart.&lt;ref name=CopperMedalAuction&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noble.com.au/auctions/lot/?id=308954 |title=Lot 740 &amp;ndash; Aust.

'''Church of Holy Trinity''' ({{lang-hr|Crkva sv. Trojstva }}) is a [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] style Roman Catholic church located in [[Split, Croatia]]. Out of all early-medieval ([[Croatian pre-Romanesque art and architecture|old Croatian]]) architectural monuments in [[Dalmatia]], which historians date beck to the period between 8th and 11th century, Church of Holy Trinity, with its original shape and rich findings, has a very important place. This small central edifice with six-leaf structure of semicircular arches strung around irregular circle has become one of the most precious heritage monuments of Split and Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unizd.hr/Portals/11/ArsAdriatica/ArsAdriatica%202012,%20Dalmatinski%20%C5%A1esterolisti%20,%20P.%20Ve%C5%BEi%C4%87.pdf |format=PDF |title=Dalmatinski šesterolisti - sličnosti i razlike |author=Pavuša Vežić |website=Unizd.hr |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Church of the Holy Trinity has been added to the register of the most valuable [[Natural and Cultural Heritage of Croatia|Croatian Cultural Heritage]], of the highest category. The church is still in active use with Holy Mass being celebrated every Sunday at 8:30 am, except in the summertime (from June 13 to September 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitsplit.com/hr/1243/crkva-sv-trojice |title=Split - Crkva Sv. Trojice |website=Visitsplit.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Church of Holy Trinity was first mentioned in a list of countries which had Benedictine monasteries from 1060, which doesn't mean that the church wasn't built in the 9th century. Historians cite different dates of construction of this church; Iveković holds that it was built in the 6th century and Ljubo Karaman in the 11th century, but most historians believe that it was built in the 9th century.

English architect [[Thomas Graham Jackson]], while studying the old architecture of Dalmatia, was first warned of the exceptional heritage value of this edifice, although it was founded abandoned and partially demolished in 1887. In 1891, investigations by domestic and foreign experts were conducted on the site. In 1914 the company from [[Bihać]] rented the church. In 1924, walls on the northwestern apse were renovated, while the previously walled up windows were opened in the 1950s. During restoration works in 1948, the remains of an older edifice that extends to the east, and more fragments of the altar partition were found. Findings are today kept in Archaeological Museum in Split. [[Arch]]es and altar screen are a typical example of pre-Romanesque stone sculpture which is harmoniously decorated with the geometric [[Croatian interlace]] motifes and carved text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-insitu.com/hr/praksa/praksa/restauracija-luka-oltarne-pregrade-iz-crkvice-sv.-trojice-u-splitu.html |title=Restauriranje luka oltarne pregrade iz crkvice Sv.

In 1965, the walls and vaults of the church were cracked, and both interior and exterior neglected, with thorns growing in the interior. Therefore, the head of a monastery of the Assumption of Mary from Poljud neighborhood in Split, fra Vjekoslav Bonifačić, asked the authorities to renovate the church, which they eventually did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samostan-poljud.com/povijest |title=Povijest |website=Samostan-poljud.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 22, 1967, church become founding place of newly founded parish of the Holy Trinity. The nearby monastery of the Assumption of Mary is used as a parish church because of practical reasons.

==Description==
Church has a central shape which is dominated by a dome that lies on six apses interconnected with pillars. The church is only of all six-apse edifices in the early medieval architecture of Dalmatia that is located in Split (the others are in the [[Zadar]] area). In addition, it's also the best preserved. The maximum external length of the church is 10.30 meters, a minimum internal length 5.90 meters, while the height of the central [[tambour]] is  9.5 meters. The church is built of limestone drowned in plaster and vaulted with a semi-dome, probably taken from some older buildings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;T.

Remains of an ancient edifice with an apse that had an unknown purpose were found nearby.&lt;ref&gt;T. Marasović – F. Oreb,

|}
In [[geometry]], '''circular symmetry''' is a type of [[continuous symmetry]] for a planar object that can be [[rotational symmetry|rotated]] by any arbitrary angle and map onto itself. 

Rotational circular symmetry is isomorphic with the [[circle group]] in the [[complex plane]], or the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(2), and [[unitary group]] U(1). Reflective circular symmetry is isomorphic with the [[orthogonal group]] O(2).
== Two dimensions==
[[File:DoubleCone.png|thumb|A double-cone is a [[surface of revolution]], generated by a line.]]
A 2-dimensional object with circular symmetry would consist of [[concentric circle]]s and [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] domains. 

Rotational circular symmetry has all [[cyclic symmetry]], Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as subgroup symmetries. Reflective circular symmetry has all [[dihedral symmetry]], Dih&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as subgroup symmetries.

== Three dimensions==

In 3-dimensions, a [[surface of revolution|surface]] or [[solid of revolution]] has '''circular symmetry''' around an axis, also called '''cylindrical symmetry'''. For example: a right circular [[cone]].  Circular symmetry in 3 dimensions has all [[pyramidal symmetry]], C&lt;sub&gt;''n''v&lt;/sub&gt; as subgroups.

A [[Cone#Other mathematical meanings.|double-cone]], [[bicone]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]], [[toroid]] and [[spheroid]] have circular symmetry, and in addition have a [[bilateral symmetry]] perpendular to the axis of system (or '''half cylindrical symmetry'''). These reflective circular symmetries have all discrete [[prismatic symmetry|prismatic symmetries]], D&lt;sub&gt;''n''h&lt;/sub&gt; as subgroups.

== Four dimensions==

In four dimensions, an object can have circular symmetry, on two orthogonal axis planes, or '''duocylindrical symmetry'''. For example the [[duocylinder]] and [[Clifford torus]] have circular symmetry in two orthogonal axes. A [[spherinder]] has spherical symmetry in one 3-space, and circular symmetry in the orthogonal direction.
{{-}}

== Spherical symmetry==
[[File:Blender-meta-ball.png|thumb|An unmarked [[sphere]] has ''reflectional spherical symmetry''.]]
An analogous 3-dimensional equivalent term is '''spherical symmetry'''. 

Rotational spherical symmetry is isomorphic with the [[rotation group SO(3)]], and can be parametrized by the [[Davenport chained rotations]] pitch, yaw, and roll. Rotational spherical symmetry has all the discrete chiral 3D [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]]s as subgroups. Reflectional spherical symmetry is isomorphic with the [[orthogonal group]] O(3) and has the 3-dimensional discrete point groups as subgroups.

A [[scalar field]] has spherical symmetry if it depends on the distance to the origin only, such as the [[potential]] of a [[central force]]. A [[vector field]] has spherical symmetry if it is in radially inward or outward direction with a magnitude and orientation (inward/outward){{fact|date=February 2011}} depending on the distance to the origin only, such as a central force.&lt;!-- forces and other potential fields are not all possible vector fields.  what about, say, magnetic field of a straight electric wire? --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8073">A '''closet drama''' is a [[play (theatre)|play]] that is not intended to be performed onstage, but read by a solitary reader or sometimes out loud in a small group. The contrast between closet drama and classic ‘stage’ dramas dates back to the late eighteenth century. Although non-performative in nature, closet drama is "a quite legitimate product of literary art." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25106077|title = The Legitimacy of the Closet-Drama|journal = The North American Review|volume = 187|issue = 627|pages = 213–223|last1 = Matthews|first1 = Brander|year = 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
== Definition ==
A closet drama (or closet play) is a [[play (theatre)|play]] created primarily for reading, rather than production. Closet dramas are traditionally defined in narrower terms as belonging to a genre of dramatic writing unconcerned with stage technique. Stageability is only one aspect of closet drama: historically, [[playwright]]s might choose the genre of 'closet' dramatic writing to avoid [[censorship]] of their works, for example in the case of political tragedies. Closet drama has also been used as a mode of dramatic writing for those without access to the commercial playhouse, and in this context has become closely associated with early modern women's writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-5|[4]]] Closet dramas were published in manuscript form, including ''dramatis personae'' and elaborate stage directions, allowing readers to imagine the text as if it was being performed.[[Closet drama#cite note-6|[5]]] This created an "unusually tight fusion between book and reader as it endeavours to stimulate the theatrical imagination." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The playwrights did not have to worry about the pressure to impress an audience due to their audience being who they chose. Thus, it was considered to be a freeing style of writing.[[Closet drama#cite note-:1-2|[1]]]

Marta Straznicky describes the form as "part of a larger cultural matrix in which closed spaces, selective interpretive communities, and political dissent are aligned." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Privacy, playreading, and women's closet drama, 1500-1700|last=Straznicky|first=Marta|publisher=Cambridge University Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-521-84124-5|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print is the crucial factor behind closet dramas: "a play that is not intended for commercial performance can nevertheless cross between private playreading and the public sphere" through this medium.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Women in closet drama ==
In the early modern period, women writers who were unable to ‘use their voice’ in public were able to emphasize their opinions using the form of closet drama. This outlet for communication provided women with the ability to "engage in political discourse without exposing her views to an indiscriminate public," &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; since they could choose to restrict their readership. However, women's writing could be influenced by societal pressures and occurrences.

[[Margaret Lucas Cavendish]], author of fourteen folio volumes,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  explored writing closet dramas during her exile and became one of the most well known women playwrights due to her interest in philosophical nature. [[Closet drama#cite note-:0-1|[1]]] Although living in relative oppression, women dealt with the risks of public shame and rejection in the effort to have their writing recognized.

Other notable women involved in closet drama include [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]], [[Jane Lumley, Baroness Lumley|Jane Lumley]], and [[Elizabeth Cary, Viscountess Falkland|Elizabeth Cary]].

==History==
The philosophical [[dialogue]]s of ancient Greek and Roman writers such as [[Plato]] (see [[Socratic dialogue]]) were written in the form of conversations between "characters" and are in this respect similar to closet drama, many of which feature little action but are often rich in philosophical rhetoric.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1998|title=Recent Studies in Closet Dramas|jstor=43447570|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume=28|issue=1|pages=142–160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with [[Friedrich von Schlegel]], many have argued that the [[tragedy|tragedies]] of [[Seneca the Younger]] in the first century AD were written to be recited at small parties rather than performed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=STRAZNICKY|first=Marta|date=1994|title=Profane Stoical Paradoxes': 'The Tragedie of Mariam' and Sidnean Closet Drama|jstor=43447747|journal=English Literary Renaissance|volume= 24|issue=1|pages=104–134|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that theory has become widely pervasive in the history of theater, there is no evidence to support the contention that his plays were intended to be read or recited at small gatherings of the wealthy. The emperor [[Nero]], a pupil of Seneca, may have performed in some of them. Some of the drama of the [[Middle Ages]] was of the closet-drama type, such as the drama of [[Hrosvit|Hroswitha of Gandersheim]] and [[Medieval debate poetry|debate poems]] in quasi-dramatic form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Elizabethan and Jacobean ===
[[Fulke Greville]], [[Samuel Daniel]], [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling|Sir William Alexander]], and [[Mary Sidney]] wrote closet dramas in the age of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson|Jonson]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Randall, Dale J. B. ''Winter Fruit: English Drama 1642&amp;#x2013;1660.'' Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1642 and 1660, the English government banned public performance. During this time, playreading became a "substitute" for playgoing. Thus, playwrights were moved to take on "propagandist aims" against parliament and topics beyond the theatre in their writing, meaning reading such work could be considered a revolutionary act. However, playwrights could write in relative security, protected by the anonymous means of print. [[Thomas Killigrew]] is an example of a stage playwright who turned to closet drama when his plays could no longer be produced during this period; he was in exile from England during the [[English Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kennedy, Dennis. ''Theatre &amp; Performance''. Oxford University Press, 2003 p.282&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660, some authors continued to favour closet drama, proving that the form "served a cultural function distinct from that of commercial drama." &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[John Milton]]'s play ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', written in 1671, is an example of [[early modern]] drama never intended for the stage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century ===
Several closet dramas in [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse]] were written in Europe after 1800; these plays were by and large inspired by classical models.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} ''[[Faust, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Faust, Part 2]]'' by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], among the most acclaimed pieces in the history of [[German literature]], were written as closet dramas, though both plays have been frequently staged. [[Lord Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and [[Alexander Pushkin]] devoted much time to the closet drama.

The popularity of closet drama at this time was both a sign of, and a reaction to, the decline of the verse [[tragedy]] on the European stage in the 1800s. Popular tastes in theater were shifting toward [[melodrama]] and [[comedy]] and there was little commercial appeal in staging verse tragedies (though [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Robert Browning]], and others wrote verse dramas that were staged in commercial theaters). Playwrights who wanted to write verse tragedy had to resign themselves to writing for readers, rather than actors and audiences. Nineteenth-century closet drama became a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theater and performance.

In [[physics]] a '''conserved current''' is a current, &lt;math&gt;j^\mu&lt;/math&gt;, that satisfies the [[continuity equation]] &lt;math&gt;\partial_\mu j^\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;. The continuity equation represents a conservation law, hence the name.

Indeed, integrating the continuity equation over a volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, large enough to have no net currents through its surface, leads to the conservation law
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial\over\partial t}Q=0\;,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Q=\int_V j^0dV&lt;/math&gt; is the [[charge (physics)|conserved quantity]].

In [[gauge theory|gauge theories]] the gauge fields couple to conserved currents. For example, the [[electromagnetic field]] couples to the [[charge conservation|conserved electric current]].

==Conserved quantities and symmetries==
Conserved current is the flow of the [[canonical conjugate]] of a quantity possessing a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[translational symmetry]].  The [[continuity equation]] for the conserved current is a statement of a ''[[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]''.
Examples of canonical conjugate quantities are:
*[[Time]] and [[energy]] - the continuous translational symmetry of time implies the [[conservation of energy]].
*[[Space]] and [[momentum]] - the continuous translational symmetry of space implies the [[conservation of momentum]]
*Space and [[angular momentum]] - the continuous ''rotational'' symmetry of space implies the [[conservation of angular momentum]]
*[[Wave function]] [[Phase (waves)|phase]] and [[electric charge]] - the continuous phase angle symmetry of the wave function implies the [[Electric charge#Conservation of charge|conservation of electric charge]]

Conserved currents play an extremely important role in [[theoretical physics]], because [[Noether's theorem]] connects the existence of a conserved current to the existence of a [[symmetry]] of some quantity in the system under study. In practical terms, all conserved currents are the [[Noether current]]s, as the existence of a conserved current implies the existence of a symmetry.  Conserved currents play an important role in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s, as the existence of a conserved current points to the existence of [[constants of motion]], which are required to define a [[foliation]] and thus an [[integrable system]].  The conservation law is expressed as the vanishing of a 4-[[divergence]], where the Noether charge forms the zeroth component of the [[four-current|4-current]].

==Conserved currents in electromagnetism==
The ''conservation of charge'', for example, in the notation of [[Maxwell's equations]],

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \rho} {\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

ρ is the ''free'' electric charge density (in units of C/m³)

'''J''' is the '''current density''':

:'''J''' = &lt;math&gt;  \rho &lt;/math&gt;'''v'''

'''v''' is the velocity of the charges.

The equation would apply equally to masses (or other conserved quantities), where the word ''mass'' is substituted for the words ''electric charge'' above.

'''Durdy Bayramov''' ([[Russian Language|Russian]]: Дурды Байрамов; April 14, 1938 - February 14, 2014) was an [[academician]] and artist who was awarded the highest honorary title in his country: “[[People’s Artist]] of [[Turkmen SSR]]”. In his native [[Turkmen language]], Durdy Bayramov’s name is simply “Durdy Bayram” (without the Slavic-style “ov” suffix added to [[Russify]] names during the Soviet era). The name "Bayram" means “celebration” in [[Turkic languages]].

== Early life and education ==
Bayramov was born in [[Baýramaly]] in the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]], then part of the [[Soviet Union]], on April 14, 1938. He lost both parents at a young age and lived as a homeless child before being placed in an orphanage in [[Serdar (city)|Serdar]] (then known as Kyzyl-Arvat), where he was raised. Growing up, Bayramov endured starvation and the many hardships that accompanied [[World War II]] and the post-war devastation. Later, he benefited from the guidance of exceptional teachers who recognized his talent and supported the young artist in his efforts to become a professional painter. His first art teacher was Gennadiy Brusentsov, a Russian artist who taught at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen Art College in [[Ashgabat]]. Bayramov and Brusentsov developed a lifelong friendship, with Brusentsov acting as Bayramov’s mentor over the years. Brusentsov’s portrait of a young Bayramov, titled ''Young Soccer Player'', is in the collection of the [[State Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Katalog Sobraniya: Seriya Zhivopis XVIII-XX Vekov.

Another great influence on Durdy Bayramov’s life and artistic career was art instructor {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Mochalsky|ru|3=Мочальский Дмитрий Константинович}}, his professor at the prestigious {{Interlanguage link multi|Surikov Art Institute|ru|3=Московский государственный академический художественный институт имени В. И. Сурикова}} in Moscow, which Bayramov attended between 1959 and 1965. Mochalsky was a recipient of the highest honorary title in arts in the former Soviet Union—People’s Artist of the USSR—and was widely respected for his “ability to highlight the essential, while setting aside the extraneous details.” &lt;ref&gt;The State Tretyakov Gallery. 2009. “Dmitrii Mochalskii – Romantik Sozializma: 23 Aprelya-7 Iyunya, 2009.” (Дмитрий Мочальский – Романтик Социализма: 23 Апреля-7 Июня, 2009)[Dmitri Mochalski – Romantic of Socialist Realism: April 23-June 7, 2009].

== Career ==

=== 1960s ===
Upon completion of his formal education in 1965, Bayramov joined the [[USSR Union of Artists]] and began his career as a professional artist. The [[landscape]] genre was the first to captivate Durdy Bayramov. Many of his early landscape works (some dating to his student years) earned high praise from critics. His celebrated painting Peaceful Land (1969) is considered a classic example of Turkmen landscape painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Catalogue of Paintings and Drawings for Golden Jubilee Exhibition of the People’s Artist of Turkmenistan Durdy Bayramov|year=2008|publisher=Dubai: Keyik Bayramova|author=Mukhatova, Ogulabat and Kurban Agaliyev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Bayramov married his beloved muse, Dunyagozel “Gozel” Ilyasova, who would be one of his most frequently painted subjects and remain an inspiration for his work throughout his life. Bayramov devoted to her an entire series of works on paper titled Gozel, which includes 53 portraits of Gozel and four flower drawings dedicated to her.

From 1965–1968, Bayramov served as an art instructor at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen State College of Arts in Ashgabat.

=== 1970s ===
Bayramov’s first major artistic honours arrived when he was named winner of the Turkmen SSR Lenin [[Komsomol]] prize in 1970 and of the USSR in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Pimenova, S. 1974, November 27. “Dve Schastlivye Sudby.” (Две Счастливые Судьбы) [Two Fortunate Fates]. Znamya Oktyabrya, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, he completed what is considered the first Turkmen self-portrait, a work formerly held in the collections of the USSR Union of Artists in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Yerlashova, S. 1975. Painting of Soviet Turkmenia. Leningrad (St. Petersburg): Aurora Art Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Bayramov pioneered the Second World War as a theme among Turkmen painters. His painting ''Frontline Assistance'' captured the deep patriotism of ordinary Turkmen women willing to sacrifice their most prized possessions to help soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Prelatov, Y. 1981, December 1. “Vistavki—Lyblyu Svoi Krai.” (Выставки—Люблю  Свой Край) [Exhibitions—Love My Homeland]. Pravda.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theme developed by Bayramov during this period was the process of making [[Turkmen rug|Turkmen carpets]]. This theme is seen in his famous work titled ''Turkmen Carpet Makers'' (1971), which depicts women at work in a carpet factory. This masterpiece of Soviet-era Turkmen art was first exhibited at the State Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow in 1971 and was later acquired by the State Tretyakov Gallery in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Kistovich, Irena. 2010. “Turkmenskaya ‘Semerka.’ Razmyshleniya ob Uhodyashem.” (Туркменская «Семерка».

Retrieved from http://xn--90aefkbacm4aisie.xn--p1ai/content/turkmenskaya-semerka-razmyshleniya-ob-uhodyashchem&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1971 until 1973, eager to assist up-and-coming artists, Bayramov returned to his position as art instructor at the Shota Rustaveli Turkmen State College of Arts in Ashgabat.

In the mid-1970s, Bayramov embarked on what was to become his most celebrated series, ''Cultural Figures''. This series contains portraits of individuals recognized by Bayramov as having made important contributions to Turkmen cultural heritage during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. The creation of ''Cultural Figures'' would span more than four decades and result in more than 150 individual portraits.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Bayramov was named an Honoured Art Worker of the [[Turkmen SSR]], and in 1984 he was awarded second prize and a [[Laureate]] Diploma for the contest commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Turkmen SSR and Communist Party of the TSSR. He remained highly productive throughout the 1980s despite personal hardships associated with [[perestroika]] (ca. 1985–1991), which caused a scarcity of basic household goods and food products for many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Children of Perestroika": Moscow Teenagers Talk About Their Lives and the Future|year=1992|publisher=London: Routledge|author=Adelman, Deborah.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayramov persevered and worked tirelessly, trying to lose himself in his art. He continued to expand his artistic repertoire through an increased focus on portraits and still lifes, especially flowers.

In 1985, Bayramov began work on one of his most celebrated thematic compositions—his monumental tribute to the great Spanish artists of the past titled ''Golden Mist''. This work would not be completed until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Blagodatov, Nikolay and Durdy Bayramov. 2012. Durdy Bayramov. Toronto: Keyik Bayramova, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, Bayramov’s popularity and renown grew as a result of numerous solo exhibitions, including those held in Moscow, Russia (1980, 1984); [[Berlin]], [[German Democratic Republic]] (1981); [[Ulyanovsk]], Russia (1984); Ashgabat, Turkmenistan (two exhibitions in 1986 alone); and [[Budapest]], Hungary (1986).

=== 1990s ===
Following continued critical and popular success at home and abroad, in 1991 Bayramov was awarded the highest artistic title in his home country: [[People’s Artist]] of Turkmenistan.

In 1998, Bayramov was appointed an Academician of the National Academy of Arts of Kyrgyzstan, along with fellow artists Suhrob Kurbanov, [[Tahir Salahov]], Turgunbai Sadykov, and Erbolat Tolepbai. In conjunction with the presentation of this award, Bayramov contributed works to the International Exhibition of the Academicians of [[Kyrgyzstan]] at the Academy of Arts in [[Bishkek]].&lt;ref&gt;Toktosunova, G. I.

Bishkek: National Academy of Arts of the Kyrgyz Republic.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===
Throughout the 2000s, Bayramov continued to travel and work extensively both within Turkmenistan and around the world. This included trips to [[Ukraine]], where he held a solo exhibition in the Kiev National Museum of Russian Art in 2000, Russia (2003), [[Thailand]] (2004), [[Turkey]] (2002 and 2004), [[Maldives]] (2004), the [[United Arab Emirates]] (multiple trips between 2003 and 2007), [[Netherlands]] (2008), Italy (2009), Belgium (2010), and France (2010). In 2008, Bayramov celebrated his 70th birthday and his 50-year milestone as an artist with two retrospective exhibitions of his work in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan.

Based on his lifetime artistic achievements and contributions to the culture of Turkmenistan, in 2008 Bayramov was awarded the “For the Love of the Motherland” medal, presented to him by the [[President of Turkmenistan]].

=== 2010s ===

Bayramov continued his prolific artistic output into the 2010s, creating more than ninety oil paintings between 2010 and 2014.

In 2012, Bayramov spent six months in Canada where he created a well-known series of landscape paintings titled ''Canadian Autumn''. In 2014, Bayramov’s paintings were displayed in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, marking the first exhibition of his work in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Samuel. 2014, June 25.

In 2015, a solo exhibition of Durdy Bayramov’s works was held at the World Bank Art Program in Washington, DC, with the support of the Embassy of Turkmenistan in the US. The opening of this exhibition coincided with celebrations of the 24th anniversary of Independence and the 20th anniversary of the Neutrality of Turkmenistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.tm/en/neutral-en/3758-the-festive-reception-in-washington-on-the-occasion-of-independence-day-and-the-20th-anniversary-of-turkmenistan-s-neutrality |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303230844/http://www.mfa.gov.tm/en/neutral-en/3758-the-festive-reception-in-washington-on-the-occasion-of-independence-day-and-the-20th-anniversary-of-turkmenistan-s-neutrality |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }} (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkmenistan)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic style ==
Durdy Bayramov created more than 5,000 artworks during his prolific career, including [[oil paintings]] and works on paper. He was also a passionate photographer, though he considered this activity a part of his artistic process and never attempted to exhibit his photographs. For this reason his considerable photographic work would not be exhibited until after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bayramova Keyik, Robert Pontsioen, and Jeren Balayeva. 2015.

Toronto, ON: Durdy Bayramov Art Foundation; and Washington, DC: Asian Cultural History Program, Smithsonian Institution. {{ISBN|978-0-9939443-1-4}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayramov worked extensively across four genres: [[portraits]], [[still lifes]], [[Landscape painting|landscapes]], and [[genre painting|thematic compositions]], though he has long been best known for his portraits. As early as 1975, it was noted that “although he paints genre pictures and landscapes, one could say that portraiture claims his special attention.” &lt;ref&gt;Yerlashova, S. 1975. ''Painting of Soviet Turkmenia.'' Leningrad (St. Petersburg): Aurora Art Publishers, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his contemporaries, he was considered to be the “unsurpassed master of the portrait genre.”&lt;ref&gt;Glazunova, T. 2007, December. “Kumiry i Poklonniki.” (Кумиры и Поклонники) [Idols and Admirers]. Neytralniy Turkmenistan, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayramov penetrated deep into the character and inner life of his subjects to reflect their diverse personalities on canvas, while emphasizing their best qualities. Bayramov said he did this by “always looking for that special spark that exists within each person.” &lt;ref&gt;Zenko, Walter. 2012. ''Bayramov Paints East to West &amp; West to East.'' [Interview with Durdy Bayramov]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlX5L9ddZPc&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to harmonize the contextual discoveries of [[Impressionism]], the attention to detail of [[Classical Realism]], and Turkmenistan’s rich artistic traditions. Bayramov found inspiration in people from all walks of life, regardless of their social, economic, or ethnic background. His subjects include a wide variety of individuals, from villagers to scientists, strangers to family members, children to seniors. Bayramov’s empathetic nature and close rapport with his subjects helps to explain his success in this genre.

Although Bayramov is best known for his [[portraiture]], his work in the [[still life]] and [[landscape]] genres is also highly respected. Flowers held a special place in Bayramov’s still life works. He was particularly passionate about painting the rich colours and textures of the red poppies that carpet the foothills of Turkmenistan every spring. The depiction of fruit in Bayramov’s still lifes symbolizes the abundance of nature and his love for his native land’s fruit in particular. He often depicted apples, melons, pomegranates, etc. arranged on traditional [[Turkmen rug|Turkmen carpets]], which feature ''göl'' woven motifs and vibrant colours, and on Turkmen ornamental felts called {{Interlanguage link multi|''keche''|ru|3= Кошма}}.

'''''El Ministerio del Tiempo''''', or '''''The Ministry of Time''''', is a Spanish [[fantasy]] [[television series]] created by Javier and [[Pablo Olivares]] and produced by Onza Partners and Cliffhanger for [[Televisión Española]]. It premiered on 24 February 2015 on TVE's main channel [[La 1 (Spain)|La 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='El Ministerio del Tiempo' se estrena el martes 24 de febrero contra 'Bajo sospecha'|url=http://www.formulatv.com/noticias/44070/el-ministerio-del-tiempo-estrena-martes-24-febrero-bajo-sospecha/|website=FormulaTV|accessdate=15 March 2015|language=Spanish|date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series follows the exploits of a patrol of the fictional Ministry of Time, which deals with incidents caused by [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]].

On 24 March 2015, it was confirmed that TVE had renewed the series for a second season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pimentel|first1=Aurelio|title=TVE renueva 'El Ministerio del Tiempo'|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20150324/tve-renueva-serie-ministerio-del-tiempo/1121644.shtml|accessdate=24 March 2015|language=Spanish|date=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was renewed for a third season on 22 September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pimentel|first1=Aurelio|title='El Ministerio del Tiempo' tendrá tercera temporada|url=http://www.rtve.es/television/20160922/ministerio-del-tiempo-tendra-tercera-temporada/1407524.shtml|website=RTVE|accessdate=23 September 2016|language=Spanish|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December 2016 it was announced that [[RTVE]] had sold the rights to [[Netflix]] to broadcast the third series internationally, outside of Spain, resulting in a bigger production budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=29 December 2016|title= ‘El Ministerio del Tiempo’ viaja por el mundo con Netflix|trans-title= ‘El Ministerio del Tiempo’ travels the world with Netflix|url=http://cultura.elpais.com/cultura/2016/12/29/television/1483026595_984846.html |language=Spanish |newspaper=[[El País]] |location= Madrid|access-date=18 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was not renewed for a fourth season, as announced by Javier Olivares at the Fun &amp; Serious festival in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;La Prensa, 13 February 2018, "El Ministerio del Tiempo: ¿por qué no tendrá temporada 4?"  https://laprensa.peru.com/espectaculos/noticia-ministerio-tiempo-que-no-tendra-temporada-4-netflix-video-fotos-77372&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:Seuministerio.JPG|thumb|right|The front door of the abandoned Palace of the Duchess of Sueca in [[Madrid]], featured in the series as the façade of the headquarters of the Ministry.]]
The Ministry of Time is the best kept secret of the state of Spain: an autonomous government institution that reports directly to the [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. Its patrols have to watch the [[Time travel|doors of time]] so that no intruder from other eras can [[Alternate history|change history]] for their own benefit.

The series follows the assignments of the Ministry's newest patrol: the one formed by [[Army of Flanders]] soldier Alonso de Entrerríos, 19th century student Amelia Folch and 21st century [[S.A.M.U.R.|Samur]] paramedic Julián Martínez.

==Cast and characters==
===Main===
* [[Rodolfo Sancho]] as Julián Martínez, one of three members of the protagonist patrol. He is a trained [[S.A.M.U.R.|SAMUR]] paramedic from 21st century Madrid. Present as a member of the patrol through season 1 and second half of season 2. Sancho left the series at the end of the second season after failing to reach an agreement with the  show producers.&lt;ref name=Sancho&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=13 December 2016 |title=Por qué no vamos a echar de menos a Rodolfo Sancho en "El Ministerio del Tiempo" |trans-title=Why we will not miss Rodolfo Sancho in ''The Ministry of Time'' |url= http://www.abc.es/play/series/noticias/abci-no-vamos-echar-menos-rodolfo-sancho-ministerio-tiempo-201612122349_noticia.html|language= Spanish|newspaper=ABC |location=Madrid |access-date=15 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His absence during the first half of season 2 was due to his shooting for ''[[Mar de plástico]]''.&lt;ref name=Sancho/&gt;
* [[Aura Garrido]] as Amelia Folch, the leader of the protagonist patrol. She is a late 19th century pioneering university student and an only child from an upper-class [[Barcelona]] family, still living with her parents. Garrido left the series halfway through the third season citing scheduling conflicts after she, like Sancho, signed on to other projects due to renewal uncertainty. She left on good terms and is open to returning in the future.
* Nacho Fresneda as Alonso de Entrerríos, one of three members of the protagonist patrol. A highly experienced 16th-century soldier from [[Seville]], he is portrayed as an expert in fields of combat. Recruited just prior to being executed, he lives in the 21st century.
* [[Cayetana Guillén Cuervo]] as Irene Larra Girón, Head of Logistics inside the Ministry. A lesbian from the repressed 1960s, her character is used to express a less rigid viewpoint within the Ministry.
* Juan Gea as Ernesto Jiménez, Chief Operating Officer inside the Ministry. Recruited from the 15th century, he is fiercely incorruptible and a perfectionist.
* [[Jaime Blanch]] as Undersecretary Salvador Martí, Head of the Ministry. His (and the Ministry's) overriding priority is to protect and repair history.
* Francesca Piñón as Angustias Vázquez, personal secretary to Salvador and a widow.
* [[Hugo Silva (actor)|Hugo Silva]] as Jesús Méndez Pontón, AKA "Pacino", a replacement member for Julián in the second and third seasons. He is a handsome police officer from 1981 Madrid, nicknamed "Pacino" due to a resemblance with actor [[Al Pacino]], whom he admires.
* [[Macarena García]] as (young) Lola Mendieta, the younger self of a former Ministry agent believed to have been KIA. After being recruited to the Ministry, she eventually joins the protagonist patrol. She is the first and only agent to ever be recruited twice. García joins the principal cast in the third season.

===Recurring characters===
* Lola Mendieta ([[Natalia Millán]]): A former agent of the Ministry who was believed to have died on a mission. She has provided information about clandestine doors of time to a number of people.
* [[Diego Velázquez]] (Julián Villagrán): One of the most important painters in Spanish history, known for ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]'', who was recruited by the Ministry as a [[facial composite]] draftsman.
* Enric Folch (Xavier Boada) and Carme ([[Fanny Gautier]]): Amelia's parents. While he appears more tolerant about his daughter's concerns, she presses her to marry and settle down.
* Blanca (Susana Córdoba): Alonso's wife, who believes him to be dead since she does not know his [[death penalty|execution]] was avoided by the Ministry.
* Elena Castillo (Susana Córdoba): Alonso's love interest in the present day and Blanca's doppelgänger.
* Susana Torres ([[Mar Saura]]): The [[Liaison officer|liaison]] of the Ministry with the Prime Minister. Her visits usually mean bad news for Salvador.
* Lucía ([[Luisa Gavasa]]): Appears in the 3rd season claiming to be Lola Mendieta's daughter.
* [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]] (Ramón Langa): One of the main generals of the Spanish Army during the 17th century, most notable for the [[Siege of Breda (1624)|siege of Breda]]. He works for the Ministry, and admits he made the mistake of reading about his fate in the books.
* [[Enriqueta Martí]] (María Rodríguez): A serial murderer who worked as Amelia's maid for a short time.
* Marisa (Nieve de Medina): An old love interest of Ernesto's who has returned to work in the Ministry.
* Armando Leiva (José Antonio Lobato): A former agent who rebelled against the Ministry when Salvador refused to allow him to bring his 10-year-old son, diagnosed with [[leukemia]], to the present so that doctors from the 21st century could tend to him.
* Maite (Mar Ulldemolins): Julián's late wife, whom he visits by way of the doors of time.
* Paul Walcott (Jimmy Shaw): An [[United States|American]] time traveller who worked for mysterious corporation Darrow Ltd.

| ShortSummary    = The essential objective of the Ministry is to prevent anyone from using the time portals to change the present from the past ... But that goal becomes essential when that someone who wants to change history is nothing less than the Nazi regime. [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], informed of the existence of a door in the [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|Monastery of Montserrat]], travels there to make use of it, taking advantage of the [[meeting at Hendaye]] between [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. The Nazi aim is no longer to dominate the world, but to rewrite history. By travelling to Montserrat, Amelia, Julián and Alonso are tasked with avoiding this, whilst Ernesto and Irene go to Hendaye, where Hitler and Franco negotiate the participation of Spain in the second world war. Something that should be avoided at all costs.

The lawyer of the Rabbi's family has found documents that prove the queen did nothing to protect him and demands a lofty compensation to the Ministry in exchange of his silence. Against the rules of the Ministry, Julián, Amelia and Alonso are sent to 1491 to save Levi, but the door to that year is in a [[time loop]] and they only have one day to accomplish their mission.

With the very existence of the Ministry at stake, Ernesto, Amelia and Alonso are sent to foil Leiva's plans, but when they are captured, they depend on Irene, under suspicion for Leiva's escape, and Julián, who is enjoying his wife's company.

But they soon discover it all happens to be a ruse planned by someone who knows very well the Ministry... and themselves, since they begin to receive photos of their lives in the past and the future. And it is then when the patrol begins to wonder: why save the central figures of Spanish History if they are not allowed to save their loved ones?

According to the history, the intervention of the abbess convinced Napoleon to pardon the life of the three men. But the Ministry has been warned that the abbess died before what history says. The death of these three men would not be so important, if it was not because one of them is an ancestor of [[Adolfo Suárez]], [[President of the Government of Spain]] during [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition]]. If the history changes and Napoleon executes them, Adolfo Suárez will not be born. The thing is they need to search someone that can act as the abbess... And the chosen one is Angustias, the secretary.

The '''electronic tongue''' is an instrument that measures and compares [[taste]]s.

[[Chemical compound]]s responsible for taste are detected by human [[taste receptor]]s, and the seven sensors of electronic instruments detect the same dissolved [[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic compound]]s. Like human receptors, each sensor has a spectrum of reactions different from the other. The information given by each sensor is complementary and the combination of all sensors' results generates a unique fingerprint. Most of the [[detection threshold]]s of sensors are similar to or better than those of human receptors.

In the biological mechanism, taste signals are transducted by nerves in the brain into electric signals. E-tongue sensors process is similar: they generate electric signals as [[potentiometric]] variations.

Taste quality perception and recognition is based on building or recognition of activated [[Sensory neuron|sensory nerve]] patterns by the brain and on the taste fingerprint of the product. This step is achieved by the e-tongue’s [[Statistical package|statistical software]] which interprets the sensor data into taste patterns.

One variation was developed by Professor Fredrik Winquist of Linköping University, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fredrik Winquist|url = http://www.ifm.liu.se/applphys/biosensors-and-bioelectro/group-members/fredrik-winquist/|website = www.ifm.liu.se|accessdate = 2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Operation ==
Liquid samples are directly analyzed without any preparation, whereas solids require a preliminary dissolution before measurement. [[Reference electrode]] and sensors are dipped in a beaker containing a test solution. A voltage is applied between each sensor and a reference electrode, and a measurable current response results that is consistent with the [[Cottrell equation]].  This current response is a result of oxidizing reactions that take place in the solution due to the voltage difference, and can be amplified through catalytic surface treatments. The response is measured and recorded by the e-tongue's software. These data represent the input for mathematical treatment that will deliver results.

==Applications==
Electronic tongues have several applications in various industrial areas: the [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical industry]], food and beverage sector, etc.
It can be used to:
* analyze flavor ageing in beverages (for instance [[Juice|fruit juice]], alcoholic or non [[Alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]], flavored milks…)
* quantify bitterness or “spicy level” of drinks or dissolved compounds (e.g. bitterness measurement and prediction of teas)
* quantify taste masking efficiency of formulations (tablets, syrups, powders, capsules, lozenges…)
* analyze medicines stability in terms of taste
* benchmark target products
* monitor environmental parameters
* monitor biological and biochemical processes

==Artificial taste==
The electronic tongue uses taste sensors to receive information from chemicals on the tongue and send it to a [[pattern recognition]] system. The result is the detection of the tastes that compose the human palate. The types of taste that is generated is divided into five categories sourness, saltiness, bitterness, [[sweetness]], and [[umami]] (savoriness). Sourness, which includes [[hydrogen chloride]], [[acetic acid]], and [[citric acid]], is created by [[Hydronium|hydrogen ions]]. Saltiness is registered as [[sodium chloride]], sweetness by [[sugar]]s, bitterness, which includes chemicals such as [[quinine]] and [[caffeine]] is detected through [[magnesium chloride]],and umami by [[monosodium glutamate]] from seaweed, or [[disodium guanylate]] in meat/fish/mushrooms.

The '''Foundation for the Community of Artists''' was founded in 1971 as a support organization for working artists. By 1988 its membership had grown to nearly 6,000, including artists, art workers and representatives of art organizations. Although the majority lived in the New York metropolitan area, there were members located throughout the nation (there was at least one who lived in England). It remained active through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;FCA archives, NY, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

FCA grew out of the National Art Workers Community (a splinter group of the [[Art Workers Coalition|Art Workers' Coalition]]). From its inception, the organization strove to overcome problems fundamental to the lives of artists. Its initial service was a four-issue-per-year publication, the ''Art Workers Newsletter'', which functioned as an open forum for the exchange of ideas and the dissemination of news items important to the trade. Its name later became ''[[Art Workers News and Art &amp; Artists|Art Workers News]]'' and, in the early 1980s, its scope was broadened and it became the bi-monthly publication, ''[[Art Workers News and Art &amp; Artists|Art &amp; Artists]]''. Over the years, articles by leading artists, critics and educators, as well as information relating to health hazards,&lt;ref&gt;Art ''Workers News/Art &amp; Artists,'' libraries worldwide, http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=art+workers+news&amp;qt=results_page&lt;/ref&gt; legal and financial affairs, housing employment and exhibition spaces, appeared in its pages.

== Mission, Services, Accomplishments ==

The Foundation sought to respond to artist needs of the time. Programs included a five-day-a-week hotline to help artists with housing problems in the downtown Manhattan loft community; sponsorship of part of the [[CETA Artists Project (NYC Cultural Council Foundation 1978-80)|CETA Artists Project]] in the late 1970s; Artwork, a job referral and placement agency; and two programs dealing with sexual and racial discrimination.

It offered its members a choice of several group health insurance programs, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield hospitalization/major medical coverage, and a health maintenance/hospitalization plan (HMO) through Healthways, Inc.

In addition to ''Art &amp; Artists'', FCA published a bi-monthly, eight-page newsletter, ''Artist Update'', which listed grants, competitions, resources and other opportunities, and books of particular concern to the working artist, such as the original editions of Dr. Michael McCann’s ''[http://www.lyonspress.com/book/9781599213187 Health Hazards Manual for Artists]'' and Caryn Leland’s ''[https://www.amazon.com/art-law-primer-Caryn-Leland/dp/093303203X The Art Law Primer]''.

The Foundation participated in a national consortium of arts groups that focused on issues of living and working space for artists. Computerized lists of available space were kept up to date for the cities of Minneapolis, MN; Washington, DC; Oakland and Berkeley, CA; and New York City.

FCA regularly ran seminars and workshops covering such issues as marketing and publicity, the gallery system, copyright and tax law, art research libraries, “hotline” phone numbers and bulletin boards, art material suppliers, consultants, etc. The organization also helped artists prepare resumes, apply for grants and work out project budgets.

Through the Foundation, members could join the first nationwide credit union for artists of all disciplines. The [http://www.as-ap.org/content/foundation-community-artists Artists’ Community Federal Credit Union], as it was called, offered savings accounts, automatic payment of health insurance premiums, financial counseling and personal loans from $100 to $5,000. Members were also eligible to apply for a Working Assets VISA, a “socially responsible” credit card.

Besides these services, the Foundation for the Community of Artists served as an artists' advocacy group. It took an aggressive stand on issues such as resale royalties legislation, the labeling of art materials, artists’ living and working space, and discrimination against minority and women artists. It provided public testimony, studies, publications and press reports through the New York Arts Coalition and the Alliance of New York State Art Councils. In early 1984, FCA helped initiate the cultural campaign Art Against Apartheid, which advocated for the freedom of South Africa. It provided office space and organizational support for AAA's local and national exhibitions and performances. Some of these efforts were documented in ''Ikon'' magazine’s ''Art Against Apartheid: Works for Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://archives.worldlit.org/ikon-pdfs/IKON-5-6.pdf World Literature Today]'', University of Oklahoma, Norman, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==

FCA received funding from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and the Manhattan Borough President's Office, via the [[New York City Department of Cultural Affairs]]. Membership fees, newspaper subscriptions, the sale of other publications, and the administration of the health plans also generated income. The work of many volunteers along with individual and corporate donations helped keep the organization operational.

== Structure ==

The Foundation's general policies and mode of operation were determined by its fifteen-member, self-sustaining board, elected once a year, composed primarily of artists. There was a salaried Executive Director, who was responsible for administration of the policies of the board and the daily operation of the organization. There was also an advisory council with ten members, which included artists and specialists in areas of expertise appropriate to the Foundation's concerns.

'''''Frog Baby'' Fountain''' is a statue set in the middle of a fountain on the [[Ball State University]] campus. It is known as a sign of good luck and is a popular meeting place. The ''Frog Baby'' statue was cast by [[Edith Barretto Stevens Parsons]] in 1937 and has been moved several times prior to becoming what it is known as today. [[Ball Brothers#Frank C. Ball|Frank C. Ball]] donated the statue to the university and it remained in the [[Ball State University Museum of Art]] until it became damaged by excessive rubbing by students, and was then packed away. In 1993, ''Frog Baby'' was restored and placed in a fountain where it resides today. The fountain is dedicated to Alexander Bracken, the son-in-law of Frank C. Ball, who was responsible for Ball State's rapid growth after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsu.edu/map/bldngs/frog/ ''Frog Baby, Ball State University.'' (Ball State University Website)],  Retrieved April 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Frog Baby'' statue, created by American sculptor Edith Barretto Stevens Parson, resides in a central location on the campus of Ball State University and is a well-known part of the university's rich traditions. The statue depicts a young girl who is brightly smiling at the sky while holding one frog in each of her hands. In the surroundings is a fountain of water with small frogs resting on the edges as they spout out water. The statue commemorates Alexander M. Bracken, who served on the Ball State Board of Trustees for 22 years and is also the son-in-law of Frank C.Ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mensching|first=Liz|title="Frog Baby" vandalized by bikini drawing|url=http://www.bsudailynews.com/2.14295/frog-baby-vandalized-by-bikini-drawing-1.2003411|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the statue did not always reside in the pond outside [[Bracken Library]]. It used to rest in the [[David Owsley Museum of Art Ball State University|University’s Museum of Art]]. ''Frog Baby'' was first donated by Frank C. Ball, one of the famous [[Ball Brothers]], during the early years of the university. Many legends and traditions are hidden around the campus of Ball State, and it was once said that if one would rub the nose of the statue, it would serve as good luck. As the rumor spread, students year by year began rubbing  ''Frog Baby''{{'}}s nose for good luck on their exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frog Baby|url=http://www.bsu.edu/map/bldngs/frog/|publisher=Ball State University|accessdate=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, the statue's nose was worn away, and in 1993, the statue was sent over seas to be restored by Rundell Ernstberger Associates as the designer and Oberle Construction as the contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smithsonian American Art Museum|title=Art Inventories Catalog|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=135240325W3MP.912&amp;profile=ariall&amp;page=2&amp;group=0&amp;term=Parsons%2C+Edith+Barretto%2C+1878-1956%2C+sculptor.&amp;index=AUTHOR%7C&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;1352403255644|publisher=Smithsonian Research Information System|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the statue resides in a fountain close to the university's library for safekeeping.
Students no longer rub the statue's nose for good luck, but they have started a new ''Frog Baby'' tradition. Now, students will dress her up based on the changing seasons.  During the winter months in particular, it is frequently seen sporting scarves and knit hats to keep her warm. To take further precautions from damage, security cameras have been installed around the fountain. Although these security cameras are not meant to be discreet, mishaps occur every now and then. In 2009, the statue was vandalized with chalk. The drawer drew a pink bikini on the statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prater|first=Nancy|title=Suspects to be charged in Frog Baby vandalism. theft|url=http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0,1370,-1019-1088,00.html|accessdate=6 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605024017/http://www.bsu.edu/news/article/0,1370,-1019-1088,00.html|archive-date=2010-06-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall of 2012 ''Frog Baby'' was vandalized again when a student sprayed painted her metallic gold.  The university removed the statue to be cleaned and restored. ''Frog Baby'' was returned to her pond in the spring of 2013 just in time for graduation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballstatedaily.com/article/2013/02/frog-baby-to-cost-more-than-3000-to-repair&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, four people attempted to steal ''Frog Baby''. While the statue itself was not stolen, the thieves caused approximately $10,000 in damages to the exhibit and four of the surrounding frogs were taken from the fountain. Fortunately all four of the missing frogs were found and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickey|first=Kelly|title=Frog Baby removed from fountain to be inspected|url=http://www.bsudailynews.com/frog-baby-removed-from-fountain-to-be-inspected-1.2601177|accessdate=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edith Barretto Stevens Parsons was an American born artist.  She was born in [[Houston, Virginia]] on July 4, 1878.  She studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]] with [[John Twachtman]], [[Daniel Chester French]], and George Bernard and won scholarships and prizes for her sculptures.  Her sculptures are representations of her children often holding turtles, ducks, frogs, and other animals.  Edith Parson's sculptures can be found in Memphis Public Park, Tennessee; the Cleveland Museum, Ohio; Ball State University, Indiana and many other places.  Edith Baretto Stevens Parsons died in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antiques &amp; Fine Art - Edith Barretto Stevens Parsons - Biography|url=http://www.antiquesandfineart.com/artists/bio.cfm?id=171692|publisher=DeRu's Fine Arts|accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Replicas==
A common misconception is that the ''Frog Baby'' statue at Ball State was made specifically for the university and that it is the only copy that exists. However, another copy of the ''Frog Baby'' sculpture resides in [[Brookgreen Gardens]] in [[South Carolina]] as part of the Gallery of Small Sculptures.
It was one of 350 sculptures that was acquired by [[Archer Milton Huntington]] and his wife [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]] for the gardens.  ''Frog Baby'' was placed in a pool in the gallery in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salmon|first=Robin R.|title=Sculpture of Brookgreen Gardens|year=2009|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston SC, Chicago IL, Portsmouth NH, San Francisco CA|isbn=978-0-7385-6656-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TSnn1u6qmekC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;q=Frog%20Baby}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another copy that is on loan to the [[Atlanta Botanical Garden]] from The [[High Museum of Art]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

'''Kurgan stelae''' ([[Mongolian language|Mongolian]]: {{lang|mn|хүн чулуу}}; [[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|каменные бабы}}; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: {{lang|uk|Баби кам'яні}} "stone [[:wikt:баба|babas]]"; {{lang-ky|балбал}} {{IPA-ky|bɑlbɑl|}})  or '''Balbals''' ({{lang|uk|балбал}} ''balbal'', most probably from a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''{{lang|tr|balbal}}'' meaning "ancestor" or "grandfather"&lt;ref&gt;O. D. Forostyuk, Луганщина релігійна, Lugansk, Світлиця, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or the Mongolic word "barimal" which means "handmade statue") are [[anthropomorphic]] stone [[stela]]e, images cut from stone, installed atop, within or around [[kurgan]]s (i.e. [[tumuli]]), in kurgan cemeteries, or in a double line extending from a kurgan. The stelae are also described as "obelisks" or "[[statue menhir|statue]] [[menhir]]s".

Spanning more than three millennia, they are clearly the product of various cultures. The earliest are associated with the [[Pit Grave culture]] of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]] (and therefore with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] according to the mainstream [[Kurgan hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;David W. Anthony, ''[[The Horse, The Wheel and Language|The Horse, The Wheel and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World]]'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Iron Age]] specimens are identified with the [[Scythians]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] examples with [[Turkic peoples]].

Such stelae are found in large numbers in [[Southern Federal District|Southern Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Prussia]], southern [[Siberia]], [[Central Asia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Mongolia]].

==Purpose==

Anthropomorphic stelae were probably memorials to the honoured dead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vasily Radlov|W.Radloff]]: "stone obelisk in honour of deceased." [[Leonid Kyzlasov]]: "a vertically anchored stone near a memorial structure, symbolizing a killed enemy" (Kyzlasov, 1966, 207, 208) (cited after Shipova E.N., 'Dictionary of Turkisms In Russian', p. 55).&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in the context of burials and funeral sanctuaries from the [[Eneolithic]] through to the [[Middle Ages]]. Ivanovovsky reported that Tarbagatai Torgouts ([[Kalmyks]]) revered kurgan obelisks in their country as images of their ancestors, and that when a bowl was held by the statue, it was to deposit a part of the ashes after the [[cremation]] of the deceased, and another part was laid under the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Ivanovovsky, ''Congres internationale d'Archeologie prehistorique'', (Moscow, 1892), vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

When used architecturally, stelae could act as a system of stone fences, frequently surrounded by a moat, with [[sacrifice|sacrificial]] hearths, sometimes tiled on the inside.

==History and distribution==
[[File:Anthropomorphic stele no 25, Sion, Petit-Chasseur necropolis 13.jpg|thumb|225px|Stele #25 from the [[Petit Chasseur]] in [[Sion, Switzerland]], dating from 2700&amp;ndash;2150&amp;nbsp;BC]]
The earliest anthropomorphic stelae date to the [[4th millennium BC]], and are associated with the early [[Bronze Age]] [[Yamna culture|Yamna]] Horizon, in particular with the [[Kemi Oba culture]] of the Crimea and adjacent steppe region.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory and D. Q. Adams, "Kemi Oba Culture", ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), pp. 327–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in Ukraine number around three hundred, most of them very crude stone slabs with a simple schematic protruding head and a few features such as eyes or breasts carved into the stone. Some twenty specimens, known as [[statue menhir]]s, are more complex, featuring ornaments, weapons, human or animal figures.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Mallory and D. Q. Adams, "Kemi Oba Culture", ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture'', (Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997), pp. 544–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple, early type of anthropomorphic stelae are also found in the Alpine region of Italy, southern France and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harrison and Volker Heyd, The Transformation of Europe in the Third Millennium BC: the example of ‘Le Petit-Chasseur I + III’ (Sion, Valais, Switzerland), ''Praehistorische Zeitschrift'', vol. 82, no. 2 (2007), pp. 129–214; John Robb, People of stone: stelae, personhood and society in prehistoric Europe, ''Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory'', vol. 16, no. 3 (September 2009), pp. 162–183.[http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/35317769/Robb_JAMT_figurine_article.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1482257275&amp;Signature=oTS%2BIUeRw1W6CvZaEmLbrdm7sVM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DPersons_of_stone_stelae_personhood_and_s.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples have also been found in [[Bulgaria]] at Plachidol, Ezerovo,&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Anthony, ''[[The Horse, the Wheel, and Language]]'' (2007), fig.13.11. (misprint "Yezevoro")&lt;/ref&gt; and Durankulak.&lt;ref&gt;Igor Manzura, The Proto-Bronze Ace cemetery at Durakukak: a look from the east, in Lolita Nikolova, John Fritz and Jude Higgins (eds.), ''Prehistoric Archaeology and Anthropological Theory and Education''. RPRP 6-7 (2005), p. 5155.[http://www.iianthropology.org/files/IgorDurankulak.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The example illustrated above was found at Hamangia-Baia, Romania.

The distribution of later stelae is limited in the west by the Odessa district, Podolsk province, Galicia, Kalisz province, Prussia; in the south by [[Kacha River]], Crimea; in the south-east by [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]] in the Stavropol province and Kuban region; in the north by [[Minsk Voblast|Minsk province]] and Oboyan district of the [[Kursk Oblast|Kursk province]] (in some opinions even the Ryazan province), Ahtyr district in the [[Kharkiv Oblast|Kharkov province]], [[Voronezh Oblast|Voronezh province]], Balash and Atkar districts in the [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov province]] to the banks of [[Samara River]] in Buzuluk districts in the [[Samara Oblast|Samara province]], in the east they are spread in the [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz]] ([[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]]) steppe to the banks of the [[Irtysh River]] and to Turkestan (near [[Issyk Kul]], Tokmak district), then in upper courses of rivers [[Tom River|Tom]] and [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], in Sagai steppe in Mongolia (according to Potanin and Yadrintseva).

The [[Cimmerian]]s of the early 1st millennium BC left a small number (about ten are known) of distinctive stone stelae. Another four or five "[[deer stone]]s" dating to the same time are known from the northern Caucasus.

From the 7th century BC, [[Scythian]] tribes began to dominate the Pontic steppe. They were in turn displaced by the [[Sarmatian]]s from the 2nd century BC, except in [[Crimea]], where they persisted for a few centuries longer. These peoples left carefully crafted stone stelae, with all features cut in [[relief|deep relief]].

Early [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] stelae are again more primitive. There are some thirty sites of the middle [[Dniestr]] region where such anthropomorphic figures were found. The most famous of these is the [[Zbruch Idol]] (c. 10th century), a post measuring about 3&amp;nbsp;meters, with four faces under a single pointed hat (c.f. [[Svetovid]]). [[Boris Rybakov]] argued for identification of the faces with the gods [[Perun]], [[Makosh]], [[Lado (deity)|Lado]] and [[Veles (god)|Veles]].

==Anthropomorphic stelae of the Near East==

Bronze Age anthropomorphic funerary stelae have been found in Saudi Arabia. There are similarities to the Kurgan type in the handling of the slab-like body with incised detail, though the treatment of the head is rather more realistic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/llv/exposition/detail_exposition.jsp;jsessionid=NTGv5RRCf05W3fWwZ4XCbpWJ7yP6RpBxTrv6CdBGphqTL8G56nx0!-17078697?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;CURRENT_LLV_EXPO%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;pageId=2&amp;bmLocale=en Roads of Arabia – Archaeology and History of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615190022/http://www.louvre.fr/llv/exposition/detail_exposition.jsp;jsessionid=NTGv5RRCf05W3fWwZ4XCbpWJ7yP6RpBxTrv6CdBGphqTL8G56nx0!-17078697?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;CURRENT_LLV_EXPO%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198674147510&amp;pageId=2&amp;bmLocale=en |date=2011-06-15 }};[http://www.arabian-archaeology.com/arch4bronze.htm Arabian Archaeology: Bronze Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropomorphic stelae so far found in Anatolia appear to post-date those of the [[Kemi Oba culture]] on the steppe and are presumed to derive from steppe types. A fragment of one was found in the earliest layer of deposition at [[Troy]], known as Troy I.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Anthony,'' The Horse, The Wheel and Language'' (2007), p. 339 and fig. 13.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirteen stone stelae, of a type similar to those of the Eurasian steppes, were found in 1998 in their original location at the centre of [[Hakkâri]], a city in the south eastern corner of Turkey, and are now on display in the Van Museum. The stelae were carved on upright flagstone-like slabs measuring between 0.7&amp;nbsp;m to 3.10&amp;nbsp;m in height. The stones contain only one cut surface, upon which human figures have been chiseled. The theme of each stele reveals the fore view of an upper human body. Eleven of the stelae depict naked warriors with daggers, spears, and axes-masculine symbols of war. They always hold a drinking vessel made of skin in both hands. Two stelae contain female figures without arms. The earliest of these stelae are in the style of bas relief while the latest ones are in a linear style. They date from the 15th to the 11th century BC and may represent the rulers of the kingdom of [[Hubushkia]], perhaps derived from a Eurasian steppe culture that had infiltrated into the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0007/abstracts/stela.html Veli Sevin, Mystery Stelae, ''Archaeology'', Volume 53, Number 4, (July/August 2000)]; [[Antonio Sagona]], ''The Heritage of Eastern Turkey: from earliest settlements to Islam'' (2006), pp. 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recording==

European traveler [[William of Rubruck]] mentioned them for the first time in the 13th century, seeing them on kurgans in the Cuman ([[Kipchak people|Kipchak]]) country, he reported that Cumans installed these statues on tombs of their deceased. These statues are also mentioned in the 17th-century "Large Drawing Book", as markers for borders and roads, or orientation points. In the 18th century information about some kurgan stelae was collected by Pallas, Falk, Guldenshtedt, Zuev, Lepekhin, and in the first half of the 19th century by Klaprot, Duboa-de-Montpere and Spassky (''Siberian obelisks''). Count [[Aleksey Uvarov]], in the 1869 ‘‘Works of the 1st Archeological Congress in Moscow'' (vol. 2), assembled all available at that time data about kurgan obelisks, and illustrated them with drawings of 44 statues.

Later in the 19th century, data about these statues was gathered by A.I. Kelsiev, and in Siberia, [[Turkestan]] and Mongolia by Potanin, Pettsold, Poyarkov, [[Vasily Radlov]], Ivanov, Adrianov and Yadrintsev, in Prussia by Lissauer and Gartman.

==Numbers==
The [[State Historical Museum|Historical museum in Moscow]] has 30 specimens (in the halls and in the courtyard); others are in [[Kharkov]], [[Odessa]], [[Novocherkassk]], etc. These are only a small part of examples dispersed in various regions of Eastern Europe, of which multitudes were already destroyed and used as construction material for buildings, fences, etc.

In the 1850s Piskarev, summing all information about kurgan obelisks available in literature, counted 649 items, mostly in [[Dnipro|Ekaterinoslav]] [[Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|province]] (428), in [[Taganrog]] (54), in [[Crimea]] province (44), in [[Kharkov]] (43), in the [[Don Cossacks]] land (37), in [[Yenisei]] province, Siberia (12), in [[Poltava]] (5), in [[Stavropol]] (5), etc.; but many statues remained unknown to him.

==Appearance==
[[File:Scythian stelae 01.jpg|thumb|Collection of drawings of Scythian stelae of the 6th to 5th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;redrawn from [[Boris Rybakov|B. A. Rybakov]],  Язычество древней Руси ("Paganism of Ancient Rus", 1987, fig. 7).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Baba 15.jpg|thumb|right|Kurgan stele (baba) near [[Luhansk]]]]
Scythian balbals, later [[Cumans|Kuman]], commonly depict a warrior holding a [[drinking horn]] in their upraised right hand.&lt;ref&gt;40 out of a total of 137 anthropomorphic stelae described by Ol'chovskij and Evdokimov (1994:67,69 table 14) include the depiction of a drinking horn.&lt;/ref&gt;
Many also show a sword or dagger suspended on the warrior's belt.

Writing about Altai kurgans, [[Lev Gumilev|L.N. Gumilev]] states: "To the east from the tombs are standing chains of balbals, crudely sculpted stones implanted in the ground. Number of balbals at the tombs I investigated varies from 0 to 51, but most often there are 3–4 balbals per tomb". Similar numbers are also given by L. R. Kyzlasov.&lt;ref name = "Kyzlasov"&gt;Kyzlasov L.R. Tuva... p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; They are memorials to the feats of the deceased, every balbal represents an enemy killed by him. Many tombs have no balbals. Apparently, there are buried ashes of women and children.

Balbals have two clearly distinct forms: conic and flat, with shaved top. Considering the evidence of [[Orkhon inscriptions]] that every balbal represented a certain person, such distinction cannot be by chance. Likely here is marked an important ethnographic attribute, a headdress. The steppe-dwellers up until present wear a conic 'malahai', and the Altaians wear flat round hats. The same forms of headdresses are recorded for the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;(Gumilev L.N. Statuettes...)." "We can note that fight against steppe was more successful, as from 486 balbals we investigated, 329 were conical, and 157 flat." "Sudden raids on the steppe pastures were more successfully than endless struggle with moutaineers, who knew each tree in the forest and each rock in the gorges. Maybe this is a reason why the flat-headed balbals, as a rule, are more massive than conical" [[Lev Gumilev|Gumilev L.N.]], ''"Ancient Türks"'', Moscow, 1993, p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;
Another observation of [[Lev Gumilev]]: "From the Tsaidam salt lakes to the Kül-tegin monument leads a three-kilometer chain of balbals. To our time survived 169 balbals, apparently there were more. Some balbals are given a crude likeness with men, indicated are hands, a hint of a belt. Along the moat toward the east runs a second chain of balbals, which gave I. Lisi a cause to suggest that they circled the fence wall of the monument. However, it is likely that it is another chain belonging to another deceased buried earlier".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Gumilev|Gumilev L.N.]], ''"Ancient Türks"'', Moscow, 1993, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Some kurgan [[obelisks]] are found still standing on kurgans, others were found buried in the slopes. Not always can be stated if they were contemporary with the kurgans on which they stand, existed earlier, or were carved later and lifted onto the kurgan. Kurgan obelisks are of [[sandstone]], [[limestone]], [[granite]], etc. Their height is from 3.5&amp;nbsp;m to 0.7&amp;nbsp;m, but more often 1.5–2&amp;nbsp;m. Some of them are simple stone columns, with a rough image of a human face, on others the head (with the narrowed neck) is clearly depicted; in most cases not only the head is depicted, but also body, arms, and frequently both legs, and [[Headgear|headdress]], and dress. On more crude statues is impossible to dissern sex, but mostly it is expressed clearly: men are with [[moustaches]] (sometimes with beard, one bearded kurgan obelisk is in the courtyard of the Historical Museum in [[Moscow]]), in a costume with metal [[breastplate]]s and [[Belt (clothing)|belts]], sometimes with a [[sword]], etc.; women are with bared breasts, wearing peculiar headdresses, with [[girdle]]s or [[necklace]]s on the neck, etc.

[[File:balbal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A balbal near [[Burana Tower]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]
[[File:Albanian stone idol which founded Boyahmadli village of Ağdam region.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stone stele found in Boyahmadli village of Ağdam region of Azerbaijan]]

Other obelisks show figures completely naked and usually only their head is covered, and legs are shod. Kurgan statues are sitting (frequently females), and standing (mostly males); in both cases the legs are not depicted. If the legs are depicted, they are either barefoot, or more often shoed, in high or low [[boots]] ('bashmaks'), sometimes with distinguishable [[trousers]] with ornaments. Many female kurgan obelisks (and some male) are naked above the belt, but below a belt and dress are visible, sometimes two dresses, one longer underneath, and another on the top, as a semi-'[[kaftan]]' or a short furcoat, with appliques and inserts (the ornaments of inserts consist of geometrical lines, double spirals, etc., or even [[cuirass]]). Others have stripes on the shoulders, many have two stripes (seldom three, or one wide across), plates (apparently, metal) on the breast attached to a belt or, more often, to two belts. On the belt sometimes is possible to distinguish a [[buckle]] in the middle or thongs hanging from it with sometimes attached bag, a round metal pocket [[mirror]], [[knife]], [[comb]], sometimes also is shown (male statues) a [[dagger]] or a straight sword, a [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], a ‘kolchan’ ([[quiver]]), a hook, an [[axe]]. On the neck the men wear a metal band, women wear a necklace of beads or scales, sometimes even 2 or 3 are visible, some have a wide tape or a [[Belt (clothing)|belt]] dropping from the [[necklace]], ending with a 4-corner cloth. On the hands, wrists and shoulders (especially for nude figures) are [[bracelet]]s (rings) and cuffs, in the ears, for women and men, are [[earrings]], on the head (forehead) sometimes is an ornamental bandage or a [[diadem]]. The female [[braid]]s can not always be distinguished from [[ribbon]]s or [[bandage]]s, they also are depicted for men. In some cases the male hat undoubtedly represents a small [[helmet]] (‘misyurka’), sometimes with crossing metal strips. The female [[headdress]] is more diverse, like a hat with curved brims, ‘bashlyk’, Kyrgyz (Kazakh) hat, etc.

The type of the [[face]] is not always depicted clearly. The vast majority of women join hands on the navel or at the bottom of the stomach, and hold a vessel, frequently cylindrical, like a cup or a glass. Sometimes it is so blurred that it can be taken for a folded [[scarf]]. One male figurine holds a [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]] in the left hand, and a sword in the right; and another has hands simply joined together, without a bowl, one female figurine holds a ring, some hold a [[rhyton]] (drinking horn).

The '''Lalit Kala Akademi''' or '''National Academy of Art''' is [[India]]'s [[national academy]] of [[fine arts]]. It is an autonomous organisation, established in [[New Delhi]] in 1954 by [[Government of India]] to promote and propagate understanding of [[Indian art]], in and outside the country.

LKA provides scholarships and a fellow program, and sponsors and organises exhibitions in India and overseas. It publishes a bilingual journal. It is funded by the Union [[Ministry of Culture (India)|Ministry of Culture]]. Its headquarters are at Ravindra Bhawan, Ferozshah Road, New Delhi. In April 2015, [[Government of India]] took over management control of Lalit Kala Akademi citing complaints regarding alleged administrative and financial irregularities in its functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/govt-takes-over-lalit-kala-akademi-s-management-115040601123_1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On May 17, 2018 Honorable President [[Ram Nath Kovind]] has appointed [[Uttam Pacharne]], an Artist, and sculptor as chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi. He is a member of the advisory committee, Kala Academy, Goa and member of advisory committee, P L Deshpande State Lalit Kala Academy and director, Janseva Sahakari Bank, Borivali, [[Mumbai]].

* In March, President Ram Nath Kovind appointed M.L. Srivastava, joint secretary (Academies) at the Ministry of Culture, as the pro-tem chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi.

* Since the current Government has taken over, former Chairman of Karnataka Lalit Kala Academy CS Krishna Setty, a well-known artist, and art critic is heading LKA as Administrator. He was charged with misappropriation of funds. So, in mid-2017, the ministry had instituted a three-member inquiry committee to probe some allegations of misuse of finances against Setty. Later, this order was withdrawn on August 16, 2017. The Delhi high court, which has been hearing a PIL alleging misappropriation of funds at the national arts body, had sought an explanation from the ministry on August 24, 2017, about it. However, the ministry hasn't replied. The next date of hearing of the case was May 8. So, the ministry finally decided to let Setty go in the first week of April 2018, after the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), in 2017, took note of repeated complaints, including missing artworks of the celebrated painter M.F. Husain from the Akademi. But in a reply to a newspaper, He said, "M.F. Husain’s work disappeared (from the Lalit Kala Akademi) long ago. It didn’t happen in my tenure and so I am not connected to it". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lalit Kala Akademi |url=https://thewire.in/the-arts/culture-ministry-raised-former-lalit-kala-akademi-heads-salary-days-before-sacking.html |publisher=[[The Wire]] |date=May 8, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== 2007-2010 ===
Initially started by Nafis Ahmed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NAFIS AHMED At the Root of Live Square|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/nafis-ahmed-at-the-root-of-live-square/|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he was a student in his sophomore year at [[Institute of Business Administration, University of Dhaka|IBA-DU]], LiveSquare became known with a series of lounge concerts under the banner of [[The Wireless Sessions]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Livesquare Experiences|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/livesquare-experiences/|website = The Daily Star|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring bands such as [[Arbovirus (band)|Arbovirus]], [[Shunno]], [[Artcell]], [[Cryptic Fate]] and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]], in a time when the lounge music scene in [[Dhaka]] was in its infancy.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite news |title=Return of The Wireless Sessions |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/01/wireless.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2016-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveSquare also organized and executed several one-off concerts during this time, including a fundraising concert for the victims of the hurricane [[Cyclone Sidr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amader Gaan &amp; ADTL Unplugged Concert 08'|url = http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2008/01/03/feature_concert.htm|website = archive.thedailystar.net|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; LiveSquare went on a year-long hiatus in 2010 following Ahmed's graduation and subsequent employment at a reputed marketing agency.

'''Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death''' (Polish: '''''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią''''', Latin: '''''De morte prologus, Dialogus inter Mortem et Magistrum Polikarpum''''') is a late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] dialog in verse, written probably in the early 15th century. Master Polikarp's Dialog with Death is now regarded as one of the most important examples of [[medieval poetry]] in the [[Polish language]]. The work is patterned after a 12th century [[Latin]] poem ''Dialogus mortis cum homine'', and other Latin language publications, popular in medieval Europe. Its author is unknown, but after discovering the complete, printed version from 1542 some [[historian]]s speculate that [[Mikołaj Rej]] has re-written the original text for print.

One of the unique features of the work is its use of [[humour]]. The dialog mocks monks and priests, inn-keepers, fat women, dishonest physicians and unjust judges.

== Versions ==

The original version of the [[dialogue]] has been lost; what remains is an incomplete copy from ca. 1463-1465, belonging to Mikołaj of Mirzyniec (Mikołaj z Mirzyńca). The ending of the work was known due to its 16th century [[Russian language|Russian]] [[translation]]. It has 498 lines, and presents everyday life scenes of members of different social classes of 15th century [[Poland]].

An unknown printed edition of ''Rozmowa Mistrza Polikarpa ze Śmiercią'' (''Master Polikarp’s Dialogue with Death'') from 1542 (Cracow, Maciej [[Scharffenberg family|Scharffenberg]]) has been discovered in one of the European university libraries.&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://instytutksiazki.pl/en/news,2,professor-wydra%E2%80%99s-great-discovery,1307.html | |title=Professor Wydra’s Great Discovery | publisher = The Polish Book Institute | date= July 3, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery was made by Professor Wiesław Wydra from the Institute of Polish Philology at [[Adam Mickiewicz University]] in [[Poznań]].&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; In the contrast to the previously known version of the dialogue from the Płock manuscript, this text has been preserved in its entirety.&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; This discovery, with a complete Polish text of 918 verses, makes it the biggest and the most important event in Polish language and literature scholarship for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/full-text-of-polish-literatures-oldest-masterpiece-found-1138 | title=Full text of Polish literature’s oldest masterpiece found | last=Nowacki | first = Aleksander | publisher = The first news | date= July 14, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical edition of the discovered text has been published by prof. Wiesław Wydra and became available on 7th November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://psp.amu.edu.pl/?type=news&amp;id_asset=1150 | title=Niezwykłe odkrycie | publisher = Wydawnictwo "Poznańskie Studia Polonistyczne" UAM | date=July 3, 2018 | access-date=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
* Master Polikarp – a well-educated person, 
* Death – pale, skinny, bald, yellowish, without nose and lips, showing its ribs, naked, a rotten kind of a woman. It holds a scepter in its hands, and its resemblance reminds the reader that life is short, and after death, human bodies decay.

The '''''Patrologia Orientalis''''' is an attempt to create a comprehensive collection of the writings by eastern [[Church Fathers]] in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], and [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]]. It is designed to complement the comprehensive, influential, and monumental [[Patrologia Latina|Latin]] and [[Patrologia Graeca|Greek patrologies]] published in the 19th century. It began in 1897 as the ''[[Patrologia]] Syriaca'',  was discontinued in its original form and replaced by the ''[[Patrologia]] Orientalis''. The collection began with those [[liturgical]] texts that touch on [[hagiography]]. Since then critical editions of the [[Bible]], theological works, [[homilies]] and letters have been published.

The edition is ongoing. Editors were René Graffin, (d. 1941); François Nau (d. 1931); [[Prince Maximilian of Saxony (1870–1951)|Max]], [[Prince]] of [[Saxony]] (d. 1951) and from 1951 François Graffin. Volume 1 was published in 1904, and 1984 saw the publication of volume 41.

The '''police procedural''', or '''police crime drama''', is a subgenre of [[detective fiction]] that emphasizes the investigative procedure of a [[police officer]] or department as the [[protagonist]](s), as contrasted with other genres that focus on a private investigator or amateur detective. Unlike traditional mysteries, which conceal the criminal's identity until the police solve the crime in the [[Climax (narrative)|narrative climax]] (the so-called [[whodunnit]]), police procedurals often reveal the perpetrator's identity to the audience early in the narrative, making it an [[inverted detective story]] or "howcatchem" {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Police procedurals attempt to accurately depict such police-related topics as [[forensic science]], [[autopsy|autopsies]], gathering [[Evidence (law)|evidence]], [[search warrant]]s, [[interrogation]] and adherence to legal restrictions and procedure.

==Early history==
The roots of the police procedural have been traced to at least the mid-1880's. [[Wilkie Collins]]'s novel ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), a tale of a [[Scotland Yard]] detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Wheat, Carolyn (2003) How to Write Killer Fiction: The Funhouse Of Mystery &amp; The Roller Coaster Of Suspense. Santa Barbara, PA: Perseverance Press, {{ISBN|1880284626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As detective fiction rose to worldwide popularity in the late 1800's and early 1900's, many of the pioneering and most popular characters, at least in the English-speaking world, were private investigators or amateurs. See [[C. Auguste Dupin]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Sam Spade]], [[Miss Marple]] and others. [[Hercule Poirot]] was described as a veteran of the Belgian police but as a protagonist he worked independently. Only after WW2 would police procedural fiction rival the popularity of PIs or amateur sleuths.

[[Lawrence Treat]]'s 1945 novel ''V as in Victim'' is often cited as the first police procedural, by [[Anthony Boucher]] (mystery critic for the ''[[New York Times]] Book Review'') among others. Another early example is [[Hillary Waugh]]'s ''[[Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)|Last Seen Wearing ...]]'', 1952.  Even earlier examples from the 20th Century, predating Treat, include the novels ''Vultures in the Dark'', 1925, and ''The Borrowed Shield'', 1925, by [[Richard Enright]], retired [[New York City Police Commissioner]], ''Harness Bull'', 1937, and ''Homicide'', 1937, by former Southern California police officer [[Leslie T. White]], ''P.C. Richardson's First Case'', 1933, by Sir [[Basil Thomson]], former [[Assistant Commissioner]] of [[Scotland Yard]], and the short story collection ''Policeman's Lot'', 1933, by former Buckinghamshire High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace [[Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet|Henry Wade]].

The procedural became more prominent after [[World War II]], and, while the contributions of [[novelist]]s like Treat were significant, a large part of the impetus for the post-war development of the procedural as a distinct subgenre of the mystery was due, not to prose fiction, but to the popularity of a number of American films which dramatized and fictionalized actual crimes.  Dubbed "[[semidocumentary]] films" by movie critics, these motion pictures, often filmed on location, with the cooperation of the law enforcement agencies involved in the actual case, made a point of authentically depicting police work. Examples include ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), ''[[The Street with No Name]]'' (1948), ''[[T-Men]]'' (1947), ''[[He Walked by Night]]'' (1948), and ''[[Border Incident]]'' (1949).

Films from other countries soon began following the semi-documentary trend.  In [[France]], there was ''[[Quai des orfevres]]'' (1947), released in the [[United States]] as ''Jenny Lamour''.  In [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]], there was [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1949 film ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', a serious police procedural [[film noir]] that was also a precursor to the [[buddy cop film]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway|Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], there were films such as ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Long Arm (film)|The Long Arm]]'' (1956) set in London and depicting the Metropolitan Police.

One semidocumentary,  ''[[He Walked By Night]]'' (1948), released by [[Eagle-Lion Films]], featured a young radio actor named [[Jack Webb]] in a supporting role.  The success of the film, along with a suggestion from [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Sergeant]] Marty Wynn, the film's [[technical advisor]], gave Webb an idea for a [[radio drama]] that depicted police work in a similarly semi-documentary manner. The resulting series, ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'', which debuted on radio in 1949 and made the transition to television in 1951, has been called "the most famous procedural of all time" by mystery novelists [[William L. DeAndrea]], [[Katherine V. Forrest]] and [[Max Allan Collins]].

The same year that ''Dragnet'' debuted on radio, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Sidney Kingsley]]'s stage play ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  This frank, carefully researched dramatization of a typical day in an [[NYPD]] [[police station|precinct]] detective squad became another benchmark in the development of the police procedural.

Over the next few years, the number of novelists who picked up on the procedural trend grew to include writers like Ben Benson, who wrote carefully researched novels about the [[Massachusetts State Police]], retired police officer [[Maurice Procter]], who wrote a series about North England cop Harry Martineau, and Jonathan Craig, who wrote short stories and novels about [[New York City]] police officers.  Police novels by writers who would come to virtually define the form, like [[Hillary Waugh]], [[Evan Hunter|Ed McBain]], and [[John Creasey]] started to appear regularly.

In 1956, in his regular ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' column, mystery critic [[Anthony Boucher]], noting the growing popularity of crime fiction in which the main emphasis was the realistic depiction of police work, suggested that such stories constituted a distinct subgenre of the mystery, and, crediting the success of ''Dragnet'' for the rise of this new form, coined the phrase "police procedural" to describe it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Written stories==

===Ed McBain===
Ed McBain, the [[pseudonym]] of [[Evan Hunter]], wrote dozens of novels in the ''[[87th Precinct]]'' series beginning with ''[[Cop Hater]],'' published in 1956. Hunter continued to write 87th Precinct novels almost until his death in 2005. Although these novels focus primarily on Detective Steve Carella, they encompass the work of many officers working alone and in teams, and Carella is not always present in any individual book.

As if to illustrate the universality of the police procedural, many of McBain's 87th Precinct novels, despite their being set in a slightly fictionalized New York City, have been filmed in settings outside New York, even outside the US. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1963 film, ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', based on McBain's ''King's Ransom'' (1959), is set in [[Tokyo]].  ''Without Apparent Motive'' (1972), set on the [[French Riviera]], is based on McBain's ''Ten Plus One'' (1963). [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Blood Relatives|Les Liens de Sang]]'' (1978), based on ''Blood Relatives'' (1974), is set in [[Montreal]].  Even ''[[Fuzz (film)|Fuzz]]'' (1972), based on the 1968 novel, though set in the US, moves the action to [[Boston]].

===John Creasey/J. J. Marric===
Perhaps ranking just behind McBain in importance to the development of the procedural as a distinct mystery subgenre is [[John Creasey]], a prolific writer of many different kinds of crime fiction, from espionage to criminal protagonist. He was inspired to write a more realistic crime novel when his neighbor, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] detective, challenged Creasey to "write about us as we are." The result was ''Inspector West Takes Charge'', 1940, the first of more than forty novels to feature Roger West of the [[London Metropolitan Police]]. The West novels were, for the era, an unusually realistic look at Scotland Yard operations, but the plots were often wildly melodramatic, and, to get around thorny legal problems, Creasey gave West an "amateur detective" friend who was able to perform the extra-procedural acts that West, as a policeman, could not.

In the mid-1950s, inspired by the success of television's ''Dragnet'' and a similar British TV series, ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', Creasey decided to try a more down-to-earth series of cop stories. Adopting the pseudonym "J.J. Marric", he wrote ''[[Gideon's Day]]'', 1955, in which [[George Gideon]], a high-ranking detective at Scotland Yard, spends a busy day supervising his subordinates' investigations into several unrelated crimes. This novel was the first in a series of more than twenty books which brought Creasey his best critical notices. One entry, ''Gideon's Fire'', 1961, won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Mystery Novel. The Gideon series, more than any other source, helped establish the common procedural plot structure of threading several autonomous story lines through a single novel.

===Sjöwall and Wahlöö===
[[Maj Sjöwall]] and [[Per Wahlöö]] planned and wrote the [[Martin Beck]] police procedural series of ten books between the 1960s and 1970s, set in [[Sweden]]. The series is particularly renowned for its extensive character development throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scene of the Crime: The Importance of Place in Crime and Mystery Fiction|last = Geherin|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck himself is gradually promoted from [[detective]] in a newly nationalised Swedish police force to [[Chief of staff|Chief]] [[Inspector]] of the National Murder Squad, and the realistic depiction, as well as criticism of the Swedish [[welfare state]] at the time whilst the tedium of the police procedural continues in the background, is something still widely used today, with authors such as [[Jo Nesbø]] and [[Stieg Larsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gumshoes: A Dictionary of Fictional Detectives|last = Brunsdale|first = Mitzi|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books gave rise to the [[Scandinavian noir|Swedish noir]] scene, and ''[[The Laughing Policeman (novel)|The Laughing Policeman]]'' earned a "Best Novel" Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1971. The books were translated from Swedish into 35 different languages, and have sold roughly ten million copies. Sjöwall and Wahlöö used [[Black comedy|black humour]] extensively in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2014/09/cis-a-guide-to-the-martin-beck-series/|title = CIS: A GUIDE TO THE MARTIN BECK SERIES|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Megraw|first = Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely recognised as one of the finest police procedural series.

===Elizabeth Linington/Dell Shannon/Lesley Egan===
A prolific author of police procedurals, whose work has fallen out of fashion in the years since her death, is [[Elizabeth Linington]] writing under her own name, as well as "Dell Shannon" and "Lesley Egan." Linington reserved her Dell Shannon pseudonym primarily for procedurals featuring LAPD Central [[Homicide]] [[Lieutenant]] Luis Mendoza (1960–86). Under her own name she wrote about Sergeant Ivor Maddox of LAPD's North Hollywood Station, and as Lesley Egan she wrote about suburban cop Vic Varallo. These novels are often considered severely flawed, partly due to the author's far-right political viewpoint (she was a proud member of the [[John Birch Society]]), but primarily because Miss Linington's books, notwithstanding the frequent comments she made about the depth of her research, were all seriously deficient in the single element most identified with the police procedural, technical accuracy. However, they have a certain charm in their depiction of a kinder, gentler California, where the police were always "good guys" who solved all the crimes and respected the citizenry.

===Georges Simenon===
It has been suggested{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the ''[[Inspector Maigret]]'' novels of [[Georges Simenon]] aren't really procedurals because of their strong focus on the lead character, but the novels have always included subordinate members of his staff as supporting characters. More importantly, Simenon, who had been a journalist covering police investigations before creating Maigret, was giving an accurate depiction, or at least the appearance of an accurate depiction, of law enforcement in Paris. Further, Simenon's influence on later European procedural writers, like [[Sweden]]'s [[Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö]], or [[A. C. Baantjer|Baantjer]], is obvious.

===Joseph Wambaugh===
Though not the first police officer to write procedurals, [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s success has caused him to become the exemplar of cops who turn their professional experiences into fiction.  The son of a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], policeman, Wambaugh joined the Los Angeles Police Department after a stint of military duty.  In 1970, his first novel, ''[[The New Centurions]]'', was published.  This followed three police officers through their training in the Academy, their first few years on the street, culminating in the Watts riots of 1965.  It was followed by such novels as ''The Blue Knight'', 1971, ''[[The Choirboys (book)|The Choirboys]]'', 1975, ''Hollywood Station'', 2006, and acclaimed non-fiction books like ''[[The Onion Field]]'', 1973, ''Lines and Shadows'', 1984, and ''Fire Lover'', 2002.  Wambaugh has said that his main purpose is less to show how cops work on the job, than how the job works on cops.

===Tony Hillerman===
[[Tony Hillerman]], the author of 17 novels involving Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, wrote procedurals in which the procedures were those of the [[Navajo Tribal Police]].

===Detective novel writers===
It is difficult to disentangle the early roots of the procedural from its forebear, the traditional detective novel, which often featured a police officer as protagonist. By and large, the better known novelists such as [[Ngaio Marsh]] produced work that falls more squarely into the province of the traditional or "cozy" detective novel. Nevertheless, some of the work of authors less well known today, like [[Freeman Wills Crofts]]'s novels about Inspector French or some of the work of the prolific team of [[G. D. H. Cole|G.D.H.]] and [[Margaret Cole]], might be considered as the antecedents of today's police procedural.  British mystery novelist and critic [[Julian Symons]], in his 1972 history of crime fiction, ''Bloody Murder'', labeled these proto-procedurals "humdrums," because of their emphasis on the plodding nature of the investigators.

===TV series===
{{Main|List of police television dramas}}

====United States====
* ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'' (1951–59, 1967–70, 1989–91 and 2003–04) was a pioneering police procedural that began on radio in 1949 and then on television in 1951. ''Dragnet'' established the tone of many police dramas in subsequent decades, and the rigorously authentic depictions of such elements as organizational structure, professional jargon, legal issues, etc., set the standard for technical accuracy that became the most identifiable element of the police procedural in all media.  The show was occasionally accused of presenting an overly idealized portrait of law enforcement in which the police (represented by Sgt. [[Joe Friday]]) were invariably presented as "good guys" and the criminals as "bad guys", with little moral flexibility or complexity between the two. However, many episodes depicted sympathetic perpetrators while others depicted unsympathetic or corrupt cops.  Further, though Jack Webb may have seemed to go to extremes to depict the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in a favorable light, most depictions of cops at the time of ''Dragnet'''s debut were both unsympathetic and unrealistic.  Webb's depiction was meant to offer balance.  Also, the show benefited from the unprecedented technical advice, involvement, and support of the LAPD, a first in TV, which may also have been an incentive to depict the Department favorably.  After the success of ''Dragnet'', Webb produced other procedural shows like ''[[The DA's Man]]'', about an undercover investigator for the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s Office, ''[[Adam-12]]'', about a pair of uniformed [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers patrolling their beat in a radio car, and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'', with [[David Janssen]] as a trouble-shooting federal officer.
* ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' (1959–63)  fictionalized real-life Federal Agent [[Eliot Ness]]'s ongoing fight with prohibition-era gangs in [[Chicago]] and elsewhere.  Originally a two-part presentation on the anthology series ''[[Desilu Playhouse]]'', it made such a splash that a series was launched the following fall.  That two-part pilot, later released to theaters under the title ''The Scarface Mob'', stuck comparatively close to the actual events, with Ness, as played by [[Robert Stack]], recruiting a team of incorruptible investigators to help bring down [[Al Capone]]. Later episodes showed Ness and his squad, after Capone, going after just about every big name gangster of the era, and when the writers ran out of real-life figures to pit against Ness, they created new ones. [[Quinn Martin]], who would become closely associated with police and crime shows like this, produced the series during its first season, leaving to found his own company, QM Productions, which would go one to produce police procedural shows like ''[[The New Breed (TV series)|The New Breed]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Dan August]]'', and ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' over the next twenty years.  The success of the series led to an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|motion picture]] in 1987, and a new TV [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|series]] that was syndicated to local stations in 1993.
* ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' (1973–78) was an anthology series set in Los Angeles created by [[LAPD]] Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh.  Hard-hitting and unflinchingly realistic, its anthology format made it possible to look at LAPD police work from many different perspectives, what it was like to be a woman in a male-dominated profession, an honest cop suspected of corruption, a rookie cop, an undercover narc, a veteran facing retirement, or a cop who had to adjust to crippling injuries incurred in the line of duty.  Despite its anthology format, there were a number of characters who appeared in more than one episode, including Robbery/Homicide partners Tony Calabrese ([[Tony Lo Bianco]]) and Bert Jameson ([[Don Meredith]]), vice cop turned homicide detective Charlie Czonka ([[James Farentino]]), and stakeout-surveillance specialist Joe LaFrieda ([[Vic Morrow]]).  Several series were spun off from the show, including ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''Joe Forrester'', and ''[[David Cassidy: Man Under Cover|Man Undercover]]''.  During its last two seasons, the show appeared as an irregular series of two-hour [[TV movies]] rather than a weekly one-hour program.  The show was revived for a season in 1988, using old scripts reshot with new casts when a writers' strike made new material inaccessible.
* ''[[Kojak]]'' (1973–78, 1989–90) created by [[Abby Mann]], focused on a veteran [[New York City]] detective-lieutenant played by [[Telly Savalas]].  Its exteriors were filmed at New York's Ninth Precinct, the same place where ''[[NYPD Blue]]'''s exteriors would be filmed.  In 1989 Savalas returned to the role briefly for five two-hour episodes, in which Kojak had been promoted to [[inspector]] and placed in charge of the Major Crimes Squad. It rotated with three other detective shows on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  A 2005 remake for the [[USA Network]] starred [[Ving Rhames]]. Kojak's most memorable character trait was his signature lollipop.
* ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981–87) featured a number of intertwined storylines in each episode, and pioneered depiction of the conflicts between the work and private lives of officers and detectives on which the police procedural was centered.  The show had a deliberate "documentary" style, depicting officers who were flawed and human, and dealt openly with the gray areas of morality between right and wrong.  It was set in an unidentified east coast or Midwestern US city.  The show was written by [[Steven Bochco]] and Michael Kozoll.
* ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'' (1982–88) revolved around two female NYPD detectives who led very different lives. Christine Cagney, played by [[Sharon Gless]], was a single-minded, witty, brash career woman. Mary Beth Lacey was a resourceful, sensitive working mom. [[Loretta Swit]] was the original choice for Cagney [she played the role in a TV movie] however she couldn't get out of her contract on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. During the first season, [[Meg Foster]] played the part of Cagney, while [[Tyne Daly]] played Lacey, the role she had originated in the pilot. [[CBS]] canceled the series claiming low ratings. It was brought back due both to a letter-writing campaign which drew millions of letters nationwide and because the ratings went ''up'' during summer reruns. A ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine read "Welcome Back". Daly continued as Lacey, but Foster was replaced with Gless, who would become the actress most identified with the part. It had 36 nominations and 14 wins during its run.  Four TV movies were broadcast after the series ended.
* ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984–90) and ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' (1987–91) showed the MTV style of Police procedurals.
* The [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]], which started with the long-running series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' (1990–2010), focuses on the two 'halves' of a criminal proceeding in the [[New York City]] criminal justice system: the investigation of the crime by the [[New York City Police Department]] homicide detectives and the subsequent prosecution of the criminals by the [[New York County District Attorney]]'s office. The success of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' inspired nine other [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series in four different countries:
** Five in the U.S.: ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–present), which focuses on sex crimes such as rape and child molestation, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' (2001–11), focusing on major crimes from the point of view of the criminal and capturing them from a psychological side, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'' (2005–06), which focuses more on the trial from both the prosecution and the defense teams' points of view, ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' (2006) and ''[[Law &amp; Order: LA]]'' (2010–11). ''Special Victims Unit'', ''Criminal Intent'', and ''LA'' series focused more on the police procedurals than ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Conviction''.  As of August 2011, ''Special Victims Unit'' is the only currently running American series in the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise.
** Two in [[Russia]]: Adaptations of ''Special Victims Unit'' (2007) and ''Criminal Intent'' (2007), both set in [[Moscow]].
** ''[[Paris enquêtes criminelles]]'' (2007), a [[France|French]] adaptation of ''Criminal Intent'' set in [[Paris]].
** ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' (2009–2014), a [[United Kingdom|British]] adaptation of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' set in [[London]].
:Aside from being its depiction of police investigation, this program also relates to the [[legal drama]] and "forensic pathology" subgenres, and has inspired such other programs as the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' [[CSI (franchise)|series]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' (1993–99; TV movie in 2000), a police procedural focusing on the homicide unit of the [[Baltimore]] city police department. Critically praised{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} (although frequently struggling in the ratings), the show was more of an ensemble piece, focusing on the activities of the unit as a whole (although significant characters such as Detective [[Frank Pembleton]] and Detective [[John Munch]], who has also appeared on the various ''Law &amp; Order'' shows, among others, became popular with viewers). The show (particularly in its first three seasons) used long-form arcs to depict ongoing criminal investigations, such as the investigation of a murdered child in the first season, which ran through 13 episodes but ended without an arrest or conviction, or even conclusive proof of who committed the crime. The show also heavily featured the complex internal politics of the police department, suggesting that rising through the ranks has more to do with personal connections, favors and opportunism than genuine ability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' (1993–2005) explored the internal and external struggles of the assorted investigators of the fictional 15th Precinct of Manhattan.  The show gained notoriety for profanity and nudity never previously broadcast on American network television. ''NYPD Blue'' was created by genre veteran [[Steven Bochco]] and [[David Milch]]. The cast of ''NYPD Blue'' included actor Dennis Franz, who previously played Detective Buntz on ''Hill Street Blues'', as well as on a spin-off series, ''Beverly Hills Buntz''. Another cast member, David Caruso, would later play Lt. Horatio Caine on ''CSI: Miami''.
* The [[CSI (franchise)|CSI franchise]] which started with ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' (2000–2015) and eventually spawned two  spin-offs focused on solving ordinary crimes using forensics, ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' (2002-2012) and ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (2004-2013).  Produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], these three shows focus on three groups of forensic scientists in [[Las Vegas]], [[Miami]] and [[New York City]] who investigate how and why a person has died and if it is a murder or not by investigating not only [[whodunit]] but also howdunit. A third spin-off, ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'' (2015-2016), focused on cybercrime and its impact on modern society.
** The CSI franchise inspired other forensic shows such as ''[[Body of Proof]]'' (2011–2013), ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' (2005-2017) and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' (2001–2007).
** The CSI franchise also inspired other crime dramas involving teams solving crimes but not relying on forensics; these include victim and witness memory for cold cases and missing people in ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' (2003–2010) and ''[[Without a Trace]]'' (2002-2009) respectively, psychological profiling in ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' (2005-), using [[mathematics]] in ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' (2005-2010) and using deception in ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008–2015).
* ''[[The Shield]]'' (2002–08) is about an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department set up in the fictional Farmington district ("the Farm") of Los Angeles, using a converted church ("the Barn") as their police station, and featuring a group of detectives called "The Strike Team", who will do anything to bring justice to the streets. Michael Chiklis (Chiklis previously played the title character in the TV series ''The Commish'') has top billing with his portrayal of Strike Team leader Detective Victor "Vic" Mackey. The show has an ensemble cast that will normally run a number of separate story lines through each episode. It was on the [[FX network]] and was known for its portrayal of police brutality and its realism. The show inspired other shows similar to ''The Shield'' such as ''[[Dark Blue (TV series)|Dark Blue]]'' and ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]''. ''The Shield'' was created by writer/producer [[Shawn Ryan]].
* The ''[[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]]'' franchise was spun off from the CBS series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' in 2003. The original series, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2003-present) follows the Major Case Response Team of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], as they investigate crimes related to the [[US Navy]] and [[Marine Corps]]. ''NCIS'' has been among the top scripted series on U.S. television, and has received two spin-offs; ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' (2009-) deals with an LA-based branch dealing in special undercover assignments, and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' (2014-) focuses on a small group of agents who handle cases from the Mississippi River to the Texas Panhandle.
* ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' (2009-2016), ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008-2015), ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' (2002–2009) and ''[[Psych]]'' (2006-2014) feature quirky investigators with their own distinct methods of solving crimes and are equally comedic shows as they are police procedurals.
* [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'']] is a multi-genre franchise that focuses on the [[Chicago]] [[Chicago P.D. (TV series)|Police Department]], the [[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Fire Department]] and the [[Chicago Med|Medical branch]] respectively.

====India====
* ''[[C.I.D. (India TV series)|C.I.D.]]'' (1995–present) C.I.D. is an Indian crime detective series that airs on Sony TV. It is about a team of detectives belonging to the Criminal Investigation Department in Mumbai. The protagonists of the show are played by [[Shivaji Satam]], [[Aditya Srivastava]], [[Dayanand Shetty]], [[Dinesh Phadnis]], [[Hrishikesh Pandey]], [[Vivek Mashru]], [[Jasveer Kaur]], [[Ansha Saeed]].The forensic experts are played by [[Narendra Gupta]] and [[Shraddha Musale]] respectively.

====Austria====
* ''[[Inspector Rex]]'' (1994–2003) was an Austrian homicide detective series, whiched aired all over the world and was (and still is) incredibly popular in Australia when broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]. It is about a German Shepherd police dog named Rex and his owner, Detective-Inspector Richard Moser of the Vienna Kriminalpolizei. Rex was a bomb squad dog whose handler was killed at a crime scene that Moser was investigating. Moser's team consisted of Ernst Stockinger (seasons 1 and 2), and Peter Hollerer (seasons 1 to 4), and Christian Bock (seasons 3 to 6). Dr Leo Graf served as forensic pathalogist/coroner throughout the whole series, who often described autopsy scenes &amp; procedures much to the disgust of the police staff. Moser was murdered by a psychotic serial killer halfway through season 4. New detective inspector Alexander Brandtner took over Moser's role after Moser's untimely death. 
Rex frequently saved the team's necks during pursuits and catching criminals, sniffing out clues, rescuing child victims, as well as occasionally being a nuisance around the office or while interviewing suspects.
The show mixes series themes with occasional comedy, such as Rex's penchant for [[ham rolls]] (wurstsemmeln), demanding to buy many dog toys, and interfering with Moser's &amp; Brandtner's erratic love lives.

====United Kingdom====
* ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', (1954–55) – possibly the first police drama to be made for British TV, this series, based on the memoirs of real-life Scotland Yard detective Robert Fabian, had a lot in common with ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.  Just as ''Dragnet'' had been the first network drama series with continuing characters to be shot on film, so ''Fabian of the Yard'' was one of the first British series to be filmed.  Both shows featured voice-over narration by the main character; both fictionalized stories derived from real-life cases; and both ended with an epilogue that revealed the ultimate fate of the criminals.  On ''Fabian'', this took the form of a medium-shot of Bruce Seton, who played Fabian in the series, seated at a desk.  The shot slowly dissolved into one of the real-life Fabian in the same pose at the same desk.  At that point, the actual Fabian stood up and told the audience what happened to the criminal he'd caught in the real-life case that had just been dramatized.
* ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', (1955–76) – [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] reprised the role of [[Constable]] George Dixon, the uniformed beat cop he had played in ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'', despite the fact that the Dixon character had been tragically murdered in that film.  During the course of this somewhat gentle series, Warner's character became, for many, the living embodiment of what every British "bobby" was supposed to be.  As the series progressed, Dixon went through several promotions, eventually winding up as the [[Station Sergeant]] at his local division.  By the final season, with Warner now over 80, Dixon retired and the focus shifted to the younger officers he'd trained up over the years.
* ''[[No Hiding Place]]'', (1957–67) – Produced with the cooperation of Scotland Yard, this long-running series featured Raymond Francis as high-ranking Met detective Tom Lockhart.  During its run, the series went through several title changes.  When it began in 1957, it was known as ''Murder Bag'', referring to the [[murder bag|bag of investigative tools]] that [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Lockhart carried with him whenever he was called to a case.  In 1959, with Lockhart promoted to [[Chief Superintendent]], it became ''Crime Sheet''.  Later in 1959, the series was given its final and best-remembered title, ''No Hiding Place'', which lasted until the series ended in 1967.
* ''[[Z-Cars]]'', (1962–78) – a police drama about two teams of uniformed constables ([[Brian Blessed]], [[Joseph Brady (actor)|Joseph Brady]], [[James Ellis (actor)|James Ellis]], and [[Jeremy Kemp]]) assigned to "Crime Patrol" duties in a pair of powerful [[Ford Zephyr]]s, under the supervision of Detective Sergeant John Watt ([[Frank Windsor]]) and Detective [[Chief Inspector]] Charlie Barlow ([[Stratford Johns]]).  A franker, and often less flattering portrait of police work than audience were used to seeing on ''Dixon of Dock Green'', the show was an immediate hit, its popularity generating spin-offs like ''[[Softly, Softly (TV series)|Softly, Softly]]'' (1966–76), ''[[Barlow at Large]]'' (1971–75), and ''[[Second Verdict]]'' (1976).
* ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', (1965–66) – a crime series produced during 1964/65 and based on the novels by [[John Creasey]] (as J. J. Marric). The series was made at Elstree in twin production with [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]] TV series. It starred Liverpudlian [[John Gregson]] in the title role as Commander George [[Gideon of Scotland Yard]], with [[Alexander Davion]] as his assistant, Detective Chief Inspector David Keen, [[Reginald Jessup]] as Det. Superintendent LeMaitre (nicknamed Lemmy), [[Ian Rossiter]] as Detective Chief Superintendent Joe Bell and [[Basil Dignam]] as Commissioner Scott-Marle.
* ''[[New Scotland Yard (TV series)|New Scotland Yard]]'', (1972–74) – a police drama series produced by [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT) for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network between 1972 and 1974. It features the activities of two officers from the [[Criminal Investigations Department]] (CID) in the [[Metropolitan Police]] force headquarters at [[New Scotland Yard]], as they dealt with the assorted villains of the day.
* ''[[The Sweeney]]'', (1975–78) – a drama series focusing on the [[Flying Squad]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]] and their twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week job of catching some of the most dangerous and violent criminals in London. The [[television program]] featured [[Detective Inspector]] Jack Regan ([[John Thaw]]) and other tough-talking hard-drinking members of his elite unit, both on and off duty. With its high level of violence, location filming, bold frankness, and well written scripts, ''The Sweeney'' revolutionized the genre.  The series was so phenomenally popular that two feature-length movies, ''Sweeney!'' (1976) and ''Sweeney 2'' (1978) were released to theatres during the show's original broadcast run.
*''[[The Gentle Touch]]'', (1980–84) – a British police drama television series made by London Weekend Television for ITV. Commencing transmission on 11 April 1980, the series is notable for being the first British series to feature a female police detective as its leading character, ahead of the similarly themed BBC series Juliet Bravo by four months.
*''[[Juliet Bravo]]'', (1980–85) – a British television series, which ran on BBC1. The theme of the series concerned a female police inspector who took over control of a police station in the fictional town of Hartley in Lancashire.
* ''[[Taggart]]'' (1983–2010)
* ''[[The Bill]]'', (1984–2010) – a drama series focusing on both the uniformed and plain-clothes police officers working out of a fictional inner-London police station. The original conception of this series was as purely procedural, with an almost fly-on-the-wall approach that survived to an extent throughout.
* The ''[[Prime Suspect (UK TV series)|Prime Suspect]]'' series, (1991–2006) – featuring [[Helen Mirren]] as Detective Chief Inspector (later Chief Superintendent) Jane Tennison, which focused on the police investigations and on Tennison's conflicts with her fellow officers as a prominent female detective in a heavily male-dominated work environment, as well as her personal problems concerning her family and after-work life.
* ''[[Cracker (UK TV series)|Cracker]]'' (1993–95) - hard-hitting drama series following dysfunctional  criminal psychologist Dr Edward "Fitz" Fitzgerald, played by [[Robbie Coltrane]]
* ''[[McCallum (TV series)|McCallum]]'' (1995–98)
* ''[[Hamish Macbeth (TV series)|Hamish Macbeth]]'' (1995–97) - police drama-comedy set in the west coast Highlands of Scotland, starring [[Robert Carlyle]]
* ''[[The Cops (TV series)|The Cops]]'' (1998–2000) – perhaps the most realistic police drama series yet seen on British TV, noted for its documentary-style camerawork and uncompromising portrayal of the police force.
* ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' (1992–2010) is made by [[Yorkshire Television]] at [[The Leeds Studios]] for broadcast on [[ITV Network|ITV]]. It lasted 18 series. Set in 1960s [[Yorkshire]], in the fictional town of Ashfordly and the nearby village of Aidensfield in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], the motorcycle-riding Aidensfield village bobby was originally played by [[Nick Berry]].
* ''[[Rebus (TV series)|Rebus]]'' (2000–07)
* ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' (2009–2014) is an adaptation of the [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]] for the British market.

The show is adapted from scripts and episodes of the original U.S. ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''.
* ''[[Suspects (TV series)|Suspects]]'' (2014–present) is an East London-based police procedural shot in a stripped-back documentary style using improvised dialogue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a549763/suspects-channel-5s-stripped-back-cop-drama-its-electrifying.html |title=Suspects - Channel 5's stripped back cop drama: "It's electrifying". |work=Digitalspy.co.uk |author=Morgan Jeffery |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and follows DS Jack Weston ([[Damien Molony]]), DC Charlie Steele ([[Claire-Hope Ashitey]]) and their superior DI Martha Bellamy ([[Fay Ripley]]) as they investigate various crimes.

==Comic strips and books==
The [[comic strip]] ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' is often pointed to as an early procedural. Indeed, in his introduction to a 1970 collection of ''Tracy'' strips entitled ''The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy'', no less an authority than [[Ellery Queen]] suggested that Tracy, predating Webb, Treat, Creasey, and McBain, was the first "truly" procedural policeman in any fictional medium.

Certainly ''Tracy'' creator [[Chester Gould]] seemed to be trying to reflect the real world. Tracy himself, conceived by Gould as a "modern-day [[Sherlock Holmes]]", was partly modeled on real-life law enforcer Eliot Ness, and his first, and most frequently recurring, antagonist, the [[Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice|Big Boy]], was based on Ness's real-life nemesis Al Capone. Other members of Tracy's [[Recurring characters in Dick Tracy|Rogues Gallery]], like Boris Arson, [[Flattop Jones]], and Maw Famon, were inspired, respectively, by [[John Dillinger]], [[Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd]], and [[Ma Barker|Kate "Ma" Barker]].

More to the point, Gould was making a genuine attempt to portray police work realistically.  Once ''Tracy'' was sold to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' syndicate, Gould enrolled in a criminology class at [[Northwestern University]], met with members of the [[Chicago Police Department]], and did research at the Department's crime lab, to make his depiction of law enforcement more authentic.  Ultimately, he hired retired [[Chicago]] policeman Al Valanis, a pioneering forensic sketch artist, as both an artistic assistant and police technical advisor.

Later stories, in which Gould veered into [[space opera]] and extraterrestrial contacts, mitigated somewhat against the strip's being recognized for its early use of realistic police procedure, but any examination of the ''Tracy'' strip from its beginnings in 1931 through the 1950s makes Gould's status as a pioneer in the police procedural subgenre clear.

The success of ''Tracy'' led to many more police strips.  While some, like Norman Marsh's ''[[Dan Dunn]]'' were unabashedly slavish imitations of ''Tracy'', others, like [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s and [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]'', took a more original approach.  Still others, like Eddie Sullivan's and Charlie Schmidt's ''[[Radio Patrol]]'' and Will Gould's ''Red Barry'', steered a middle course. One of the best post-''Tracy'' procedural comics was ''[[Kerry Drake]]'', written and created by Allen Saunders and illustrated by [[Alfred Andriola]]. It diverged from the metropolitan settings used in ''Tracy'' to tell the story of the titular Chief Investigator for the District Attorney of a small-town jurisdiction. Later, following a personal tragedy, he leaves the DA's Office and joins his small city's police force in order to fight crime closer to the grass roots level.  As both a DA's man and a city cop, he fights a string of flamboyant, Gould-ian criminals like "Stitches", "Bottleneck", and "Bulldozer."

Other syndicated police strips include [[Zane Grey]]'s ''[[King of the Royal Mounted]]'', depicting police work in the contemporary Canadian Northwest, Lank Leonard's ''[[Mickey Finn (comics)|Mickey Finn]]'', which emphasized the home life of a hard-working cop, and ''Dragnet'', which adapted stories from the pioneering radio-TV series into comics. Early [[comic books]] with police themes tended to be reprints of syndicated newspaper strips like ''Tracy'' and ''Drake''.  Others adapted police stories from other mediums, like the radio-inspired anthology comic ''[[Gang Busters]]'', Dell's ''87th Precinct'' issues, which adapted McBain's novels, or ''The Untouchables'', which adapted the fictionalized TV adventures of real-life policeman Eliot Ness.

More recently, there have been attempts to depict police work with the kind of hard-edged realism seen in the novels of writers like Wambaugh, such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] four-issue mini-series ''Cops:  The Job'', in which a rookie police officer learns to cope with the physical, emotional, and mental stresses of law enforcement during her first patrol assignment. With [[superhero]]es having long dominated the comic book market, there have been some recent attempts to integrate elements of the police procedural into the universe of costumed crime-fighters.  ''[[Gotham Central]]'', for example, depicts a group of police detectives operating in [[Batman]]'s [[Gotham City]], and suggested that the caped crime-fighter is disliked by many Gotham detectives for treading on their toes. Meanwhile, ''[[Metropolis SCU]]'' tells the story of the Special Crimes Unit, an elite squad of cops in the police force serving [[Superman]]'s [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

The use of police procedural elements in superhero comics can partly be attributed to the success of [[Kurt Busiek]]'s groundbreaking 1994 series ''[[Marvels]]'', and his subsequent ''[[Astro City]]'' work, both of which examine the typical superhero universe from the viewpoint of the common man who witnesses the great dramas from afar, participating in them tangentially at best.

In the wake of Busiek's success, many other writers mimicked his approach, with mixed results&amp;nbsp;– the narrative possibilities of someone who does not get involved in drama are limited. In 2000, however, [[Image Comics]] published the first issue of [[Brian Michael Bendis]]'s comic ''[[Powers (comics)|Powers]]'', which followed the lives of homicide detectives as they investigated superhero-related cases. Bendis's success has led both Marvel Comics and [[DC Comics]] to begin their own superhero-themed police procedurals (''[[District X]]'' and the aforementioned ''Gotham Central''), which focus on how the job of a police officer is affected by such tropes as secret identities, superhuman abilities, costumes, and the near-constant presence of [[vigilante]]s.

While the detectives in ''Powers'' were "normal" (unpowered) humans dealing with super-powered crime, [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'' mini-series, published by [[America's Best Comics]] in 2000–01, centered around the super-powered police force in a setting where powers are omnipresent. The comic detailed the lives and work of the police force of Neopolis, a city in which everyone, from the police and criminals to civilians, children and even pets, has super-powers, colourful costumes and secret identities.

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rhythm 0''''' (1974) was a six-hour work of [[performance art]] by Yugoslav artist [[Marina Abramović]] in Studio Morra, [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Marina Abramović, Chris Thompson and Katarina Weslien, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4139995 "Pure Raw: Performance, Pedagogy, and (Re)presentation"], ''PAJ: A Journal of Performance and Art'', 28(1), January 2006 (pp. 29–50), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The work involved Abramović standing still while the audience was invited to do to her whatever they wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, and a gun loaded with one bullet.&lt;ref name=Abramovic01:00mins&gt;[https://vimeo.com/71952791 "Marina Abramović on ''Rhythm 0'' (1974)"], Marina Abramović Institute, 2014, c. 01:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/audios/190/1972 "Marina Abramović. Rhythm 0. 1974"], Museum of Modern Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no separate stages. Abramović and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer Ward, ''No Innocent Bystanders: Performance Art and Audience'', University Press of New England, 2012, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: "What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?"&lt;ref name=Abramovic00:00mins&gt;[https://vimeo.com/71952791 Abramović 2014], c. 00:00 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance==
Her instructions were placed on the table: 

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;
Instructions.&lt;br/&gt;
There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance.&lt;br/&gt;
I am the object.&lt;br/&gt;
During this period I take full responsibility.&lt;br/&gt;
Duration: 6 hours (8 pm – 2 am).&lt;ref&gt;Ward 2012, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Abramović said the work "pushed her body to the limits."&lt;ref name=Abramovic00:00mins/&gt; Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss.&lt;ref name=Abramovic01:00mins/&gt; Art critic [[Thomas McEvilley]], who was present, wrote:

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:none;margin-right:5em;margin-left:0em;border-left:solid 5px #ccc;padding:1.2em"&gt;

It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin. Her throat was slashed so someone could suck her blood. Various minor sexual assaults were carried out on her body. She was so committed to the piece that she would not have resisted rape or murder. Faced with her abdication of will, with its implied collapse of human psychology, a protective group began to define itself in the audience. When a loaded gun was thrust to Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a fight broke out between the audience factions."&lt;ref&gt;Ward 2012, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Abramović described it later: “What I learned was that... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.” ... “I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.”&lt;ref&gt;Daneri, 29; and 30&lt;/ref&gt;

When the gallery announced the work was over, and Abramović began to move again, she said the audience left, unable to face her as a person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vimeo.com/71952791 Abramović 2014], c. 01:45 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[File:Screenplay example.svg|right|thumb|250px|Sample from a screenplay, showing dialogue and action descriptions]]
A '''screenplay''', or '''script''', is a written work by [[screenwriter]]s for a [[film]], [[television show|television program]] or [[video game]]. These screenplays can be [[Originality|original works]] or [[Film adaptation|adaptations]] from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a [[teleplay]].

== Format and style ==
The format is structured so that one page equates to roughly one minute of screen time, though this is only used as a ballpark estimate and often bears little resemblance to the running time of the final movie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnaugust.com/2006/how-accurate-is-the-page-per-minute-rule JohnAugust.com "How accurate is the page-per-minute rule?]&lt;/ref&gt; The standard font is 12 point, 10 pitch [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] Typeface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://johnaugust.com/2007/hollywood-standard JohnAugust.com "Hollywood Standard Formatting"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The major components are action (sometimes called "screen direction") and [[dialogue]]. The action is written in the [[present tense]] and is limited to what can be heard or seen by the audience, for example descriptions of settings, character movements, or sound effects. The dialogue is the words the characters speak, and is written in a center column.

Unique to the screenplay (as opposed to a stage play) is the use of slug lines. A ''slug line'', also called a ''master scene heading'', occurs at the start of every scene and typically contains three pieces of information: whether the scene is set inside (interior/INT.) or outside (exterior/EXT.), the specific location, and the time of day. Each slug line begins a new scene. In a "[[shooting script]]" the slug lines are numbered consecutively for ease of reference.

American screenplays are printed single-sided on three-hole-punched paper using the standard American [[paper size|letter size]] (8.5 x 11&amp;nbsp;inch). They are then held together with two [[Brass fastener|brass brads]] in the top and bottom hole. The middle hole is left empty as it would otherwise make it harder to quickly read the script.

In the United Kingdom, double-hole-punched [[A4 paper size|A4]] paper is normally used, which is slightly taller and narrower than US letter size. Some UK writers format the scripts for use in the US letter size, especially when their scripts are to be read by American producers, since the pages would otherwise be cropped when printed on US paper. Because each country's standard paper size is difficult to obtain in the other country, British writers often send an electronic copy to American producers, or crop the A4 size to US letter.

A British script may be bound by a single brad at the top left hand side of the page, making flicking through the paper easier during script meetings. Screenplays are usually bound with a light card stock cover and back page, often showing the logo of the production company or agency submitting the script, covers are there to protect the script during handling which can reduce the strength of the paper. This is especially important if the script is likely to pass through the hands of several people or through the post.

Increasingly, ''reading copies'' of screenplays (that is, those distributed by producers and agencies in the hope of attracting finance or talent) are distributed printed on both sides of the paper (often professionally bound) to reduce paper waste. Occasionally they are reduced to half-size to make a small book which is convenient to read or put in a pocket; this is generally for use by the director or production crew during shooting.

Although most writing contracts continue to stipulate physical delivery of three or more copies of a finished script, it is common for scripts to be delivered electronically via email.

== Screenplay formats ==
Screenplays and teleplays use a set of standardizations, beginning with proper formatting. These rules are in part to serve the practical purpose of making scripts uniformly readable "blueprints" of movies, and also to serve as a way of distinguishing a professional from an amateur.

===Feature film===
[[File:The Godfather Screenplay.JPG|thumb|Screenplay for ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', Turin, Italy]]
Motion picture screenplays intended for submission to mainstream studios, whether in the US or elsewhere in the world, are expected to conform to a standard [[typographical]] style known widely as the ''studio format'' which stipulates how elements of the screenplay such as scene headings, action, transitions, dialog, character names, shots and parenthetical matter should be presented on the page, as well as font size and line spacing.

One reason for this is that, when rendered in studio format, most screenplays will transfer onto the screen at the rate of approximately one page per minute. This rule of thumb is widely contested &amp;mdash; a page of dialogue usually occupies less screen time than a page of action, for example, and it depends enormously on the literary style of the writer &amp;mdash; and yet it continues to hold sway in modern [[Hollywood]].

There is no single standard for studio format. Some studios have definitions of the required format written into the rubric of their writer's contract. The [[Nicholl Fellowship]], a screenwriting competition run under the auspices of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], has a guide to screenplay format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080822084909/http://www.oscars.org/nicholl/format.html Guide to screenplay format] from the website of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed reference is ''The Complete Guide to Standard Script Formats''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Guide to Standard Script Formats'' (2002) Cole and Haag, SCB Distributors, {{ISBN|0-929583-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Spec screenplay ====
A "[[spec script]]" or speculative screenplay is a script written to be sold on the open market with no upfront payment, or promise of payment. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works, or real people and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://actfourscreenplays.com/glossary/spec-script/|title=Spec Script|publisher=Act Four Screenplays|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
For American TV shows, the format rules for hour-long dramas and [[Single-camera setup|single-camera]] sitcoms are essentially the same as for motion pictures. The main difference is that TV scripts have act breaks.  [[Multiple-camera setup|Multi-camera]] sitcoms use a different, specialized format that derives from stage plays and radio. In this format, dialogue is double-spaced, action lines are capitalized, and scene headings, character entrances and exits, and sound effects are capitalized and underlined.

Drama series and sitcoms are no longer the only formats that require the skills of a writer. With reality-based programming crossing genres to create various hybrid programs, many of the so-called "reality" programs are in a large part scripted in format. That is, the overall skeleton of the show and its episodes are written to dictate the content and direction of the program. The Writers Guild of America has identified this as a legitimate writer's medium, so much so that they have lobbied to impose jurisdiction over writers and producers who "format" reality-based productions. Creating reality show formats involves storytelling structure similar to screenwriting, but much more condensed and boiled down to specific plot points or actions related to the overall concept and story.

===Documentaries===
The script format for documentaries and audio-visual presentations which consist largely of voice-over matched to still or moving pictures is different again and uses a two-column format which can be particularly difficult to achieve in standard word processors, at least when it comes to editing or rewriting. Many script-editing software programs include templates for documentary formats.

== Screenwriting software ==
{{Main article|Screenwriting software}}
Various [[screenwriting software]] packages are available to help screenwriters adhere to the strict formatting conventions. Detailed computer programs are designed specifically to format screenplays, teleplays, and stage plays. Such packages include BPC-Screenplay, [[Celtx]], [[Fade In (software)|Fade In]], [[Final Draft (software)|Final Draft]], [[FiveSprockets]], [[Montage (software)|Montage]], [[Movie Magic Screenwriter]], [[Movie Outline]] 3.0, [[Scrivener (software)|Scrivener]], Movie Draft SE and [[Zhura]]. Software is also available as [[web applications]], accessible from any computer, and on [[mobile devices]], such as Fade In Mobile and Scripts Pro.

The first screenwriting software was [[SmartKey]], a macro program that sent strings of commands to existing word processing programs, such as [[WordStar]], [[WordPerfect]] and [[Microsoft Word]]. SmartKey was popular with screenwriters from 1982 to 1987, after which word processing programs had their own macro features.

== Script coverage ==
{{Main article|Script coverage}}
''Script coverage'' is a filmmaking term for the analysis and grading of screenplays, often within the script-development department of a production company. While coverage may remain entirely verbal, it usually takes the form of a written report, guided by a rubric that varies from company to company. The original idea behind coverage was that a producer's assistant could read a script and then give their producer a breakdown of the project and suggest whether they should consider producing the screenplay or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Script Coverage?|url=https://www.wescreenplay.com/blog/post/what-is-script-coverage|website=WeScreenplay|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Shilpgram Museum''' is a craft village, situated near Ramsinghpura village, 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Sawai Madhopur]] in [[India]]. It is a living ethnographic museum depicting the tremendous diversity in crafts, art and culture of various Indian states, especially the western part.

[[File:Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur.jpg|right|Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur]]

==Description==
The foundation stone-laying ceremony of Shilpgram, Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, was done by [[Bina Kak]], former Hon'ble Tourism, Art, Culture, Forest and Environment Minister of [[Rajasthan]] on 26 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sawai Madhopur Shilpgram to be Inaugurated Tomorrow|url=http://rajasthantourismbuzz.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/sawai-madhopur-shilpgram-to-be-inaugurated-tomorrow/|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Shilpgram got renovated in 2017 and is being an attractive destination for tourists where the local crafts lure the tourist to spend some time in the tranquility of Ranthambhore. Spreading over 22 acres in land, Shilpgram is a platform where regional handicraft and hand-loom products is developed. Like other Shilpgrams, for example, [[Shilpgram, Udaipur|Udaipur Shilpgram]], tourist interest as well as public utility exhibitions and craft bazaars of handicrafts and handlooms are organized by Shilpgram. Sometimes to showcase their regional cultural heritage, they also organize cultural events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tourism Minister Inaugurating Shilpgram Today at Sawai Madhopur|url=http://dainikbhor.com/cities/jaipur/tourism-minister-inaugurating-shilpgram-today-at-sawai-madhopur/|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3147">The '''Symphony No. 5 "Requiem, Bardo, Nirmanakaya"''' is a [[symphony]] for [[Choir|chorus]] and [[orchestra]] by the American composer [[Philip Glass]].  It was commissioned by the [[Salzburg Festival]], [[Austria]] and premiered August 28, 1999 and was conducted by [[Dennis Russell Davies]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Glass |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Glass |year=1999 |title=Symphony No. 5 "Requiem, Bardo, Nirmanakaya" |publisher=[[G. Schirmer Inc.]] |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/540/12419 |accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The symphony has a duration of roughly an hour and forty minutes is divided into twelve [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
# Before the Creation
# The Creation of the Cosmos
# The Creation of Sentient Beings
# The Creation of Human Beings
# Joy and Love
# Evil and Ignorance
# Suffering
# Compassion
# Death
# Judgement and Apocalypse
# Paradise
# Dedication

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for solo [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[bass-baritone]], a children's chorus, [[SATB]] choir, and a large orchestra consisting of [[piccolo]], two [[flute]]s, two [[oboe]]s, two [[clarinet]]s, [[E-flat clarinet]], [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[bass trombone]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion, [[harp]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the [[United States]] premiere, [[Paul Griffiths (writer)|Paul Griffiths]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' criticized the work's repetition, writing, "Given that the symphony, in 12 movements, summarized the entirety of creation and human life, the homogeneity that was also found in the musical invention was perplexing. 'Dedication of Merit' -- the last movement, a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] prayer for peace to emanate from virtue -- did not sound so different from 'The Creation of Sentient Beings' (the fourth movement) or, indeed, from most of the rest."  He nevertheless added, "But none of these was the moment that counted. What mattered was that right at the end, with an emphatic conclusion in sight, Mr. Glass drew back, took his music into darker, more chromatic territory, had his choir re-enter in moaning disconsolateness, and only then moved toward his close. Irony is not his strong point, but here it seemed that he was, within his own work, undercutting its preposterous pretensions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griffiths |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Griffiths (writer) |title=MUSIC REVIEW; Philip Glass Takes on a History of the Cosmos |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 9, 2000 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/09/arts/music-review-philip-glass-takes-on-a-history-of-the-cosmos.html |accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Hand of the Violinist (The Rhythms of the Bow)''''' is a 1912 painting by Italian [[Futurism|Futurist]] [[Giacomo Balla]], depicting a musician's hand and the neck of a [[violin]] "made to look like it's vibrating through space"—blurred and duplicated to suggest the motion of frenetic playing.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opam"/&gt; The painting, representative of Futurism's first wave, exhibits techniques of [[Divisionism]].&lt;ref name="Greenwald"/&gt;

Balla was inspired to use multiplication to imply motion by the photographic experiments of [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]].&lt;ref name="Greenwald"/&gt; As with other Futurists, he was also inspired by [[Cubism]]'s methods of capturing multiple perspectives; ''The Hand of the Violinist'' has been said to bring the viewer "inside the reverberations of the instrument itself", and has earned comparison with [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Nude Descending A Staircase]]''.&lt;ref name="Bertrand"/&gt;

From February to August 2014, the painting was part of the exhibit ''Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe'', at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Greenwald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guggenheim"/&gt;

'''The Sower''' ({{lang-sl|Sejalec}}), created in 1907, is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by the [[Slovene Impressionism|Slovene Impressionist]] painter and musician [[Ivan Grohar]]. It is an image of a peasant sowing seeds on a ploughed field in an early and foggy morning. A [[hayrack]], typical of the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene]] landscape, stands in the back, and even farther, the rocks of the small hill [[Kamnitnik]] near [[Škofja Loka]]. It has been a [[metaphor]] for the 19th-century myth of [[Slovenes]] as a vigorous nation in front of an unclear destiny,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ng-slo.si/default.asp?id=29&amp;prikaz=opis&amp;p=1 |title=Slovenska moderna |publisher=National Gallery of Slovenia |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Slovene Early Modernism |first=Andrej |last=Smrekar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026195245/http://www.ng-slo.si/default.asp?id=29&amp;prikaz=opis&amp;p=1 |archivedate=2013-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a symbol for the Slovene nation that sows in order that it could harvest, and a depiction of human interrelatedness with the nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gorenjskiglas.si/novice/gg_plus/index.php?action=clanek&amp;id=22034 |title=Je človek še Sejalec |trans-title=Is a Man Still a Sower |language=Slovenian |first=Miha |last=Naglič |date=6 June 2008 |newspaper=Gorenjski glas |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208093450/http://www.gorenjskiglas.si/novice/gg_plus/index.php?action=clanek&amp;id=22034 |archivedate=8 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a reflection of the context of Slovene transition from a rural to an urban culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/pogled-na/ivan-grohar-sejalec/ |title=Pogled na ...: Ivan Grohar, Sejalec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=A Look on...: Ivan Grohar, ''The Sower'' |publisher=RTV Slovenija |date=4 December 2007 |first=Andrej |last=Smrekar |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905131330/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/pogled-na/ivan-grohar-sejalec/ |archivedate=5 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become one of the most characteristic and established Slovene creations in visual arts. It has been used by the [[IRWIN]] art group as well as the [[Semenarna Ljubljana]] seed company, and is depicted on the [[Slovenian 5 cent euro coin]].

'''''Very Short Introductions''''' ('''''VSI''''') are a [[book series]] published by the [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP). The books are concise introductions to particular subjects, intended for a general audience but written by experts. Most are under 200 pages long. While authors may present personal viewpoints, the books are meant to be "balanced and complete" as well as thought provoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/series/VeryShortIntroductions/|title=Very Short Introductions|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series began in 1995, and by April 2018 there were 607 titles, published or announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/v/very-short-introductions-vsi/|title=Very Short Introductions – General Series|publisher=Oxford University Press (UK)|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oup"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/series/VeryShortIntroductions/ |title=Very Short Introductions |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books have been commercially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/academic/series/general/vsi/9780199590599.do?sortby=pubDateAscend&amp;page=32&amp;thumbby=10&amp;thumbby_crawl=10 |title=Languages: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press (UK) |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224101632/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/academic/series/general/vsi/9780199590599.do?sortby=pubDateAscend&amp;page=32&amp;thumbby=10&amp;thumbby_crawl=10 |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and have been published in more than 25 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glendinning|first=Simon|title=Derrida: A Very Short Introduction|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-280345-0|page=ii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions can subscribe to an online service to allow their users to read the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veryshortintroductions.com/ |title=Very Short Introductions |publisher=Oxford University Press (UK) |accessdate=2015-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the books have been written specifically for the series, but around 60 were recycled from earlier OUP publications: several had been in OUP's ''[[Past Masters (book series)|Past Masters]]'' series, and numbers 17–24 used chapters from ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Britain'' (1984).

''Not to be confused with maritime artist [[William John Huggins]] (1781-1845).''

'''William Huggins''' (May 1820 – 25 February 1884)&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Huggins, William (1820-1884)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[English people|English]] artist, from [[Liverpool]], who specialised in drawing animals.&lt;ref name=burlington&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.burlington.co.uk/artist-biography/william-huggins.html|title=William Huggins|work=Burlington Paintings|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huggins was a member of the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=burlington/&gt; He enjoyed visiting [[Wombwell's Travelling Menagerie]], an animal circus, and the Liverpool [[Zoological Gardens]].&lt;ref name=leicestergalleries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestergalleries.com/index.pl?isa=Metadot::SystemApp::ArtistSearch;op=detail;artist=121;show_bio=1;printable=1|title=WILLIAM  HUGGINS Artist Biography|work=Peter Nahum|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huggins has been compared to fellow Liverpool artist [[George Stubbs]]&lt;ref name=leicestergalleries/&gt; and is known for keeping his house full of pets.&lt;ref name=Christie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1368904|title=William Huggins (1820-1884)|work=[[Christie's]]|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simfineart/&gt;

==Life==
William Huggins was born in Liverpool. His parents were called Samuel and Elizabeth. He received his first instruction in drawing at the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Mechanics' Institution]]. He won a prize for "Adam's Vision of the Death of Abel" and successfully entered work to be shown at the [[Liverpool Academy of Arts]] whilst fifteen years old.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He drew from life using the classes at the Academy of Arts or by sketching the animals in Liverpool's zoo.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He travelled further afield to see exotic animals at the unusual [[George Wombwell|Wombwell’s Travelling Menagerie]].&lt;ref name=simfineart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simfineart.com/paint/huggins.htm|title=Sim Fine Art, William Huggins (1820-1884)|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His animal work was admired and compared to [[George Stubbs|Stubbs]]. Huggins was magnanimous in acknowledging Stubbs' influence and this contrasts with a later comparison that was made with [[Edwin Henry Landseer|Landseer]] where Huggins felt insulted. Huggins pictures of exotic animals were much admired but they are noted for lack of background as Huggins never saw them in their own habitat.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
[[File:HugglesCatst.jpg|thumb|left|Lion and Lioness; a pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redfoxfineart.com/inventory_artist_detail.php?id=4000&amp;artist_id=7026 W. Huggins] (Red Fox Fine Art)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1845 Huggins changed his themes away from animals and chickens. His paintings were based on literary themes from Milton, Shelley and [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser's]] "[[The Faerie Queene]]" and [[Thomas Moore|Moore's]] "Enchantress and Nourmahal"&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;
[[File:Cattle watering 1871.jpg|thumb|right|Cattle watering (1871)]]
Huggins first exhibited "Androcles and the lion" at the [[Royal Academy]] and made successful entries from 1846 until he was in his seventies. In addition he showed his paintings at most of the major cities in Great Britain.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He was influenced in his use of glazes by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] who also had exhibitions there.&lt;ref name=leicestergalleries/&gt;&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=875122|title=Current and Forthcoming Exhibitions|work=|page=641|volume=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a full member of the Liverpool Academy in 1850 (resigning in 1856), but never became an [[Royal Academy|RA (Royal Academician)]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

In 1861 Huggins moved to [[Chester]] where he lived with his brother, Samuel, until 1865. Huggins work at this time moved from animals to buildings (his brother, [[Samuel Huggins|Samuel]] was a notable architectural writer). He painted [[Chester Cathedral]] which his brother was to go on to defend when it was to be restored.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Nicholson, ‘Huggins, Samuel (1811–1885)’, rev. Valerie Scott, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14050, accessed 2 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving his brother, he painted the "Stones of Chester, or Ruins of St. John's" (1874) and the "Salmon Trap on the Dee". He moved to [[Betws-y-Coed]] in 1876 so that he could paint landscapes. One painting that resulted was, "The Fairy Glen" which was exhibited in Liverpool in 1877.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Huggins eventually moved from Wales and settled in and died in the [[Cheshire]] village of [[Christleton]] on 25 February 1884,&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Albert Nicholson, ‘Huggins, William (1820–1884)’, rev. Mark Pottle, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 ;online edn, Jan 2007 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14052, accessed 2 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; just a year before his brother, [[Samuel Huggins|Samuel]].  The brothers were buried in [[St James' Church, Christleton]], and the headstone of their grave is a Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1187247|desc= Headstone of William Huggins, Churchyard of St.James|access-date= 8 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

Huggins' horses, cattle, and poultry pictures were his best and most characteristic work, good in drawing, and remarkable for brilliance of colour.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; "Tried Friends", purchased by the Liverpool corporation, illustrates his use of transparent glazes over a white ground. Huggins' preferred medium was painting on white millboard from pencil outlines.&lt;ref name=victorianweb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/huggins/paintings/2.html|title=Barn Door Fowl (Rhode Island Reds) by William Huggins|author=Sally Burgess and Peter Nahum|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huggins portrait include one of the master of the [[Holcombe Hunt]], his brother Samuel and himself. He included his wife in "Aerial combat, the fight between the Eagle and the Serpent" which he painted in his literary phase and which illustrated [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley's]] "Revolt of Islam."

Huggins has nearly 60 paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Art UK bio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to art-historian and gallery owner [[Rupert Maas]], "Huggins was an eccentric individual. He preferred the company of animals, especially chickens, than of his fellow men. He hated travelling through tunnels, and so would get off the train before Liverpool and walk the rest of the way home.  His epitaph, which he composed himself, read: 'A just and compassionate man who would neither tread on a worm, nor cringe to an Emperor'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/huggins/index.html |title=William Huggins |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=12 August 2001 |accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wimbledon College of Arts''', formerly '''Wimbledon School of Art''', is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]]. It is located in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] and [[Merton Park]], [[South West (London sub region)|South West London]].

==History==

The foundation of Wimbledon College of Arts goes back to 1890, when an art class for the [[Rutlish School|Rutlish School for Boys]] was started. Between 1904 and 1920 this was housed in the [[Wimbledon Technical Institute]] in Gladstone Road. It became independent in 1930 and moved to Merton Hall Road in 1940. Theatre design was taught from 1932, and became a department in 1948. BA courses were introduced from 1974, and MA courses from 1984. In 1993 the school, which previously had been controlled by the [[London Borough of Merton]], was incorporated as an independent higher education institution, and from 1995 awarded degrees accredited by the [[University of Surrey]].&lt;ref name=qaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ual/&gt;

Wimbledon School of Art became part of the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2006 and was renamed Wimbledon College of Art. In 2013 it was renamed Wimbledon College of Arts.

Wimbledon delivers specialist art, design and theatre courses ranging from [[undergraduate]] to [[postgraduate]], as well as providing research supervision for students undertaking a research programme of study.

The collection is owned by the house of [[Waldburg-Wolfegg]] and hosted in [[Schloss Wolfegg]]. Among its most famous pieces were the [[Waldseemüller map]], the [[Mittelalterliches Hausbuch]] and the [[Kleiner Klebeband]], all of which were sold in the early 21st century though.
