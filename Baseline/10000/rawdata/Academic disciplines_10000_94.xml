'''50 Things That Made the Modern Economy''' began as a weekly economic history [[Radio documentary|documentary radio]] series on the [[BBC World Service]] presented by economist and journalist [[Tim Harford]]. The first episode was broadcast on Saturday 5 November 2016, and all episodes are available as [[podcast]]s.

Harford explained his motivation "to paint a picture of economic change by telling the stories of the ideas, people, and tools that had far-reaching consequences". He was fascinated by the many unexpected outcomes, such as "the impact of the fridge on global politics, or of the gramophone on income inequality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/51st-thing-that-made-the-modern-economy "BBC World Service invites suggestions for the ’51st Thing’ that made the modern economy"], ''[[BBC World Service]]'', 19 August 2017. Retrieved on 10 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was subsequently released by Harford as a book titled '''Fifty Things That Made The Modern Economy''' in the UK published by [[Little, Brown Book Group|Little, Brown Books]], and as '''Fifty Inventions That Shaped The Modern Economy''' in the US published by [[Riverhead Books]]. The hardcover and eBook editions were released on 6 July 2017 in the UK and the US edition was released on 29 August 2017. A paperback edition has been announced for May 2018.

A public call was made for suggestions for a '''51st thing''' in August 2017. Harford chose his six favourite submissions for an online vote from late September to 6 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|title=Vote for the 51st Thing!|last=|first=|date=|website=BBC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005133320/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Y4Gn8gbQvp4X87wGLV3n4N/vote-for-the-51st-thing|archive-date=5 October 2017|dead-url=|access-date=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning item was announced as the [[Credit Card]] in an episode released on 28 October 2017.

Each of the nine-minute long programmes introduces the story of fifty products or inventions that have revolutionised the modern world.

Each episode was originally broadcast on BBC World Service, with a subsequent broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] and distribution as a BBC podcast.

In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Ackley function''' is a non-[[convex function]] used as a performance test problem for [[optimization algorithm]]s. It was proposed by David Ackley in his 1987 PhD Dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Ackley, D. H. (1987) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=sx_VBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Ackley%20function%22&amp;f=false A connectionist machine for genetic hillclimbing]", Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a 2-dimensional domain it is defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x,y) = -20&amp;\exp\left[-0.2\sqrt{0.5\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}\right] \\
&amp; {} -\exp\left[0.5\left(\cos 2\pi x + \cos 2\pi y \right)\right] + e + 20
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Its global optimum point is:  
:&lt;math&gt;f(0,0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

'''Algorithmic composition''' is the technique of using [[algorithm]]s to create [[music]].

Algorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to [[composer|compose]] music for centuries; the procedures used to plot [[Voice leading|voice-leading]] in Western [[counterpoint]], for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy.  The term is usually reserved, however, for the use of formal procedures to make music without human intervention, either through the introduction of [[Randomness|chance]] procedures or the use of [[computers]].

Some algorithms or data that have no immediate musical relevance are used by composers&lt;ref name="Music Algorithm Composition Inspiration"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Bruce L.|title=Algorithmic Composition as a Model of Creativity|journal=Organised Sound|date=December 1996|volume=1|issue=3|pages=157–165|doi=10.1017/S1355771896000222|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=50017|accessdate=3 January 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as creative inspiration for their music.  Algorithms such as [[fractals]], [[L-system]]s, [[statistics|statistical models]], and even arbitrary [[data]] (e.g. [[census]] figures, [[Geographic information system|GIS]] coordinates, or [[magnetic field]] measurements) have been used as source materials.

==Models for algorithmic composition==
Compositional algorithms are usually classified by the specific programming techniques they use. The results of the process can then be divided into 1) music composed by computer and 2) music composed with the aid of computer. Music may be considered composed by computer when the algorithm is able to make choices of its own during the creation process.

Another way to sort compositional algorithms is to examine the results of their compositional processes. Algorithms can either 1) provide notational information ([[sheet music]] or [[MIDI]]) for other instruments or 2) provide an independent way of [[sound synthesis]] (playing the composition by itself). There are also algorithms creating both notational data and sound synthesis.

One way to categorize compositional algorithms is by their structure and the way of processing data, as seen in this model of six partly overlapping types:&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos and Wiggins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02gw/papers/AISB99b.pdf |title=AI Methods for Algorithmic Composition: A Survey, a Critical View and Future Prospects |year=1999 |last1=Papadopoulos |first1=George |last2=Wiggins |first2=Geraint |journal=Proceedings from the AISB’99 Symposium on Musical Creativity, Edinburgh, Scotland |pages=110–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translational Models===
This is an approach to music synthesis that involves "translating" information from an existing non-musical medium into a new sound. The translation can be either rule-based or [[stochastic]].  For example, when translating a picture into sound, a [[jpeg]] image of a horizontal line may be interpreted in sound as a constant pitch, while an upwards-slanted line may be an ascending scale. Oftentimes, the software seeks to extract concepts or metaphors from the medium, (such as height or sentiment) and apply the extracted information to generate songs using the ways music theory typically represents those concepts. Another example is the translation of text into music,&lt;ref name="TransProse: Generating Music From Text" &gt;{{cite journal | last=Davis|first=Hannah| title= Generating Music from Literature| journal= Proceedings of the EACL Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature| year =2014|  url =https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Generating Music From Text" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicfromtext.com/ |title=Generating Music from Text }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can approach composition by extracting sentiment (positive or negative) from the text using [[machine learning]] methods like [[sentiment analysis]] and represents that sentiment in terms of chord quality such as minor (sad) or major (happy) chords in the musical output generated.&lt;ref name="Tambr: Generating Music From Text" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://tambr.ml |title=Tambr Music From Literature }}{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical models===
Mathematical models are based on mathematical [[equations]] and random events. The most common way to create compositions through mathematics is [[stochastic processes]]. In stochastic models a piece of music is composed as a result of non-[[deterministic]] methods. The compositional process is only partially controlled by the composer by weighting the possibilities of random events. Prominent examples of stochastic algorithms are [[Markov chains]] and various uses of [[Gaussian distributions]]. Stochastic algorithms are often used together with other algorithms in various decision-making processes.

Music has also been composed through natural phenomena. These chaotic models create compositions from the [[harmonic]] and inharmonic phenomena of nature. For example, since the 1970s [[fractals]] have been studied also as models for algorithmic composition.

As an example of deterministic compositions through mathematical models, the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] provides an option to play an [[integer sequence]] as [[12-tone equal temperament]] music.  (It is initially set to convert each integer to a note on an 88-key [[musical keyboard]] by computing the integer [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 88, at a steady rhythm. Thus 123456, the natural numbers, equals half of a chromatic scale.) As another example, the all-interval series has been used for computer-aided composition &lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Toro, Carlos Agon, Camilo Rueda, Gerard Assayag. "[http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol86No2/17Vol86No2.pdf GELISP: A FRAMEWORK TO REPRESENT MUSICAL CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS AND SEARCH STRATEGIES]." Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology 86 (2). 2016. 327-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge-based systems===
One way to create compositions is to isolate the aesthetic code of a certain musical genre and use this code to create new similar compositions. [[Knowledge-based systems]] are based on a pre-made set of arguments that can be used to compose new works of the same style or genre. Usually this is accomplished by a set of tests or rules requiring fulfillment for the composition to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Brown |first=Silas |date=1997 |title=Algorithmic Composition and Reductionist Analysis: Can a Machine Compose? |url=http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/clara/article.htm |magazine= CamNotes |publisher=Cambridge University New Music Society |access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammars===
Music can also be examined as a language with a distinctive [[grammar]] set. Compositions are created by first constructing a musical grammar, which is then used to create comprehensible musical pieces. Grammars often include rules for macro-level composing, for instance [[harmonies]] and [[rhythm]], rather than single notes.

===Evolutionary methods===
[[Evolutionary music|Evolutionary methods of composing music]] are based on [[genetic algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Fox 2006 [https://www.aaai.org/Papers/FLAIRS/2006/Flairs06-047.pdf Genetic Hierarchical Music Structures] (American Association for Artificial Intelligence)&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is being built by the means of [[evolutionary]] process. Through [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]], different solutions evolve towards a suitable musical piece. Iterative action of the algorithm cuts out bad solutions and creates new ones from those surviving the process. The results of the process are supervised by the critic, a vital part of the algorithm controlling the quality of created compositions.

===Evo-Devo approach===
[[evolutionary algorithm|Evolutionary]] methods, combined with developmental processes, constitute the ''evo-devo'' approach for generation and optimization of complex structures. These methods have also been applied to music composition, where the musical structure is obtained by an iterative process that transform a very simple composition (made of a few notes) into a complex fully-fledged piece (be it a score, or a MIDI file).&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ball|first=Philip| title= Algorithmic Rapture| journal= Nature| volume= 188| year =2012| pages= 456| url =http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/488458a | doi = 10.1038/488458a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AI survey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=JD|last2=Vico|first2=F|title=AI Methods in Algorithmic Composition: A Comprehensive Survey.|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|date=2013|volume=48|pages=513–582|doi=10.1613/jair.3908|url=http://www.jair.org/media/3908/live-3908-7454-jair.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems that learn===
{{further|Machine improvisation|Machine listening|Machine learning}}
Learning systems are programs that have no given knowledge of the genre of music they are working with. Instead, they collect the learning material by themselves from the example material supplied by the user or programmer. The material is then processed into a piece of music similar to the example material. This method of algorithmic composition is strongly linked to algorithmic modeling of style,&lt;ref&gt;S. Dubnov, G. Assayag, O. Lartillot, G. Bejerano, "[http://cms2.unige.ch/fapse/neuroemo/pdf/JournalDubnov.pdf Using Machine-Learning Methods for Musical Style Modeling]", IEEE Computers, 36 (10), pp. 73-80, Oct. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[machine improvisation]], and such studies as [[cognitive science]] and the study of [[neural networks]]. Assayag and Dubnov &lt;ref&gt;G. Assayag, S. Dubnov, O. Delerue, "[http://articles.ircam.fr/textes/Assayag99a/index.pdf Guessing the Composer's Mind : Applying Universal Prediction to Musical Style]", In Proceedings of International Computer Music Conference, Beijing, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a variable length [[Markov model]] to learn motif and phrase continuations of different length. Marchini and Purwins &lt;ref name="Marchini"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23126-1_14 |title=Unsupervised Analysis and Generation of Audio Percussion Sequences |year=2011 |last1=Marchini |first1=Marco |last2=Purwins |first2=Hendrik |booktitle=Exploring Music Contents |pages=205–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a system that learns the structure of an audio recording of a rhythmical percussion fragment using unsupervised clustering and variable length Markov chains and that synthesizes musical variations from it.

===Hybrid systems===
Programs based on a single algorithmic model rarely succeed in creating aesthetically satisfying results. For that reason algorithms of different type are often used together to combine the strengths and diminish the weaknesses of these algorithms. Creating hybrid systems for music composition has opened up the field of algorithmic composition and created also many brand new ways to construct compositions algorithmically.  The only major problem with hybrid systems is their growing complexity and the need of resources to combine and test these algorithms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21319">The '''artificial pancreas''' is a technology in development to help people with [[diabetes]], primarily type 1, automatically and continuously control their [[blood glucose level]] by providing the substitute [[endocrine]] functionality of a healthy [[pancreas]].

The endocrine functionality of the pancreas is provided by [[Pancreatic islets|islet cells]] which produce the hormones [[insulin]] and [[glucagon]]. Artificial pancreatic technology mimics the secretion of these hormones into the bloodstream in response to the body's changing blood glucose levels. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is crucial to the function of the brain, liver, and kidneys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://columbiasurgery.org/pancreas/pancreas-and-its-functions|title=The Pancreas and Its Functions {{!}} Columbia University Department of Surgery|website=columbiasurgery.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, for type 1 patients, it is necessary that the levels be kept balanced when the body cannot produce insulin itself.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The artificial pancreas is a broad term for different [[Biological engineering|bio-engineering]] strategies currently in development to achieve these requirements. Different bio-engineering approaches under consideration include:

* the [[medical equipment]] approach—using an [[insulin pump]] under [[control theory|closed loop control]] using real-time feedback data from a [[continuous glucose monitor|continuous blood glucose monitor]].
* the [[Physiology|physiological]] approach—the development of a treatment with engineered [[Stem cell|stem cells]] to be integrated into the body to provide functional blood glucose regulation.

==Approaches==

===Medical equipment===
The medical equipment approach involves combining a continuous glucose monitor and an implanted insulin pump that can function together with a computer-controlled algorithm to replace the normal function of the pancreas.&lt;ref name="Gingras2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gingras V, Taleb N, Roy-Fleming A, Legault L, Rabasa-Lhoret R | title = The challenges of achieving postprandial glucose control using closed-loop systems in patients with type 1 diabetes | journal = Diabetes, Obesity &amp; Metabolism | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 245–256 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28675686 | doi = 10.1111/dom.13052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uduku C, Oliver N | title = Pharmacological aspects of closed loop insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes | journal = Current Opinion in Pharmacology | volume = 36 | pages = 29–33 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28802779 | doi = 10.1016/j.coph.2017.07.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graf A, McAuley SA, Sims C, Ulloa J, Jenkins AJ, Voskanyan G, O'Neal DN | title = Moving Toward a Unified Platform for Insulin Delivery and Sensing of Inputs Relevant to an Artificial Pancreas | journal = Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 308–314 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28264192 | pmc = 5478040 | doi = 10.1177/1932296816682762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of continuous glucose monitors has led to the progress in artificial pancreas technology using this integrated system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Apablaza P, Soto N, Codner E | title = [From insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring to the artificial pancreas] | journal = Revista Medica De Chile | volume = 145 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–640 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28898340 | doi = 10.4067/S0034-98872017000500011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Continuous Glucose Monitors ====
[[Image:Artificial Pancreas.jpg|thumb|Artificial pancreas feedback system |alt=]]

The original devices for use in type 1 diabetes were [[Glucose meter|blood glucose meters]]. Continuous blood glucose monitors are one of the set of devices that make up an artificial pancreas device system, the other being an insulin pump, and a glucose meter to calibrate the device.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/artificialpancreas/ucm259548.htm#artificial|title=Artificial Pancreas Device System - What is the pancreas?  What is an artificial pancreas device system?|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous glucose monitors are a more recent breakthrough and have begun to hit the markets for patient use after approval from the FDA. Both the traditional and the continuous monitor require manual insulin delivery or carbohydrate intake depending on the readings from the devices. While the traditional blood glucose meters require the user to prick their finger every few hours to obtain data, continuous monitors use sensors placed just under the skin on the arm or abdomen to deliver blood sugar level data to receivers or smartphone apps as often as every few minutes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The sensors can be used for up to ten days.  A number of different continuous monitors are currently approved by the FDA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managedcaremag.com/archives/2018/7/first-four-continuous-glucose-monitors|title=The First Four Continuous Glucose Monitors|date=2018-07-04|work=Managed Care magazine|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continuous glucose monitor (CGM) was approved in December 2016. Developed by [[Dexcom]], the G5 Mobile Continuous Monitoring System requires users to prick their fingers twice a day (as opposed to the typical average 8 times daily with the traditional meters) in order to calibrate the sensors. The sensors last up to seven days. The device uses Bluetooth technology to warn the user either through a handheld receiver or app on a smartphone if blood glucose levels reach below a certain point. The cost for this device excluding any co-insurance is an estimated $4,800 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:BGM twopart.JPG|alt=The white sensor is fixed to the upper arm and scanned with the reader. The reader is showing (top to bottom) days to replacement of sensor (11), current BG (7,4) &amp; change (-&gt; i.e. steady) and a diagram of the latest BG levels.|thumb|Blood glucose meter FreeStyle Libre from Abbott. ]]
[[Abbott Laboratories|Abbott Laboratories']] FreeStyle Libre CGM was approved in September 2017. It does not support smartphone use. This device does not require finger pricks at all and the sensor, placed on the upper arm, lasts 10 days. The estimated cost for this monitor is $1,300 a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dexcom's next G6 model CGM was approved in March 2018, which can last up to ten days and does not need finger prick calibration. Like Medtronic's monitor, it can predict glucose level trends. It is compatible for integration into insulin pumps. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Closed-Loop Systems ====
Unlike the continuous sensor alone, the closed-loop system requires no user input in response to reading from the monitor; the monitor and insulin pump system automatically delivers the correct amount of hormone calculated from the readings transmitted. The system is what makes up the artificial pancreas device.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elleri D, Dunger DB, Hovorka R | title = Closed-loop insulin delivery for treatment of type 1 diabetes | language = En | journal = BMC Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 120 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071283 | doi = 10.1186/1741-7015-9-120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== MiniMed 670G =====
In September 2016, the FDA approved the [[Medtronic MiniMed 670G]], which was the first approved hybrid [[Closed-loop transfer function|closed loop system]]. The device senses a diabetic person's [[Basal (medicine)|basal]] insulin requirement and automatically adjusts its delivery to the body.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/7993/20170111141252/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm522764.htm|title=Recently-Approved Devices - The 670G System - P160017|last=Health|first=Center for Devices and Radiological|website=wayback.archive-it.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made up of a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a glucose meter for calibration. It automatically functions to modify the level of insulin delivery based off the detection of blood glucose levels by continuous monitor. It does this by sending the blood glucose data through an algorithm that analyzes and makes the subsequent adjustments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The system has two modes. Manual mode lets the user choose the rate at which basal insulin is delivered. Auto mode regulates basal insulin levels from the continuous monitor's readings every five minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/products/minimed-670g-insulin-pump-system|title=MiniMed 670G Insulin Pump System {{!}} World's First Hybrid Closed Loop System|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was originally available only to those aged 14 or older, and in June 2018 was approved by the FDA for use in children aged 7-14. Families have reported better sleep quality from use of the new system, as they do not have to worry about manually checking blood glucose levels during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/fda-approves-minimed-670g-system-children-7-13/|title=FDA Approves the MiniMed 670G System for Children 7-13 - The LOOP Blog|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full cost of the system is $3700, but patients have the opportunity to get it for less.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medtronicdiabetes.com/loop-blog/update-minimed-670g-availability/|title=Update on MiniMed 670G Availability|website=www.medtronicdiabetes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== iLet Bionic Pancreas =====
A team at [[Boston University]] working in collaboration with [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] on a dual hormone artificial pancreas system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionicpancreas.org/|title=bionicpancreas.org|website=www.bionicpancreas.org|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; began clinical trials on their device called the Bionic Pancreas in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/beta-bionics-ilet-update#1|title=Update on the iLet Bionic Pancreas Closed Loop System|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Public Benefit Corporation [[Beta Bionics]] was formed. In conjunction with the formation of the company, Beta Bionics changed the preliminary name for their device from the Bionic Pancreas to the iLet.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The device uses a closed-loop system to deliver both insulin and glucagon in response to sensed blood glucose levels. While not yet approved for public use, the 4th generation iLet prototype, presented in 2017, is around the size of an iPhone, with a touchscreen interface. It contain two chambers for both insulin and glucagon, and the device is configurable for use with only one hormone, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2017/bionic-pancreas-clinical-trial/|title=Bionic Pancreas Passes Critical Science Hurdle {{!}} BU Today {{!}} Boston University|work=BU Today|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While trials continue to be run, the iLet has a projected final approval for the insulin-only system in 2020.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===== Current Studies =====
Four studies on different artificial pancreas systems are being conducted starting in 2017 and going into the near future. The projects are funded by the [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]](NIDDK), and are the final part of testing the devices before applying for approval for use. Participants in the studies are able to live their lives at home while using the devices and being monitored remotely for safety, efficacy, and a number of other factors.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medlineplus.gov/magazine/issues/spring17/articles/spring17pg15-16.html|title=The Miracle of an Artificial Pancreas {{!}} NIH MedlinePlus the Magazine|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Closed-Loop trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02844517|International Diabetes Closed Loop (iDCL) Trial: Research Site Training Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by researchers from the [[University of Virginia]], is testing a closed-loop system called inControl, which has a smartphone user interface. 240 people of ages 14 and up are participating for 6 months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A full-year trial led by researchers from the [[University of Cambridge]] started in May 2017 and has enrolled an estimated 150 participants of ages 6 to 18 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The artificial pancreas system being studied uses a smartphone and has a low glucose feature to improve glucose level control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT02925299|Day and Night Closed-loop in Young People With Type 1 Diabetes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Diabetes Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in collaboration with [[Rabin Medical Center|Schneider Children's Medical Center]] in Petah Tikva, Israel, are planning a 6-month study that will begin in early 2019 and will involve 112 adolescents and young adults, ages 14 to 30.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{ClinicalTrialsGov|NCT03040414|Fuzzy Logic Automated Insulin Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main object of the study is to compare the current Medtronic 670G system to a new Medtronic-developed system. The new system has programming that aims to improve glucose control around mealtime, which is still a big challenge in the field.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The current 6-month study lead by the Bionic Pancreas team started in mid-2018 and enrolled 312 participants of ages 18 and above.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Physiological ===
[[Image:Bio-artificial pancreas with Islet Sheet technology.JPG|thumb|right|300px|'''The Bio-artificial pancreas''': this diagram shows a cross section of [[tissue engineering|bio-engineered tissue]] with encapsulated [[islets of Langerhans|islet cells]] which deliver [[endocrine]] [[pancreas#Function|hormones]] in response to [[glucose]].]]

The biotechnical company Defymed, based in France, is developing an implantable bio-artificial device called MailPan which features a bio-compatible membrane with [[Semipermeable membrane|selective permeability]] to encapsulate different cells types, including pancreatic [[Beta cell|beta cells]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3749642,00.html|title=Israeli and French Biotech Companies Partner to Fight Diabetes With Bio-Artificial Pancreas|date=2018-11-12|work=CTECH - www.calcalistech.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantation of the device does not require conjunctive immuno-supressive therapy because the membrane prevents antibodies of the patient from entering the device and damaging the encapsulated cells. After being surgically implanted, the membrane sheet will be viable for years.The cells that the device holds can be produced from stem cells rather than human donors, and may also be replaced over time using input and output connections without surgery.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defymed.com/mailpan/|title=MailPan ® BioArtificial Pancreas {{!}} Defymed, advanced therapies inspired for you|work=Defymed|access-date=2018-11-28|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defymed is partially funded by JDRF, formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, but is now defined as an organization for all ages and all stages of type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180212005894/en/Innovative-Medical-Devices-Treatment-Diabetes-Defymed-Strengthens|title=Innovative Medical Devices for the Treatment of Diabetes, Defymed Strengthens Its Position as a Worldwide Leader|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jdrf.ca/who-we-are/what-does-jdrf-stand-for/|title=What Does JDRF Stand For?|last=Canada|first=JDRF|website=JDRF Canada|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, it was announced that Defymed would partner with the Israel-based Kadimastem, a bio-pharmaceutical company developing stem-cell based regenerative therapies, to receive a two-year grant worth approximately $1.47 million for the development of a bio-artificial pancreas that would treat type 1 diabetes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/|title=Kadimastem - Stem Cell to Cure Diseases|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kadimastem's stem cell technology uses differentiation of human embryonic stem cells to obtain pancreatic endocrine cells. These include insulin-producing beta cells, as well as alpha cells, which produce glucagon. Both cells arrange in islet-like clusters, mimicking the structure of the pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kadimastem.com/regenerative-medicine/17/diabetes|title=Diabetes - Kadimastem|website=www.kadimastem.com|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the partnership is to combine both technologies in a bio-artificial pancreas device, which releases insulin in response to blood glucose levels, to bring to clinical trial stages.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The San Diego, California based biotech company ViaCyte has also developed a product aiming to provide a solution for type 1 diabetes which uses an encapsulation device made of a semi-permeable immune reaction-protective membrane. The device contains pancreatic [[Progenitor cell|progenitor cells]] that have been differentiated from embryonic stem cells.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/two-year-data-from-viacytes-step-one-clinical-trial-presented-at-ada-2018-300671013.html|title=Two-year Data from ViaCyte's STEP ONE Clinical Trial Presented at ADA 2018|last=Inc.|first=ViaCyte,|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/products/pec%E2%80%90encap-vc-01|title=PEC‐Encap™ (VC-01™)|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After surgical implantation in an outpatient procedure, the cells mature into endocrine cells which arrange in islet-like clusters and mimic the function of the pancreas, producing insulin and glucagon.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacyte.com/|title=Home|work=Viacyte, Inc.|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schulz TC | title = Concise Review: Manufacturing of Pancreatic Endoderm Cells for Clinical Trials in Type 1 Diabetes | journal = Stem Cells Translational Medicine | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 927–31 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26062982 | pmc = 4511151 | doi = 10.5966/sctm.2015-0058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The technology advanced from pre-clinical studies to FDA approval for phase 1 clinical trials in 2014, and presented two-year data from the trial in June 2018.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; They reported that their product, called PEC-Encap, has so far been safe and well tolerated in patients at a dose below therapeutic levels. The encapsulated cells were able to survive and mature after implantation, and immune system rejection was decreased due to the protective membrane. The second phase of the trial will evaluate the efficacy of the product.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; ViaCyte has also been receiving financial support from JDRF on this project.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Initiatives around the globe==
In the United States in 2006, JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) launched a multi-year initiative to help accelerate the development, regulatory approval, and acceptance of continuous glucose monitoring and artificial pancreas technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdrf.org/artificialpancreas Artificial Pancreas Project : JDRF&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/10/type-1-diabetes-insurance-companies/|title=Insurers can profit while improving the lives of people with type 1 diabetes|last=KMorandi says|date=2017-08-10|website=STAT|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassroots efforts to create and commercialize a fully automated artificial pancreas system have also arisen directly from patient advocates and the diabetes community.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, Dan (24 December 2014) [https://www.wired.com/2014/12/diabetes-patients-hacking-together-diy-bionic-pancreases/] WIRED Magazine, Diabetes Patients Are Hacking Their Way Toward a Bionic Pancreas&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bigfoot Biomedical]], a company founded by parents of children with T1D have created algorithms and are developing a closed loop device that monitor blood sugar and appropriately provide insulin.&lt;ref&gt;Knutson, Ryan (8 June 2015) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/computer-experts-deliver-insulin-to-diabetic-kids-1433805697] The Wall Street Journal, Computer Experts Deliver Insulin to Diabetic Kids&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winners 2007/2008==
In 2007/2008 the final was held at [[Queen Elizabeth II Law Courts, Liverpool]] on Saturday 1 March 2008.  The sixteen Regional Heat winners from across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland competed in three preliminary rounds in order to determine the top two finalist teams that would progress onto the Grand Final.

Queen Elizabeth's Community College, [[Crediton]] (winners of the Plymouth Regional Heat) and Whitley Bay High School (winners of the Newcastle Regional Heat) were announced as the two finalists.

In the Grand Final the teams presented the case of Jordan Potter before a panel of five judges and senior counsel from across the UK: HHJ Clifton, HHJ Harris QC, Brian Kennedy QC, [[Herbert Kerrigan]] QC and HHJ Roddy.

Whitley Bay High School were declared national champions.  HHJ Clifton praised both teams on the high standard of their performances, noting the dramatic flair of the witnesses and the quality of all four barristers.

The new national champions received their trophy and prizes from the judges.

==Winners 2006/2007==
A total of 158 schools had taken part in the Competition since heats began in November the previous year.

Lumen Christi College was the winner of the 2006/2007 competition. The Lumen Christi student who played the role of a barrister said: "The opportunity to work with real barristers and prepare a case has been a great experience. It gave us a real insight into how the justice system works"{{cite this quote|date=December 2013}} Her teacher added: "I was impressed by how a number of shy students flourished and came out of their shells by taking part in the competition and the level of articulation and analytical skills was heartening to see. The actual day in court showed me how readily students rose to the challenge of such a pressurised setting. Their confidence shone through. The school was enlivened by our victory and the level of support has been fantastic."{{cite this quote|date=December 2013}}

==Background==
[[File:Paris July 1968.jpg|thumb|Posters in Paris in July 1968]]

The ''Atelier Populaire'', who designed and printed the posters, were a group of [[Marxist]] artists and art students who occupied the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] during with the wave of [[wildcat strikes]] in May 1968.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; Using a [[silk-screen]] printing press they produced thousands of posters at a time.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; They typically were printed on newssheet using a single colour, and use a simple [[iconography]] in which the factory represents the role of workers in society and the fist stands for solidarity and resistance (see right).&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

They comment on topics including the [[freedom of the press]] (see also [[Censorship in France]]), [[colonialism]] (see also [[French colonial empire]]) and the status of [[immigrant workers]] (see also [[Immigration to France]]).&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; The posters were also used to voice opposition to [[consumerism]] and were inspired by the [[Situationist International]]'s critique of the [[spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]] and [[Georges Perec]]'s 1965 novel ''[[Things: A Story of the Sixties]].&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

Though the posters display various styles, individual artists were never credited and each work was treated as the work of the collective.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; General assemblies (see [[General assembly (Occupy movement)]]) were held to discuss and vote on the posters.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/01/1968-paris-protest-posters-.html|title='Beauty Is in the Street' features 1968 Paris protest posters|date=January 1, 2012|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Liesl|last=Bradner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; In a 1969 book of the posters, the ''Atelier Populaire'' wrote "To use them for decorative purposes, to display them in bourgeois places of culture or to consider them as objects of aesthetic interest is to impair both their function and their effect."&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

Much of the imagery they created, including a poster of a truncheon-wielding [[riot police]]man (right) has since achieved iconic status.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; The posters were rarely saved but were collected by Kugelberg who staged an exhibition at London's [[Hayward Gallery]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; The exhibition commemorated the 40th anniversary of the protests.&lt;ref name=dd/&gt;

==Overview==

The book includes over 200 posters.&lt;ref name=int&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/four-corners-beauty-in-the-street|title=Four Corners: Beauty is in the Street|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=It's Nice That|first=Alex|last=Bec}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the exhibition which preceded it, the posters in the book are accompanied by photographs taken by Vermés of the students, the production process and the protests,&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt; many of which were previously unpublished.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;

The book also includes a foreword by Vermés, a founder of the ''Atelier Populaire'';&lt;ref name=ind/&gt; translations of first-hand accounts of students' and strikers' clashes with the police;&lt;ref name=int/&gt; manifestos and pamphlets;&lt;ref name=dd/&gt; a pictorial index, a bibliography, and a thumbnail gallery of posters that were not reproduced full-size.&lt;ref name=int/&gt;&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Justin McGuirk noted the continued relevance of "the spirit of '68" in the United Kingdom in the wake of the [[2010 United Kingdom student protests|2010 student protests]], describing the book as "a beautiful volume". McGuirk questioned the absence of political design from the 2010 protests and occupations, as well as the commercial [[street art]] of [[Banksy]] and [[Shepard Fairey]], and the contemporary popularity of the 1939 [[Keep Calm and Carry On]] poster.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/may/23/beauty-in-street-posters-protest|title=Beauty Is in the Street: the power of protest posters|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|first=Justin|last=McGuirk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}}s Liesl Bradner also argued for the book's relevance in 2012 after the [[Occupy movement]] and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s naming "the protester" as its [[Time Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Alex Bec of the art blog ''It's Nice That'' noted that despite the events of May 1968 having been well documented, "''Beauty is in the Street'' blew everything before it out of the water."&lt;ref name=int/&gt; Fíacha O'Dubhda of ''[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]'' described the book as one "that immerses the reader in the process through which spontaneous design and production were used to document, illustrate and instigate" the events of May 1968.&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/review/article/on-the-barricades|title=On the barricades|date=Summer 2011|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=[[Eye (magazine)|Eye]]|first=Fíacha|last=O'Dubhda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Before Jerusalem Fell''''' is a book written by [[Kenneth Gentry]] based on his [[PhD]] dissertation from [[Whitefield Theological Seminary]]. The book is currently in its third edition and is published by [[American Vision]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The book presents a sustained argument from fields such as [[biblical hermeneutics]], ancient history, [[textual criticism]], [[archaeology]], and [[Christian theology]] for why the [[Book of Revelation]] must have been written before the [[destruction of Jerusalem]] in AD 70, during the reign of Roman emperor [[Nero]]. Gentry argues that Nero Caesar is the "sixth king" presently ruling ({{bibleverse||Rev.|17:10}}) who functions in Revelation as the [[The Beast (Bible)|Beast]].

The book is controversial in that it goes against majority [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] and [[Dispensation (period)|Dispensational]] opinion that Revelation was written in the reign of [[Domitian]] in AD 95, though the pre-AD 70 date for Revelation was the dominant view of scholars in the 19th century and first two decades of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

'''CGIAR''' (formerly the '''Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research''') is a global partnership that unites organizations engaged in research for a food-secured future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902213810/http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR research is dedicated to reducing rural poverty, increasing food security, improving human health and nutrition, and ensuring sustainable management of natural resources. It is carried out by 15 centers that are members of the CGIAR Consortium, in close collaboration with hundreds of partners, including national and regional research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, development organizations, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902213810/http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this through a network of 15 research centers known as the [[CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Africa |url=http://www.cgiar.org/cgiar-consortium/research-centers/ |title=CGIAR |publisher=Consortium.cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These research centers are spread around the globe, with most centers located in the [[Global South]], at [[Center of origin|Vavilov Centers]] of agricultural crop genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenburg, Jr., Jack Ralph (2004) First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492-2000, Second Edition, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR research centers are generally run in partnership with other organizations, including national and regional agricultural research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector.

CGIAR is unusual in that it is not part of an international political institution such as the United Nations or the World Bank; it is an ad-hoc organization which receives funds from its members.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/2549/cgiar%4040_final_LOWRES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of CGIAR includes country governments, institutions, and philanthropic foundations including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO), the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[World Bank]], the European Commission, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Fund of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC Fund). In 2009 CGIAR had revenues of US$629 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgiar.org/publications/annual/cgiar-annualreport2010/cgiar-annualreport2010/cgiar_annual_report/2009_CGIAR_Full_Financial_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== CGIAR's vision ==
CGIAR's vision is to:

:Reduce poverty and hunger, improve human health and nutrition, and enhance ecosystem resilience through high-quality international agricultural research, partnership and leadership.

== Strategic objectives ==
CGIAR's vision is supported by four strategic objectives:

* Reducing [[rural poverty]]
* Improving [[food security]]
* Improving [[nutrition]] and [[health]]
* Sustainably managing [[natural resources]]

The Strategy and Results Framework&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/5224/CGIAR-SRF-March_2011_BROCHURE.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; describes how CGIAR intends to work towards those objectives.

== History ==
=== The early years ===
CGIAR arose in response to the widespread concern in the mid-20th century that rapid increases in human populations would soon lead to widespread [[famine]]. Starting in 1943, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the Mexican government laid the seeds for the [[Green Revolution]] when they established the Office of Special Studies, which resulted in the establishment of the [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([[IRRI]]) in 1960 and [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT) in 1963 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation, developing high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties that dramatically increased production of these staple cereals, and turned India, for example, from a country regularly facing starvation in the 1960s to a net exporter of cereals by the late-1970s. But it was clear that these foundations alone could not fund all the agricultural research and development efforts needed to feed the world's population. In 1969, the [[Pearson Commission on International Development]] urged the international community to undertake "intensive international effort" to support "research specializing in food supplies and tropical agriculture".

In 1970, the Rockefeller Foundation proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the [[World Bank]], FAO and UNDP, and CGIAR was established on May 19, 1971, to coordinate international agricultural research efforts aimed at reducing poverty and achieving [[food security]] in developing countries.

CGIAR originally supported four centres: CIMMYT; [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([[IRRI]]); the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT); and the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] (IITA). The initial focus on the staple cereals—rice, wheat and maize—widened during the 1970s to include cassava, chickpea, sorghum, potato, millet and other food crops, and encompassed livestock, farming systems, the conservation of genetic resources, plant nutrition, water management, policy research, and services to national agricultural research centers in developing countries. By 1983 there were 13 research centers around the world under its umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;Establishment of CGIAR - see Mark Dowie, ''American Foundations: An Investigative History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2001, (p.114)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and consolidation ===
By the 1990s the number of centers supported by CGIAR had grown to 18. Mergers between the two livestock centers the [[International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases]] (ILRAD) and the [[International Livestock Centre for Africa]] (ILCA)) and the absorption of work on bananas and plantains into the program of the [[International Plant Genetic Resources Institute]] (IPGRI; now [[Bioversity International]]) reduced the number to 16. Later another center (ISNAR) was absorbed{{clarification needed|date=March 2017 &lt;!--into what?--&gt;}}, reducing the total number of supported centers to 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/who/history/index.html#5 |title=History of CGIAR / CGIAR |publisher=Cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction in the number of supported centers was not enough to address problems facing the group. These included the logistics of funders and the group alike in dealing with a large number of centers. This led to the creation of three classes of centers, divided into high, medium, and low impact delivery. 

At the same time, a number of aid recipient countries like China, India, and Malaysia created their own development agencies and developed cadres of agricultural scientists. Private donors and industries also contributed, while research institutions in the rich world turned their attention to problems of the poor. CGIAR, however, failed to embrace these changes in any effective way.

=== CGIAR reforms ===
Seeking to increase its efficiency and build on its previous successes, CGIAR embarked on a program of reform in 2001. Key among the changes implemented was the adoption of Challenge Programs as a means of harnessing the strengths of the diverse centers to address major global or regional issues. Three Challenge Programs were established within the supported research centers and a fourth to FARA, a research forum in Africa:
* Water and Food, aimed at producing more food using less water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?ProjectID=60685 |title=Research for Development &gt; Water and Food Challenge Programme |publisher=DFID |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Including [[Basin Focal Projects]])
* HarvestPlus, to improve the micronutrient content of staple foods;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://knowledge.cta.int/en/S-T-Organisations/International/HarvestPlus |title=HarvestPlus / International / S&amp;T Organisations / Home - Knowledge for Development |publisher=Knowledge.cta.int |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Generation, aimed at increasing the use of [[plant genetic resources | crop genetic resources]] to create a new generation of plants that meet farmers and consumers needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpg/2008/369601/ |title=The Generation Challenge Programme Platform: Semantic Standards and Workbench for Crop Science |publisher=Hindawi.com |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A new CGIAR ===
Since CGIAR was established there have been large changes in the agricultural research "landscape". Fluctuations in food and energy prices and in financial markets are adding uncertainty to the environment in which farmers and consumers operate. Climate change will have a wide range of impacts on agriculture, with changes in growing conditions for crops, livestock, and fish and the pests and diseases that affect them. Droughts and storms are expected to increase in frequency and severity, undermining the efforts of farmers, foresters and fishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/15538-079b31d45081fe9c3dbc6ff34de4807e4.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - main document3 ivan.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will have a large impact on food security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19703.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, CGIAR embarked on a change process to improve the engagement between all stakeholders in international agricultural research for development—donors, researchers and beneficiaries—and to refocus the efforts of the centers on major global development challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yojana Sharma |url=http://www.scidev.net/en/features/a-revolution-to-combat-world-hunger.html |title=A revolution to combat world hunger |publisher=SciDev.Net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/changemanagement/briefs/march08.html |title=Browsing by Subject "CGIAR newsletters" |publisher=Cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key objective was to integrate the work of the centers and their partners, avoiding fragmentation and duplication of effort.

CGIAR components include the [[CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers]], the CGIAR Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905190501/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/ |archive-date=2011-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CGIAR Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecouncil.cgiar.org/ |title=Independent Science &amp; Partnership Council: ISPC home |publisher=Sciencecouncil.cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partners. Research is guided by the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/sites/cgiarfund.org/files/Documents/PDF/CGIAR-SRF-March%202011_BROCHURE.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331111653/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/sites/cgiarfund.org/files/Documents/PDF/CGIAR-SRF-March%202011_BROCHURE.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGIAR Consortium unites the centers supported by CGIAR; it coordinates limited research activities of about fifteen research projects (See list below) among the centers and provides donors with a single contact point to centers. The CGIAR Fund aims to harmonize the efforts of donors to contribute to agricultural research for development, increase the funding available by reducing or eliminating duplication of effort among the centers and promote greater financial stability. The CGIAR ISPC, appointed by the CGIAR Fund Council, provides expert advice to the funders of CGIAR, particularly in ensuring that CGIAR's research programs are aligned with the Strategy and Results Framework. It provides a bridge between the funders and the CGIAR Consortium. The hope was that the Strategy and Results Framework would provide the strategic direction for the centers and CGIAR Research Programs, ensuring that they focus on delivering measurable results that contribute to achieving CGIAR objectives. However the research programs were designed prior to the Framework being ready, so now some refitting will have to take place to get the programs inline with it.&lt;ref&gt;http://consortium.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CGIAR-SRF-Feb_20_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A biennial Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development (GCARD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=What is GCARD GCARD 2012 GCARD 2010 |url=http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/gcard/aboutGCARD |title=What is GCARD |publisher=EGFAR |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061054/http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/gcard/aboutGCARD |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a forum for closer engagement of developing countries and partners in developing and guiding the research and development agenda of the CGIAR Consortium and the CGIAR Fund.

The CGIAR Consortium was established in April 2010. It is based at the  [[Agropolis International|Agropolis campus]] in Montpellier. The CGIAR Fund was established in January 2010 and is based in Washington, DC.

====CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers====
The '''CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers''' was established in April 2010 to coordinate and support the work of the 15 international agricultural research centers supported by CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; It plays a central role in formulating the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework (SRF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consortium.cgiar.org/our-strategic-research-framework/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002728/http://consortium.cgiar.org/our-strategic-research-framework/ |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that guides the work of CGIAR supported centers on CGIAR funded research and developing CGIAR Research Programs under the SRF. The work of the CGIAR Consortium is governed by the Consortium Board, a 10-member panel that has fiduciary responsibility for CGIAR Research Programs, including monitoring and evaluation and reporting progress to donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/the-consortium-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034056/http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/the-consortium-board/ |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR Research Programs are approved and funded by the CGIAR Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711021646/http://www.cgiarfund.org/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a contractual basis through performance agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/how_the_fund_works |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101080923/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/how_the_fund_works |archive-date=2011-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new strategy and results framework was approved in 2015 and the portfolio of research programs revised. The systems programs dryland systems, aquatic agricultural systems, and Humidtropics ceased to be standalone programs, even though they were seen as what was new to the reformed CGIAR, but were not given a real chance to take off and prosper, mainly due to funding reductions, but also because of a refocus on commodity value chains. These commodity programs were renamed to, for example, RTB Systems Program or Rice Systems Program. Some work of the earlier systems programs were incorporated, but most was lost.

== Impacts of CGIAR ==
The impacts of CGIAR research have been extensively assessed, as demonstrated by a review article published in the journal ''Food Policy'' in 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Renkow, M. and Byerlee, D. 2010. The impacts of CGIAR research: A review of recent evidence. Food Policy, 35 (5):391-402&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the impact of the CGIAR centers has come from crop genetic improvement. The high-yielding wheat and rice varieties that were the foundation of the Green Revolution were the beginning of a long line of successes. An assessment of the impact of crop breeding efforts at CGIAR centers between 1965 and 1998 showed that 65 percent of the area planted to ten crops addressed by CGIAR—wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, barley, lentils, beans, cassava, and potatoes—was planted in improved varieties. Of this, 60 percent was sown with varieties with CGIAR ancestry (more than 90 percent in the case of lentils, beans, and cassava), and half of those varieties came from crosses made at a CGIAR center.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, R.E. 2003. Modern variety production: a synthesis. In: Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D. (Eds.), Crop Variety Improvement and its Effect on Productivity: The Impact of International Agricultural Research. [[CAB International|CABI]] Publishing, Wallingford, UK, pp. 427–446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, R.E. 2003. Production impacts of crop genetic improvement programmes. In: Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D. (Eds.), Crop Variety Improvement and its Effect on Productivity: The Impact of International Agricultural Research. CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK, pp. 447–472.&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary value of CGIAR's investment in crop improvement is huge, running into the billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raitzer, D.A. and Kelley, T.G. 2008. Benefit-cost meta-analysis of investment in the international agricultural research centers of the CGIAR. Agricultural Systems, 96 (1–3):108–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centers have also contributed to such fields as improving the nutritional value of staple crops; pest and disease control through breeding resistant varieties; integrated pest management and biological control (e.g., control of the cassava mealybug in sub-Saharan Africa through release of a predatory wasp); improvements in livestock and fish production systems; genetic resources characterization and conservation; improved natural resource management; and contributions to improved policies in numerous areas, including forestry, fertilizer, milk marketing, and genetic resources conservation and use. The introduction of no-tillage systems in the rice-wheat systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, for example, generated economic benefits of about US$165 million between 1990 and 2010 from an investment of only US$3.5 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Even the most conservative estimate of the measurable benefits of CGIAR research indicate US$2 in benefits for every US$1 invested.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/212527/SCBriefbfitcostan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chiller.jpg|thumb|right|[[York International]] water-cooled chiller]]
A '''chiller''' is a machine that removes heat from a liquid via a [[vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression]] or [[absorption refrigerator|absorption refrigeration cycle]]. This liquid can then be circulated through a [[heat exchanger]] to cool equipment, or another process stream (such as air or process water). As a necessary by product, refrigeration creates [[waste heat]] that must be exhausted to ambience, or for greater efficiency, recovered for heating purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Chilled water is used to [[Air conditioning|cool and dehumidify]] air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities. Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled systems can provide efficiency and [[Environmental issue|environmental impact]] advantages over air-cooled systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=water+chiller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8u6Q0v7QAhUlw4MKHdU-BxQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20chiller&amp;f=false|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W.

==Use in air conditioning==
[[File:Air Cooled Liquid Chiller.jpg|thumb|A liquid (glycol based) chiller with an air cooled condenser on the rooftop of a medium size commercial building.]]
In [[air conditioning]] systems, chilled water is typically distributed to heat exchangers, or '''coils''', in [[air handler]]s or other types of terminal devices which cool the air in their respective space(s). The water is then recirculated to the chiller to be recooled. These cooling coils transfer [[sensible heat]] and [[latent heat]] from the air to the chilled water, thus cooling and usually dehumidifying the air stream. A typical chiller for air conditioning applications is rated between 15 and 2000 [[Ton of refrigeration|tons]], and at least one manufacturer can produce chillers capable of up to 5,200 tons of cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TITAN Multistage Industrial Chillers (FORM 160.72-EG1)|publisher=York International|url=http://www.usair-eng.com/chillers/OMtitan.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chilled water temperatures can range from {{convert|35|to|45|F|C}}, depending upon application requirements.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers {{cite web |url=http://www.ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517162917/http://ashrae.org/publications/page/158 |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the chillers for air conditioning systems are not operable or they are in need of repair or replacement, emergency chillers may be used to supply chilled water. Rental chillers are mounted on a [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailer]] so that they can be quickly deployed to the site. Large chilled water [[hose]]s are used to connect between rental chillers and air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Request for Proposal #946 - Emergency Chillers Rentals|publisher=Montclair State University|url=http://www.montclair.edu/news/media/originals/Ad_Bid_946.pdf|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in industry==
In industrial application, chilled water or other liquid from the chiller is pumped through process or laboratory equipment.  Industrial chillers are used for controlled cooling of products, mechanisms and factory machinery in a wide range of industries.  They are often used in the plastic industries, injection and blow molding, metal working cutting oils, welding equipment, [[die-casting]] and machine tooling, chemical processing, pharmaceutical formulation, food and beverage processing, paper and cement processing, vacuum systems, X-ray diffraction, power supplies and power generation stations, analytical equipment, semiconductors, compressed air and gas cooling. They are also used to cool high-heat specialized items such as MRI machines and lasers, and in hospitals, hotels and campuses.

Chillers for industrial applications can be centralized, where a single chiller serves multiple cooling needs, or decentralized where each application or machine has its own chiller. Each approach has its advantages. It is also possible to have a combination of both centralized and decentralized chillers, especially if the cooling requirements are the same for some applications or points of use, but not all.

Decentralized chillers are usually small in size and cooling capacity, usually from {{convert|0.2|to|10|ST|LT t|3}}.  Centralized chillers generally have capacities ranging from ten tons to hundreds or thousands of tons.

Chilled water is used to [[Air conditioning|cool and dehumidify]] air in mid- to large-size commercial, industrial, and institutional (CII) facilities.  Water chillers can be water-cooled, air-cooled, or evaporatively cooled. Water-cooled chillers incorporate the use of [[cooling tower]]s which improve the chillers' thermodynamic effectiveness as compared to air-cooled chillers. This is due to heat rejection at or near the air's wet-bulb temperature rather than the higher, sometimes much higher, dry-bulb temperature. Evaporatively cooled chillers offer higher efficiencies than air-cooled chillers but lower than water-cooled chillers.

Water-cooled chillers are typically intended for indoor installation and operation, and are cooled by a separate condenser water loop and connected to outdoor cooling towers to expel heat to the atmosphere.

Air-cooled and evaporative cooled chillers are intended for outdoor installation and operation. Air-cooled machines are directly cooled by ambient air being mechanically circulated directly through the machine's condenser coil to expel heat to the atmosphere. Evaporative cooled machines are similar, except they implement a mist of water over the condenser coil to aid in condenser cooling, making the machine more efficient than a traditional air-cooled machine. No remote cooling tower is typically required with either of these types of packaged air-cooled or evaporatively cooled chillers.

Where available, cold water readily available in nearby water bodies might be used directly for cooling, replace or supplement cooling towers. The [[deep water source cooling]] system in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], [[Canada]], is an example. It uses cold lake water to cool the chillers, which in turn are used to cool city buildings via a [[district cooling]] system. The return water is used to warm the city's drinking water supply, which is desirable in this cold climate. Whenever a chiller's heat rejection can be used for a productive purpose, in addition to the cooling function, very high thermal effectiveness is possible.

==Vapor-compression chiller technology==
A vapor compression chiller typically uses one of four types of compressor: [[Reciprocating compressor|Reciprocating]] compression, [[scroll compressor|scroll]] compression, [[rotary screw compressor|screw-driven]] compression, and [[centrifugal compressor|centrifugal]] compression are all mechanical machines that can be powered by [[electric motors]], [[steam turbine|steam]], or [[gas turbine]]s. They produce their cooling effect via the [[reverse-Rankine cycle]], also known as vapor-compression. With [[evaporative cooling]] heat rejection, their coefficients of performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

::COP &lt;math&gt; = \frac{\text{Cooling power}}{\text{Input power}} &lt;/math&gt;

Current vapor-compression chiller technology is based on the "reverse-Rankine" cycle known as vapor-compression.
See the attached diagram which outlines the key components of the chiller system.
[[File:Water Cooled Chiller Diagram.png|thumb|Diagram showing the components of a water-cooled chiller]]
Key components of the chiller:

Refrigeration compressors are essentially a pump for refrigerant gas. The capacity of the compressor,
and hence the chiller cooling capacity, is measured in kilowatts input (kW), Horse power input (HP), or
volumetric flow (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h, ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/h). The mechanism for compressing refrigerant gas differs between
compressors, and each has its own application. Common refrigeration compressors include
reciprocating, scroll, screw, or centrifugal. These can be powered by electric motors, steam turbines, or
gas turbines. Compressors can have an integrated motor from a specific manufacturer, or be open drive--allowing the connection to another type of mechanical connection. Compressors can also be either
Hermetic (welded closed) or semihermetic (bolted together).

In recent years, application of variable-speed drive (VSD) technology has increased efficiencies of vapor
compression chillers. The first VSD was applied to centrifugal compressor chillers in the late 1970s and
has become the norm as the cost of energy has increased. Now, VSDs are being applied to rotary screw
and scroll-technology compressors.

Condensers can be air-cooled, water-cooled, or evaporative. The condenser is a heat exchanger which
allows heat to migrate from the refrigerant gas to either water or air. Air cooled condenser are
manufactured from copper tubes (for the refrigerant flow) and aluminium fins (for the air flow). Each
condenser has a different material cost and they vary in terms of efficiency. With evaporative cooling
condensers, their coefficients-of-performance (COPs) are very high; typically 4.0 or more.

The expansion device or refrigerant metering device (RMD) restricts the flow of the liquid refrigerant
causing a pressure drop that vaporizes some of the refrigerant; this vaporization absorbs heat from nearby liquid refrigerant.
The RMD is located immediately prior to the evaporator so that the cold gas in the evaporator can absorb
heat from the water in the evaporator. There is a sensor for the RMD on the evaporator outlet side which
allows the RMD to regulate the refrigerant flow based on the chiller design requirement.

Evaporators can be plate type or shell and tube type. The evaporator is a heat exchanger which allows
the heat energy to migrate from the water stream into the refrigerant gas. During the state change of the remaining
liquid to gas, the refrigerant can absorb large amounts of heat without changing temperature.

==How absorption technology works==
The thermodynamic cycle of an [[absorption chiller]] is driven by a heat source; this heat is usually delivered to the chiller via steam, hot water, or combustion. Compared to electrically powered chillers, an absorption chiller has very low electrical power requirements - very rarely above 15&amp;nbsp;kW combined consumption for both the solution pump and the refrigerant pump.  However, its heat input requirements are large, and its COP is often 0.5 (single-effect) to 1.0 (double-effect). For the same tonnage capacity, an absorption chiller requires a much larger [[cooling tower]] than a vapor-compression chiller.  However, absorption chillers, from an energy-efficiency point of view, excel where cheap, low-grade heat or waste heat is readily available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eng.usf.edu/~hchen4/Cogeneration.htm|title=Converting Low-Grade Heat into Electrical Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extremely sunny climates, [[solar energy]] has been used to operate [http://www.thermocold-hvacsystems.co.uk/absorption-chillers/ absorption chillers].

The single-effect absorption cycle uses water as the refrigerant and [[lithium bromide]] as the absorbent. It is the strong affinity that these two substances have for one another that makes the cycle work. The entire process occurs in almost a complete vacuum.

#'''Solution Pump''' : A dilute lithium bromide solution (63% concentration) is collected in the bottom of the absorber shell. From here, a hermetic solution pump moves the solution through a shell and tube heat exchanger for preheating.
#'''Generator''' : After exiting the heat exchanger, the dilute solution moves into the upper shell. The solution surrounds a bundle of tubes which carries either steam or hot water. The steam or hot water transfers heat into the pool of dilute lithium bromide solution. The solution boils, sending refrigerant vapor upward into the condenser and leaving behind concentrated lithium bromide. The concentrated lithium bromide solution moves down to the heat exchanger, where it is cooled by the weak solution being pumped up to the generator.
#'''Condenser''' : The refrigerant vapor migrates through mist eliminators to the condenser tube bundle. The refrigerant vapor condenses on the tubes. The heat is removed by the cooling water which moves through the inside of the tubes. As the refrigerant condenses, it collects in a trough at the bottom of the condenser.
#'''Evaporator''' : The refrigerant liquid moves from the condenser in the upper shell down to the evaporator in the lower shell and is sprayed over the evaporator tube bundle. Due to the extreme vacuum of the lower shell [6&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (0.8 kPa) absolute pressure], the refrigerant liquid boils at approximately {{convert|39|F|C}}, creating the refrigerant effect. (This vacuum is created by hygroscopic action - the strong affinity lithium bromide has for water - in the Absorber directly below.)
#'''Absorber''' : As the refrigerant vapor migrates to the absorber from the evaporator, the strong lithium bromide solution from the generator is sprayed over the top of the absorber tube bundle. The strong lithium bromide solution actually pulls the refrigerant vapor into solution, creating the extreme vacuum in the evaporator. The absorption of the refrigerant vapor into the lithium bromide solution also generates heat which is removed by the cooling water.  Now the dilute lithium bromide solution collects in the bottom of the lower shell, where it flows down to the solution pump. The chilling cycle is now completed and the process begins once again.&lt;ref name="matsu1"&gt;http://matsu.com.au/chiller-range/chiller-range-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial chiller technology===
Industrial chillers typically come as complete, packaged, closed-loop systems, including the chiller unit, [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]], and pump station with recirculating pump, expansion valve, no-flow shutdown, internal cold water control. The internal tank helps maintain cold water temperature and prevents temperature spikes from occurring. Closed-loop industrial chillers recirculate a clean coolant or clean water with condition additives at a constant temperature and pressure to increase the stability and reproducibility of water-cooled machines and instruments. The water flows from the chiller to the application's point of use and back.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

If the water temperature differentials between inlet and outlet are high, then a large external water tank would be used to store the cold water. In this case the chilled water is not going directly from the chiller to the application, but goes to the external water tank which acts as a sort of "temperature buffer." The cold water tank is much larger than the internal water goes from the external tank to the application and the return hot water from the application goes back to the external tank, not to the chiller.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The less common open loop industrial chillers control the temperature of a liquid in an open tank or sump by constantly recirculating it. The liquid is drawn from the tank, pumped through the chiller and back to the tank. In industrial water chillers is the use of water cooling instead of air cooling. In this case the condenser does not cool the hot refrigerant with ambient air, but uses water that is cooled by a [[cooling tower]]. This development allows a reduction in energy requirements by more than 15% and also allows a significant reduction in the size of the chiller, due to the small surface area of the water-based condenser and the absence of fans. Additionally, the absence of fans allows for significantly reduced noise levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Most industrial chillers use refrigeration as the media for cooling, but some rely on simpler techniques such as air or water flowing over coils containing the coolant to regulate temperature.  Water is the most commonly used coolant within process chillers, although coolant mixtures (mostly water with a coolant additive to enhance heat dissipation) are frequently employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPDRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=water+chiller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiA8u6Q0v7QAhUlw4MKHdU-BxQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q==%20additive&amp;f=false|title=HVAC Water Chillers and Cooling Towers: Fundamentals, Application, and Operation, Second Edition|last=III|first=Herbert W.

==Industrial chiller selection==
Important specifications to consider when searching for cumond industrial chillers include the total life cycle cost, the power source, chiller IP rating, chiller cooling capacity, evaporator capacity, evaporator material, evaporator type, condenser material, condenser capacity, ambient temperature, motor fan type, noise level, internal piping materials, number of compressors, type of compressor, number of fridge circuits, coolant requirements, fluid discharge temperature, and COP (the ratio between the cooling capacity in RT to the energy consumed by the whole chiller in KW). For medium to large chillers this should range from 3.5 to 7.0, with higher values meaning higher efficiency.  Chiller efficiency is often specified in kilowatts per [[Air conditioning#Energy|refrigeration ton]] (kW/RT).

Process pump specifications that are important to consider include the process flow, process pressure, pump material, elastomer and mechanical shaft seal material, motor voltage, motor electrical class, motor IP rating and pump rating. If the cold water temperature is lower than −5&amp;nbsp;°C, then a special pump needs to be used to be able to pump the high concentrations of ethylene glycol. Other important specifications include the internal water tank size and materials and full load current.

Control panel features that should be considered when selecting between industrial chillers include the local control panel, remote control panel, fault indicators, temperature indicators, and pressure indicators.

Additional features include emergency alarms, hot gas bypass, city water switchover, and casters.&lt;ref name="matsu1"/&gt;

Demountable chillers are also an option for deployment in remote areas and where the conditions may be hot and dusty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matsu.com.au/mining|title=Summit Matsu Chillers - Chillers for Mining  - Summit Matsu Chillers|work=Summit Matsu Chillers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerants==
{{Main article|Refrigerant}}

A vapor-compression chiller uses a [[refrigerant]] internally as its working fluid.  Many refrigerants options are available; when selecting a chiller, the application cooling temperature requirements and refrigerant's cooling characteristics need to be matched.  Important parameters to consider are the operating temperatures and pressures.

There are several environmental factors that concern refrigerants, and also affect the future availability for chiller applications.  This is a key consideration in intermittent applications where a large chiller may last for 25 years or more. [[Ozone depletion potential]] (ODP) and [[global warming potential]] (GWP) of the refrigerant need to be considered. ODP and GWP data for some of the more common vapor-compression refrigerants (noting that many of these refrigerants are highly flammable and/or toxic):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Chromosome 2q deletion''' is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 2. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 2q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/3744/chromosome-2q-deletion|title=Chromosome 2q deletion - Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|accessdate=12 August 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DPVweb''' is a [[database]] for virologists working on [[plant virus]]es combining [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]], [[bioinformatic]] and [[symptom]] data.

== Description ==
DPVweb is a central web-based source of information about [[virus]]es, [[viroid]]s and satellites of [[plants]], [[fungi]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref name=researchgate&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1564/16dec08|last1=Adams|first1=M|last2=Antoniw|first2=J|title=DPVweb: An open access internet resource on plant viruses and virus diseases|journal=Outlooks on Pest Management|volume=16|pages=268–270|year=2005|issue=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It provides comprehensive taxonomic information, including brief descriptions of each family and genus, and classified lists of virus sequences. It makes use of a large database that also holds detailed, curated, information for all sequences of viruses, viroids and satellites of plants, fungi and protozoa that are complete or that contain at least one complete gene. There are currently about 10,000 such sequences. For comparative purposes, DPVweb also contains a representative sequence of all other fully sequenced virus species with an [[RNA]] or single-stranded [[DNA]] [[genome]]. For each curated sequence the database contains the start and end positions of each feature ([[gene]], non-translated region, etc.), and these have been checked for accuracy. As far as possible, the nomenclature for genes and [[protein]]s are standardized within genera and families. Sequences of features (either as DNA or [[amino acid]] sequences) can be directly downloaded from the website in [[FASTA]] format.

The sequence information can also be accessed via client software for personal computers.

== History ==
The Descriptions of Plant Viruses (DPVs) were first published by the [[Association of Applied Biologists]] in 1970 as a series of leaflets, each one written by an expert describing a particular plant virus.&lt;ref name=nist&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams|first1=M|last2=Antoniw|first2=J|title=DPVweb: a comprehensive database of plant and fungal virus genes and genomes|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=34|issue=Database issue|pages=D382–5|date=January 2006|pmid=16381892|pmc=1347386 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkj023|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16381892}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 all of the 354 DPVs published in paper were scanned, and converted into an electronic format in a database and distributed on CDROM. In 2001 the descriptions were made available on the new DPVweb site, providing open access to the now 400+ DPVs (currently 415) as well as taxonomic and sequence data on all plant viruses.

== Uses==
DPVweb is an aid to researchers in the field of plant virology as well as an educational resource for students of [[virology]] and [[molecular biology]].

The site provides a single point of access for all known plant virus genome sequences making it easy to collect these sequences together for further analysis and comparison. Sequence data from the DPVweb database have proved valuable for a number of projects:
# survey of [[codon]] usage bias amongst all plant viruses,
# two-way comparisons between comprehensive sets of sequences from the families [[Flexiviridae]] and [[Potyviridae]] that have helped inform taxonomy and clarify genus and species discrimination criteria,
# a survey and verification of the polyprotein cleavage sites within the family Potyviridae.

=== Habitat destruction and fragmentation ===
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn shows deforestation]]

Human population growth results in changes in land-use, which can cause natural habitats to become fragmented, altered, or destroyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Large mammals are often more vulnerable to extinction than smaller animals because they require larger [[home range]]s and thus are more prone to suffer the effects of [[deforestation]]. Large species such as [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, large [[primate]]s, [[tapir]]s and [[Peccary|peccaries]] are the first animals to disappear in fragmented [[rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnaird, M. F., Sanderson, E. W., O'Brien, T. G., Wibisono, H. T. and Woolmer, G., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Sanderson2/publication/227602224_Deforestation_Trends_in_a_Tropical_Landscape_and_Implications_for_Endangered_Large_Mammals/links/0912f5108705b72742000000.pdf Deforestation Trends in a Tropical Landscape and Implications for Endangered Large Mammals.]" ''Conservation Biology'' (2003) 17: 245–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study from Amazonian Ecuador analyzed two oil-road management approaches and their effects on the surrounding wildlife communities. The free-access road had forests that were cleared and fragmented and the other had enforced access control. Fewer species were found along the first road with density estimates being almost 80% lower than at the second site that which had minimal disturbance.&lt;ref name="oil roads"&gt;Suárez, E., Morales, M., Cueva, R., Utreras Bucheli, V., Zapata-Ríos, G., Toral, E., Torres, J., Prado, W. and Vargas Olalla, J., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Galo_Zapata-Rios/publication/229528550_Oil_Industry_Wild_Meat_Trade_and_Roads_Indirect_Effects_of_Oil_Extraction_Activities_in_a_Protected_Area_in_North-Eastern_Ecuador/links/02e7e528ccfdcbb399000000/Oil-Industry-Wild-Meat-Trade-and-Roads-Indirect-Effects-of-Oil-Extraction-Activities-in-a-Protected-Area-in-North-Eastern-Ecuador.pdf Oil Industry, Wild Meat Trade and Roads: Indirect Effects of Oil Extraction Activities in a Protected Area in North-Eastern Ecuador.]" ''Animal Conservation'' 12 (2009): 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding suggests that disturbances affected the local animals' willingness and ability to travel between patches.[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|Fishbone deforestation pattern. This was found in Brazil and is visible from satellite]]

[[Habitat fragmentation|Fragmentation]] lowers populations while increasing extinction risk when the remaining [[habitat]] size is small.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When there is more unfragmented land, there is more habitat for more diverse species. A larger land patch also means it can accommodate more species with larger [[home range]]s.  However, when patch size decreases, there is an increase in the number of isolated fragments which can remain unoccupied by local [[fauna]]. If this persists, species may become extinct in the area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rybicki, J., "[http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB%202013/ECOPO2_2013/Ecological%20effects%20of%20environ.%20change/Rybicki%20y%20Hanski%202013.pdf Species–area Relationships and Extinctions Caused by Habitat Loss and Fragmentation.]" ''Ecology Letters'' 16 (2013): 27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] looked at two patterns of [[habitat fragmentation]]: "fish-bone" in smaller properties and another unnamed large property pattern. The large property pattern contained fewer fragments than the smaller fish-bone pattern. The results suggested that higher levels of fragmentation within the fish-bone pattern led to the [[loss of species]] and decreased diversity of large vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, D. A., Hobbs, R. J. and Margules, C. R., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denis_Saunders/publication/227638151_Saunders_D_Hobbs_R_Margules_C_Biological_Consequences_of_Ecosystem_Fragmentation_A_Review_Conservation_Biology/links/53d20be10cf2a7fbb2e9620f/Saunders-D-Hobbs-R-Margules-C-Biological-Consequences-of-Ecosystem-Fragmentation-A-Review-Conservation-Biology.pdf Biological Consequences of Ecosystem Fragmentation: A Review.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 5 (1991): 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Human impacts, such as the fragmentation of forests, may cause large areas to lose the ability to maintain [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem function]] due to loss of key ecological processes.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge, M. L. S. P., Galetti, M., Ribeiro, M. C., Ferraz, K.M.P.M.B. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Malu_Jorge/publication/256669321_Mammal_defaunation_as_surrogate_of_trophic_cascades_in_hotspot/links/00b7d52aafdb4d98da000000.pdf Mammal Defaunation as Surrogate of Trophic Cascades in A Biodiversity Hotspot.]" ''Biological Conservation'' 163 (2013): 49–57.&lt;/ref&gt; This can consequently cause changes within environments and skew evolutionary processes.&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;

=== Invasive species ===

Human influences, such as colonization and agriculture, have caused species to become distributed outside of their native ranges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fragmentation also has cascading effects on native species, beyond reducing habitat and resource availability; it leaves areas vulnerable to non-native invasions. [[Invasive species]] can out-compete or directly prey upon native species, as well as alter the habitat so that native species can no longer survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oil roads"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeschke, J., et. al. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12299/full Defining the Impact of Non-Native Species.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 28.5 (2014): 1188-1194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In extinct animal species for which the cause of extinction is known, over 50% were affected by invasive species. For 20% of extinct animal species, invasive species are the only cited cause of extinction. Invasive species are the second-most important cause of extinction for mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Clavero, M., Garcia-Berthou, E. "[http://dugi-doc.udg.edu:8080/bitstream/handle/10256/12285/InvasiveSpeciesLeading.pdf?sequence=1 Invasive Species are a Leading Cause of Animal Extinctions.]" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 20.3 (2005): 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global patterns ==

Tropical regions are the most heavily impacted by defaunation.&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; These regions, which include the [[Brazilian Amazon]], the [[Congo Basin]] of Central Africa, and [[Indonesia]], experience the greatest rates of overexploitation and [[habitat degradation]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, specific causes are varied, and areas with one endangered group (such as birds) do not necessarily also have other endangered groups (such as mammals, insects, or amphibians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Global map shows new patterns of extinction risk|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_2-11-2006-10-49-47|work=Imperial College London and the Natural Environment Research Council|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon leads to habitat fragmentation and overexploitation. Hunting pressure in the Amazon rainforest has increased as traditional hunting techniques have been replaced by modern weapons such as shotguns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Access roads built for mining and logging operations fragment the forest landscape and allow hunters to move into forested areas which previously were untouched.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The bushmeat trade in Central Africa incentivizes the overexploitation of local fauna.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Indonesia has the most endangered animal species of any area in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Endangered Species in Indonesia - Australian Science|url = http://www.australianscience.com.au/environmental-science/endangered-species-in-indonesia/|website = Australian Science|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US|first = Ivanovic,|last = Josip}}&lt;/ref&gt; International trade in wild animals, as well as extensive logging, mining and agriculture operations, drive the decline and extinction of numerous species.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==

=== Genetic loss ===
[[Inbreeding]] and [[genetic diversity]] loss often occur with endangered species populations because they have small and/or declining populations. Loss of genetic diversity lowers the ability of a population to deal with change in their environment and can make individuals within the community [[homogeneous]]. If this occurs, these animals are more susceptible to [[disease]] and other occurrences that may target a specific [[genome]]. Without genetic diversity, one disease could eradicate an entire species. Inbreeding lowers reproduction and [[survival rate]]s. It is suggested that these genetic factors contribute to the extinction risk in threatened/endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham, R., "Genetics and Conservation Biology." C. R. ''Biologies'' 326 (2003): S22-S29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seed dispersal ===

==== Effects on plants and forest structure ====
The consequences of defaunation can be expected to affect the plant community. There are three non-mutually exclusive conclusions as to the consequences on tropical forest plant communities:

# If seed dispersal agents are targeted by hunters, the effectiveness and amount of dispersal for those plant species will be reduced&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;
# The species composition of the [[seedling]] and [[sapling]] layers will be altered by hunting,&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; and
# Selective hunting of medium/large-sized animals instead of small-sized animals will lead to different seed predation patterns, with an emphasis on smaller seeds&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation affects the populations and diets of rodents in Neotropical rainforests|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071500186X|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–7|volume = 190|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.032|first = Mauro|last = Galetti|first2 = Roger|last2 = Guevara|first3 = Carolina L.|last3 = Neves|first4 = Raisa R.|last4 = Rodarte|first5 = Ricardo S.|last5 = Bovendorp|first6 = Marcelo|last6 = Moreira|first7 = John B.|last7 = Hopkins III|first8 = Justin D.|last8 = Yeakel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent study analyzed seedling density and composition from two areas, Los Tuxtlas and Montes Azules. Los Tuxtlas, which is affected more by human activity, showed higher seedling density and a smaller average number of different species than in the other area. Results suggest that an absence of vertebrate dispersers can change the structure and diversity of forests.&lt;ref&gt;Dirzo, R. and Miranda, A. "Altered Patterns of Herbivory and Diversity in the Forest Understory: A Case Study of the Possible Consequences of Contemporary Defaunation." In: ''Plant-Animal Interactions: Evolutionary ecology in tropical and temperate regions''. P. W. Price, T. M. Lewinsohn, G. W. Fernandes &amp; W. W. Benson (Eds.). Wiley and Sons Pub. New York pp: 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a plant community that relies on animals for dispersal could potentially have an altered [[biodiversity]], species [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]], survival, [[demography]], and spatial and genetic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Beaune, David. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Beaune/publication/256303581_Seed_dispersal_strategies_and_the_threat_of_defaunation_in_a_Congo_forest/links/00b4952246469ee96c000000.pdf Seed Dispersal Strategies and the Threat of Defaunation in a Congo Forest]." ''Biodiversity and Conservation'' 22.1 (2013): 225-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poaching is likely to alter plant composition because the interactions between game and plant species varies in strength. Some game species interact strongly, weakly, or not at all with species. A change in plant species composition is likely to be a result because the net effect removal of game species varies among the plant species they interact with.&lt;ref name="poachers alter"/&gt;

==== Effects on small-bodied seed dispersers and predators ====

As large-bodied vertebrates are increasingly lost from seed-dispersal networks, small-bodied seed dispersers (i.e. bats, birds, dung beetles) and seed predators (i.e. rodents) are affected. Defaunation leads to reduced species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Seed predation in a human-modified tropical landscape|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S026646741500019X|journal = Journal of Tropical Ecology|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 1469-7831|pages = 379–383|volume = 31|issue = 4|doi = 10.1017/S026646741500019X|first = Jenny|last = Zambrano|first2 = Rosamond|last2 = Coates|first3 = Henry F.|last3 = Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective defaunation affects dung beetle communities in continuous Atlantic rainforest|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713000992|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2013-07-01|pages = 79–89|volume = 163|series = Special Issue: Defaunation's impact in terrestrial tropical ecosystems|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.004|first = Laurence|last = Culot|first2 = Emilie|last2 = Bovy|first3 = Fernando|last3 = Zagury Vaz-de-Mello|first4 = Roger|last4 = Guevara|first5 = Mauro|last5 = Galetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to relaxed competition; small-bodied species normally compete with large-bodied vertebrates for food and other resources. As an area becomes defaunated, dominant small-bodied species take over, crowding out other similar species and leading to an overall reduced species diversity.&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"/&gt; The loss of species diversity is reflective of a larger [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], which has consequences for the maintenance of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The quality of the physical habitat may also suffer. Bird and bat species (many of who are small bodied seed dispersers) rely on [[Geophagy|mineral licks]] as a source of sodium, which is not available elsewhere in their diets. In defaunated areas in the Western Amazon, mineral licks are more thickly covered by vegetation and have lower water availability. Bats were significantly less likely to visit these degraded mineral licks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation of tropical forests reduces habitat quality for seed-dispersing bats in Western Amazonia: an unexpected connection via mineral licks|journal = Animal Conservation|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1469-1795|pages = 44–51|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/acv.12055|first = S. J.|last = Ghanem|first2 = C. C.|last2 = Voigt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of such licks will thus negatively affect the health and reproduction of bat populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Defaunation has negative consequences for seed dispersal networks as well. In the western Amazon, birds and bats have separate diets and thus form separate [[Guild (ecology)|guilds]] within the network.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Partitioning of seed dispersal services between birds and bats in a fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1984-46702014000300006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Zoologia (Curitiba)|issn = 1984-4670|pages = 245–255|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1590/S1984-46702014000300006|first = Raissa|last = Sarmento|first2 = Cecília P.|last2 = Alves-Costa|first3 = Adriana|last3 = Ayub|first4 = Marco A. R.|last4 = Mello|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that large-bodied vertebrates, being generalists, connect separate guilds, creating a stable, [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] network. Defaunation results in a highly modular network in which specialized frugivores instead act as the connector hubs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Ecosystem services===
{{main|ecosystem services}}
Changes in predation dynamics, seed predation, seed dispersal, carrion removal, dung removal, vegetation trampling, and other ecosystem processes as a result of defaunation can affect ecosystem supporting and regulatory services, such as [[nutrient cycling]] and [[decomposition]], crop pollination, [[pest control]], and [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;

=== Conservation ===
Efforts against defaunation include wildlife overpasses&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pell|first=Stuart|last2=Jones|first2=Darryl|date=2015-04-01|title=Are wildlife overpasses of conservation value for birds?

Wildlife overpasses are specifically used for the purpose of protecting many animal species from the roads.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many countries use them and they have been found to be very effective in protecting species and allowing forests to be connected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These overpasses look like bridges of forest that cross over many roads, like a walk bridge for humans, allowing animals to migrate from one side of the forest to the other safely since the road cut off the original connectivity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was concluded in a study done by Pell and Jones, looking at bird use of these corridors in Australia, that many birds did, in fact, use these corridors to travel from one side of forest to the other and although they did not spend much time in the corridor specifically, they did commonly use them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Riparian corridors are very similar to overpasses they are just on flat land and not on bridges, however, they also work as connective "bridges" between fragmented pieces of forest. One study done connected the corridors with bird habitat and use for seed dispersal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The conclusions of this study showed that some species of birds are highly dependent on these corridors as connections between forest, as flying across the open land is not ideal for many species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Overall both of these studies agree that some sort of connectivity needs to be established between fragments in order to keep the forest ecosystem in the best health possible and that they have in fact been very effective.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Marine ==
Defaunation in the [[marine biology|ocean]] has occurred later and less intensely than on land. A relatively small number of marine species have been driven to extinction. However, many species have undergone local, ecological, and commercial extinction.&lt;ref name="mar def"&gt;McCauley, D. J., Pinsky, M. L., [[Stephen R. Palumbi|Palumbi, S. R.]], Estes, J. A., Joyce, F. H., and Warner, R. R., "[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/1gj9w82r.pdf Marine defaunation: Animal loss in the global ocean.]" ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 347 (2015): 12555641.&lt;/ref&gt; Most large marine animal species still exist, such that the size distribution of global species assemblages has changed little since the Pleistocene, but individuals of each species are smaller on average, and [[overfishing]] has caused reductions in genetic diversity. Most extinctions and population declines to date have been driven by human overexploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Dulvy, N. K., Pinnegar, J. K., and Reynolds, J. D. "[http://www.dulvy.com/uploads/2/1/0/4/21048414/dulvy_holoceneextinctions2009.pdf Holocene extinctions in the sea.]" Pages 129-150 Turvey., S. T., editor. Holocene Extinctions. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consequences===
Marine defaunation has a wide array of effects on ecosystem structure and function. The loss of animals can have both top-down (cascading) and bottom-up effects,&lt;ref&gt;Myers, R. A., Baum, J. K., Shepherd, T. D.,  Powers, S. P., and Peterson, C. H. "[http://people.umass.edu/bethanyb/GCE/Myers%20et%20al.,%202007%20sharks.pdf Cascading effects of the loss of apex predatory sharks from a coastal ocean]". ''Science'' 315 (2007):1846–1850.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cury, P. M., Boyd, I. L., Bonhommeau, S., Anker-Nilssen, T., Crawford, R. J., Furness, R. W., ... &amp; Sydeman, W. J., "[http://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00056/16770/14307.pdf Global seabird response to forage fish depletion—one-third for the birds]". ''Science'', 334(2011), 1703-1706.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as consequences for [[biogeochemical cycling]], [[ecosystem connectivity]], and [[ecosystem stability]].

Two of the most important ecosystem services threatened by marine defaunation are the provision of food and coastal storm protection.&lt;ref name="mar def" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10899">The '''Dwight H. Terry Lectureship''', also known as the '''Terry Lectures''', was established at [[Yale University]] in 1905&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/ Yale University - "Dwight H. Terry Lectureship"]&lt;/ref&gt; by a gift from Dwight H. Terry of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]. Its purpose is to engage both scholars and the public in a consideration of religion from a [[humanitarian]] point of view, in the light of modern science and philosophy.  The subject matter has historically been similar to that of the [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland, and several lecturers have participated in both series.

==Establishment of the Lectureship==
The 1905 deed of gift establishing the lectureship states:

{{cquote|The object of this foundation is not the promotion of scientific investigation and discovery, but rather the assimilation and interpretation of that which has been or shall be hereafter discovered, and its application to human welfare, especially by the building of the truths of science and philosophy into the structure of a broadened and purified religion. The founder believes that such a religion will greatly stimulate intelligent effort for the improvement of human conditions and the advancement of the race in strength and excellence of character. To this end it is desired that a series of lectures be given by men eminent in their respective departments, on ethics, the history of civilization and religion, biblical research, all sciences and branches of knowledge which have an important bearing on the subject, all the great laws of nature, especially of evolution ... also such interpretations of literature and sociology as are in accord with the spirit of this foundation, to the end that the Christian spirit may be nurtured in the fullest light of the world’s knowledge and that mankind may be helped to attain its highest possible welfare and happiness upon this earth.&lt;ref name="yup"&gt;[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=81 Yale University Press - "The Terry Lectures Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although commitment to the gift was made in 1905 it did not mature until 1923, which is when the first Terry lectures were held.

==Lecture format==
The lectures are free and open to the public.  A single installment generally consists of four lectures by the same visiting scholar, given over the course of a month or less.  Many of the lectures have been edited into books published by the [[Yale University Press]], and remain in print to this day (see below)  Since 1999, the lectures have been recorded and archived on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100411232503/http://www.yale.edu/terrylecture/past_00-04.html Terry Lectures website] as audio and/or video streams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7346">The '''Energy Technologies Institute''' ('''ETI''') is an energy research, development and demonstration body established in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2007. The government set up the ETI following an announcement in the 2006 budget speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm Budget 2006: Speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925193953/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_06/bud_bud06_speech.cfm |date=2006-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the ETI is to “accelerate the development, demonstration and eventual commercial deployment of a focused portfolio of energy technologies, which will increase energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help achieve energy and climate change goals”. The institute works with a range of academic and commercial bodies.

Deployment of the technologies involved, which are expected to contribute to the reduction of the UK’s [[carbon emissions]], is expected to begin around 2018.

Commentators generally welcomed the new body as likely to make a positive contribution in the efforts to minimise [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/press_releases/06-03-22_budget.htm Science Media Centre -press releases archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070313163433/http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/press_releases/06-03-22_budget.htm |date=2007-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, they pointed to the slow pace of government action in promoting [[energy conservation]] and implementing existing low-carbon technologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grownupgreen.org.uk/library/?id=877&amp;PHPSESSID=e324f44440ed07bb6459a8cd5f3a35f7 Was Brown's Budget Green? - grownupgreen&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  compared to progress in a number of other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/renewable/Story/0,,201987,00.html Renewable energy across Europe | Special reports | Guardian Unlimited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
In addition to initial funding for the ETI, the [[Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform|Department for Business]] will provide £50 million a year over a period of 10 years starting in 2008-09. When establishing the ETI, the government expected the separate Energy Research Partnership &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070311040609/http://www.energyresearchpartnership.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; to raise matching funding from commercial organisations.

As of September 2006 [[EDF Energy]], [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[BP]] and [[E.ON UK]] had committed to providing funds. By 2014, this had grown to include [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]].

==Objectives==
Five objectives were set for the institute:
*To increase the level of research and development funding to meet the [[Energy policy of the United Kingdom|UK’s energy policy goals]].
*To deliver research and development that facilitates the rapid commercial deployment of cost-effective, low-carbon energy technologies.
*To provide better strategic focus for commercially applicable energy related research and development in the UK.
*To connect and manage networks of the best scientists and engineers to deliver focussed energy research and development projects to accelerate eventual commercial deployment.
*To build research and development capacity in the UK in the relevant technical disciplines to deliver the UK’s energy policy goals.

The ETI describes as its vision: "Affordable, secure, sustainable energy for present and future generations."

==Research focus==
The institute set out to focus research on a mixture of technologies.

As of 2014, the ETI states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eti.co.uk/about/how_we_operate/types_of_projects/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427185929/http://www.eti.co.uk/about/how_we_operate/types_of_projects/#sthash.H71ADUdd.dpuf |archive-date=2014-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that typically it supports projects that:

* Develop and demonstrate system level capabilities based on novel low carbon energy technologies or services
* Create additional value through the capabilities of the ETI Industry Members and Project Partners
* Create new partnerships - improving skills, knowledge, capabilities and supply chain capacity
* Create benefit in the UK and globally - through deployment, skills, knowledge base or exports
* Reduce risk associated with novel energy systems and supply chains
* Identify barriers requiring “next generation” science and technology support
* Inform development of regulations, standards, and policy

At the same time, the institute focuses on a mix of technologies to increase security of supply, and solutions to address [[fuel poverty]].

In 2017 the ETI started the Nuclear Cost Drivers Project, which aims to identify cost reductions in nuclear power plant design, construction and operation, so enabling more widespread deployment of new nuclear.&lt;ref name=wnn-20171027&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-UK-study-aims-to-identify-nuclear-cost-reductions-2710174.html |title=UK study aims to identify nuclear cost reductions |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=27 October 2017 |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Historically, since the privatisation of the country's energy industries, public sector support for energy research and development in the UK has come from a variety of bodies with little co-ordination between them. Problems experienced as a result of this included poor continuity of funding, and the availability of funding for certain parts of the research-development-commercialisation process but not others. Funding levels have also been low by international standards.

==Location==

In September 2007 it was announced that the Midlands Consortium had been chosen to host the ETI. The consortium comprises the Universities of Birmingham, Loughborough and Nottingham with financial support from Advantage West Midlands and the East Midlands Development Agency. 
The hub of the ETI is based at [[Loughborough University]], on the Holywell Park area of the campus, at the heart of the University's Science and Enterprise Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newscentre.bham.ac.uk/press/2007/09/ETI_consortium_bid_20_09_07.shtml ETI Bid Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hot metalwork.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Heat]], a form of energy, is partly [[potential energy]] and partly [[kinetic energy]]]]

'''Energy quality''' is the contrast between different [[Energy forms|forms of energy]], the different [[trophic level]]s in [[ecology|ecological]] systems and the propensity of [[energy]] to convert from one form to another. The concept refers to the empirical experience of the characteristics, or [[qualia]], of different energy forms as they [[Energy flow (ecology)|flow]] and transform. It appeals to our common [[perception]] of the [[heat]] value, versatility, and environmental performance of different energy forms and the way a small increment in energy flow can sometimes produce a large transformation effect on both energy [[physical state]] and energy. For example the transition from a [[solid]] state to [[liquid]] may only involve a very small addition of energy. Methods of evaluating energy quality are sometimes concerned with developing a system of ranking energy qualities in [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] order.

==Introduction==
Since before [[ancient history|antiquity]] there has been deep [[philosophical]], [[aesthetic]] and scientific interest in the contrast of quality with [[quantity]]. In some respects the history of [[Modernism|modern]] and [[postmodern]] thought can be characterized by the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approach to these two concepts. A central question has been whether the many different qualitative aspects of the world can be understood in terms of rational quantities, or whether the qualitative and quantitative are irreconcilable: that is, there is no "rational quality", or [[quale]] ratio. Many scientists and analytic philosophers say they are not, and therefore consider some qualitative phenomena like, for instance, [[spirituality]], and [[astrology]] to be unquantifiable, unanalysable by [[scientific methods]], and therefore ungrounded in physical reality. The notion of energy quality therefore has a tendency to be linked with phenomena many scientists consider unquantifiable, or at least incommunicable, and are consequently dismissed out of hand.

At the same time many people have also recognised qualitative differences in the way things can be done by different entities (both physical and biological). Humans, for example have qualitatively different capacities than many other mammals, due, in part, to their [[opposable thumb]]. In the attempt to formalise some of the qualitative differences, entities were grouped according to distinguishing features or capacities. Different schools of thought used different methods to make distinctions. Some people chose [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] and [[genome]] [[structure]], while others chose [[energetics|energetic]] function as the basis of classifications. The former are often associated with biology, while the latter with the trophic food chain analysis of ecology. These can be considered attempts to formalise quantitative, scientific studies of the qualitative differences between entities. The efforts were not isolated to biology and ecology, since engineers were also interested in quantifying the amount of work that qualitatively different sources of energy could provide.

==Ohta==

According to Ohta (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;90–91) the ranking and scientific analysis of energy quality was first proposed in 1851 by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] under the concept of "availability". This concept was continued in Germany by Z. Rant, who developed it under the title, "die Exergie" (the [[exergy]]). It was later continued and standardised in [[Japan]]. [[Exergy]] analysis now forms a common part of many industrial and ecological energy analyses. For example, I.Dincer and Y.A. Cengel (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;132) state that energy forms of different qualities are now commonly dealt with in [[steam power]] [[engineering]] industry. Here the "quality index" is the relation of exergy to the energy content (Ibid.). However energy engineers were aware that the notion of heat quality involved the notion of [[Value theory|value]] – for example A. Thumann wrote, "The essential quality of heat is not the amount but rather its 'value'" (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;113) – which brings into play the question of [[teleology]] and wider, or ecological-scale goal functions. In an ecological context S.E. Jorgensen and G.Bendoricchio say that exergy is used as a goal function in ecological models, and expresses energy "with a built-in measure of quality like energy" (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;392).

==Energy quality evaluation methods==
There appear to be two main kinds of methodology used for the calculation of energy quality. These can be classed as either receiver or donor methods. One of the main differences that distinguishes these classes is the assumption of whether energy quality can be upgraded in an energy transformation process.

'''Receiver methods:''' view energy quality as a measure and indicator of the relative ease with which energy converts from one form to another. That is, how much energy is received from a transformation or transfer process. For example, A. Grubler [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Transition_in_Energy_Use/transitions-euse-ene_encyclop_2004.pdf] used two types of indicators of energetic quality ''pars pro toto'': the hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio, and its inverse, the [[carbon intensity]] of energy. Grubler used the latter as an indicator of relative environmental quality. However Ohta says that in multistage industrial conversion systems, such as a [[hydrogen production]] system using solar energy, the energy quality is not upgraded (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;125).

'''Donor methods:''' view energy quality as a measure of the amount of energy used in an energy transformation, and that goes into sustaining a product or service (H.T.Odum 1975, p.&amp;nbsp;3). That is how much energy is donated to an energy transformation process. These methods are used in ecological physical chemistry, and ecosystem evaluation. From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality ''is'' upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems. Here, upgraded energy quality has a greater capacity to feedback and control lower grades of energy quality. Donor methods attempt to understand the ''usefulness'' of an energetic process by quantifying the extent to which higher quality energy controls lower quality energy.

==Energy quality in physical-chemical science (direct energy transformations) ==
===Constant energy form but variable energy flow===
T.Ohta suggested that the concept of energy quality may be more intuitive if one considers examples where the [[Energy#Forms of energy|form of energy]] remains constant but the amount of energy flowing, or transferred is varied. For instance if we consider only the inertial form of  energy, then the energy quality of a moving body is higher when it moves with a greater velocity. If we consider only the heat form of energy, then a higher temperature has higher quality. And if we consider only the light form of energy then light with higher frequency has greater quality (Ohta 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). All these differences in energy quality are therefore easily measured with the appropriate scientific instrument.

===Variable energy form, but constant energy flow===
The situation becomes more complex when the form of energy does not remain constant. In this context Ohta formulated the question of energy quality in terms of the conversion of energy of one form into another, that is the '''transformation''' of energy. Here, energy quality is defined by the '''relative ease''' with which the energy transforms, from form to form.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If energy A is relatively easier to convert to energy B but energy B is relatively harder to convert to energy A, then the quality of energy A is defined as being higher than that of B. The ranking of energy quality is also defined in a similar way. (T.Ohta 1994, p. 90).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Nomenclature:''' Prior to Ohta's definition above, A.W.Culp produced an energy conversion table describing the different conversions from one energy to another. Culp's treatment made use of a subscript to indicate which energy form is being talked about. Therefore, instead of writing "energy A", like Ohta above, Culp referred to "J&lt;sub&gt;''e''&lt;/sub&gt;", to specify electrical form of energy, where" J" refers to "energy", and the "''e''"subscript refers to electrical form of energy. Culps notation anticipated Scienceman's (1997) later maxim that all energy should be specified as form energy with the appropriate subscript.

==Energy quality in biophysical economics (indirect energy transformations)==
The notion of energy quality was also recognised in the economic sciences. In the context of [[biophysical economics]] energy quality was measured by the amount of economic output generated per unit of energy input (C.J. Cleveland et al. 2000). The estimation of energy quality in an economic context is also associated with [[embodied energy]] methodologies. Another example of the economic relevance of the energy quality concept is given by Brian Fleay. Fleay says that the "Energy Profit Ratio (EPR) is one measure of energy quality and a pivotal index for assessing the economic performance of fuels. Both the direct and indirect energy inputs embodied in goods and services must be included in the denominator." (2006; p.&amp;nbsp;10) Fley calculates the EPR as the energy output/energy input.

==Ranking energy quality==
===Energy abundance and relative transformation ease as measure of hierarchical rank and/or hierarchical position===

Ohta sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality and introduced a hierarchical scale for ranking energy quality based on the relative ease of energy conversion (see table to right after Ohta, p.&amp;nbsp;90). It is evident that Ohta did not analyse all forms of energy. For example, water is left out of his evaluation. It is important to note that the ranking of energy quality is not determined solely with reference to the efficiency of the energy conversion. This is to say that the evaluation of "relative ease" of an energy conversion is only partly dependent on transformation efficiency. As Ohta wrote, "the turbine generator and the electric motor have nearly the same efficiency, therefore we cannot say which has the higher quality" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;90). Ohta therefore also included, 'abundance in nature' as another criterion for the determination energy quality rank. For example, Ohta said that, "the only electrical energy which exists in natural circumstances is lightning, while many mechanical energies exist." (Ibid.). (See also table 1. in [http://www.exergy.se/ftp/japan85.pdf Wall's article] for another example ranking of energy quality).

===Transformity as an energy measure of hierarchical rank===

Like Ohta, H.T.Odum also sought to order energy form conversions according to their quality, however his hierarchical scale for ranking was based on extending ecological system food chain concepts to thermodyanmics rather than simply relative ease of transformation . For H.T.Odum energy quality rank is based on the amount of energy of one form required to generate a unit of another energy form. The ratio of one energy form input to a different energy form output was what H.T.Odum and colleagues called [[transformity]]: "the [[Emergy|EMERGY]] per unit energy in units of emjoules per joule" (H.T.Odum 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;1135).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7700">The '''European Parliamentary Technology Assessment''' (EPTA) is a network of [[technology assessment]] (TA) institutions specialising in advising parliamentary bodies in Europe.

[[Image:epta.jpg|thumb|EPTA-Logo]]

== Objectives ==

The EPTA partners advise parliaments on the possible social, economic and environmental impact of new sciences and technologies. The common aim is to provide impartial and high quality analysis and reports of developments in issues such as for example [[bioethics]] and [[biotechnology]], [[public health]], environment and energy, [[information and communication technologies|ICTs]], and R&amp;D policy. Such work is seen as an aid to the democratic control of scientific and technological innovations, and was pioneered in the 1970s by the [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) of the [[US Congress]]. EPTA aims to advance the establishment of [[technology assessment]] (TA) as an integral part of policy formation in parliamentary decision-making processes in Europe, and to strengthen the links between TA units in Europe.

== History and Organisation ==

The EPTA network was formally established in 1990, on a recommendation by the UK’s parliamentary TA office – [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]], under the patronage of the President of the [[European Parliament]], Mr [[Enrique Baron Crespo]]. The network has a light structure, guided by the EPTA ''Council'' and by meetings of the ''Directors'' of the EPTA partner organisations. The EPTA Council is the steering committee of the EPTA network, and consists of Members of Parliament or representatives of the advisory boards for the respective EPTA organisation. The Council decides on organisational matters such as co-operation within the network and the status of members and associates. The ''Presidency'' of EPTA rotates among full members each year. The tasks of the EPTA member organisation holding the presidency are to coordinate the EPTA network activities and to host the annual EPTA conference, Council meeting and Directors' meeting.

== Members ==

Parliamentary TA is institutionalised in different ways, ranging from permanent parliamentary committees for TA; separate TA units as part of the parliamentary administration; to independent institutions with a mandate to serve as a permanent consulting institution for the parliament. The members of the EPTA network are European organisations, which carry out TA studies on behalf of parliaments. Full membership can be obtained by a unit that operates in Europe, is devoted to TA or related activities, serves a (supra-national, national or regional) parliament, has its own budget and secretariat and has an active work programme including publications on issues with a scientific and technological component. Associate membership can be granted to other TA units that have a TA programme and the resources to realise it, but that do not fulfil other criteria for full membership. Associates are involved in all EPTA activities but are not represented in the EPTA Council. Further, other units interested in the work of EPTA can act as observers.

There are currently '''12 full members''':

'''Foreshadowing''' is a [[Literary technique|literary device]] in which a writer gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and it helps the reader develop expectations about the upcoming events. 

A writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways.  Some of these ways include: character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story, so that the readers are interested and want to know more.

This literary device is generally used to build anticipation in the minds of readers about what might happen next, thus adding dramatic tension to a story.  Moreover, foreshadowing can make extraordinary and bizarre events appear credible, as the events are predicted beforehand so that readers are mentally prepared for them. &lt;ref name=devices&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreshadowing|url=https://literarydevices.net/foreshadowing/|website=Literarydevices.net|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This literary device is frequently adapted for use by [[composer]]s of theatrical music, in the composition of [[opera]]s, [[musicals]], [[radio]], film, [[television]], [[Video game|gaming]], podcast, and internet scores and [[underscoring|underscores]], and [[incidental music]] for spoken theatrical productions.

==Misconceptions==
Foreshadowing is often confused with other [[literary techniques]]. Some of these techniques include:
* A "[[red herring (plot device)|red herring]]", is a hint that is designed to mislead the audience. However, foreshadowing only hints at a possible outcome within the confinement of a narrative, and purposely leads readers in the right direction. 
* A "[[flashforward]]" is a scene that takes the [[narrative]] forward in time from the current point of the story in [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ulrike Spierling|author2=Nicolas Szilas|title=Interactive Storytelling: First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008 Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIkhA9zuvSUC&amp;pg=PA156|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-89424-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward flash-forward - definition of flash-forward by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshadowing is sometimes employed  through characters' explicitly predicting the future.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 146, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By analogy to foreshadowing, the literary critic Gary Morson describes its opposite, '''sideshadowing'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morson|first1=Gary Saul|title=Sideshadowing and Tempics|journal=New Literary History|date=Autumn 1998|volume=29|issue=4|pages=599–624|jstor=20057502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found notably in the epic novels of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], it is the practice of including scenes that turn out to have no relevance to the plot. This, according to Morson, increases the verisimilitude of the fiction because the audience knows that in real life, unlike in novels, most events are in fact inconsequential. This "sense of structurelessness" invites the audience to "interpret and question the events that actually do come to pass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calixto|first1=Joshua|title=LET’S TALK ABOUT ROSA VAR ATTRE, THE IMPOSSIBLE ROMANCE OF THE WITCHER 3|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/lets-talk-about-rosa-var-attre-impossible-romance-witcher-3/|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=[[Kill Screen]]|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chemical engineering]]''' as a discipline that was developed out of those practising "industrial chemistry" in the late 19th century. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]] (18th century), industrial chemicals and other consumer products such as soap were mainly produced through [[Batch production|batch processing]]. Batch processing is labour-intensive and individuals mix predetermined amounts of ingredients in a vessel, heat, cool or pressurize the mixture for a predetermined length of time. The product may then be isolated, purified and tested to achieve a saleable product.  Batch processes are still performed today on higher value products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, speciality and formulated products such as perfumes and paints, or in food manufacture such as pure maple syrups, where a profit can still be made despite batch methods being slower and inefficient in terms of labour and equipment usage.  Due to the application of Chemical Engineering techniques during manufacturing process development, larger volume [[chemical substances|chemicals]] are now produced through a [[Continuous production|continuous]] "assembly line" [[chemical process]]es. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was when a shift from batch to more continuous processing began to occur. Today [[commodity chemicals]] and [[petrochemicals]] are predominantly made using continuous manufacturing processes whereas [[speciality chemicals]], [[fine chemicals]] and [[pharmaceuticals]] are made using batch processes.

==Origin==
The Industrial Revolution led to an unprecedented escalation in demand, both with regard to quantity and quality, for bulk chemicals such as [[soda ash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kostick|first1=Dennis|title=The origin of the U.S. natural and synthetic soda ash industries|journal=Wyoming State Geological Survey Public Information Circular|date=1998|volume=39|url=https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/soda_ash/soda-ash-industry.pdf|accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This meant two things: one, the size of the activity and the efficiency of operation had to be enlarged, and two, serious alternatives to batch processing, such as continuous operation, had to be examined.

==The first chemical engineer==
Industrial chemistry was being practised in the mid 1800s, but it was not until the 1880s that the engineering elements required to control chemical processes were being recognized as a distinct professional activity. Chemical engineering was first established as a profession in the United Kingdom when the first chemical engineering course was given at the University of Manchester in 1887 by [[George E. Davis]] in the form of twelve lectures covering various aspects of industrial chemical practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Delgass|publisher=Purdue University|title=Seventy-Five Years of Chemical Engineering|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE/AboutUs/history.html|accessdate=13 August 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence [[George E. Davis]] is regarded as the world's first chemical engineer. Today, chemical engineering is a highly regarded profession. Chemical engineers with experience can become [[Regulation and licensure in engineering#United States|licensed Professional Engineers]] in the United States, aided by the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]], or gain "Chartered" chemical-engineer status through the UK-based [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]].

==Professional associations==
In 1880, the first attempt was made to form a ''Society of Chemical Engineers'' in London.  This eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Society of Chemical Industry]] in 1881. The [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]] (AIChE) was founded in 1908, and the UK [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] (IChemE) in 1922.&lt;ref name=Furter&gt;W. F. Furter (1980) A Century of Chemical Engineering, Plenum Press (NY &amp; London) {{ISBN|0-306-40895-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These both now have substantial international membership.  Some other countries now have chemical engineering societies or sections within chemical or engineering societies, but the AIChE, IChemE and IiChE remain the major ones in numbers and international spread: they are both open to suitably qualified professionals or students of chemical engineering anywhere in the world.

==Definitions==
For the other established branches of engineering, there were ready associations in the public's mind: [[Mechanical Engineering]] meant machines, [[Electrical Engineering]] meant circuitry, and [[Civil Engineering]] meant structures. Chemical engineering came to mean [[chemicals production]].

===Unit operation===
[[Arthur Dehon Little]] is credited with the approach chemical engineers to this day take: process-oriented rather than product-oriented analysis and design. The concept of [[Unit operation | unit operations]] was developed to emphasize the underlying similarity among seemingly different chemical productions. For example, the principles are the same whether one is concerned about separating alcohol from water in a fermenter, or separating gasoline from diesel in a refinery, as long as the basis of separation is generation of a vapor of a different composition from the liquid. Therefore, such separation processes can be studied together as a unit operation, in this case called [[distillation]].

===Unit processes===
In the early part of the last century, a parallel concept called [[unit processing|Unit Processes]] was used to classify reactive processes. Thus [[Redox|oxidation]]s, [[Redox|reduction]]s, [[alkylation]]s, etc. formed separate unit processes and were studied as such. This was natural considering the close affinity of chemical engineering to industrial chemistry at its inception. Gradually however, the subject of [[chemical reaction engineering]] has largely replaced the unit process concept. This subject looks at the entire body of chemical reactions as having a personality of its own, independent of the particular chemical species or chemical bonds involved. The latter does contribute to this personality in no small measure, but to design and operate chemical reactors, a knowledge of characteristics such as [[chemical kinetics|rate behaviour]], [[thermodynamics]], single or multiphase nature, etc. are more important.  The emergence of chemical reaction engineering as a discipline signaled the severance of the umbilical cord connecting chemical engineering to industrial chemistry and cemented the unique character of the discipline.

The first decorative [[fountain]] in the United States was dedicated in [[City Hall Park]], in [[New York City]], in 1842.  Early American fountains were used to distribute clean drinking water, had little ornamentation, and copied European styles.

In the 20th century, American fountains often ceased to distribute drinking water; they became purely decorative, and were designed to honor events or individuals, as works of urban sculpture or to imitate nature.  In the late 20th century, the [[musical fountain]], where the dance of water is controlled by a computer and is accompanied by lights and music, became a form of public entertainment in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and other American cities.

== 1800-1900 ==

Philadelphia built the first citywide water system in the United States, which began operation in January 1801. Underground aqueducts carried drinking water from the [[Schuylkill River]], and twin steam pumps propelled it into a water tower at Centre Square, now the site of [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. Scottish-born architect [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]] designed the system along with the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] pumping house/water tower.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schillerinstitute.org/educ/hist/eiw_this_week/v4n3_jan20_1801.html "Benjamin Latrobe Designs the first American Steam-Powered Municipal Waterworks,"] from ''This Week in History'', January 2012, The Schiller Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Centre Square was converted from a meadow into a public park, and an ornamental fountain was added, 1808&amp;ndash;1809. Sculptor [[William Rush]] carved a wooden statue, ''Allegory of the Schuylkill River'' (better known as ''Water Nymph with Bittern''), to adorn the Centre Square fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafa.org/museum/The-Collection-Greenfield-American-Art-Resource/Tour-the-Collection/Category/Collection-Detail/985/coltype--Sculpture/mkey--8434/sort57--3_3a30-/ ''Head of the Nymph''], from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first monumental fountains in the United States were built to mark the termini of aqueducts bringing fresh drinking water into New York City. A [[cholera]] epidemic in 1832 and the disastrous [[Great Fire of New York]], in 1835, persuaded the government of New York City to build the [[Croton aqueduct]] to bring abundant fresh water into the city.  The [[Croton Dam]], aqueduct, and reservoir were finished in 1841,  bringing water 40 miles from the [[Croton River]] to New York City.  In commemoration, the first fountain in the U.S., the ''Croton Fountain'' in [[City Hall Park]], was turned on on October 14, 1842 and jetted water 50 feet into the air.&lt;ref&gt;Ric Burns and James Sanders, ''New York, an Illustrated History'', Alfred Knopf, New York, 1999, pg. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;  A second fountain in [[Union Square (New York City)|Union Square]] was also connected to the system.

The first fountains were very simple, without sculpture, and simply spouted water up into the air.  They no longer exist, though vestiges of the original water system remain.&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn Symmes with Maria Ann Conelli, "Fountains as Refreshment", in the collection ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present''. Thames and Hudson, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, Boston completed its own new water system, an aqueduct from [[Lake Cochituate]] 20 miles (32&amp;nbsp;km) to the [[Boston Common]], where the first fountain was located. A parade and festival were held to mark the fountain's opening on October 25, 1848.  The ceremony included schoolchildren singing an ode written by American poet [[James Russell Lowell]] for the event.  The ode began:

"My name is Water: I have sped
through strange dark ways untried before,
By pure desire of friendship led,
Cochituate's Ambassador:
He sends four gifts by me,
Long life, health, peace, and purity."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Marilynn Symmes and Maria Ann Conelli in ''Fountains, Splash and Spectacle''. Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the first American fountains, which were simple and functional, in the 1850s, more decorative fountains were constructed as part of a nationwide effort to beautify American cities by building parks, squares, and fountains inspired by European models. 
[[File:Bethesda Fountain, Central Park.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' in [[Central Park]], New York (1873)]]
For example, the ''[[Bethesda Fountain]]'' was created to adorn New York City's new [[Central Park]], which project had been begun in 1858 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Calvert Vaux]], to create a vast [[natural landscape]] in the heart of the city.  In the middle of the park was one formal element: a mall adorned with elm trees and a terrace with views over a lake.  In 1863, the park commissioners decided to build a monumental fountain for the central basin in the middle of the mall.  The sculptor was a little-known American artist, [[Emma Stebbins]], whose brother was the head of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and President of the Board of Commissioners, who lobbied on her behalf.  Her fountain was based on the biblical verse from the [[Gospel of Saint John]], in which an angel touched, or "troubled", the waters of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in [[Jerusalem]], giving it healing powers.  She wrote about the fountain:  "We have no less healing, comfort and purification freely sent to us through the blessed gift of pure, wholesome water, which to all the countless homes of this great city comes like an angel visitant."&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Streifer Rubinstein, 'American Women Sculptors: A History of Women Working in Three Dimensions'', Chicago, 1990, pg. 63-66. Cited in "The Bethesda Fountain in New York City", article by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains- Splash and Spectacle, Water and Design from the Renaissance to the Present'', by Marilynn Symmes.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was criticized by some writers when it was opened in 1873: the ''New York Times'' called it "a feebly-pretty idealess thing",&lt;ref&gt;"The Bethesda Fountain", ''The New York Times'', June 1, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; but gradually the fountain became a popular favorite, featured in many films and in recent times in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Kushner - ''Angels in America part two'', Perestroika, New York, 1994, pp. 143-146.  Cited by Andrew Scott Dolkart in ''Fountains - Splash and Spectacle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1900-2000 ==
Fountains built in the United States between 1900 and 1950 mostly followed European models and classical styles.  For example:
*The handsome ''[[Samuel Francis Dupont Memorial Fountain]]'' (aka ''Dupont Circle Fountain''), in [[Dupont Circle]], [[Washington D.C.]], was designed and created by [[Henry Bacon]] and [[Daniel Chester French]], the architect and sculptor of the [[Lincoln Memorial]],  in 1921, in a pure [[Neoclassical sculpture|neoclassical]] style.
*The ''[[Buckingham Fountain]]'' in Grant Park, Chicago was one of the first American fountains to use powerful modern pumps to shoot water as high as 150 feet (46 meters) into the air.
*The ''Fountain of Prometheus,'' with sculpture by [[Paul Manship]], built at [[Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]] in 1933, was the first American fountain in the [[Art-Deco]] style.

After World War II, fountains in the United States became more varied in form.  Some, like the [[Vaillancourt Fountain]] in [[San Francisco]] (1971), were pure works of sculpture. The modernist French-Canadian [[Armand Vaillancourt]] built his monumental fountain at Embarcadero Plaza in San Francisco in a [[cubist]] style, though it was intended as a political statement - the official title is "Quebec Libre!", and the artist was arrested at the time of the opening for painting political slogans on his own fountain.

Other fountains, like the ''Frankin Roosevelt Memorial Waterfall'' (1997), by architect [[Lawrence Halprin]], were designed as landscapes to illustrate themes.  This fountain is part of the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial]] in [[Washington D.C.]], which has four outdoor "rooms" illustrating FDR's Presidency.  Each "room" contains a cascade or waterfall;  the cascade in the third room illustrates the turbulence of the years of the World War II.  Halprin wrote at an early stage of the design; "the whole environment of the memorial becomes sculpture: to touch, feel, hear and contact - with all the senses."&lt;ref&gt;Halprin, Lawrence, Notebooks 1959-1971, Cambridge Massachusetts (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most unusual modern American fountains is the [[Civil Rights Memorial]] (1989) at the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], designed by [[Maya Lin]], the designer of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington D.C.  The ''Civil Rights Memorial'' fountain features a low elliptical black granite table, with a thin surface of water flowing over the surface, over the inscribed names of civil rights leaders who lost their lives, illustrating the quotation from [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:  "...Until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."  Visitors are invited to touch the names through the water. "The water is as slow as I could get it," Lin wrote. "It remains very still until you touch it. Your hand carves ripples, which transform and alter the piece, just as reading the words completes the piece."&lt;ref&gt;Zinnser, William, "I Realized Her Tears Were Becoming Part of The Memorial (Maya Lin), ''Smithsonian'' 22, no. 6. September 1991 pp. 32-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial design''' is a process of [[design]] applied to [[Product (business)|products]] that are to be manufactured through techniques of [[mass production]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Kirkham|1999}} Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Noblet|1993|pp=21-22}} This distinguishes industrial design from [[craft]]-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.{{sfn|Noblet|1993|p=21}}

All manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can take many forms: it can be conducted by an individual or a large team; it can emphasize intuitive [[creativity]] or calculated [[Evidence-based design|scientific decision-making]], and often emphasizes both at the same time; and it can be influenced by factors as varied as [[Raw material|material]]s, [[Manufacturing process management|production processes]], [[business strategy]] and prevailing social, commercial or aesthetic attitudes.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=10}} The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, function, usability, [[physical ergonomics]], marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.&lt;ref&gt;de Noblet, J., ''Industrial Design'', Paris: A.F.A.A. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
For several millennia before the onset of [[industrialisation]], design, technical expertise, and manufacturing were often done by individuals [[Craft production|craftsmen]], who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation, according to their own manual skill, the requirements of their clients, experience accumulated through their own experimentation, and knowledge passed on to them through training or [[apprenticeship]].{{sfn|Noblet|1993|p=21}}

The [[division of labour]] that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}} The growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Bruges]], where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] of [[pattern books]]: collections of [[engravings]] illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} The use of [[Technical drawing|drawing]] to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by [[architects]] and [[shipwrights]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].{{sfn|Baynes|1991|p=108}}

In the 17th century, the growth of artistic patronage in centralized monarchical states such as [[France]] led to large government-operated manufacturing operations epitomised by the [[Gobelins Manufactory]], opened in [[Paris]] in 1667 by [[Louis XIV]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} Here teams of hundreds of craftsmen, including specialist artists, decorators and engravers, produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from [[tapestries]] and [[furniture]] to [[metalwork]] and [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]], all under the creative supervision of the King's leading artist [[Charles Le Brun]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=11-12}} This pattern of  large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century, such as the [[Meissen porcelain]] workshops established in 1709 by the [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxony]], where patterns from a range of sources, including court goldsmiths, sculptors and engravers, were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=12}} As long as reproduction remained craft-based, however, the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman, and tended to decline as the scale of production increased.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=12-13}}

===Birth of industrial design===
The emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the [[industrial revolution]] in [[Great Britain]] in the mid 18th century.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Kirkham|1999}} The rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made, [[urbanisation]] changed patterns of [[consumerism|consumption]], the [[imperialism|growth of empires]] broadened tastes and diversified markets, and the emergence of a wider [[middle class]] created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population.{{sfn|Benton|2000|p=380}}

The first use of the term "industrial design" is often attributed to the industrial designer [[Joseph Claude Sinel]] in 1919 (although he himself denied this in interviews), but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade.  [[Christopher Dresser]] is considered among the first independent industrial designers.&lt;ref name=dresser&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Dresser|url=http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|website=Design Museum|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920154512/http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|archive-date=20 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial design's origins lie in the industrialization of consumer products. For instance the [[Deutscher Werkbund]], founded in 1907 and a precursor to the [[Bauhaus]], was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, to put [[Germany]] on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the [[United States]].

The earliest use of the term may have been in [[The Art Journal|''The Art Union'', A monthly Journal of the Fine Arts]], 1839.

{{Quotation|Dyce's report to the Board of Trade on foreign schools of Design for Manufactures. Mr Dyces official visit to France, Prussia and Bavaria for the purpose of examining the state of schools of design in those countries will be fresh in the recollection of our readers. His report on this subject was ordered to be printed some few months since, on the motion of Mr Hume.

The school of St Peter, at Lyons was founded about 1750 for the instruction of draftsmen employed in preparing patterns for the silk manufacture. It has been much more successful than the Paris school and having been disorganized by the revolution, was restored by Napoleon and differently constituted, being then erected into an Academy of Fine Art: to which the study of design for silk manufacture was merely attached as a subordinate branch. It appears that all the students who entered the school commence as if they were intended for artists in the higher sense of the word and are not expected to decide as to whether they will devote themselves to the Fine Arts or to Industrial Design, until they have completed their exercises in drawing and painting of the figure from the antique and from the living model. It is for this reason, and from the fact that artists for industrial purposes are both well paid and highly considered (as being well instructed men) that so many individuals in France engage themselves in ''both'' pursuits.}}

''The Practical Draughtsman's Book of Industrial Design'' by [[Jacques-Eugène Armengaud]] was printed in 1853.&lt;ref name=practical&gt;{{cite web|title=The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design : forming a complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing by Armengaud, aîné (Jacques-Eugène), 1810-1891|url=https://archive.org/details/practicaldraught00arme|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle of the (translated) work explains, that it wants to offer a "complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing." The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belong to the field of industrial design.  This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field drawing education in France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

[[Robert Lepper]] helped to establish one of the country's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon magazine - Winter 2002"&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/magazine/02winter/newsbriefs.html "Newsbriefs: Lepper show runs at Warhol."] Carnegie Mellon Magazine. Winter 2002. Retrieved January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[Product design]] and industrial design overlap in the fields of [[user interface design]], [[information design]], and [[interaction design]]. Various [[schools]] of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges and design schools (product styling), to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design, to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics, the so-called ''functionalist'' school.&lt;ref&gt;Pulos, Arthur J., ''The American Design Adventure 1940-1975'', Cambridge, Mass:MIT Press (1988), p. 249 ({{ISBN|9780262161060}})&lt;/ref&gt; Except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design, educational programs in the U.S. for engineering design require accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/accreditation/ Abet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=About+NASAD Nasad.arts-accredit.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812143443/http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=About+NASAD |date=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
Most industrial designers complete a design or related program at a vocational school or university. Relevant programs include graphic design, interior design, industrial design, architectural technology, and drafting  Diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide. Diplomas and degrees take two  to four years of study. The study results in a [[Bachelor of Industrial Design]] (B.I.D.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc) or [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (B.F.A.). Afterwards, the bachelor programme can be extended to postgraduate degrees such as [[Master of Design]], [[Master of Fine Arts]] and others to a [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]].

==Definition==

Industrial design studies function and form—and the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as engineers who design the mechanical aspects of the product assuring functionality and manufacturability, and with marketers to identify and fulfill customer needs and expectations.

{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=Industrial design (ID) is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer.|source=[[Industrial Designers Society of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124105248/http://www.idsa.org/absolutenm/templates/?a=89 |archivedate=January 24, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Design, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers and engineers, because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Design|Carnegie Mellon's School of Design]], "Design is the process of taking something from its existing state and moving it to a preferred state" (Simon, Herbert A. "The sciences of the artiﬁcial." Cambridge, MA (1969, 1981, 1996)). This applies to new artifacts, whose existing state is undefined, and previously created artifacts, whose state stands to be improved.

Industrial design can overlap significantly with [[engineering design]], and in different countries the boundaries of the two concepts can vary, but in general [[engineering]] focuses principally on functionality or utility of products, whereas industrial design focuses principally on ''aesthetic and user-interface'' aspects of products. In many jurisdictions this distinction is effectively defined by [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|credentials and/or licensure]] required to engage in the practice of engineering.&lt;ref name=mcadc&gt;{{cite web|title=The Difference Between Industrial Design And Design Engineering|url=http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|website=MCADC Cafe|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920154512/http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|archive-date=20 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Industrial design" as such does not overlap much with the engineering sub-discipline of [[industrial engineering]], except for the latter's sub-specialty of [[ergonomics]].

At the 29th General Assembly in Gwangju, South Korea, 2015, the Professional Practise Committee unveiled a renewed definition of industrial design as follows:
"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences."
An extended version of this definition is as follows:
"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what’s possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and co-create solutions with the intent of making a product, system, service, experience or a business, better. At its heart, Industrial Design provides a more optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres.
Industrial Designers place the human in the centre of the process. They acquire a deep understanding of user needs through empathy and apply a pragmatic, user centric problem solving process to design products, systems, services and experiences. They are strategic stakeholders in the innovation process and are uniquely positioned to bridge varied professional disciplines and business interests. They value the economic, social and environmental impact of their work and their contribution towards co-creating a better quality of life. "&lt;ref name="ICSID 2015 in Gwangju"&gt;[http://www.icsid.org/about/about/articles31.htm ICSID web：DEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317224506/http://www.icsid.org/about/about/articles31.htm |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process==

[[Image:VW 1300 side.jpg|thumb|Model 1300 Volkswagen Beetle]]

Although the process of design may be considered 'creative,' many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. These processes are best defined by the industrial designers and/or other team members. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, [[computer-aided industrial design]] and CAD programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype first and then use [[industrial CT scanning]] to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model. From this the manufacturing process may be modified to improve the product.

Product characteristics specified by industrial designers may include the overall form of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, [[colors]], texture, form, and aspects concerning the [[Ergonomic|use of the product]]. Additionally they may specify aspects concerning the production process, [[material selection|choice of materials]] and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the [[point of sale]]. The inclusion of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added value by improving [[usability]], lowering production costs and developing more appealing products.

Industrial design may also focus on technical concepts, products, and processes. In addition to [[aesthetics]], usability, and ergonomics, it can also encompass engineering, usefulness, market placement, and other concerns—such as psychology, desire, and the emotional attachment of the user. These [[Architectural design values|values]] and accompanying aspects that form the basis of industrial design can vary—between different schools of thought, and among practicing designers.

==Industrial design rights==
{{Main article|Industrial design rights}}

Industrial design rights are [[intellectual property]] rights that make exclusive the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian.  A design patent would also be considered under this category.  An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Under the [[Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs]], a [[WIPO]]-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.

==Examples of iconic industrial design==

A number of industrial designers have made such a significant impact on culture and daily life that their work is documented by historians of social science. [[Alvar Aalto]], renowned as an [[architect]], also designed a significant number of household items, such as chairs, stools, lamps, a tea-cart, and vases. [[Raymond Loewy]] was a prolific American designer who is responsible for the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] corporate logo, the original [[BP]] logo (in use until 2000), the [[PRR S1]] steam locomotive, the [[Studebaker Starlight]] (including the later iconic bulletnose), as well as [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric razors, [[Electrolux]] refrigerators, short-wave radios, [[Le Creuset]] French ovens, and a complete line of modern furniture, among many other items.

[[Richard A. Teague]], who spent most of his career with the [[American Motor Company]], originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings. He was responsible for such unique automotive designs as the [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]], [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]], [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], and the complete interior of the [[Eagle Premier]].

Milwaukee's [[Brooks Stevens]] was best known for his [[Milwaukee Road]] [[Skytop Lounge]] car  and [[Oscar Mayer]] [[Wienermobile]] designs, among others.

[[Viktor Schreckengost]] designed bicycles manufactured by Murray bicycles for Murray and Sears, Roebuck and Company. With engineer Ray Spiller, he designed the first truck with a cab-over-engine configuration, a design in use to this day. Schreckengost also founded The Cleveland Institute of Art's school of industrial design.

[[Oskar Barnack]] was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer, and the father of 35mm photography. He developed the [[Leica Camera|Leica]], which became the hallmark for photography for 50 years, and remains a high-water mark for mechanical and optical design.

[[Charles and Ray Eames]] were most famous for their pioneering furniture designs, such as the [[Eames Lounge Chair Wood]] and [[Eames Lounge Chair]]. Other influential designers included [[Henry Dreyfuss]], [[Eliot Noyes]], [[John Vassos]], and [[Russel Wright]].

[[Dieter Rams]] is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company [[Braun (company)|Braun]] and the [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] school of industrial design.

Many of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s recent iconic products were designed by Sir [[Jonathan Ive]].

The '''light-harvesting complex''' (or '''antenna complex''') is an array of [[protein]] and [[chlorophyll]] molecules embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membrane of plants, which transfer light energy to one chlorophyll ''a'' molecule at the [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]] of a [[photosystem]].

The [[photosynthetic pigment|antenna pigments]] are predominantly [[chlorophyll b|chlorophyll ''b'']], [[xanthophylls]], and [[carotene]]s. [[Chlorophyll a|Chlorophyll ''a'']] is known as the core pigment. Their absorption spectra are non-overlapping and broaden the range of light that can be absorbed in photosynthesis. The carotenoids have another role as an antioxidant to prevent photo-oxidative damage of chlorophyll molecules. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by [[resonance energy transfer]] to a specialized chlorophyll-protein complex known as the [[Photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]] of each [[photosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Biochemistry 4th Ed.|last = Voet and Voet|first = Donald and Judith G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0470-57095-1|location = USA|pages = 906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction center initiates a complex series of chemical reactions that capture energy in the form of chemical bonds.

For photosystem II, when either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorb energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an [[electron acceptor]] molecule, [[pheophytin]], leaving the chlorophyll ''a'' in an [[oxidation|oxidized]] state. The oxidised chlorophyll ''a'' replaces the electrons by [[photolysis]] that involves the oxidation of water molecules to [[oxygen]], [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s.

Under changing light conditions, the reversible phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCII) represents a system for balancing the excitation energy between the two photosystems.&lt;ref name="PUB00015383"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Liu XD, Shen YG |title=NaCl-induced phosphorylation of light harvesting chlorophyll a/b proteins in thylakoid membranes from the halotolerant green alga, Dunaliella salina |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=569 |issue=1–3 |pages=337–340 |year=2004 |pmid=15225658 |doi=10.1016/j.febslet.2004.05.065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The N-terminus of the chlorophyll A-B binding protein extends into the stroma where it is involved with adhesion of granal membranes and photo-regulated by reversible phosphorylation of its threonine residues.&lt;ref name="PUB00015384"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson B, Yang DH, Paulsen H |title=The N-terminal domain of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein complex (LHCII) is essential for its acclimative proteolysis |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=466 |issue=2–3 |pages=385–388 |year=2000 |pmid=10682866 |doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(00)01107-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these processes are believed to mediate the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems I and II.

This family also includes the photosystem II protein PsbS, which plays a role in energy-dependent quenching that increases thermal dissipation of excess absorbed light energy in the photosystem.&lt;ref name="PUB00015385"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kramer D, Bassi R, Li XP, Gilmore AM, Caffarri S, Golan T, Niyogi KK |title=Regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting involves intrathylakoid lumen pH sensing by the PsbS protein |journal=J.

The '''magnetosphere of [[Jupiter]]''' is the cavity created in the [[solar wind]] by the planet's [[magnetic field]]. Extending up to seven million kilometers in the Sun's direction and almost to the orbit of [[Saturn]] in the opposite direction, Jupiter's [[magnetosphere]] is the largest and most powerful of any planetary magnetosphere in the [[Solar System]], and by volume the largest known continuous structure in the Solar System after the [[heliosphere]]. Wider and flatter than the [[Earth's magnetosphere]], Jupiter's is stronger by an [[order of magnitude]], while its [[magnetic moment]] is roughly 18,000 times larger. The existence of Jupiter's magnetic field was first inferred from observations of radio emissions at the end of the 1950s and was directly observed by the ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' spacecraft in 1973.

Jupiter's internal magnetic field is generated by electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid [[metallic hydrogen]]. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] eject large amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]] gas into space, forming a large [[gas torus|torus]] around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same [[angular velocity]] and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, rather than by the [[solar wind]] like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent [[aurora (astronomy)|auorae]] around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter can be thought of as a very weak [[radio pulsar]]. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], including [[infrared]], [[visible light|visible]], [[ultraviolet]] and [[soft X-rays]].

The action of the magnetosphere traps and accelerates particles, producing intense belts of [[particle radiation|radiation]] similar to Earth's [[Van Allen belts]], but thousands of times stronger. The interaction of energetic particles with the surfaces of Jupiter's largest [[Galilean moons|moons]] markedly affects their chemical and physical properties. Those same particles also affect and are affected by the motions of the particles within Jupiter's tenuous [[Rings of Jupiter|planetary ring system]]. Radiation belts present a significant hazard for spacecraft and potentially to human space travellers.

== Structure ==
Jupiter's magnetosphere is a complex structure comprising a [[bow shock]], [[magnetosheath]], [[magnetopause]], [[magnetotail]], magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates from a number of different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the [[solar wind]], which carries the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref name=Khurana12&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal magnetic field ===
The bulk of Jupiter's magnetic field, like [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth]]'s, is generated by an internal [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its [[outer core]]. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten [[iron]] and [[nickel]], Jupiter's is composed of [[metallic hydrogen]].&lt;ref name=Russell1993-694/&gt; As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a [[dipole]], with north and south magnetic poles at the ends of a single magnetic axis.&lt;ref name=Khurana3/&gt; However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Kivelson303/&gt;{{refn|The north and south poles of the Earth's dipole should not be confused with Earth's [[North magnetic pole]] and [[South magnetic pole]], which lie in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively.|group=note}} Jupiter's field also has [[quadrupole]], [[octupole]] and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.&lt;ref name=Khurana3&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; the tilt is similar to that of the Earth (11.3°).&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khurana3/&gt; Its equatorial field strength is about 776.6&amp;nbsp;[[microtesla|μT]] (7.766&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]]), which corresponds to a dipole [[magnetic moment]] of about 2.83{{E-sp|20}} [[Tesla (unit)|T]]·[[cubic meter|m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]]. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000&amp;nbsp;times larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Connerney|first=J. E.

=== Size and shape ===
Jupiter's internal magnetic field prevents the [[solar wind]], a stream of ionized particles emitted by the [[Sun]], from interacting directly with [[atmosphere of Jupiter|its atmosphere]], and instead diverts it away from the planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] different from that of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Khurana1&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt; The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the [[Sun]] and its visible [[corona]] would fit inside it with room to spare.&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715&gt;[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, pp. 715–717&lt;/ref&gt; If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the [[full moon]] in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.&lt;ref name="Russell1993-715"/&gt;

As with Earth's magnetosphere, the boundary separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere is called the [[magnetopause]].&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; The distance from the magnetopause to the center of the planet is from 45 to 100 ''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; (where ''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;=71,492&amp;nbsp;km is the radius of Jupiter) at the [[subsolar point]]—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on [[solar wind|solar activity]].&lt;ref name="Russell2001-1016"&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1015–1016&lt;/ref&gt; In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet's center) lies the [[bow shock]], a [[wake]]-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Krupp15"&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Russell1993-725"&gt;[[#Russell1993|Russel]], 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;725–727&lt;/ref&gt; The region between the bow shock and magnetopause is called the [[magnetosheath]].&lt;ref name="Khurana1"/&gt;

At the opposite side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing [[magnetotail]], which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref name="Khurana17"/&gt; The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated by a thin layer of plasma called the tail [[current sheet]] (orange layer in the middle).&lt;ref name="Khurana17"&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18&lt;/ref&gt; Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the [[radiation belt]]s at distances closer than 10&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Khurana6"&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of Jupiter's magnetosphere described above is sustained by the neutral sheet current (also known as the magnetotail current), which flows with Jupiter's rotation through the tail [[plasma sheet]], the tail currents, which flow against Jupiter's rotation at the outer boundary of the magnetotail, and the magnetopause currents (or Chapman–Ferraro currents), which flow against rotation along the dayside magnetopause.&lt;ref name="Kivelson303"/&gt; These currents create the magnetic field that cancels the internal field outside the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Khurana17"/&gt; They also interact substantially with the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Kivelson303&gt;[[#Kivelson|Kivelson]], 2005, pp. 303–313&lt;/ref&gt;

Jupiter's magnetosphere is traditionally divided into three parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is located at distances closer than 10&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet. The magnetic field within it remains approximately dipole, because contributions from the currents flowing in the magnetospheric equatorial plasma sheet are small. In the middle (between 10 and 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;) and outer (further than 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and is seriously disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

=== Role of Io ===
[[File:iotorus.jpg|thumb|300 px|Io's interaction with Jupiter's magnetosphere. The Io plasma torus is in yellow.]]
Although overall the shape of Jupiter's magnetosphere resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1016/&gt; Jupiter's volcanically active moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of new material every second.&lt;ref name=Khurana5&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]], a major part of which is [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociated]] into atoms and [[ionization|ionized]] by the solar [[ultraviolet radiation]], producing ions of [[sulfur]] and [[oxygen]]: S&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Krupp3&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|talk=Talk:Magnetosphere of Jupiter #Plasma originating from Io|date=June 2018}} These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the ''Io plasma torus'': a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt; The [[Hot plasma|plasma temperature]] within the torus is 10–100&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] (100,000–1,000,000&amp;nbsp;K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10&amp;nbsp;keV (100&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp1&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of several processes—[[diffusion]] and [[interchange instability]] being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Krupp4&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt; As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; These radial currents are also the source of the magnetic field's azimuthal component, which as a result bends back against the rotation.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; The [[particle number density]] of the plasma decreases from around 2,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in the Io torus to about 0.2&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; at a distance of 35&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Khurana10&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 10–12&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; Eventually at the distances greater than 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1024&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1024–1025&lt;/ref&gt; As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20&amp;nbsp;[[Kiloelectronvolt|keV]] (200&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana10/&gt; This plasma, [[adiabatic heating|adiabatically heated]] as it approaches Jupiter,&lt;ref name=Khurana20&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt;

=== Magnetodisk ===
While Earth's magnetic field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and "wobbles" periodically about its axis.&lt;ref name=depths/&gt; The main reasons for this disk-like configuration are the [[centrifugal force]] from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's [[magnetic field line]]s, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1021&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, pp. 1021–1024&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane,&lt;ref name=Krupp3/&gt; approximately near the [[magnetic equator]]. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1016/&gt; The load of plasma from Io greatly expands the size of the Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Krupp15/&gt; In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, whereas it is actually 75&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; on average.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

The configuration of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the azimuthal [[ring current]] (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet.&lt;ref name=Kivelson315&gt;[[#Kivelson|Kivelson]], 2005, pp. 315–316&lt;/ref&gt; The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a [[centripetal force]], which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160&amp;nbsp;million [[ampere]]s.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khurana13&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dynamics ==

=== Co-rotation and radial currents ===
[[File:Currents in Jovian Magnetosphere.png|thumb|300px|The magnetic field of Jupiter and co-rotation enforcing currents]]
The main driver of Jupiter's magnetosphere is the planet's rotation.&lt;ref name=Blanc250&gt;[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 250–253&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect Jupiter is similar to a device called a [[Unipolar generator]]. When Jupiter rotates, its ionosphere moves relatively to the dipole magnetic field of the planet. Because the dipole magnetic moment points in the direction of the rotation,&lt;ref name=Kivelson303/&gt; the [[Lorentz force]], which appears as a result of this motion, drives negatively charged electrons to the poles, while positively charged ions are pushed towards the equator.&lt;ref name=Cowley1069&gt;[[#Cowley|Cowley]], 2001, pp. 1069–76&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the poles become negatively charged and the regions closer to the equator become positively charged. Since the magnetosphere of Jupiter is filled with highly conductive plasma, the [[electrical circuit]] is closed through it.&lt;ref name=Cowley1069/&gt; A current called the direct current{{refn|The direct current in the Jovian magnetosphere is not to be confused with the [[direct current]] used in electrical circuits. The latter is the opposite of the [[alternating current]].|group=note}} flows along the magnetic field lines from the ionosphere to the equatorial plasma sheet. This current then flows radially away from the planet within the equatorial plasma sheet and finally returns to the planetary ionosphere from the outer reaches of the magnetosphere along the field lines connected to the poles. The currents that flow along the magnetic field lines are generally called field-aligned or [[Birkeland current]]s.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; The radial current interacts with the planetary magnetic field, and the resulting Lorentz force accelerates the magnetospheric plasma in the direction of planetary rotation. This is the main mechanism that maintains co-rotation of the plasma in Jupiter's magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Cowley1069/&gt;

The current flowing from the ionosphere to the plasma sheet is especially strong when the corresponding part of the plasma sheet rotates slower than the planet.&lt;ref name="Cowley1069" /&gt; As mentioned above, co-rotation breaks down in the region located between 20 and 40&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter. This region corresponds to the magnetodisk, where the magnetic field is highly stretched.&lt;ref name=Blanc254&gt;[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 254–261&lt;/ref&gt; The strong direct current flowing into the magnetodisk originates in a very limited latitudinal range of about {{nowrap|16 ± 1}}° from the Jovian magnetic poles. These narrow circular regions correspond to Jupiter's main [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral ovals]]. (See below.)&lt;ref name=Cowley1083&gt;[[#Cowley|Cowley]], 2001, pp. 1083–87&lt;/ref&gt; The return current flowing from the outer magnetosphere beyond 50&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; enters the Jovian ionosphere near the poles, closing the electrical circuit. The total radial current in the Jovian magnetosphere is estimated at 60 million–140&amp;nbsp;million amperes.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cowley1069/&gt;

The acceleration of the plasma into the co-rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the [[kinetic energy]] of the plasma.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krupp1/&gt; In that sense, the Jovian magnetosphere is powered by the planet's rotation, whereas the Earth's magnetosphere is powered mainly by the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Krupp1/&gt;

=== Interchange instability and reconnection ===
The main problem encountered in deciphering the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy cold plasma from the Io torus at 6&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the [[Rayleigh-Taylor instability]] in [[hydrodynamics]].&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, [[centrifugal force]] plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to [[Io (moon)|Io]]) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of [[flux tube]]s filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric [[turbulence]].&lt;ref name=Russell2008&gt;[[#Russell2008|Russell]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jovian magnetosphere (view from the north pole).png|thumb|left|The magnetosphere of Jupiter as viewed from above the north pole&lt;ref name=Krupp2007-216/&gt;]]
This highly hypothetical picture of the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the [[Galileo spacecraft]], which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp4/&gt; These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Krupp7&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.

When flux tubes loaded with the cold Ionian plasma reach the outer magnetosphere, they go through a [[reconnection]] process, which separates the magnetic field from the plasma.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The former returns to the inner magnetosphere in the form of flux tubes filled with hot and less dense plasma, while the latter are probably ejected down the magnetotail in the form of [[plasmoid]]s—large blobs of plasma. The reconnection processes may correspond to the global reconfiguration events also observed by the Galileo spacecraft, which occurred regularly every 2–3 days.&lt;ref name=Krupp11/&gt; The reconfiguration events usually included rapid and chaotic variation of the magnetic field strength and direction, as well as abrupt changes in the motion of the plasma, which often stopped co-rotating and began flowing outward. They were mainly observed in the dawn sector of the night magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp11&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma flowing down the tail along the open field lines is called the planetary wind.&lt;ref name=Krupp3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khurana18&gt;[[#Khurana|Khurana]], 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

The reconnection events are analogues to the [[Magnetosphere#Magnetic substorms and storms|magnetic substorm]]s in the Earth's magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The difference seems to be their respective energy sources: terrestrial substorms involve storage of the solar wind's energy in the magnetotail followed by its release through a reconnection event in the tail's neutral current sheet. The latter also creates a plasmoid which moves down the tail.&lt;ref name=Russell2001-1011&gt;[[#Russell2001|Russell]], 2001, p. 1011&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in Jupiter's magnetosphere the rotational energy is stored in the magnetodisk and released when a plasmoid separates from it.&lt;ref name=Krupp11/&gt;

=== Influence of the solar wind ===
[[File:Jovian magnetosphere vs solar wind.svg|thumb|300px|Interactions between solar wind and Jovian magnetosphere]]
Whereas the dynamics of Jovian magnetosphere mainly depend on internal sources of energy, the solar wind probably has a role as well,&lt;ref name=Nichols&gt;[[#Nichols|Nichols]], 2006, pp. 393–394&lt;/ref&gt; particularly as a source of high-energy [[proton]]s.{{refn|The Jovian [[ionosphere]] is another significant source of protons.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt; The structure of the outer magnetosphere shows some features of a solar wind-driven magnetosphere, including a significant dawn–dusk asymmetry.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; In particular, magnetic field lines in the dusk sector are bent in the opposite direction to those in the dawn sector.&lt;ref name=Khurana13/&gt; In addition, the dawn magnetosphere contains open field lines connecting to the magnetotail, whereas in the dusk magnetosphere, the field lines are closed.&lt;ref name=Khurana17/&gt; All these observations indicate that a solar wind driven reconnection process, known on Earth as the [[Dungey cycle]], may also be taking place in the Jovian magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nichols/&gt;

The extent of the solar wind's influence on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown;&lt;ref name=Krupp18&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; however, it could be especially strong at times of elevated solar activity.&lt;ref name=Nichols404&gt;[[#Nichols|Nichols]], 2006, pp. 404–405&lt;/ref&gt; The auroral radio,&lt;ref name=Zarka375/&gt; optical and X-ray emissions,&lt;ref name=Elsner/&gt; as well as [[synchrotron]] emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure, indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Krupp11/&gt;

== Emissions ==

=== Aurorae ===
[[File:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.mod.svg|thumb|400 px|Image of Jupiter's northern aurorae, showing the main auroral oval, the polar emissions, and the spots generated by the interaction with Jupiter's natural satellites]]
Jupiter demonstrates bright, persistent aurorae around both poles. Unlike Earth's aurorae, which are transient and only occur at times of heightened solar activity, Jupiter's aurorae are permanent, though their intensity varies from day to day. They consist of three main components: the main ovals, which are bright, narrow (less than 1000&amp;nbsp;km in width) circular features located at approximately 16° from the magnetic poles;&lt;ref name=Palier1171/&gt; the satellites' auroral spots, which correspond to the footprints of the magnetic field lines connecting Jupiter's ionosphere with those of its largest moons, and transient polar emissions situated within the main ovals.&lt;ref name=Palier1171&gt;[[#Palier|Palier]], 2001, pp. 1171–73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 311–316&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the auroral emissions were detected in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to X-rays (up to 3&amp;nbsp;keV), they are brightest in the mid-infrared (wavelength 3–4&amp;nbsp;μm and 7–14&amp;nbsp;μm) and deep ultraviolet spectral regions (wavelength 80–180&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj342&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The main ovals are the dominant part of the Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations,&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311/&gt; but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae.&lt;ref name=Cowley2-49&gt;[[#Cowley2|Cowley]], 2003, pp. 49–53&lt;/ref&gt; As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj316&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 316–319&lt;/ref&gt; These electrons carry [[field aligned current]]s, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents.&lt;ref name=Cowley1083/&gt; The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100&amp;nbsp;keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj306&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, pp. 306–311&lt;/ref&gt; The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100&amp;nbsp;[[terawatt|TW]].&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj296&gt;[[#Bhardwaj|Bhardwaj]], 2000, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as [[Joule heating]]. This heating, which produces up to 300&amp;nbsp;TW of power, is responsible for the strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.{{sfn|Miller Aylward et al.|2005|pp=335–339}}

Spots were found to correspond to three Galilean moons: Io, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].{{refn|Callisto may have a spot as well; however, it would be unobservable because it would coincide with the main auroral oval.&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;|group=note}}&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;[[#Clarke|Clarke]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed in the vicinity of moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to [[Alfvén waves|Alfvén current]]s flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water ice from their surfaces.&lt;ref name=Blanc277&gt;[[#Blanc|Blanc]], 2005, pp. 277–283&lt;/ref&gt;

Bright arcs and spots sporadically appear within the main ovals. These transient phenomena are thought to be related to interaction with the solar wind.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311/&gt; The magnetic field lines in this region are believed to be open or to map onto the magnetotail.&lt;ref name=Bhardwaj311/&gt; The secondary ovals observed inside the main oval may be related to the boundary between open and closed magnetic field lines or to the polar [[Aurora (astronomy)#Solar wind and the magnetosphere|cusp]]s.&lt;ref name=Palier1170&gt;[[#Palier|Palier]], 2001, pp. 1170–71&lt;/ref&gt; The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth's poles: both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops, during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet.&lt;ref name=Blanc254/&gt; The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X-rays. The spectrum of the auroral X-ray radiation consists of [[spectral line]]s of highly ionized oxygen and sulfur, which probably appear when energetic (hundreds of kiloelectronvolts) S and O ions precipitate into the polar atmosphere of Jupiter. The source of this precipitation remains unknown.&lt;ref name=Elsner&gt;[[#Elsner|Elsner]], 2005, pp. 419–420&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jupiter at radio wavelengths ===
Jupiter is a powerful source of [[radio wave]]s in the spectral region stretching from several [[kilohertz]] to tens of [[megahertz]]. Radio waves with [[radio frequency|frequencies]] of less than about 0.3&amp;nbsp;MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1&amp;nbsp;km) are called the Jovian [[kilometer|kilometric]] radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3&amp;nbsp;MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000&amp;nbsp;m) are called the [[hectometer|hectometric]] radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40&amp;nbsp;MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100&amp;nbsp;m) are referred to as the [[decameter|decametric]] radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.&lt;ref name=Zarka20160&gt;[[#Zarka|Zarka]], 1998, pp. 20,160–168&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The non-Io-DAM is much weaker than the Io-DAM, and is the high-frequency tail of the HOM emissions.&lt;ref name=Zarka20160/&gt;|group=note}}
[[File:Radio emissions of Solar System planets.png|thumb|left|300px|The spectrum of Jovian radio emissions compared with spectra of four other magnetized planets, where (N,T,S,U)KR means (Neptunian, Terrestrial, Saturnian and Uranian) kilometric radiation]]
The majority of these emissions are thought to be produced by a mechanism called Cyclotron Maser Instability, which develops close to the auroral regions, when electrons bounce back and forth between the poles. The electrons involved in the generation of radio waves are probably those carrying currents from the poles of the planet to the magnetodisk.&lt;ref name=Zarka20173&gt;[[#Zarka|Zarka]], 1998, pp. 20, 173–181&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of Jovian radio emissions usually varies smoothly with time; however, Jupiter periodically emits short and powerful bursts (S bursts), which can outshine all other components. The total emitted power of the DAM component is about 100&amp;nbsp;GW, while the power of all other HOM/KOM components is about 10&amp;nbsp;GW. In comparison, the total power of Earth's radio emissions is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;GW.&lt;ref name=Zarka20160/&gt;

Jupiter's radio and particle emissions are strongly modulated by its rotation, which makes the planet somewhat similar to a [[pulsar]].&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;[[#Hill|Hill]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This periodical modulation is probably related to asymmetries in the Jovian magnetosphere, which are caused by the tilt of the magnetic moment with respect to the rotational axis as well as by high-latitude [[magnetic anomaly|magnetic anomalies]]. The physics governing Jupiter's radio emissions is similar to that of radio pulsars. They differ only in the scale, and Jupiter can be considered a very small [[radio pulsar]] too.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; In addition, Jupiter's radio emissions strongly depend on solar wind pressure and, hence, on [[solar variation|solar activity]].&lt;ref name=Zarka20160/&gt;

In addition to relatively long-wavelength radiation, Jupiter also emits [[synchrotron radiation]] (also known as the Jovian [[decimeter|decimetric]] radiation or DIM radiation) with frequencies in the range of 0.1–15&amp;nbsp;GHz (wavelength from 3&amp;nbsp;m to 2&amp;nbsp;cm),&lt;ref name=Zarka/&gt; which is the [[bremsstrahlung radiation]] of the relativistic electrons trapped in the inner radiation belts of the planet. The energy of the electrons that contribute to the DIM emissions is from 0.1 to 100&amp;nbsp;MeV,&lt;ref name=Santos-Costa&gt;[[#Santos-Costa|Santos-Costa]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; while the leading contribution comes from the electrons with energy in the range 1–20&amp;nbsp;MeV.&lt;ref name=Bolton&gt;[[#Bolton|Bolton]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This radiation is well understood and was used since the beginning of the 1960s to study the structure of the planet's magnetic field and radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Zarka384&gt;[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 384–385&lt;/ref&gt; The particles in the radiation belts originate in the outer magnetosphere and are adiabatically accelerated, when they are transported to the inner magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana20/&gt;

Jupiter's magnetosphere ejects streams of high-energy electrons and ions (energy up to tens [[megaelectronvolt]]s), which travel as far as Earth's orbit.&lt;ref name=Krupp17&gt;[[#Krupp|Krupp]], 2004, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; These streams are highly [[collimated]] and vary with the rotational period of the planet like the radio emissions. In this respect as well, Jupiter shows similarity to a pulsar.&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt;

== Interaction with rings and moons ==
{{See also|Rings of Jupiter|Ganymedian magnetosphere|Space weathering}}
Jupiter's extensive magnetosphere envelops its ring system and the orbits of all four [[Galilean satellites]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2/&gt; Orbiting near the magnetic equator, these bodies serve as sources and sinks of magnetospheric plasma, while energetic particles from the magnetosphere alter their surfaces. The particles [[sputtering|sputter]] off material from the surfaces and create chemical changes via [[radiolysis]].&lt;ref name=Johnson-1&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma's co-rotation with the planet means that the plasma preferably interacts with the moons' trailing hemispheres, causing noticeable hemispheric asymmetries.&lt;ref name=Johnson-3&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the large internal magnetic fields of the moons contribute to the Jovian magnetic field.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2/&gt;
[[File:Jupiter radio.jpg|thumb|Jupiter's variable radiation belts]]
Close to Jupiter, the planet's rings and small moons absorb high-energy particles (energy above 10&amp;nbsp;keV) from the radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Burns1/&gt; This creates noticeable gaps in the belts' spatial distribution and affects the decimetric synchrotron radiation. In fact, the existence of Jupiter's rings was first hypothesized on the basis of data from the ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' spacecraft, which detected a sharp drop in the number of high-energy ions close to the planet.&lt;ref name=Burns1&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The planetary magnetic field strongly influences the motion of sub-micrometer ring particles as well, which acquire an electrical charge under the influence of solar [[ultraviolet radiation]]. Their behavior is similar to that of co-rotating [[ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Burns12&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; The resonant interaction between the co-rotation and the orbital motion is thought to be responsible for the creation of Jupiter's innermost halo ring (located between 1.4 and 1.71&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;), which consists of sub-micrometer particles on highly [[Inclination|inclined]] and [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] orbits.&lt;ref name=Burns10&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; The particles originate in the main ring; however, when they drift toward Jupiter, their orbits are modified by the strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance located at 1.71&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, which increases their inclinations and eccentricities.{{refn|A Lorentz resonance is one that exists between a particle's orbital speed and the rotation period of a planet's magnetosphere. If the ratio of their angular frequencies is ''m'':''n'' (a [[rational number]]) then scientists call it an ''m'':''n'' Lorentz resonance. So, in the case of a 3:2 resonance, a particle at a distance of about 1.71&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from Jupiter makes three revolutions around the planet, while the planet's magnetic field makes two revolutions.&lt;ref name=Burns17/&gt;|group=note}} Another 2:1 Lorentz resonance at 1.4&amp;nbsp;Rj defines the inner boundary of the halo ring.&lt;ref name=Burns17&gt;[[#Burns|Burns]], 2004, pp. 17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface pressures in the range 0.01–1&amp;nbsp;[[bar (unit)|nbar]], which in turn support substantial [[ionosphere]]s with electron densities in the range of 1,000–10,000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfvén wings.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-8&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction of the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the non-magnetized planets like [[Venus]], although the co-rotational speed is usually [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] (the speeds vary from 74 to 328&amp;nbsp;km/s), which prevents the formation of a [[bow shock]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-1&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent.&lt;ref name="Kivelson2-2" /&gt; In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).&lt;ref name=Cooper137&gt;[[#Cooper|Cooper]], 2001, pp. 137,139&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PIA04433 Jupiter Torus Diagram cr.jpg|thumb|left|Plasma tori created by Io and Europa]]
The icy Galilean moons, [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], all generate induced magnetic moments in response to changes in Jupiter's magnetic field. These varying magnetic moments create dipole magnetic fields around them, which act to compensate for changes in the ambient field.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-2/&gt; The induction is thought to take place in subsurface layers of salty water, which are likely to exist in all of Jupiter's large icy moons. These underground oceans can potentially harbor life, and evidence for their presence was one of the most important discoveries made in the 1990s by [[Galileo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]].&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-10&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-10/&gt; Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede's magnetic field diverts the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere. It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field lines are closed, from energetic particles. The latter can still freely strike Ganymede's poles, where the field lines are open.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-16&gt;[[#Kivelson2|Kivelson]], 2004, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Williams1&gt;[[#Williams|Williams]], 1998, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Energetic electrons entering its thin atmosphere are responsible for the observed Ganymedian polar aurorae.&lt;ref name=Kivelson2-16/&gt;

Charged particles have a considerable influence on the surface properties of Galilean moons. Plasma originating from Io carries sulfur and [[sodium]] ions farther from the planet,&lt;ref name=Cooper154&gt;[[#Cooper|Cooper]], 2001, pp. 154–156&lt;/ref&gt; where they are implanted preferentially on the trailing hemispheres of Europa and Ganymede.&lt;ref name=Johnson-15&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt; On Callisto however, for unknown reasons, sulfur is concentrated on the leading hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Hibbitts&gt;[[#Hibbitts|Hibbitts]], 2000, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma may also be responsible for darkening the moons' trailing hemispheres (again, except Callisto's).&lt;ref name=Johnson-3/&gt; Energetic electrons and ions, with the flux of the latter being more isotropic, bombard surface ice, sputtering atoms and molecules off and causing [[radiolysis]] of water and other [[chemical compound]]s. The energetic particles break water into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]], maintaining the thin oxygen atmospheres of the icy moons (since the hydrogen escapes more rapidly). The compounds produced radiolytically on the surfaces of Galilean moons also include [[ozone]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]].&lt;ref name=Johnson-8/&gt; If organics or [[carbonate]]s are present, [[carbon dioxide]], [[methanol]] and [[carbonic acid]] can be produced as well. In the presence of sulfur, likely products include sulfur dioxide, [[hydrogen disulfide]] and [[sulfuric acid]].&lt;ref name=Johnson-8&gt;[[#Johnson|Johnson]], 2004, pp. 8–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxidant]]s produced by radiolysis, like oxygen and ozone, may be trapped inside the ice and carried downward to the oceans over geologic time intervals, thus serving as a possible energy source for life.&lt;ref name="Cooper154" /&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:Pioneer 10 at Jupiter.jpg|thumb|Pioneer 10 provided the first ''in situ'' and definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetosphere]]

The first evidence for the existence of Jupiter's magnetic field came in 1955, with the discovery of the [[decameter|decametric]] radio emission or DAM.&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;[[#Burke|Burke]], 1955&lt;/ref&gt; As the DAM's spectrum extended up to 40&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]], astronomers concluded that Jupiter must possess a magnetic field with a strength of about 1&amp;nbsp;milli[[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s (10&amp;nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]).&lt;ref name=Zarka&gt;[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 371–375&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, observations in the [[microwave]] part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]]) led to the discovery of the Jovian [[decimeter|decimetric]] radiation (DIM) and the realization that it was [[synchrotron radiation]] emitted by [[Relativistic electron beam|relativistic electrons]] trapped in the planet's radiation belts.&lt;ref name=Drake&gt;[[#Drake|Drake]], 1959&lt;/ref&gt; These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.&lt;ref name=Khurana5/&gt;

By 1973 the magnetic moment was known within a factor of two, whereas the tilt was correctly estimated at about 10°.&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; The modulation of Jupiter's DAM by [[Io (moon)|Io]] (the so-called Io-DAM) was discovered in 1964, and allowed Jupiter's [[rotation period]] to be precisely determined.&lt;ref name=Zarka375&gt;[[#Zarka2|Zarka]], 2005, pp. 375–377&lt;/ref&gt; The definitive discovery of the Jovian magnetic field occurred in December 1973, when the [[Pioneer 10]] spacecraft flew near the planet.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[[#Smith|Smith]], 1974&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Pioneer 10 carried a helium vector [[magnetometer]], which measured the magnetic field of Jupiter directly.

[[File:Ulysses at Jupiter.jpg|thumb|The path of the Ulysses spacecraft through the magnetosphere of Jupiter in 1992]]
[[File:Galileo - MAD photo - mag1.jpg|thumb|Galileo orbiter's magnetometer instrument]]
As of 2009 a total of eight spacecraft have flown around Jupiter and all have contributed to the present knowledge of the Jovian magnetosphere. The first space probe to reach Jupiter was [[Pioneer 10]] in December 1973, which passed within 2.9&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; from the center of the planet.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; Its twin [[Pioneer 11]] visited Jupiter a year later, traveling along a highly inclined trajectory and approaching the planet as close as 1.6&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt;

Pioneer 10 provided the best coverage available of the inner magnetic field&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; as it passed through the inner radiation belts within 20&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;, receiving an integrated dose of 200,000 [[Rad (unit)|rads]] from [[electrons]] and 56,000 rads from [[protons]] (for a human, a whole body dose of 500 rads would be fatal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Garry |last= Hunt et al |year= 1981 |title= Jupiter|edition= 1st |publisher= Rand McNally |location= London |isbn= 0-528-81542-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of radiation at Jupiter was ten times more powerful than ''Pioneer'''s designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probe would not survive; however, with a few minor glitches, it managed to pass through the radiation belts, saved in large part by the fact that Jupiter's magnetosphere had "wobbled" slightly upward at that point, moving away from the spacecraft. However, Pioneer 11 did lose most images of Io, as the radiation had caused its imaging photo [[polarimeter]] to receive a number of spurious commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced ''[[Voyager program|Voyager]]'' spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the massive radiation levels.&lt;ref name=depths&gt;[[#Wolverton|Wolverton]], 2004, pp. 100–157&lt;/ref&gt;

Voyagers 1 and 2 arrived at Jupiter in 1979–1980 and traveled almost in its equatorial plane. [[Voyager 1]], which passed within 5&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; from the planet's center,&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; was first to encounter the Io plasma torus.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; It received a radiation dosage one thousand times the lethal level for humans, the damage resulting in serious degradation of some high-resolution images of Io and Ganymede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Andrew |last= Wilson |year= 1987 |title= Solar System Log |edition= 1st |publisher= Jane's Publishing Company Limited |location= London |isbn= 0-7106-0444-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voyager 2]] passed within 10&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1993-715/&gt; and discovered the current sheet in the equatorial plane. The next probe to approach Jupiter was [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] in 1992, which investigated the planet's polar magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

The [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo spacecraft]], which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, provided a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk sectors of the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's [[gyroscope]]s often exhibited increased errors. Several times [[electrical arc]]s occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter [[Safe mode (spacecraft)|safe mode]], which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable [[quartz oscillator]].&lt;ref name=Fieseler&gt;[[#Fieseler|Fieseler]], 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Cassini (spacecraft)|Cassini]] spacecraft flew by Jupiter in 2000, it conducted coordinated measurements with Galileo.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt; [[New Horizons]] passed close to Jupiter in 2007, carrying out a unique investigation of the Jovian magnetotail, traveling as far as 2500&amp;nbsp;''R''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt; along its length.&lt;ref name=Krupp2007-216&gt;[[#Krupp2007|Krupp]], 2007, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016 [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]] was inserted into Jupiter orbit, its scientific objectives include exploration of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juno.wisc.edu/science.html |title=Juno Science Objectives |accessdate=October 13, 2008 |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016083427/http://juno.wisc.edu/science.html |archivedate=October 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage of Jupiter's magnetosphere remains much poorer than for Earth's magnetic field. Further study is important to further understand the Jovian magnetosphere's dynamics.&lt;ref name=Khurana1/&gt;

In 2003, [[NASA]] conducted a conceptual study called "Human Outer Planets Exploration" (HOPE) regarding the future human exploration of the [[outer solar system]]. The possibility was mooted of building a surface base on Callisto, because of the low radiation levels at the moon's distance from Jupiter and its geological stability. Callisto is the only one of Jupiter's Galilean satellites for which human exploration is feasible. The levels of [[ionizing radiation]] on Io, Europa and Ganymede are inimical to human life, and adequate protective measures have yet to be devised.&lt;ref name=Trautman&gt;[[#Troutman|Troutman]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islam, a '''mahr''' (in {{lang-ar|[[Wiktionary:مهر|مهر]]}};  {{lang-fa|مهريه}}; {{lang-tr|Mehir}} also [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]] '''''mehr''''', '''''meher''''', '''''mehrieh''''' or '''''mahriyeh''''') is a mandatory payment, in the form of money or possessions paid by the groom, or by groom's father, to the bride at the time of [[marriage in Islam|marriage]], that legally becomes her property.&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Spies, O. | year= 2012 | title=Mahr |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_4806|subscription=yes|volume=Vol. 6|pages=78-79}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''mahr'' is often money, it can also be anything agreed upon by the bride such as jewelry, home goods, furniture, a dwelling or some land. Mahr is typically specified in the marriage contract signed during an Islamic marriage. 

"[[Dower]]" is the English translation that comes closest to Islamic meaning of mahr, as "dower" refers to the payment from the husband or his family to the wife, especially to support her in the event of his death.  However, mahr is distinct from dower in two ways: 1) mahr is legally required for all Islamic marriages while dower was optional, and 2) mahr is required to be specified at the time of marriage (when a certain amount is promised, if not paid immediately), while dower is not paid until the death of the husband.  Mahr also can be classified as a form of "bridewealth", described by anthropologists as payments made from the kin of the groom to the kin of the bride; however, mahr is paid directly to the bride and not her parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goody|first1= Jack |first2= Stanley |last2=Tambiah|year= 1973|title=Bridewealth and Dowry|publisher= Cambridge University Press|page= 1-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkU4AAAAIAAJ&amp;vq=mahr&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, as her legal property, mahr establishes the bride's financial independence from her parents and in many cases from her husband, who has no legal claims to his wife's mahr.

The terms "[[dowry]]" and "[[bride price]]" are sometimes incorrectly used to translate ''mahr'', but mahr differs from dowries in many other cultures. A dowry traditionally refers to money or possessions a woman brings forth to the marriage, usually provided by her parents or family; bride price to money or property paid by the groom or his family to the parents of a woman (but not to the woman herself) upon the marriage.

In the event the marriage contract does not contain an exact, specified mahr, the husband must still pay the wife an equitable sum.&lt;ref&gt;DAVID PEARL &amp; WERNER MENSKI, MUSLIM FAMILY LAW ¶ 7-10, at 178-81 (3d ed. 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of a mahr is mentioned several times in the Quran and Hadith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamswomen.com/marriage/fiqh_of_marriage_6.php|title=Islams Women - Fiqh of Marriage - Dowry|publisher=islamswomen.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mahr is often paid to the bride in parts.  The ''mahr'' amount given to the bride at the signing of the marriage contract is called a '''muajjal(معجل)'' (which is paid at time of marriage (nikah), and the portion that is promised but deferred is called a ''ghaire mu’ajjal(غیر معجل)'' (which is paid after completion of marriage).  A deferred promise to pay does not make the full amount of the mahr any less legally required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Islamic Institution of Mahr and American Law|first= Richard |last=Freeland|publisher= Gonzaga University|url= http://www.law.gonzaga.edu/academic-program/Files/GJIL/Volume4/Vol4-TheIslamicInstitution.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are differences between the nature of ''mahr'', definition of proper contract and conditions of enforceability depending on the regional ''[[Usul al-fiqh|fiqh]]'' and school of Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="Lindsey E. Blenkhorn 2002"&gt;Lindsey E. Blenkhorn, Note, Islamic Marriage Contracts in American Courts: Interpreting Mahr Agreements as Prenuptials and Their Effect on Muslim Women, 76 S. CAL. L. REV. 189, 210-11 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and history==
The word ''mahr'' is related to the Hebrew word "mohar" and the Syriac word "mahrā", meaning “bridal gift”, which originally meant “purchase-money”. The word implies a gift given voluntarily and not as a result of a contract, but in Muslim religious law it was declared a gift which the bridegroom has to give the bride when the contract of marriage is made and which becomes the property of the wife.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

Among pre-Islamic Arabs, a ''bride price'' called ''mahr'' was an essential condition for a legal marriage. The ''mahr'' was given to the guardian (''wali'') of the bride, such as her father, brother or another relative. In earlier times, the bride received no portion of the ''mahr''.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; Some scholars believe that in the period shortly before Muhammad, the ''mahr'', or at least a part of it, was already given to the bride,&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt; while others regard its transformation into wife's property as a "revolutionary" Quranic innovation.&lt;ref name=EoQ-281&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=281|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of mahr==
A mahr is part of every Muslim marriage contract. The mahr may be separated into two parts. First, there is the ''muqaddam'', or the prompt mahr, which the wife must receive at or immediately after the marriage ceremony. The second part of the mahr, called the ''mu'akhar'', is a deferred and promised amount, payable at any agreed upon date following the consummation of the marriage. Often the deferred amount is larger than the amount paid at marriage. In theory, the deferred amount is supposed to provide the wife with a means of support, and is associated with the death or divorce of the husband, however this is a more traditional rather than Islamic stance on the matter. The ''muqaddam'' should be viewed as importantly as the initial dowry payment as it is an obligation to be fulfilled by the husband and is considered debt if it is not given to the wife within the timeframe agreed upon between the couple.&lt;ref&gt;Tracie Rogalin Siddiqui, Interpretation of Islamic Marriage Contracts by American Courts, 41 FAM. L.Q. 639, 639 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The mahr in any Islamic marriage contract is a fundamental religious right of the wife, and the husband may not reduce the mahr. Even upon the husband's death, the deferred mahr is paid from his estate before all other debts, because it is a religious requirement.

According to a hadith, the Muslim Prophet [[Muhammad]] stated the mahr should be "one gold piece",&lt;ref name=WahhabiIslam&gt;{{cite book

The typical mahr containing marriage contract consists of the names of the parties, the amount of the mahr, a cleric's signature, the signature of two male witnesses, and a disclaimer that Islamic law will govern the marriage contract.&lt;ref name="Lindsey E. Blenkhorn 2002"/&gt;  In Islamic marriages, assets brought into the union by the wife may only be accepted by the husband after the mahr has been paid by him to her.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In Arabian world, there are varying interpretations of ''mahr'' containing marriage contracts, highlighting the differences between Maliki, Hanbali, Hanafi, Shafi, and Jafari [[Madhhab|schools of Islamic jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="Lindsey E. Blenkhorn 2002"/&gt; For example, the Hanafi School holds that if the woman initiates the divorce (khulʿ) she cannot receive her mahr regardless of whether the husband is or is not at fault, while the Maliki School holds that when the husband is at fault for the divorce, the wife does not forfeit her right to the mahr even if she initiates the divorce. The schools also differ over the requisite number of witnesses to the contract. The Hanafi School requires two witnesses on the document for a mahr containing contract to be valid, while the Maliki School holds that witnesses are only needed at marriage's publication but not the document.&lt;ref&gt;Mona Rafeeq, Rethinking Islamic Law Arbitration Tribunals: Are They Compatible with Traditional American Notions of Justice?, 28 WIS. INT‟L Law Journal, 108, 138-39 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences and issues==

Mahr is similar in legal enforceability to ''[[donatio propter nuptias]]'' of [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Eastern Roman law]], except some critical differences.&lt;ref&gt;The Personal Law of the Mahommedans: According to All the Schools, Syed Ameer Ali, WH Allen &amp; Company, London, pp. 299-300&lt;/ref&gt; ''Donatio propter nuptias'' was optional and voluntary, while mahr is mandatory and required for all Muslim marriages. Mahr is not an optional gift.&lt;ref&gt;Kecia Ali, "Marriage in Classical Islamic Jurisprudence: A Survey of Doctrines", in ''The Islamic Marriage Contract: Case Studies in Islamic Family Law'' 11, 19 (Asifa Quraishi &amp; Frank E. Vogel eds., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legaldictionary.lawin.org/donatio-propter-nuptias/|title=Donatio Propter Nuptias|publisher=legaldictionary.lawin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other difference was that ''donatio propter nuptias'' was a security the groom delivered to bride or registered in her name, at the time of marriage, in exchange for ''dos'' (dowry) that came with the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Georg |last=Long |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Donatio_propter_Nuptias.html |title=Donatio propter Nuptias in William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, John Murray, London, 1875}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ortolan, Explication Historique des Instituts, vol. I, page 478-480&lt;/ref&gt; Mahr is a religious requirement according to [[Sharia]].

Under Islamic law, there is no concept of marital property.  In Islam, marriage is a contract between a man and his wives. A Muslim man and woman do not merge their legal identity upon marriage. The assets of the man before the marriage, and earned after the marriage, remain his during marriage, and in case of a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad v. Ahmad, No. L-00-1391, 2001 WL 1518116 (Ohio Ct. App. Nov. 30, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

A divorce under Islamic law does not require redistribution of property. Rather, each spouse walks away from the marriage with his or her individual property. Divorcing Muslim women who did not work outside their home after marriage, except for the deferred mahr, are left with little or no claim on the collective wealth of the couple. The deferred mahr is considered a debt owed by the man to the woman, and is owed even if he has no assets.&lt;ref&gt;Jamal Nasir, ''The Status of Women Under Islamic Law and Modern Islamic Legislation'', 3d edition, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sameena Nazir and Leigh Tomppert, Ed., Women’s Rights in the Middle East and North Africa, Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Divorce under Islamic law may take many forms. If a woman wishes to divorce her husband she has two options: seek a ''tafriq'', or seek a ''[[khul'|khulʿ]]''. A ''tafriq'' is a divorce for certain allowable reasons, such as abuse or abandonment. This divorce is granted by a ''[[qadi]]'', a religious judge. If a tafriq is granted, the marriage is dissolved and the husband is obligated to pay the wife the deferred mahr specified in their marriage contract. The second method, ''khulʿ'' is a divorce without cause, by mutual consent. This divorce requires a husband's consent and it must be supported by consideration that passes from the wife to the husband. Often, this consideration consists of the wife relinquishing her claim to the deferred mahr. In contrast to allowable methods of divorce to a woman, a husband may unilaterally divorce his wife, as ''[[talaq]]'', with no requirement to show cause, nor any intervention by a ''qadi''. However, upon talaq, the husband must pay the wife her deferred mahr.&lt;ref&gt;Wael B. Hallaq, Sharia: Theory, Practice, Transformations, p. 271 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Western courts have treated mahr provisions in a manner similar to pre-marital contracts. However, in many cases the courts have considered the validity of the marriage contract in cases such as where proper disclosures were not made at the time of marriage, the bride and groom did not separately consent without duress, and in case the bride or both spouses entered into a [[child marriage]] prior to a legal age of consent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/1126 Bargaining in the Shadow of God's Law: Islamic Mahr Contracts and the Perils of Legal Specialization], Nathan B. Oman, William &amp; Mary Law School (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeland, Richard (2000), Islamic Institution of Mahr and American Law, The. Gonz. Journal Int'l Law, 4, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in Islamic texts==
The [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'s entry on ''mahr'' states: "According to a tradition in [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]], the mahr is an essential condition for the legality of the marriage: 'Every marriage without mahr is null and void'."&lt;ref name="Houtsma1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

According to Islamic teachings in the [[hadith]] (sayings of Muhammad), ''mahr'' is the amount to be paid by the groom to the bride at the time of marriage, some of which may be delayed according to what is agreed upon by the spouses. The mahr is for her to spend as she wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph |last=Schacht|authorlink=Joseph Schacht|title= An Introduction to Islamic Law|edition= 2|location= New York|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1982| page= 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be cash, jewellery or any other valuable gift. In some cases, per [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] (Volume 7, Book 62, Number 72), even an iron ring can be mahr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/062-sbt.php Shahih Bukhari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013231550/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/062-sbt.php |date=2012-10-13 }} University of Southern California, Hadith 7.62.72&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mass wasting''', also known as '''slope movement''' or '''mass movement''', is the [[geomorphology|geomorphic]] process by which [[soil]], [[sand]], [[regolith]], and [[rock (geology)|rock]] move downslope typically as a solid, continuous or discontinuous mass, largely under the force of [[gravity]], but frequently with characteristics of a flow as in [[debris flow]]s and [[mudflow]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/368257/mass-movement Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; Types of mass wasting include [[Downhill creep|creep]], slides, flows, topples, and falls, each with its own characteristic features, and taking place over timescales from seconds to hundreds of years. Mass wasting occurs on both terrestrial and submarine slopes, and has been observed on [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]], and Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]].

When the gravitational force acting on a slope exceeds its resisting force, slope failure (mass wasting) occurs. The slope material's strength and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] and the amount of [[internal friction]] between material help maintain the slope's stability and are known collectively as the slope's [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]]. The steepest angle that a cohesionless slope can maintain without losing its stability is known as its [[angle of repose]]. When a slope made of loose material possesses this angle, its shear strength perfectly counterbalances the force of gravity acting upon it.

Mass wasting may occur at a very slow rate, particularly in areas that are very dry or those areas that receive sufficient rainfall such that vegetation has stabilized the surface. It may also occur at very high speed, such as in [[rockslide]]s or [[landslides]], with disastrous consequences, both immediate and delayed, e.g., resulting from the formation of [[landslide dam]]s.

Factors that change the potential of mass wasting include: change in slope angle, weakening of material by [[weathering]], increased water content; changes in [[vegetation]] cover, and overloading.

Volcano flanks can become over-steep resulting in instability and mass wasting. This is now a recognised part of the growth of all active volcanoes. It is seen on submarine as well as surface volcanoes: [[Loihi]] in the Hawaiian volcanic chain and [[Kick 'em Jenny]] in the Caribbean volcanic arc are two submarine volcanoes that are known to undergo mass wasting. The failure of the northern flank of [[Mount St Helens]] in 1980 showed how rapidly volcanic flanks can deform and fail.

==The importance of water in mass wasting==
Water can increase or decrease the stability of a slope depending on the amount present.  Small amounts of water can strengthen soils because the surface tension of water increases soil cohesion.  This allows the soil to resist erosion better than if it were dry.  If too much water is present the water may act to increase the pore pressure, reducing friction, and accelerating the erosion process and resulting in different types of mass wasting (i.e. mudflows, landslides, etc.).  A good example of this is to think of a [[sand castle]].  Water must be mixed with sand in order for the castle to keep its shape.  If too much water is added the sand washes away, if not enough water is added the sand falls and cannot keep its shape. Water also increases the mass of the soil, this is important because an increase in mass means that there will be an increase in velocity if mass wasting is triggered.
Saturated water, however, eases the process of mass wasting in that the rock and soil debris are easily washed down-slope.

==Types of mass wasting==
Based on how the soil, regolith or rock moves downslope as a whole, mass movements can be broadly classified as creeps and landslides.

===Creeps===
[[Soil creep]] is a slow and long term mass movement. The combination of small movements of soil or rock in different directions over time are directed by gravity gradually downslope. The steeper the slope, the faster the creep. The creep makes trees and shrubs curve to maintain their perpendicularity, and they can trigger landslides if they lose their root footing. The surface soil can migrate under the influence of cycles of freezing and thawing, or hot and cold temperatures, inching its way towards the bottom of the slope forming [[terracettes]].  

===Landslides===
A [[landslide]], also called a landslip, is a slow or rapid movement of a large mass of earth and rocks down a hill or a mountainside. Little or no flowage of the materials occurs on a given slope until heavy rain and resultant lubrication by the same rainwater facilitate the movement of the materials, causing a landslide to occur. 

In particular, if the main feature of the movement is a slide along a planar or curved surface, the landslide is termed slump, earth slide, debris slide or rock slide, depending on the prevailing material.

Movement of soil and regolith that more resembles fluid behavior is called a flow. These include [[avalanche]]s, [[mudflow]]s, [[debris flow]]s, [[earth flow]], [[lahars]] and [[sturzstrom]]s. Water, air and ice are often involved in enabling fluid-like motion of the material.

A fall, including [[rockfall]] and debris fall, occurs where regolith cascades down a slope, but is not of sufficient volume or viscosity to behave as a flow. Falls are promoted in rocks which are characterized by the presence of vertical cracks. Falls can also result from undercutting by running water as well as by waves. They usually occur at very steep slopes such as a cliff face. The rock material may be loosened by earthquakes, rain, plant-root wedging, and expanding ice, among other things. The accumulation of rock material that has fallen and resides at the base of the structure is known as [[Scree|talus]].

==Triggers of mass wasting==
Soil and regolith remain on a hillslope only while the gravitational forces are unable to overcome the frictional forces keeping the material in place (see [[slope stability]]). Some factors that reduce the frictional resistance relative to the downslope forces, and thus can trigger slope movement, can include:
* [[earthquake]]s
* increased overburden from structures
* increased soil moisture
* reduction of roots holding the soil to bedrock
* undercutting of the slope by [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] or erosion
* weathering by [[frost heave]] or chemical dissolution
* [[bioturbation]]

==Reducing the impacts of mass wasting==
* [[Afforestation]]
* Re-Afforestation
* [[Terrace (agriculture)|Terracing]] steps on slopes or, more generally, re-modeling its shape
* [[Slope stabilization]]

'''Maynard operation sequence technique (MOST)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acronymfinder.com/Maynard-Operation-Sequence-Technique-(MOST).html&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[predetermined motion time system]] that is used primarily in industrial settings to set the [[standard time (manufacturing)|standard time]] in which a worker should perform a task.  To calculate this, a task is broken down into individual motion elements, and each is assigned a numerical time value in units known as time measurement units, or TMUs, where 100,000 TMUs is equivalent to one hour.  All the motion element times are then added together and any [[allowance (engineering)|allowance]]s are added, and the result is the standard time.  It is more common in Asia whereas the original and more sophisticated [[Methods-Time Measurement|Methods Time Measurement]] technique, better known as MTM, is a global standard.

The most commonly used form of MOST is BasicMOST, which was released in Sweden in 1972 and in the United States in 1974.  Two other variations were released in 1980, called MiniMOST and MaxiMOST.  The difference between the three is their level of focus—the motions recorded in BasicMOST are on the level of tens of TMUs, while MiniMOST uses individual TMUs and MaxiMOST uses hundreds of TMUs.  This allows for a variety of applications—MiniMOST is commonly used for short (less than about a minute), repetitive cycles, and MaxiMOST for longer (more than several minutes), non-repetitive operations.  BasicMost is in the position between them, and can be used accurately for operations ranging from less than a minute to about ten minutes.

Another variation of MOST is known as AdminMOST.  Originally developed and released under the name ClericalMOST in the 1970s, it was recently updated to include modern administrative tasks and renamed.  It is on the same level of focus as BasicMOST.

Up until 16bit programs stopped working with Windows, it was possible to use AutoMOST. AutoMOST was a knowledge based system employing decision trees. Developers created logic trees. These trees could then be used by non IE trained operators to generate Standard Times. The user answered a series of logic questions to route the logic and made inputs (number of parts fitted etc). As they made their way through the tree, based on their route and inputs, AutoMOST would be gathering sub operation data to collate into the final time for the activity being measured. AutoMOST was able to pull in sub operation data from any of the base versions of MOST (Mini, Maxi or Basic)

In particular, these models correlate the [[genome]] with molecular [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=Franke_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franke|author2=Siezen, Teusink|title=Reconstructing the metabolic network of a bacterium from its genome.|journal=Trends in Microbiology|year=2005|volume=13|issue=11|pages=550–558|pmid=16169729|doi=10.1016/j.tim.2005.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction breaks down [[metabolic]] pathways (such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]]) into their respective reactions and enzymes, and analyzes them within the perspective of the entire network. In simplified terms, a reconstruction collects all of the relevant metabolic information of an organism and compiles it in a mathematical model.  Validation and analysis of reconstructions can allow identification of key features of metabolism such as growth yield, resource distribution, network robustness, and gene essentiality. This knowledge can then be applied to create novel [[biotechnology]].

In general, the process to build a reconstruction is as follows:
# Draft a reconstruction
# Refine the model
# Convert model into a mathematical/computational representation
# Evaluate and debug model through experimentation

==Genome-scale metabolic reconstruction==
A metabolic reconstruction provides a highly mathematical, structured platform on which to understand the systems biology of metabolic pathways within an organism.&lt;ref name=Thiele_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thiele|first=Ines|author2=Bernhard Ø Palsson|title=A protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction|journal=Nature Protocols|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–121|doi=10.1038/nprot.2009.203|pmid=20057383|pmc=3125167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integration of biochemical metabolic pathways with rapidly available, annotated genome sequences has developed what are called genome-scale metabolic models. Simply put, these models correspond metabolic genes with metabolic pathways. In general, the more information about physiology, biochemistry and genetics is available for the target organism, the better the predictive capacity of the reconstructed models. Mechanically speaking, the process of reconstructing prokaryotic and eukaryotic [[metabolic network]]s is essentially the same. Having said this, eukaryote reconstructions are typically more challenging because of the size of genomes, coverage of knowledge, and the multitude of cellular compartments.&lt;ref name="Thiele_2010"/&gt; The first genome-scale metabolic model was generated in 1995 for ''Haemophilus influenzae''.&lt;ref name=Venter_Influenzae&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd|journal=Science|year=1995|volume=269|issue=1995|pages=496–512|pmid=7542800|doi=10.1126/science.7542800|author1=Fleischmann|first1=R.

==Drafting a reconstruction==

===Resources===
Because the timescale for the development of reconstructions is so recent, most reconstructions have been built manually. However, now, there are quite a few resources that allow for the semi-automatic assembly of these reconstructions that are utilized due to the time and effort necessary for a reconstruction. An initial fast reconstruction can be developed automatically using resources like PathoLogic or ERGO in combination with encyclopedias like MetaCyc, and then manually updated by using resources like PathwayTools. These semi-automatic methods allow for a fast draft to be created while allowing the fine tune adjustments required once new experimental data is found. It is only in this manner that the field of metabolic reconstructions will keep up with the ever-increasing numbers of annotated genomes.

====Databases====
* '''Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ([http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG])''': a bioinformatics database containing information on genes, proteins, reactions, and pathways. The ‘KEGG Organisms’ section, which is divided into [[eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryotes]], encompasses many organisms for which gene and [[DNA]] information can be searched by typing in the enzyme of choice.
* '''BioCyc, EcoCyc, and MetaCyc''': [http://biocyc.org/ BioCyc] Is a collection of 3,000 pathway/genome databases (as of Oct 2013), with each database dedicated to one organism. For example, [http://ecocyc.org/ EcoCyc] is a highly detailed [[bioinformatics]] database on the genome and metabolic reconstruction of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', including thorough descriptions of ''E. coli'' signaling pathways and regulatory network. The EcoCyc database can serve as a paradigm and model for any reconstruction. Additionally, [http://biocyc.org/metacyc/index.shtml MetaCyc], an encyclopedia of experimentally defined metabolic pathways and enzymes, contains 2,100 metabolic pathways and 11,400 metabolic reactions (Oct 2013).
* '''[http://enzyme.expasy.org/ ENZYME]''': An enzyme [[Scientific classification|nomenclature]] database (part of the [[ExPASy]] proteonomics server of the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]]). After searching for a particular enzyme on the database, this resource gives you the reaction that is catalyzed. ENZYME has direct links to other gene/enzyme/literature databases such as KEGG, BRENDA, and PUBMED.
* '''[http://www.brenda-enzymes.info/ BRENDA]''': A comprehensive enzyme database that allows for an enzyme to be searched by name, EC number, or organism.
* '''[http://bigg.ucsd.edu/ BiGG]''': A knowledge base of biochemically, genetically, and genomically structured genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions.
* '''[http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/metatiger/ metaTIGER]''': Is a collection of metabolic profiles and phylogenomic information on a taxonomically diverse range of eukaryotes which provides novel facilities for viewing and comparing the metabolic profiles between organisms.

====Tools for literature====
* '''PUBMED''': This is an online library developed by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], which contains a massive collection of medical journals. Using the link provided by ENZYME, the search can be directed towards the organism of interest, thus recovering literature on the enzyme and its use inside of the organism.

===Methodology to draft a reconstruction===
[[File:Metabolic Network Reconstruction Process.pdf|thumb|This is a visual representation of the metabolic network reconstruction process.]]

A reconstruction is built by compiling data from the resources above.  Database tools such as KEGG and BioCyc can be used in conjunction with each other to find all the metabolic genes in the organism of interest.  These genes will be compared to closely related organisms that have already developed reconstructions to find homologous genes and reactions. These homologous genes and reactions are carried over from the known reconstructions to form the draft reconstruction of the organism of interest. Tools such as ERGO, Pathway Tools and Model SEED can compile data into pathways to form a network of metabolic and non-metabolic pathways. These networks are then verified and refined before being made into a mathematical simulation.&lt;ref name="Thiele_2010"/&gt;

The predictive aspect of a metabolic reconstruction hinges on the ability to predict the biochemical reaction catalyzed by a protein using that protein's amino acid sequence as an input, and to infer the structure of a metabolic network based on the predicted set of reactions. A network of enzymes and metabolites is drafted to relate sequences and function.  When an uncharacterized protein is found in the genome, its amino acid sequence is first compared to those of previously characterized proteins to search for homology.  When a homologous protein is found, the proteins are considered to have a common ancestor and their functions are inferred as being similar.  However, the quality of a reconstruction model is dependent on its ability to accurately infer phenotype directly from sequence, so this rough estimation of protein function will not be sufficient.  A number of algorithms and bioinformatics resources have been developed for refinement of sequence homology-based assignments of protein functions:
* '''[http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi InParanoid]''':  Identifies eukaryotic orthologs by looking only at [[in-paralog]]s.
* '''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd CDD]''':  Resource for the annotation of functional units in proteins. Its collection of domain models utilizes 3D structure to provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships.
* '''[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ InterPro]''':  Provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites.
* '''[http://string.embl.de/ STRING]''':  Database of known and predicted protein interactions.

Once proteins have been established, more information about the enzyme structure, reactions catalyzed, substrates and products, mechanisms, and more can be acquired from databases such as [http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG], [http://www.metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] and [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ NC-IUBMB].  Accurate metabolic reconstructions require additional information about the reversibility and preferred physiological direction of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction which can come from databases such as [http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ BRENDA] or [http://www.metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] database.&lt;ref name="Ivanova_2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivanova|first=N.|author2=A. Lykidis|title=Metabolic Reconstruction|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd Ed.|year=2009|pages=607–621|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00010-9|isbn=9780123739445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model refinement==
An initial metabolic reconstruction of a genome is typically far from perfect due to the high variability and diversity of microorganisms.  Often, metabolic pathway databases such as KEGG and MetaCyc will have "holes", meaning that there is a conversion from a substrate to a product (i.e., an enzymatic activity) for which there is no known protein in the genome that encodes the enzyme that facilitates the catalysis.  What can also happen in semi-automatically drafted reconstructions is that some pathways are falsely predicted and don't actually occur in the predicted manner.&lt;ref name="Ivanova_2009" /&gt;  Because of this, a systematic verification is made in order to make sure no inconsistencies are present and that all the entries listed are correct and accurate.&lt;ref name="Franke_2005" /&gt;  Furthermore, previous literature can be researched in order to support any information obtained from one of the many metabolic reaction and genome databases. This provides an added level of assurance for the reconstruction that the enzyme and the reaction it catalyzes do actually occur in the organism.

[[Enzyme promiscuity]] and spontaneous chemical reactions can damage metabolites. This [[Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|metabolite damage, and its repair or pre-emption]], create energy costs that need to be incorporated into models. It is likely that many genes of unknown function encode proteins that repair or pre-empt metabolite damage, but most genome-scale metabolic reconstructions only include a fraction of all genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Linster|first = Carole L.|last2 = Van Schaftingen|first2 = Emile|last3 = Hanson|first3 = Andrew D.|date = 2013-02-01|title = Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|journal = Nature Chemical Biology|volume = 9|issue = 2|pages = 72–80|doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1141|issn = 1552-4469|pmid = 23334546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hanson|first = Andrew D.|last2 = Henry|first2 = Christopher S.|last3 = Fiehn|first3 = Oliver|last4 = de Crécy-Lagard|first4 = Valérie|date = 2015-11-19|title = Metabolite Damage and Metabolite Damage Control in Plants|journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology|doi = 10.1146/annurev-arplant-043015-111648|issn = 1545-2123|pmid = 26667673|volume=67|pages=131–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any new reaction not present in the databases needs to be added to the reconstruction. This is an iterative process that cycles between the experimental phase and the coding phase. As new information is found about the target organism, the model will be adjusted to predict the metabolic and phenotypical output of the cell. The presence or absence of certain reactions of the metabolism will affect the amount of [[reactants]]/products that are present for other reactions within the particular pathway. This is because products in one reaction go on to become the reactants for another reaction, i.e. products of one reaction can combine with other proteins or compounds to form new proteins/compounds in the presence of different enzymes or [[catalysts]].&lt;ref name = "Franke_2005" /&gt;

Francke ''et al.'' &lt;ref name="Franke_2005"/&gt; provide an excellent example as to why the verification step of the project needs to be performed in significant detail. During a metabolic network reconstruction of ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'', the model showed that [[succinyl-CoA]] was one of the reactants for a reaction that was a part of the biosynthesis of [[methionine]]. However, an understanding of the physiology of the organism would have revealed that due to an incomplete tricarboxylic acid pathway, ''Lactobacillus plantarum'' does not actually produce succinyl-CoA, and the correct reactant for that part of the reaction was [[acetyl-CoA]].

Therefore, systematic verification of the initial reconstruction will bring to light several inconsistencies that can adversely affect the final interpretation of the reconstruction, which is to accurately comprehend the molecular mechanisms of the organism. Furthermore, the [[simulation]] step also ensures that all the reactions present in the reconstruction are properly balanced. To sum up, a reconstruction that is fully accurate can lead to greater insight about understanding the functioning of the organism of interest.&lt;ref name = "Franke_2005" /&gt;

==Metabolic network simulation==
A metabolic network can be broken down into a stoichiometric matrix where the rows represent the compounds of the reactions, while the columns of the matrix correspond to the reactions themselves. [[Stoichiometry]] is a quantitative relationship between [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] of a chemical reaction. In order to deduce what the metabolic network suggests, recent research has centered on a few approaches, such as extreme pathways, elementary mode analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papin | first1 = JA | last2 = Stelling | first2 = J | last3 = Price | first3 = ND | last4 = Klamt | first4 = S | last5 = Schuster | first5 = S | last6 = Palsson | first6 = BO | date = Aug 2004 | title = Comparison of network-based pathway analysis methods | url = | journal = Trends Biotechnol | volume = 22 | issue = 8| pages = 400–5 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.010 | pmid=15283984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[flux balance analysis]], and a number of other constraint-based modeling methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = N.E. | last2 = Nagarajan | first2 = H. | last3 = Palsson | year = 2012 | title =Constraining the metabolic genotype–phenotype relationship using a phylogeny of ''in silico'' methods | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2737 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 291–305 | pmid=22367118 | pmc=3536058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/ CoBRA Methods - Constraint-based analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme pathways===
Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name=Price_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Nathan|author2=Jennifer Reed |author3=Jason Papin |author4=Sharon Wiback |author5=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Network-based analysis of metabolic regulation in the human red blood cell|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=November 2003|volume=225|issue=2|pages=185–194|pmid=14575652|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00237-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Palsson lab, use a method of singular value decomposition (SVD) of extreme pathways in order to understand regulation of a human [[red blood cell]] metabolism. Extreme pathways are convex [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] that consist of [[steady state]] functions of a metabolic network.&lt;ref name=Papin_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papin|first=Jason|author2=Nathan Price |author3=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Extreme Pathway Lengths and Reaction Participation in Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks|journal=Genome Research|date=December 2002|volume=12|issue=12|pages=1889–1900|pmid=12466293|doi=10.1101/gr.327702|pmc=187577}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any particular metabolic network, there is always a unique set of extreme pathways available.&lt;ref name=Papin_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papin|first=Jason|author2=Nathan Price |author3=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Comparison of network-based pathway analysis methods|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=August 2004|volume=22|issue=8|pages=400–405|pmid=15283984|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; define a [[constraint-based approach]], where through the help of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] like [[mass balance]] and maximum [[reaction rates]], it is possible to develop a ‘solution space’ where all the feasible options fall within. Then, using a kinetic model approach, a single solution that falls within the extreme pathway solution space can be determined.&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; Therefore, in their study, Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; use both constraint and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] approaches to understand the human red blood cell metabolism. In conclusion, using extreme pathways, the regulatory mechanisms of a metabolic network can be studied in further detail.

===Elementary mode analysis===
Elementary mode analysis closely matches the approach used by extreme pathways. Similar to extreme pathways, there is always a unique set of elementary modes available for a particular metabolic network.&lt;ref name = "Papin_2004" /&gt; These are the smallest sub-networks that allow a metabolic reconstruction network to function in steady state.&lt;ref name=Schuster_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=S|author2=Fell DA |author3=Dandekar T |title=A general definition of metabolic pathways useful for systematic organization and analysis of complex metabolic networks|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=March 2000|volume=18|issue=3|pages=326–332|pmid=10700151|doi=10.1038/73786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stelling_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelling|first=J|author2=Klamt S |author3=Bettenbrock K |author4=Schuster S |author5=Gilles ED |title=Metabolic network structure determines key aspects of functionality and regulation.|journal=Nature|date=November 2002|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=190–193|pmid=12432396|doi=10.1038/nature01166|bibcode=2002Natur.420..190S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullah_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ullah|first=E|author2=Aeron S |author3=Hassoun S|title=gEFM: An Algorithm for Computing Elementary Flux Modes Using Graph Traversal.|journal=IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=122–34|date=2015|doi=10.1109/TCBB.2015.2430344|pmid=26886737}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stelling (2002),&lt;ref name = "Stelling_2002" /&gt; elementary modes can be used to understand cellular objectives for the overall metabolic network. Furthermore, elementary mode analysis takes into account [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrics]] and [[thermodynamics]] when evaluating whether a particular metabolic route or network is feasible and likely for a set of proteins/enzymes.&lt;ref name = "Schuster_2000" /&gt;

===Minimal metabolic behaviors (MMBs)===
In 2009, Larhlimi and Bockmayr presented a new approach called "minimal metabolic behaviors" for the analysis of metabolic networks.&lt;ref name=Larhlimi_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larhlimi|first=A|author2=Bockmayr, A.|title=A new constraint-based description of the steady-state flux cone of metabolic networks|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|year=2009|volume=157|issue=10|pages=2257–2266|doi=10.1016/j.dam.2008.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like elementary modes or extreme pathways, these are uniquely determined by the network, and yield a complete description of the flux cone. However, the new description is much more compact. In contrast with elementary modes and extreme pathways, which use an inner description based on generating vectors of the flux cone, MMBs are using an outer description of the flux cone. This approach is based on sets of non-negativity constraints. These can be identified with irreversible reactions, and thus have a direct biochemical interpretation. One can characterize a metabolic network by MMBs and the reversible metabolic space.

===Flux balance analysis===
{{main article|Flux balance analysis}}
A different technique to simulate the metabolic network is to perform [[flux balance analysis]]. This method uses [[linear programming]], but in contrast to elementary mode analysis and extreme pathways, only a single solution results in the end. Linear programming is usually used to obtain the maximum potential of the objective function that you are looking at, and therefore, when using flux balance analysis, a single solution is found to the optimization problem.&lt;ref name = "Stelling_2002" /&gt; In a flux balance analysis approach, exchange [[flux]]es are assigned to those metabolites that enter or leave the particular network only. Those metabolites that are consumed within the network are not assigned any exchange flux value. Also, the exchange fluxes along with the enzymes can have constraints ranging from a negative to positive value (ex: -10 to 10).

Furthermore, this particular approach can accurately define if the reaction stoichiometry is in line with predictions by providing fluxes for the balanced reactions. Also, flux balance analysis can highlight the most effective and efficient pathway through the network in order to achieve a particular objective function. In addition, [[gene knockout]] studies can be performed using flux balance analysis. The enzyme that correlates to the gene that needs to be removed is given a constraint value of 0. Then, the reaction that the particular enzyme catalyzes is completely removed from the analysis.

===Dynamic simulation and parameter estimation===
In order to perform a dynamic simulation with such a network it is necessary to construct an ordinary differential equation
system that describes the rates of change in each metabolite's concentration or amount. To this end, a rate law, i.e., a kinetic equation that determines the rate of reaction based on the concentrations of all reactants is required for each reaction. Software packages that include numerical integrators, such as [[COPASI]] or [http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsimulator SBMLsimulator], are then able to simulate the system dynamics given an initial condition. Often these rate laws contain kinetic parameters with uncertain values. In many cases it is desired to estimate these parameter values with respect to given time-series data of metabolite concentrations. The system is then supposed to reproduce the given data. For this purpose the distance between the given data set and the result of the simulation, i.e., the numerically or in few cases analytically obtained solution of the differential equation system is computed. The values of the parameters are then estimated to minimize this distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dräger|first=A|author2=Kronfeld M |author3=Ziller MJ |author4=Supper J |author5=Planatscher H |author6=Magnus JB |author7=Oldiges M |author8=Kohlbacher O |author9=Zell A  |title=Modeling metabolic networks in C. glutamicum: a comparison of rate laws in combination with various parameter optimization strategies|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=January 2009|volume=3|issue=5|pmid=19144170|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-3-5|pmc=2661887|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One step further, it may be desired to estimate the mathematical structure of the differential equation system because the real rate laws are not known for the reactions within the system under study. To this end, the program [http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer SBMLsqueezer] allows automatic creation of appropriate rate laws for all reactions with the network.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dräger|first1=Andreas|last2=Hassis|first2=Nadine|last3=Supper|first3=Jochen|last4=Schröder|first4=Adrian|last5=Zell|first5=Andreas|title=SBMLsqueezer: A CellDesigner plug-in to generate kinetic rate equations for biochemical networks|journal=BMC Systems Biology|volume=2|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-2-39|pmid=18447902|pmc=2412839|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic accessibility===
Synthetic accessibility is a simple approach to network simulation whose goal is to predict which metabolic gene knockouts are lethal. The synthetic accessibility approach uses the topology of the metabolic network to calculate the sum of the minimum number of steps needed to traverse the metabolic network graph from the inputs, those metabolites available to the organism from the environment, to the outputs, metabolites needed by the organism to survive. To simulate a gene knockout, the reactions enabled by the gene are removed from the network and the synthetic accessibility metric is recalculated. An increase in the total number of steps is predicted to cause lethality. Wunderlich and Mirny showed this simple, parameter-free approach predicted knockout lethality in ''E. coli'' and ''S. cerevisiae'' as well as elementary mode analysis and flux balance analysis in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wunderlich|first=Z|author2=Leonid Mirny|title=Using the topology of metabolic networks to predict viability of mutant strains|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=September 2006|volume=91|issue=6|pages=2304–11|pmid= 16782788|doi=10.1529/biophysj.105.080572|pmc=1557581|bibcode=2006BpJ....91.2304W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of a reconstruction==
* Several inconsistencies exist between gene, enzyme, reaction databases, and published literature sources regarding the metabolic information of an organism. A reconstruction is a systematic verification and compilation of data from various sources that takes into account all of the discrepancies.
* The combination of relevant metabolic and genomic information of an organism.
* Metabolic comparisons can be performed between various organisms of the same species as well as between different organisms.
* Analysis of synthetic lethality&lt;ref name="Costanzo, et al. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costanzo|first=M|title=The Genetic Landscape of a Cell |journal=Science|year=2010|volume=327 |pages=425–431 |doi=10.1126/science.1180823| issue=5964|pmid=20093466|display-authors=etal |pmc=5600254|bibcode=2010Sci...327..425C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Predict adaptive evolution outcomes&lt;ref name=Fong_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fong|first=SS|author2=Marciniak JY |author3=Palsson BØ |title=Description and interpretation of adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 by using a genome-scale ''in silico'' metabolic model|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|date=November 2003|volume=185|issue=21|pages=6400–6408|pmid=14563875|doi=10.1128/JB.185.21.6400-6408.2003|pmc=219384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use in metabolic engineering for high value outputs

Reconstructions and their corresponding models allow the formulation of hypotheses about the presence of certain enzymatic activities and the production of metabolites that can be experimentally tested, complementing the primarily discovery-based approach of traditional microbial biochemistry with hypothesis-driven research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivanova|first=A|author2=A. Lykidis|title=Metabolic Reconstruction|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd Edition|year=2009|pages=607–621|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00010-9|isbn=9780123739445}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results these experiments can uncover novel pathways and metabolic activities and decipher between discrepancies in previous experimental data.  Information about the chemical reactions of metabolism and the genetic background of various metabolic properties (sequence to structure to function) can be utilized by genetic engineers to modify organisms to produce high value outputs whether those products be medically relevant like pharmaceuticals; high value chemical intermediates such as terpenoids and isoprenoids; or biotechnological outputs like biofuels.

Metabolic network reconstructions and models are used to understand how an organism or parasite functions inside of the host cell. For example, if the parasite serves to compromise the [[immune system]] by lysing [[macrophages]], then the goal of metabolic reconstruction/simulation would be to determine the metabolites that are essential to the organism's proliferation inside of macrophages. If the proliferation cycle is inhibited, then the parasite would not continue to evade the host's immune system. A reconstruction model serves as a first step to deciphering the complicated mechanisms surrounding disease. These models can also look at the minimal genes necessary for a cell to maintain virulence. The next step would be to use the predictions and postulates generated from a reconstruction model and apply it to discover novel biological functions such as [[drug-engineering]] and [[drug delivery]] techniques.

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita Art Museum) 3.jpg|thumb|x150px|First painting of the Fujita scroll showing two courtiers on the balcony of a building and men lighting torches in the garden outside the house.]]
The {{nihongo|'''''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'''''|紫式部日記絵巻|Murasaki Shikibu nikki emaki}} is a mid-13th century [[emaki]], a Japanese picture scroll, inspired by the [[The Diary of Lady Murasaki|private diary]] (''[[Nikki Bungaku|nikki]]'') of [[Murasaki Shikibu]], [[lady-in-waiting]] at the 10th/11th centuries Heian court and author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. This emaki belongs to the classical style of [[Japanese painting]] known as ''[[yamato-e]]'' and revives the iconography of the [[Heian period]].

Today there remain four paper scrolls of the emaki in varying condition and stored in different collections: Hachisuka, Matsudaira, Hinohara scrolls ([[Tokyo]]), and Fujita scroll ([[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Osaka]]).&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131"&gt;{{harvnb|Okudaira|1973|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the extant scrolls, the first relates the celebrations on occasion of the birth of prince Atsunari (Atsuhira, later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]]) in 1008 and the last those of the birth of Prince Atsunaga (later [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]]) in 1009. This difference in time indicates that the original emaki most likely consisted of more scrolls than exist today.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"&gt;{{citation

== Description ==
{{nihongo|''[[The Diary of Lady Murasaki]]''|紫式部日記|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki}} records the daily life of the [[Heian era]] lady-in-waiting and writer, [[Murasaki Shikibu|Lady Murasaki Shikibu]], author of ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Most likely written between 1008 and 1010, the largest portion consists of descriptive passages of the birth of [[Empress Shōshi]]'s (Akiko) children (future Emperors [[Emperor Go-Ichijō|Go-Ichijō]] and [[Emperor Go-Suzaku|Go-Suzaku]]) and related festivities, with smaller [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] describing life at the Imperial court and relations between other ladies-in-waiting and court writers such as [[Izumi Shikibu]], [[Akazome Emon]] and [[Sei Shōnagon]].&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt; It also gives a lively account of the regency of the powerful [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]].&lt;ref name="Hempel-p203"/&gt; Like the romantic novel Genji Monogatari, the diary deals with emotions and human relationships, particularly with Murasaki Shikibu's constraints at the court of Akiko, loneliness and futility after her husband's death (in 1001).&lt;ref name="mason-p30"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author is critical of her contemporaries, the men for their discourteous ways (including Fujiwara no Michinaga) and the women for their inexperience and lack of education and will.&lt;ref name="Keene99.42"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Donald |last1=Keene  |title=Travelers of a Hundred Ages: The Japanese as revealed through 1000 years of diaries |publisher =[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1999 |pages=42–46 |isbn=978-0-231-11437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diary is considered a masterpiece of [[Nikki Bungaku]].&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;

Emaki, which are long paper scrolls telling a story through texts and paintings, came to Japan through exchange with the Chinese Empire around the 6th century and spread widely among the Heian aristocracy.  The subsequent [[Kamakura period]] was marked by internal strife and civil wars that fostered the rise of the warrior class. If the warriors of the ''[[bakufu]]'' preferred "quick-moving narrative scrolls" such as war tales or legends, the production of emaki at the Heian court subsisted. Pictures illustrating ''The Tale of Genji'' continued to be popular into the early Kamakura period and revived interest in the author, Murasaki Shikibu. Towards the end of the 13th century, a renewed interest in the refined culture of the Heian period led some artists to return to painting styles of the Imperial Court; many emaki were produced during this period.&lt;ref name="mason-p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'' belongs to this golden age of the emaki and according to Penelope Mason "may be regarded as one of the finest extant examples of prose-poetry narrative illustration from the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] period".&lt;ref name="mason-p29"/&gt; It was created about 200 years after the diary was written, in the mid-13th century.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Suzuki Keizō, a scholar of the history of costume dated it to around 1250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murase96.163"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Miyeko |last1=Murase|title=L’art du Japon|language=French|trans-title=Japanese Art|publisher=Éditions LGF - Livre de Poche|series=La Pochothèque| year=1996 |pages=163–164 |isbn=2-253-13054-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.193"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|2001|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clasica.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=144&amp;PHPSESSID=a002ac85757493eaae8791c0849f1324 |script-title=ja:紫式部日記繪詞 |trans-title=Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki |publisher=Clasica |language=Japanese |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425122936/http://clasica.jp/products/detail.php?product_id=144&amp;PHPSESSID=a002ac85757493eaae8791c0849f1324 |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It transcribes the solitude and the observations of palace life from the diary but adds to the text a certain nostalgia for the glorious past of the Heian court which is typical for the 13th century, giving an overall feeling of "lost golden age", according to Mason, even during happy events such as parties.&lt;ref name="mason-p183" /&gt; The explanatory notes (or captions), i.e. the non-painting part, show little textual deviations from  the diary.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;

An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is mentioned in the ''[[Meigetsuki]]'' ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar [[Fujiwara no Teika]]. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to [[Cloistered rule|cloistered]] [[Emperor Go-Horikawa]] planned to create a new emaki of ''The Tale of Genji'' (after the 12th century [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]], the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter [[Fujiwara Nobuzane]] and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frederic05.207"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Louis |last1=Frédéric |title=Japan encyclopedia |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2005 |page=207 |isbn=0-674-01753-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC |accessdate=2011-11-11  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style and composition ==
Two elements  are found in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period,  such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems or talking to each other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason,  Mason calls the people in the emaki "house bound".&lt;ref name="mason-p22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left;  or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after-effects to the left.&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt; Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the ''onna-e'' genre of ''[[yamato-e]]'' and is in this respect similar to the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki|Tale of Genji Scrolls]] (1120–1140) but differs from them in many other aspects.&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murase96.163" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.53"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical for ''onna-e'', the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added.&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194" /&gt; Illustrations are relatively short&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In the case of the Genji Monogatari Emaki, {{convert|43|cm|abbr=on}} on average.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to emaki of war or folktales,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Where a single scene could be more than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} long&lt;/ref&gt; which according to Mason, "heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs".&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt;

The painting technique of ''tsukuri-e'' ("built painting"), used mainly in emaki of the court in the twelfth century, is also used here.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt; It is done in three stages: a first sketch of the scene is made with [[India ink|Indian ink]] (probably by a master of the workshop), then the color is applied on the entire surface of the paper in a specific order, from large areas in the background to fine details. Finally, the contours are enhanced or revived in ink to emphasize the depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/t/tsukurie.htm |title=Tsukuri-e |publisher=[[JAANUS]] (Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System) |accessdate =2011-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a visible change in style may again be noted, because the pigments are here less opaque than usual, and the more subtle shades are highlighted by fine outlines in ink; and in addition, the decorative aspect emerges strongly through extensive use of gold dust, and sometimes of silver.&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.131" /&gt; According to Mason, the technique seems to be less careful than in the past, as can be seen in elements of the architectural interior (sliding doors, screens ...) which lack detail or in the silver powder which is used much less often in general compared to gold.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;

The cultural changes after the Heian period resulted in a more realistic depiction of figures including movements and gestures.&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;
Abandoning the Heian period ''[[hikime kagibana]]'' style ("slit eyes, hooked nose"),&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;technique of representing the faces with four lines on a white background, similar to [[Noh]] masks to mark the extreme reclusiveness of the aristocrats&lt;/ref&gt; figures were painted individual features and facial expressions that  conveyed emotions and moods.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194" /&gt; More generally, M. Murase notes that the expression of feelings subtly changed compared to the scrolls of the 12th century; here the rooms (or the inner space, because it depends on the fusuma) in the palace are larger and less intimate or private, and nobles come and go naturally and determined.&lt;ref name="Murase96.163" /&gt; Unlike earlier scrolls such as the Genji Emaki, in which architecture and landscape were used as metaphors for people's emotions, interpersonal or societal pressures, in these scrolls the people's feelings are painted directly on the faces or shown through gestures, in addition to being expressed by the placement of characters within the scene. Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods. Landscapes stand on their own as they are detached from the characters' emotions and gain a new function as a place to escape from the constraints of court life.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most emaki, the composition is based on the ''fukinuki yatai'' ("blown-off roof") technique, which consists of a [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of looking down from above into the inner spaces resulting in a plunging view. Furthermore, diagonals are used to mark depth.  Compared to earlier scrolls, in these scrolls, the interior spaces are depicted from a more normal perspective such as through rolled up bamboo blinds (''misu''&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt;) or spaces in the walls where sliding panels (''[[fusuma]]'') had been removed.&lt;ref name="mason-p23"/&gt; The pace that is intentionally slow in ''tsukuri-e'', here seems slightly faster with illustrations depicting a single occurrence in time and temporally related events positioned close to each other in the emaki.&lt;ref name="mason-p30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.64"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |id=Okudaira73 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new decorative approach to paintings of the court (''onna-e'') inspired by the themes of literature is evident in several other works of the Kamakura period, such as [[uta monogatari (literature)|uta monogatari]] (e.g. ''[[The Tales of Ise]] Emaki''), [[tsukuri monogatari]] (e.g. ''[[Sumiyoshi Monogatari]] Emaki'') and romances (e.g. {{nihongo|Lord Takafusa's Love Songs|隆房卿艶詞絵巻|Takafusa Kyō tsuya kotoba emaki}}).&lt;ref name="mason-p29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shimizu01.194"&gt;{{harvnb|Shimizu|2001|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Okudaira73.33"&gt;{{harvnb | Okudaira | 1973 |id=Okudaira73 |p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
The illustrations provide insight into life and festivities at the [[Heian Palace]]; which sometimes consisted of something as simple as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]] or the [[Pillow Book Emaki]] (''Makura no Sōshi Emaki'') they provide valuable information on the architectural [[shinden-zukuri]] style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and traditional Japanese influences.&lt;ref name="mason-p107"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Extant scrolls==
It is thought that the emaki originally consisted of 10–12 scrolls.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt; The ancestral heritage of the emaki before the [[Edo period]] is not known and an investigation conducted during the [[Meiji period]], found that only four scrolls had survived, each {{convert|21.0|cm|abbr=on}} high and about {{convert|4.5|-|5.4|m|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; The owners and state of preservation of all four scrolls has since changed.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; The extant parts correspond to about 15 percent of the original diary and are not in sequence.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt; They consist of 24 scenes of varying widths distributed among three scrolls, six single sheets and two hanging scrolls in six different locations: [[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Gotoh Museum]], [[Tokyo National Museum]] and three private collections.&lt;ref name="Hempel-p203"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hempel|first=Rose|title=The golden age of Japan, 794-1192|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FT7rAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2011-10-29|year=1983|publisher=Rizzoli|isbn=978-0-8478-0492-4|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scroll begins with a text section and generally alternates scene descriptions with illustrations, ending with a painting. In two instances a long text section is split in two parts&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;3rd text of Hachisuka and 4th text of Hinohara scroll.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hachisuka scroll has an accumulation of three illustrations&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Paintings 3, 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt; unseparated by text, and an accumulation of two unseparated independent text sections.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Texts 6 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hachisuka scroll===
Chronologically the oldest scenes of the emaki, combined with some of the later anecdotes in the diary, are contained in the Hachisuka scroll. Named after its former owner, the [[Hachisuka clan]], rulers of the [[Tokushima Domain]] in [[Awa Province (Tokushima)|Awa Province]], this scroll is privately owned. It consists of eight illustrations and seven text sections on 16 paper sheets.&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The long third text section is split in two parts and followed by three illustrations. The seventh text section immediately follows the sixth without a painting between the two. The full scroll is {{convert|537.5|cm|abbr=on}} long and has been designated as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]]. Scenes 1–5 correspond to a continuous part of the diary and are the oldest diary entries represented by any of the four extant emaki scrolls. Scenes 6 and 7 correspond to later diary entries and appear in the diary after several of the scenes described in the other three extant scrolls.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Third day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - painting 1).gif|thumb|left|Nobles offering congratulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitool.amherst.edu:8881/R/C1EGFH2VE36NBIQHS6V2A3RBCI8D6YIEA9C94UAY6L495D3ND3-00196?func=results-jump-full&amp;set_entry=000008&amp;set_number=000665&amp;base=3036 |title=Diary of Murasaki Shikibu   Section 1 (Right)   Nobles Offer Congratulations |work=Amherst College Library, Digital Collections |publisher=[[Amherst College]] |accessdate=2011-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Hachisuka scroll starts with a description of a banquet given by the queen's [[majordomo]] and managed by the governor of [[Ōmi Province]] on [[Kankō]] 5, 9th month, 13th day (October 14, 1008), the third night of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]]. On that occasion, the mother, [[Empress Shōshi]] received presents such as baby clothes and furniture. The illustration associated with this scene shows court nobles on the balconies outside of the principal building in which the queen is located.&lt;ref name="diary-p85-86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=85–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emak HachisukaS.jpg|thumb|right|Fourth painting (right), fifth painting (middle) and fourth text section (left)]]
The second to fifth scenes of the Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime minister and baby's grandfather, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]], celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls ([[mochi]]) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the scene as bright as in daylight. There is one illustration following this scene.&lt;ref name="diary-p86-87"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third text is split in two parts, followed by three illustrations. The text contains a detailed description of how the dinner was served to the queen including the names of the maids of honour and their father's names. The ladies who had not been selected to attend "wept bitterly". Other people involved in the ceremony included uneme,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;beautiful women selected for their beauty&lt;/ref&gt; mohitori,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;officials in charge of wells, soy sauce and ice-houses&lt;/ref&gt; migusiage,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;attendants whose hair was done up with hairpins&lt;/ref&gt; tonomori,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;King's housekeepers&lt;/ref&gt; kanmori no nyokwan&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;cleaners&lt;/ref&gt; and door keepers. According to Murasaki Shikibu so many people were involved that it was hard to get through.&lt;ref name="diary-p87-88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - scene 4).jpg|thumb|left|Court lady exits beneath blinds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitool.amherst.edu:8881/R/C1EGFH2VE36NBIQHS6V2A3RBCI8D6YIEA9C94UAY6L495D3ND3-00608?func=results-jump-full&amp;set_entry=000004&amp;set_number=000667&amp;base=3036 |title=Diary of Murasaki Shikibu   Section 4 (Right)   Court ladies exiting through blinds |work=Amherst College Library, Digital Collections |publisher=[[Amherst College]] |accessdate=2011-11-27 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The relatively short fourth scene describes that the maids of honour exit from the queen's room which had been partitioned off by ''misu''&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"&gt;a thinly woven bamboo curtain hung before great people and women's apartments&lt;/ref&gt; entering the torch-lit garden. It also gives more details and an interpretation of the dress of one of those maids, Lady Oshikibu.&lt;ref name="diary-p88"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - priest).jpg|thumb|right|The seventh painting, located between the 5th (right) and 6th (left) text sections]]
The short fifth passage is a continuation of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: ''You cannot see such a lovely thing every day'', to which he replies: ''Indeed! indeed!'' clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.&lt;ref name="diary-p88"/&gt;

====Our lady of the chronicle====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hachisuka - Bai Juyi).jpg|thumb|left|Murasaki Shikibu (right) reading to Empress Shōshi (left). A scroll of {{nihongo|Bai Juyi's poetry anthology|白氏文集|Hakushi Monjū}} is spread on a [[maki-e]] writing desk between them.]]
This anecdote, the sixth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, occurs at an unspecified date in 1009. It is part of a description of the lady Saemon no Naishi who, Murasaki Shikibu writes in the diary, hated her. Naishi spread the rumour that Murasaki Shikibu was proud of her Chinese learning (which in the [[Heian period]] was the domain of the male aristocracy) and gave her the name "Japanese Chronicle Lady".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;After the [[Shoku Nihongi|Chronicles of Japan]] written in Classical Chinese.&lt;/ref&gt; In the anecdote, Murasaki Shikibu explains she learned Chinese in childhood, that she was taught not to be proud of  her learning, keeping it a secret during her life in fear of how others would judge her. The text in the emaki relates how [[Empress Shōshi]] requested that Murasaki Shikibu read to her in Chinese and teach her the poetical works of [[Bai Juyi]] (in particular the part known as {{nihongo||新楽府|shingafu}}) in secrecy. Nevertheless, the Emperor and Prime Minister found out about it and presented to the Empress a number of poetical works.&lt;ref name="diary-p135-136"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=135–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gosechi dancers====
This final scene in the Hachisuka scroll is about a scene from the Gosechi, an ancient dance performed by young beautiful girls in the 11th month to celebrate the harvest.&lt;ref name="Mostow1996-p178"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mostow|first=Joshua S.|title=Pictures of the heart: the Hyakunin isshu in word and image|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0KcAwrVksQC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=2011-11-30|year=1996|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1705-3|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emaki text begins  with a description of the appearance and clothing of two of the participating girls and ends with a scene in which the girls throw down their fans as the secretaries of the sixth rank approached them to take away their fans. Murasaki Shikibu considered the dancers graceful but unlike girls.&lt;!-- clarify here? not sure what she means here. the text in my translation reads: "Though they were graceful they did not seem like girls." perhaps check with Bowring --&gt; This particular scene is set on Kankō 5, 11th month, 22nd day (December 22, 1008).&lt;ref name="diary-p115-116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Painting only scenes====
The Hachisuka scroll contains paintings which are not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the [[Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki#Thinking of the first time at court|second text section of the Hinohara scroll]], where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed ''[[tsumado]]'' (hinged plank door) and ''[[shitomido]]'' (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick on top of it (''[[tōdai (light)|tōdai]]'').&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For a reproduction as relief see the lower image on [http://kakitutei.web.fc2.com/murasaki/etizen/bridge2.html this page].&lt;/ref&gt;

The final illustration of the Hachisuka scroll has no corresponding text section in the extant emaki fragments. However its content can be matched to a scene from the diary in which Murasaki Shikibu expresses her sorrows as a widow&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Her husband had died in 1001.&lt;/ref&gt; worrying about the future. She relates how she is gazing dreamily at the moon when she is "hopelessly sad" and lonely. Playing the [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description of her room containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and that no one has touched since, the other with "old poems and romances", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in [[Kankō]] 6 (1009). The illustration present in the emaki&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For a reproduction as relief see the upper image on [http://kakitutei.web.fc2.com/murasaki/etizen/bridge2.html this page]. For a recent reproduction of the painting see [http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-1.htm this image] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165712/http://www.hcn.zaq.ne.jp/internet-gallery/sakuhin3-1.htm# |date=2012-05-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a tatami room playing the koto with a court lady walking outside her room on the balcony (''[[engawa]]'').&lt;ref name="diary-p132-133"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=132–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fujita scroll===
Formerly in possession of the {{nihongo|[[Akimoto clan]]|秋元家}}, rulers of the [[Tatebayashi Domain]] in [[Kōzuke Province]], the extant Fujita scroll alternates five sections of text and five paintings. Based on this ancestral heritage it is sometimes referred to as former Akimoto scroll.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; A sixth text only section has been preserved as a 19th-century copy from the original emaki. The extant scroll is {{convert|434.0|cm|abbr=on}} long, in possession of the [[Fujita Art Museum]], [[Osaka]] and was designated as [[National Treasure of Japan]] on June 28, 1956.&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbookXI"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ohishi|1990|p=XI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the time from the evening of the 5th day celebration of the birth of the first Imperial Prince, Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]], and ends with the furnishing of Michinaga's residence for the visit of [[Emperor Ichijō]].&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ohishi|1990|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki Fujita Art Museum 2ndpaint.JPG|thumb|x150px|right|Second painting.]]
Set shortly after the fifth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, this scene relates events from the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008), the day Michinaga celebrated the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō. Some people were casting ''da''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A gambling game played with dice now not known.&lt;/ref&gt; others composed poems. Murasaki Shikibu then praises [[Fujiwara no Kintō]]'s repartee and skills in the composition of poetry; however on this evening he did not participate in the exchange of poems. The queen gave gift of robes and baby dresses to the highest ranked ladies; lined kimonos to those of 4th rank; and [[hakama]] to the lesser sixth ranked ladies.&lt;ref name="diary-p89-90"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A boating party====
The second section is a direct continuation of the previous scene, recounting an outing of young courtiers, dressed in white, going boating on a moonlit night the following day (Kankō 5, 9th month, 16th day, or 17 October 1008 in the Gregorian calendar).

Continuing from the previous scene, confusion occurs among the people in the boats as palanquins of ladies-in-waiting of the Emperor's court appear near the shelter for conveyances.

====Birth celebration organized by the Imperial Court====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita - A).jpg|right|thumb|x150px|Murasaki Shikibu (center) catches a glimpse at the Empress (left) with undone hair beyond the ''misu''.&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt;]]
The Emperor celebrated on Kankō 5, 9th month, 17th day (October 18, 1008), the seventh day of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō. Presents were exchanged between court nobles and the Emperor. During the evening ceremony, Murasaki Shikibu catches a glance of the queen, remarking that she appeared weary, having lost weight and gaining a pale complexion. Her "hair would be better tied up" writes Murasaki Shikibu; however she stops the description, realizing the impropriety of her depiction of the  "mother of the nation".&lt;ref name="diary-p91-92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparations for the Imperial visit====
Set some time between Kankō 5, 10th month, 13th day and the morning of 16th day (November 13 to 16, 1008), this scene begins with a description of planting [[chrysanthemum]]s&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chrysanthemum flowers are associated with the Imperial Family.&lt;/ref&gt; at Michinaga's mansion in preparation for the Emperor's visit. In the second part of the section, Murasaki Shikibu is musing about her melancholic life because of an "extraordinary sorrow", wishing to be more adaptable and mindless. Wondering whether she is too sinful, she yearns for a religious life. Seeing waterfowl playing heedlessly in a pond, she writes the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:
&lt;poem&gt;
Waterfowl floating on the water—
They seem so gay,
But in truth
It is not gay to live anxiously seeking means of existence.
&lt;/poem&gt;

====Day of the Imperial visit (Tanaka Shinbi copy)====
A sixth text section of the Fujita scroll has been preserved in the form of a copy from the original manuscript made by {{nihongo|Tanaka Shinbi|田中親美}} (1875–1975), researcher and collector of Japanese fine arts who also assisted in the reproduction of old writings and ancient paintings including the [[Genji Monogatari Emaki]].&lt;ref name="Shinbi-nipponica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Nipponica]] |title=田中親美 |trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi |url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E/ |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher=[[Shogakukan]] }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinbi-daijirin"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Daijirin]] |title=田中親美 |trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi |url=http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=112183000000 |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher=[[Sanseidō]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130218184256/http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;dtype=0&amp;dname=0ss&amp;stype=0&amp;pagenum=1&amp;index=112183000000 |archivedate=2013-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shinbi-kokushi"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Kokushi Daijiten]] |title=田中親美|trans-title=Tanaka Shinbi|url=http://dic.search.yahoo.co.jp/search?p=%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E8%A6%AA%E7%BE%8E&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=opsrch |accessdate=2011-12-03 |language=Japanese |edition=online |publisher= [[Yoshikawa Kobunkan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1894 he worked on the reproduction of the Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki.&lt;ref name="Shinbi-nipponica"/&gt; This text fragment does not include any illustration and is in possession of the Tanaka family.[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Fujita Art Museum) 2.jpg|left|thumb|x150px|Final painting of the extant scroll corresponding to the sixth scene: Michinaga on the veranda of his boathouse watching courtiers enjoying themselves in the boats he has provided&lt;ref name="mason-p107"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p108"/&gt;]]

The scene, which in the diary directly follows the fifth scene of the Fujita scroll, tells of an exchange of letters between Murasaki Shikibu and the Lady Koshosho. Writing her response at the time of a brisk shower in a hurry in order not to keep the messenger waiting as the "sky looked threatening", Murasaki Shikibu adds the following poem to her letter:
&lt;poem&gt;
There are pauses between the showers of the outer world,
But there is no time when my sleeves, wet with tears, are dry.
&lt;/poem&gt;
After dark she receives the following reply from Lady Koshosho:
&lt;poem&gt;
The dark sky dulls my dreamy mind,
The down-dripping rain lingers–
O my tears down falling, longing after thee!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Changing topic, Murasaki Shikibu mentions shortly that at the same day, Michinaga inspected two new boats, one with a dragon's head the other with a [[Fenghuang|phoenix]] head at the prow,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Both figures were said to have magical powers to prevent ships from sinking.&lt;/ref&gt; reminding her of animated living figures. The painting located in the emaki after the fifth text section, at the end of the extant Fujita scroll and originally before the sixth scene, illustrates this inspection of boats.&lt;ref name="diary-p95"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowring-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Bowring|2005|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penelope Mason sees this diverse composition as a nostalgic representation of the 13th century Imperial Court past its golden age, as despite of the "gaiety and splendor the scene is permeated with fleeting nature of joy and pleasure."&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntbook-p288"/&gt;

===Matsudaira or former Morikawa scroll===
In 1920 Morikawa Kanichirō (森川勘一郎, 1887–1980) from [[Nagoya]] discovered a 5-segment scroll of the ''Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki'' consisting of alternatingly five illustrations and five captions.&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"&gt;{{harvnb|Study and research institute of old writings|1989|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NagoyaCityMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.city.nagoya.jp/tenji080301.html|title=展覧会の案内|trans-title=Exhibition information|year=2000|publisher=[[Nagoya City Museum]]|accessdate=2011-10-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416025830/http://www.museum.city.nagoya.jp/tenji080301.html|archivedate=2008-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly in possession of the [[Matsudaira clan]], rulers of the [[Saijō Domain]] in [[Iyo Province]], this scroll is referred to as "Matsudaira clan edition" or after its finder as "Former Morikawa edition" (not to be confused with the Morikawa edition below which refers to the Morikawa family).&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; Two years after discovery Morikawa sold the scroll to the [[Niigata prefecture|Niigata]] businessman and master of the tea ceremony, Masuda Donō (益田鈍翁, 1847－1938, who had it cut into parts.&lt;ref name="masuda dono"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Biographical Dictionary of Art]] (美術人名辞典) |title=益田鈍翁|trans-title=Masuda Donō|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E7%9B%8A%E7%94%B0%E9%88%8D%E7%BF%81 |accessdate=2011-11-07|language=Japanese |edition=online }}&lt;/ref&gt; One part (Morikawa edition), the fifth segment, is bequeathed to the Morikawa family and today in a private collection. A year later, in 1933, Donō detached the third segment and reformatted it as a [[kakemono|hanging scroll]] (now in possession of the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]]). The remaining three scenes (numbers 1, 2, 4) were framed in 1934, changed owner once more, eventually (via the Takanashi family)  ending up in the collection of the [[Gotoh Museum]].&lt;ref name="gotohmuseumhomepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NagoyaCityMuseum"/&gt; They are known collectively as "Gotoh edition".&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; Today's Matsudaira scroll is spread over three locations and includes one [[National Treasures of Japan|National Treasure]] and two [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Properties]].
While this scroll has not survived in one piece, a 20th-century reproduction measures in at {{convert|453.1|cm|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; With the exception of the first scene of the Gotoh edition, the Matsudaira clan scroll depicts events on Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the ''ika-no-iwai'',&lt;ref group="nb" name="ikanoiwai"/&gt; the 50th day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō.

====Gotoh edition====
The Gotoh edition corresponds to scenes 1, 2 and 4 of the Matsudaira clan scroll and had been partitioned off from the scroll in 1932 and 1933 by Masuda Donō. It consists of 3 paintings and 3 associated captions each framed individually (six items in total).&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt; This set has been designated as National Treasure on June 28, 1956 and is located at the [[Gotoh Museum]].&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

=====Moonlit night=====
[[Image:2000 Yen Murasaki Shikibu.jpg|thumb|The image of Murasaki Shikibu (bottom right) on the 2000 yen bank note is taken from this scene.]]
The scene dated to [[Kankō]] 5, 10th month, 17th day (November 17, 1008), shows two drunk courtiers trying to gain entrance to Murasaki Shikibu quarters after she had enjoyed the garden outside her apartment. In the illustration, Murasaki holds her window shut against the men.&lt;ref name="mason-p183"/&gt; First to arrive at the scene is the palace steward [[Sangi (Japan)|Sangi]] {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara no Sanenari]]|藤原実成}} (on right) who opens the upper part of Murasaki's lattice door and inquires whether anybody is at home. According to Murasaki Shikibu his intention is to be mentioned to [[Empress Shōshi|Akiko]]. Sanenari is joined by the consort's steward (associated with Akiko), Sangi {{nihongo|[[Fujiwara no Tadanobu]]|藤原斉信}} who also calls out: "Is anyone here?" Murasaki replies faintly, avoiding anything that could be regarded as flirting. Together the two courtiers are requesting her to open the lower part of the door. Such behaviour, somebody of higher rank trying to enter the house of somebody of lower rank, was in the Heian period considered disgraceful and only excused by the young age of the two courtiers.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"/&gt;

In the top right corner, Murasaki's friend, the maid Saishō no Kimi, is visible.&lt;ref name="mason-p33"/&gt; The large garden occupying the left half of the painting and the  diagonally positioned building are considered to be a bold scene arrangement.&lt;ref name="gotoh-nikki-2"&gt;{{citation

The third scene held by the Gotoh museum was originally the fourth segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll. It is therefore preceded by the segment held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and followed by the 5th segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll which is in possession of the Morikawa family. Like those segments, this scene is dated to the evening of the Ika-no-iwai&lt;ref group="nb" name="ikanoiwai"/&gt; celebration of Atsuhira-shinnō. It shows drunk and disordered court nobles amusing themselves with court ladies.

====Former Ōkura family fragment====

This item, consisting of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third scene of the Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Donō in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the Ōkura clan　(大倉家), but it is now owned by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] and in custody of the [[Tokyo National Museum]]. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day of the birth of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinnō, the later Emperor Go-Ichijō in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with [[kichō]] partitioners and the prince's grandfather, [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]] at the bottom is offering rice cake ([[mochi]]) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the bottom right is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu.&lt;ref name="f-morikawa-emuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emuseum.jp/detail/100341/000/000?mode=simple&amp;d_lang=en&amp;s_lang=en&amp;word=murasaki&amp;class=&amp;title=&amp;c_e=&amp;region=&amp;era=&amp;century=&amp;cptype=&amp;owner=&amp;pos=1&amp;num=2 |title=Detached segment of The Diary of Lady Murasaki, emaki|publisher= [[Independent Administrative Institution National Institutes for Cultural Heritage]]|accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="diary-p103-104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a single scene with a very short illustration showing the inside of a traditional Japanese style room with [[fusuma]] sliding doors, [[tatami]] and a curtain.&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Like all but the first segment of this scroll, the scene is set in the evening of Kankō 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008) on occasion of the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsuhira-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Ichijō]].&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi had been hiding from the drunken carousal of that evening, but were discovered by Michinaga, Saishō no Chūjō and others. The painting is dominated by the massive figure of Fujiwara no Michinaga dressed in brocade jacket and trousers and placed in the centre of the room.&lt;ref name="mason-p31"/&gt; Murasaki Shikibu and Saishō no Kimi are huddled near the border of the painting with heads bent down as a sign of submission and deference.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|1980|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; On discovering the two court ladies in hiding, Michinaga demands a poem from each of them.

:On the fiftieth day how should one number those that follow?
:May the Prince's life span more than eight thousand years.

Despite being drunk, Michinaga answered quickly with another poem:

:O would I might live the life of a crane—
:Then might I reckon the years of the Prince
:Up to one thousand!

which according to Murasaki's diary "came from his innermost desire".&lt;ref name="diary-p106-107"/&gt; Based on the topic, this scene resembles the Azumaya edition of the Genji emaki where another court noble demands a response from a woman.&lt;ref name="mason-p32"/&gt;　This part of the scroll was designated [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan|Important Cultural Property]] on July 19, 1952.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

===Hinohara or former Hisamatsu scroll===
Formerly in possession of the [[Hisamatsu-Matsudaira clan]], a branch of the [[Matsudaira clan]] and rulers of the [[Iyo-Matsuyama Domain]], this scroll is now privately owned by the Hinohara family (日野原家). Due to this ancestral heritage it is variously referred to as "former Hisamatsu scroll" or "Hinohara scroll". The scroll is {{convert|531.6|cm|abbr=on}} long and consists of alternatingly six sections of text and six associated paintings on 13 sheets of paper.&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The fourth text part is relatively long and has been split in two.&lt;ref name="clasica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="old-writings-p237"/&gt; The scroll has been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Day of the Bird festival====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 1 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 1st painting]]
Murasaki Shikibu tells of an anecdote at the festival of the Kamo Shrine held on Kankō 5, 11th month, 28th day (December 28, 1008), the last {{nihongo|Day of the Bird|酉の日|tori no hi}}.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Last day of the [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] in the 11th month.&lt;/ref&gt; On this day, [[Fujiwara no Norimichi]], son of Michinaga, had the role of the Emperor's substitute. After a night of merriment, a joke is played on the [[Naidaijin]] by making him believe&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Through the content a characteristics of the present themselves.&lt;/ref&gt; that a present he had received is directly from the Empress; thus requiring an open return. Murasaki Shikibu goes on to describe how noble and dignified Norimichi looked on that day and how his nurse was overwhelmed by his appearance. In a sacred dance performed at night, the mediocre performance of one dancer who had been "very handsome last year" reminded Murasaki Shikibu "of the fleeting life of us all".&lt;ref name="diary-p119-120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration associated with this scene shows the Imperial Messenger, Fujiwara no Norimichi, his head decorated with wisteria branches on the top of a staircase of a shrine building. The [[Train (clothing)|train]] of his garment is flowing down the staircase and he is watched by three courtiers positioned near the bottom of the stairs.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=12–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thinking of the first time at court====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 2 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|x150px|left|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 2nd painting]]
Set on the evening of [[Kankō]] 5, 12th month, 29th day (January 27, 1009), in this scene, Murasaki Shikibu returns to the Imperial Court after a visit to her parents' home. As it is the anniversary of her coming to the court she is looking back at her former life nostalgically. Feeling lonely she goes to sleep murmuring the following [[Waka (poetry)|waka]]:

:My life and the year are closing together.
:At the sound of the wind dreary is my heart.&lt;ref name="diary-p120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting following this text section shows a man on the stairs of a house and two men on a boat just outside the house. The illustration matching the scene described in the text is now the fifth painting of the Hachisuka scroll.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=15–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incident at night====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki (Hinohara - scene 3).jpg|thumb|''All the night through, knocking louder than a water-rail, I stood in vain at the door of hinoki wood weary and lamenting.''&lt;ref name="diary-p140"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This scene from an unknown day in the year Kankō 6 (1009) shows Murasaki asleep at night in a room close to the corridor; a man is knocking on the door. Afraid to open, she spends the night without making a sound. The next morning her nightly visitor reveals himself as Michinaga through a poem he sent to her. She replies with the lines:
:A cause of deep regret, indeed,
:Had the door opened at the knocking of the water-rail!&lt;ref name="diary-p140"/&gt;

====50th day celebration of Atsunaga-shinnō====
[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki4L.JPG|thumb|x150px|left|Courtiers carrying food on the balconies of a building.]]
Scenes four to six describe the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsunaga-shinnō, the later [[Emperor Go-Suzaku]], on Kankō 7, 1st month, 15th day (February 1, 1010). The lengthy fourth section of text is split into two parts. Murasaki Shikibu briefly mentions her friendly relationship with Lady Kokosho and that they join their rooms separating them by ''kichō'' partitions only when both are at home. This behaviour made Michinaga believe that they are gossiping about other people.&lt;ref name="diary-p142-144"/&gt;  Murasaki Shikibu then describes the day's festivities: the Queen and her audience, the clothing, names and titles of the participants which included the Emperor, the infant prince and various court ladies. Dazzled in their presence, she escapes to an inner room. As the nurse, Madam Nakadaka comes away from the Emperor and Queen under the canopy, carrying the prince in her arms, Murasaki Shikibu praises her dignified demeanour, tranquility and earnestness.&lt;ref name="diary-p142-144"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=142–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting associated with this scene shows four courtiers on the balcony (''[[engawa]]'') of a Japanese style building outside fabric enclosed rooms, which are not visible. Two of the men are shown walking, the others are kneeling and appear to be talking to a person inside the building or to be handing something to someone inside. Two of the men (one standing, one walking) carry trays with cups.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the full painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|pp=21–22}}.

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 5 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 5th painting]]
In  the subsequent scene, the [[dais]] at which the main persons are seated, covered by ''misu'',&lt;ref group="nb" name="misu"/&gt; is opened and Murasaki Shikibu notes that the people present at the event and seated around the dais on the balcony were either of high rank or court ladies.  Lower rank officials later joined them on the steps below where the royalty is seated to perform music with a lute (''[[biwa]]''), harp (''[[Koto (instrument)|koto]]'') and [[Fue|flute]] (''[[Shō (instrument)|shō]]'').&lt;ref name="diary-p144-145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting corresponding to this scene shows two ladies on the balcony with rolled up misu. Both are squeezed in the corner of the image and appear to be talking to each other.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;For an [[ukiyo-e]] reproduction of the painting see {{harvnb|Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki|n.d.|p=24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki Hinohara 6 (ukiyoe).jpg|thumb|left|x150px|Ukiyo-e reproduction of 6th painting]]
A short text section follows, which is the final scene of the scroll and the final part of the known diary. The official musicians mentioned in the previous scene are joined by outsiders, one of which "made a mistake in the notes and was hissed". The [[Minister of the Right]] made a great mistake in praising the six-stringed koto. The emaki text (and diary) ends abruptly with mention of Michinaga's gift of flutes in two boxes.&lt;ref name="diary-p145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shikibu|Shikibu|1920|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illustration to this scene shows three courtiers seated in a row on the balcony with their backs facing the outside. The left figure is shown with a Japanese harp (''koto'') in front of him, his head is turned toward the other two who appear to be concentrating on something in front of them (likely instruments).

The Neighbour-Sensing mathematical model of hyphal growth is a set of interactive computer models that simulate the way [[fungal|fungi]] hyphae grow in three-dimensional space. The three-dimensional simulation is an experimental tool which can be used to study the [[morphogenesis]] of fungal hyphal networks. 

The modelling process starts from the proposition that each [[hypha]] in the fungal [[mycelium]] generates a certain abstract field that (like known physical fields) decrease with increasing distance. Both scalar and vector fields are included in the models. The field(s) and its (their) gradient(s) are used to inform the algorithm that calculates the likelihood of branching, the angle of branching and the growth direction of each hyphal tip in the simulated mycelium. The growth vector is being informed of its surroundings so, effectively, the virtual hyphal tip is sensing the neighbouring mycelium. This is why we call it the Neighbour-Sensing model.

Cross-walls in living hyphae are formed only at right angles to the long axis of the hypha. A daughter hyphal apex can only arise if a branch is initiated. So, for the fungi, hyphal branch formation is the equivalent of cell division in animals, plants and protists. The position of origin of a branch, and its direction and rate of growth are the main formative events in the development of fungal tissues and organs. Consequently, by simulating the mathematics of the control of hyphal growth and branching the Neighbour-Sensing model provides the user with a way of experimenting with features that may regulate hyphal growth patterns during morphogenesis to arrive at suggestions that could be tested with live fungi.

The model was proposed by Audrius Meškauskas and David Moore in 2004 and developed using the [[supercomputing]] facilities of the [[University of Manchester]].
The key idea of this model is that all parts of the fungal mycelium have identical field generation systems, field sensing mechanisms and growth direction altering algorithms. Under properly chosen model parameters it is possible to observe the transformation of the initial unordered mycelium structure into various forms, some of them being very like natural fungal fruit bodies and other complex structures.

In one of the simplest examples, it is assumed that the hyphal tips try to keep a 45 degree orientation with relation to the Earth’s gravity vector field, and also generate some kind of scalar field that the growing tips try to avoid. This combination of parameters leads to development of hollow conical structures, similar to the fruit bodies of some primitive fungi.

[[Image:Neighbour Sensing model cords.jpg|thumb|250px|left|After changing the parameter set, the initially chaotic formation (in the center) starts forming cords]]

In another example, the hypha generates a vector field parallel to the hyphal axis, and the tips tend to turn parallel to that field. After more tips turn in the same direction, their hyphae form a stronger directional field. In this way, it is possible to observe spontaneous orientation of growing hypha in a single direction, which simulates the strands, cords and rhizomorphs produced by many species of fungi in nature.
The parameters under which the model operates can be changed during its execution. This allows a greater variety of structures to be formed (including mushroom - like shapes) and may be supposed to simulate cases where the growth strategy depends on an internal biological clock.
The Neighbour-Sensing model explains how various fungal structures may arise because of the ‘crowd behaviour’ of the community of hyphal tips that make up the mycelium.

An '''Oil sketch''' or '''oil study''' is an artwork made primarily in [[oil paint]] in preparation for a larger, finished work. Originally these were created as preparatory studies or '''[[modello|modelli]]''', especially so as to gain approval for the design of a larger commissioned painting. They were also used as designs for specialists in other media, such as [[printmaking]] or [[tapestry]], to follow. Later they were produced as independent works, often with no thought of being expanded into a full-size painting.

The [[sketch (drawing)|usual medium]] for ''modelli'' was the [[drawing]], but an oil sketch, even if done in a limited range of colours, could better suggest the tone of the projected work. It is also possible to more fully convey the flow and energy of a composition in paint. For a painter with exceptional technique, the production of an oil sketch may be as rapid as that of a drawing, and many practitioners had superb brush skills. In its rapidity of execution the oil sketch may be used not only to express movement and transient effects of light and color, its gestural nature may even represent a mimetic parallel to the action of the subject.

One of the earliest artists to produce oil sketches was [[Polidoro da Caravaggio]], a fine draftsman and pupil of [[Raphael]], but not one who had passed through the traditional Florentine training, with its emphasis on drawing.  His are all apparently related to works later done on a larger scale, and are themselves relatively large and on [[panel painting|panel]], with examples in the [[National Gallery, London]][https://web.archive.org/web/20070303121519/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=NG6594] and [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] being 75 and 65&amp;nbsp;cm tall respectively.  Sometimes a number of sketches for the same composition have survived.
[[Image:Théodore Géricault nu masculino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Oil study of a male nude by [[Géricault]]]]
In the early 17th century the oil sketch became widely used, as it was suited to conveying the drama of [[Baroque painting|Baroque art]].  [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made great use of them, as working studies, and as ''modelli'' for clients, his own assistants, engravers and tapestry-makers.  Their degree of finish varies accordingly.  Rubens' working practices influenced others, such as [[Anthony van Dyck]], who did not normally use oil sketches for the portraits that were the bulk of his output, but did for his [[old master print|print]] series the ''Iconographie'', and for other works such as a projected series of tapestries and some religious paintings. The ''[[Magistrate of Brussels]]'', recognised in England in 2013, may be a Van Dyck portrait oil sketch. 

Perhaps the first to produce oil sketches as independent works was [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], an amazingly fecund generator of compositions on a relatively small range of subjects.  He grew up and trained in [[Genoa]], and apparently had contact with both Rubens and Van Dyck during their stays there.  He produced a large number of small works, mostly on paper, in a mixture of mediums - drawings or [[gouache]]s finished in oil, oils with pen details - in fact, most possible permutations.  Detail is typically restricted to a few key points, with much of the subject conveyed in impressionistic fashion.  By this time a collectors' market for studies in drawing was well developed, and there was appreciation of their energy and freedom. Castiglione's sketches to some extent seem to trade off this appreciation, and look more unfinished and offhand than they actually are - a concept with a great future. 

A systematic producer of small ''modelli'' sketches on canvas with a high degree of finish was the 18th century [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], whose superb technique is often shown at its best in reducing a huge [[altarpiece]] to a lively but precise rendering at this small scale. At roughly the same time [[Jean Fragonard]] was producing a series of virtuosic ''Figures de fantaisie'', half-length portraits of imaginary subjects, purporting to have been painted in an hour.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, Richard R.: ''Impression: Painting Quickly in France'', pages 31–2. Yale University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:John Constable 025.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[John Constable]], 1827, 22 × 31 cm]]

By the 19th century oil sketches, often referred to as "oil studies" if from this period, had become very common, both as preparatory works, and for their own sake. The popularity of the oil sketch engendered the need to formulate distinctions. The ''esquisse'', or oil sketch, tended to be inspirational or imaginative, often originating in literature or art; the ''etude'', or study, tended to represent an observation of nature, painted from life. In academic painting the oil sketch took the form of the ''croquis'', a small and gestural compositional study, and the ''ébauche'', a dynamic laying-in of paint on the full-scale canvas, a temporary stage of the painting eventually leading to greater elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brettell, pages 31–9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[John Constable]] made extensive use of sketches for his landscapes, both of intimate scale, often in a [[sketchbook]] on paper, and in full-scale sketches for his largest "six-footers", which he used to refine his compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/constable/ Tate Britain exhibition showing Constable's large landscapes along with their full-size oil sketches]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Eakins]], Sketch for [[The Gross Clinic]].]][[image:Study for swimming thomas eakins.jpeg|thumb|left|Thomas Eakins, 1884 ''Swimming Hole sketch'', [[oil paint|oil]] on [[fiberboard]] mounted on fiberboard, 22.1 × 27 cm., 8{{fraction|3|4}} × 10{{fraction|3|4}} inches, [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], [[Washington, D.C..]]]][[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Géricault]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] and [[Degas]] are other artists who often used them. For some oil sketches Degas painted in ''essence'', a technique by which the oil had been all but removed from the pigment, so that the artist was virtually drawing with pure paint. [[Seurat]] made many careful small oil sketches for his larger works. However, with the advent of [[Impressionism]], and then [[Modernism]], the practice of preparatory drawing and painting tended to decline. The abandonment by many artists of a high level of detail and finish in favor of a more [[painterly]] and spontaneous approach, reduced the distinction between a detailed sketch and a finished painting.  Sketches by Rubens or Tiepolo, for example, are at least as highly finished as many 20th century oil paintings.  Many artists, especially those working in more traditional styles, still use oil sketches today.  [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] is an example of an artist who called many of his most important, and largest, finished works "studies": examples are his [[Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion]] [[Tate Britain]], or his ''Study from Pope Innocent X'', auctioned in 2007 for $52.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0516/baconf.html RTE story &amp; picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oregon Forest Resources Institute'''  (OFRI) is an educational organization based in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] dedicated to [[forestry]] issues, including improving public understanding of the state's forest resources and encouraging environmentally sound [[forest management]]. It provides education, training and publications for forest landowners, students and teachers, and the general public. It also produces research on forest science and current issues.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= About OFRI |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; OFRI's seven-member staff is located in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].&lt;ref name=Contact&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/ContactInformation.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= Contact OFRI |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
OFRI was created by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] in 1991 and is funded by a dedicated [[Forest product|forest-products]] harvest tax.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; It is governed by a 13-member board of directors who represent small, medium and large forest producers, small woodland owners, forest sector employees, academia and the general public. The [[Oregon Department of Forestry|Oregon State Forester]] appoints 11 members. The others are ex officio: the dean of [[Oregon State University]] College of Forestry and a public representative appointed by the president of the [[Oregon State Senate]] and speaker of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=Board&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/BoardofDirectors.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= Board of Directors |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of Directors&lt;ref name="Board"/&gt;==
The Board of Directors consists entirely of representatives from the timber industry.

The state forester appoints 11 dedicated individuals to a board of directors that governs the Oregon Forest Resources Institute. The state forester is charged by statute with soliciting nominations and appointing the following board members: nine representatives of producer classes, with three each from small (Class 1), medium (Class 2) and large (Class 3) producers; one member representing small woodland owners; and one representative for forest industry employees.

Ex officio members required by statute include the dean of the Oregon State University College of Forestry and a public member appointed jointly by the president of the Oregon Senate and the speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives.

Board members appointed by the state forester serve three-year terms. 
Current OFRI board members (as of January 2016) are as follows:

Class 1:  producers are defined by rule as those paying the harvest tax on 20 million board feet per year or less. 
Class 2: producers are those paying tax on more than 20 million per year but less than 100 million board feet. 
Class 3: producers pay tax on 100 million board feet per year or more.
Small woodland owners: are defined as those who own between 100 and 2,000 acres of forestland and who have no direct financial interest in any forest products processing activity.

Current members include:

Matt Hegerberg - WyEast Timber Services, LLC

Jennifer Phillipi - Perpetua Forests Company

Quincy Powers - Powers Ranch Company

Tyler Freres - Freres Lumber Company, Inc.

David Fartwangler - Cascade Timber Consulting, Inc.

Eric Schooler - Collins Timber

David Hampton - Hampton Lumber

Jim Hunt - Campbell Global, LLC

Steve McNulty - [[Weyerhaeuser]]

Audrey Barnes - Nickel Mountain, LLC

Mike Sullivan - [[Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers]]

Ex Officio Member - Thomas Maness - Dean, [[Oregon State University]] School of Forestry

Ex Officio Member - Randy Schild - Tillamook School District no. 9

==Advertising Campaigns==
OFRI has purchased several prominent advertising campaigns in the state of Oregon. These campaigns are paid for with taxpayer dollars. In 2015 OFRI spent $1.05 million in taxpayer funds.&lt;ref name="TAX-DOLLAR TIMBER INDUSTRY ADVERTISING FACES SCRUTINY IN OREGON"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://invw.org/2015/09/09/tax-dollar-timber-industry-advertising-faces-scrutiny-in-oregon |title= TAX-DOLLAR TIMBER INDUSTRY ADVERTISING FACES SCRUTINY IN OREGON |publisher= Investigate West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016-2017 the advertising campaigns have focused on promoting a [[corporate website]] created by OFRI, http://oregonforestlaws.org/

==Landowner education==
OFRI provides workshops, publications and conferences focused on recent science and advances in forest management practices. Its programs are available to both large and small forestland owners.&lt;ref name=Report&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/assets/media/pdf/0910_annualrpt.pdf.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= 2009-2010 Annual Report |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student and teacher education==
OFRI's K-12 forestry education programs reach more than 100,000 students and more than 1,000 educators annually.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt; Its Oregon Forest Literacy Program includes a forest education conceptual framework correlated with state education standards that offer educators guidance for developing classroom lessons related to forests. Student programs include classroom presentations, career events, publications, field tours and activities. Teacher training also includes support for workshops and conferences.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

OFRI manages the Rediscovery Forest, a forested area used for educational purposes and to demonstrate diverse Oregon wildlife habitat and [[forest ecology|forest ecosystems]].&lt;ref name=Disc&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/rediscovery |title= Rediscovery Forest |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rediscovery Forest is located in the [[Oregon Garden]], in [[Silverton, Oregon|Silverton]].

==Public education==
To increase public understanding about Oregon forests and their management, OFRI produces educational spots aired on broadcast and cable television; print, radio and Internet advertising; and online newsletters.&lt;ref name=Facts&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonforests.org/content/about/FactsAndResources/Videos.asp?section=2&amp;content=1%20 |title= FactsAndResources/Videos |publisher= Oregon Forest Resources Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a [[speakers bureau]], and co-sponsors and supports conferences and forest field trips.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

==Publications==
OFRI maintains a library of approximately 70 titles that includes special reports, fact sheets, research reports, pocket reference guides and career information, all available at OFRI's website.&lt;ref name=Facts/&gt;  It publishes an annual report each year in the fall.&lt;ref name=Report/&gt;

'''Planetizen''' is a planning-related news [[website]] owned by Urban Insight of Los Angeles, California. It features user-submitted and editor-evaluated news and weekly user-contributed op-eds about [[urban planning]] and several related fields. The website also publishes an annual list of the top 10 books in the field published during the current year, and a directory and ranking of graduate-level education in the field of urban planning.

The name of the website is a concatenation of Plan, as in the word, planning, and [[Netizen]], a [[portmanteau]] of [[Internet]] and [[citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;Planetizen [http://www.planetizen.com/about/faq Frequently asked questions page]&lt;/ref&gt; The website self-reports that it is visited by 1.5 million unique visitors each year.&lt;ref&gt;Planetizen [http://www.planetizen.com/about/advertise Advertising] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the website also started publishing books, including the first urban planning book for children, ''Where Things Are, From Near to Far'', published in 2008 by Planetizen Press. This book was reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/realestate/22postings.html My First Book of Urban Planning], published by ''[[The New York Times]]'' on February 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2007 book "Planetizen's Contemporary Debates in Urban Planning", [http://www.islandpress.com/bookstore/details.php?prod_id=1202] a collection of brief essays published by Island Press, received positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Chavan,+Abhijeet,+Christian+Peralta+and+Christopher+Steins,+eds.:...-a0185031908 Book review by Patrick S. McGovern in Canadian Journal of Urban Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Planetizen introduced a much-needed broader perspective on city planning in the US, which very often extends into international practice as well. Coming out of the very formal car-oriented planning philosophy and practice following the Second World War, American urbanism risked becoming a dinosaur as it missed all the exciting New Urbanist practices being implemented. The great value of Planetizen was to juxtapose ALL planning practice and let readers judge the effectiveness of each idea. Coming as it did in the internet age, it provided, and continues to provide, an extremely useful central location for urbanists and planners to follow what is happening around the world. More than any other site, Planetizen is a clearing house of planning ideas, and its inclusivity without any ideological prejudice is both refreshing and invaluable.

==Innovations and Debates==

===Suburban Sprawl===
The major problem in developed economies is surely sprawl and its energy-devouring urban morphology. Planetizen has broadly championed the New Urbanist solutions while juxtaposing a variety of alternatives and criticisms. This interplay lays the groundwork for facing a difficult problem. Debate on Planetizen juxtaposes practical concerns of developers and government entities with the need for more sustainable urban fabric. Developers who build Sprawl are being educated towards new strategies for a more livable suburbia.

===Informal Settlements===
In the Developing World, the major problem facing both economies and governments lies in owner-built settlements, [[favelas]], [[villas miserias]], [[gecekondu]], or slums by any other name. Here the debate is more difficult to access, because for a long time, the problems and solutions found in informal settlements have been either ignored or misinterpreted by mainstream planners. Solutions to this exponentially growing problem are not obvious. Planetizen has commendably brought attention to this other side of urbanism, so often ignored by the urban planning schools. For example, it sponsored a discussion on the Bombay slum [[Dharavi]], which brought the topic of [[slum clearance]] versus upgrading to world-wide attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetizen.com/node/35269 Dharavi: India's Model Slum]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skyscrapers/Tall Buildings===
World economies and major construction companies are driven in part by building megaprojects, the most prominent component of which is one or more skyscrapers. Planetizen has opened up the debate on skyscrapers more than once. A city has to balance the drive to build high, using high-tech, with the theoretical objections that skyscrapers drain the resources and energy from the region in which they are implanted. New skyscrapers are claimed to be ecosustainable, but those claims have as many critics as they have proponents. Again, there is a need for a broad debate, and Planetizen contains many different and dissenting viewpoints on the question of skyscrapers as a viable building typology.

==Criticism==
Planetizen is often criticized for running news stories or user-contributed op-eds that are critical of current [[urban planning]] practices. Planetizen is also criticized by some urban planning educators in higher education for ranking graduate-level urban planning programs in the ''Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[[UCLA]] Professor [[Randall Crane]] explains problems with the Planetizen ranking of graduate urban planning programs on his blog, in a post, [http://planning-research.com/ranking-urban-planning-programs/ Ranking Urban Planning Programs].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6100">A '''pseudoword''' or '''non-word''' is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain [[language]], while in fact it has no meaning in the [[lexicon]]. It is a kind of non-lexical [[vocable]].

Such [[word]]s without a [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a certain language or no occurrence in any [[text corpus]] or [[dictionary]] can be the result of (the interpretation of) a truly [[random signal]], there will usually be an underlying deterministic source as is the case for:

*[[nonsense word]]s (e.g. ''[[jabberwocky]]'')
*[[nonce word]]s
*[[ghost word]]s (e.g. ''[[dord]]'')
*[[Cipher|cyphers]]
*[[typo]]s

When nonsensical words are strung together, [[gibberish]] may arise. [[Word salad]] in contrast may contain legible and intelligible words but without semantic or [[syntax|syntactic]] correlation or [[coherence (linguistics)|coherence]].

== Characteristics ==
{{No footnotes|section|date=April 2013}}
Within [[linguistics]], a pseudoword is defined specifically as respecting the [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] restrictions of a language. That is, it does not include sounds or series of sounds that do not exist in that language: it is easily pronounceable for speakers of the language. Also, when written down, a pseudoword does not include strings of characters that are not permissible in the spelling of the target language. "Vonk" is a pseudoword in English, while "dfhnxd" is not. The latter is an example of a nonword. Nonwords are contrasted with pseudowords in that they are not pronounceable and by that their spelling could not be the spelling of a real word.

Pseudowords are also sometimes called '''wug words''' in the context of linguistic experiments. This is because ''wug'' [wʌg] was one such pseudoword used by [[Jean Berko Gleason]] in her [[wug test]] 1958 experiments. Words like ''wug'', which could have been a perfectly acceptable word in English but isn't due to an [[accidental gap]], were presented to children. The experimenter would then prompt the children to create a plural for ''wug'', which was almost invariably ''wugs'' [wʌgz]. The experiments were designed to see if English [[morphophonemics]] would be applied by children to novel words. They revealed that even at a very young age, children have already internalized many of the complex features of their language.

A '''logatome''' is a short pseudoword or just a syllable which is used in acoustic experiments to examine [[speech recognition]].

== Nonsense syllables ==

A '''logatome''' or '''nonsense syllable''' is a short pseudoword consisting most of the time of just one [[syllable]] which has no meaning of its own. Examples of English logatomes are the nonsense words ''snarp'' or ''bluck''.

Like other pseudowords, logatomes obey all the phonotactic rules of a specific language.

Logatomes are used in particular in [[acoustics|acoustic]] experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=57–64 |doi=10.1055/s-2007-997389 |title=Sprachaudiometrie mit Logatomen* |year=2008 |last1=Welge-Lüßen |first1=Antje |last2=Hauser |first2=R. |last3=Erdmann |first3=J. |last4=Schwob |first4=Ch. |last5=Probst |first5=R. |journal=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie |volume=76 |issue=02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in experiments in the [[psychology of learning]] as a way to examine speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.specom.2007.01.009 |title=Reaching over the gap: A review of efforts to link human and automatic speech recognition research |year=2007 |last1=Scharenborg |first1=O |journal=Speech Communication |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=336–347}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[experimental psychology]], especially the psychology of learning and [[memory]].

Nonsense syllables were first introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]]&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1964).  ''Memory''. New York: Dover. (Originally published 1885.)&lt;/ref&gt; in his experiments on the learning of lists.  His intention was that they would form a standard stimulus so that experiments would be reproducible.  However, with increasing use it became apparent that different nonsense syllables were learned at very different rates, even when they had the same superficial structure.  Glaze&lt;ref&gt;Glaze, J. A. (1928).  The association value of non-sense syllables.  ''Pedagogical Seminary and Journal of Genetic Psychology, 35'', 255-269.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[association value]] to describe these differences, which turned out to be reliable between people and situations.  Since Glaze's time, experiments using nonsense syllables typically control association value in order to reduce variability in results between stimuli.

Nonsense syllables can vary in structure.  The most used are the so-called CVC syllables, composed of a consonant, a vowel, and a consonant.  These have the advantage that nearly all are pronounceable, that is, they fit the phonotactics of any language that uses [[syllable#Coda|closed syllables]], such as English and [[German language|German]].  They are often described as "CVC [[trigram]]s", reflecting their three-letter structure.  Obviously many other structures are possible, and can be described on the same principles, e.g. VC, VCV, CVCV.  But the CVC trigrams have been studied most intensively; for example, Glaze determined association values for 2019 of them.

The term nonsense syllable is widely used to describe [[non-lexical vocables in music|non-lexical vocables used in music]], most notably in [[scat singing]] but also in many other forms of vocal music.  Although such usages do not invoke the technical issues about structure and associability that are of concern in psychology, the essential meaning of the term is the same.

'''Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals''' ('''REACH''') is a [[European Union regulation]] dating from 18 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Full title: Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency.&lt;/ref&gt; REACH addresses the production and use of [[chemical substance]]s, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.  Its 849 pages took seven years to pass, and it has been described as the most complex legislation in the Union's history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU's REACH chemicals law begins life in Helsinki | date=31 May 2007 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/24169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the most important in 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Q&amp;A: Reach chemicals legislation | date=28 November 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437304.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the strictest law to date regulating chemical substances and will affect industries throughout the world.&lt;ref name="US affected"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/12/14/MNGR2MV8UT1.DTL&amp;hw=toxic+chemicals&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 | title=European Parliament OKs world's toughest law on toxic chemicals | date=14 December 2006 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Marla | last=Cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; REACH entered into force on 1 June 2007, with a phased implementation over the next decade. The regulation also established the [[European Chemicals Agency]], which manages the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of REACH.

==Overview==
[[File:European Chemicals Agency.jpg|{{largethumb}}|left|[[European Chemicals Agency]] headquarters in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}.]]

When REACH is fully in force, it will require all companies manufacturing or importing chemical substances into the European Union in quantities of one [[tonne]] or more per year to register these substances with a new [[European Chemicals Agency]] (ECHA) in {{ill|Annankatu (Helsinki)|fi}}, [[Finland]]. Since REACH applies to some substances that are contained in objects (''articles'' in REACH terminology), any company importing goods into Europe could be affected.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt;

The [[European Chemicals Agency]] has set three major deadlines for registration of chemicals. In general these are determined by tonnage manufactured or imported, with 1000 tonnes/a. being required to be registered by 1 December 2010, 100 tonnes/a. by 1 June 2013 and 1 tonne/a. by 1 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reagent.co.uk/blog/what-is-reach/|title=What is REACH? – ReAgent Chemical Services|date=6 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, chemicals of higher concern or toxicity also have to meet the 2010 deadline.

About 143,000 chemical substances marketed in the European Union were pre-registered by the 1 December 2008 deadline. Although pre-registering was not mandatory, it allows potential registrants much more time before they have to fully register. Supply of substances to the European market which have not been pre-registered or registered is illegal (known in REACH as "no data, no market").

REACH also addresses the continued use of chemical ''[[substance of very high concern|substances of very high concern]]'' (SVHC) because of their potential negative impacts on human health or the environment. From 1 June 2011, the European Chemicals Agency must be notified of the presence of SVHCs in articles if the total quantity used is more than one tonne per year and the SVHC is present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the object. Some uses of SVHCs may be subject to prior authorisation from the European Chemicals Agency, and applicants for authorisation will have to include plans to replace the use of the SVHC with a safer alternative (or, if no safer alternative exists, the applicant must work to find one) - known as ''substitution''. {{As of|2015|06|15}}, there are 168 SVHCs on the candidate list for authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

REACH applies to all [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] imported or produced in the EU. The European Chemicals Agency will manage the technical, [[Science|scientific]] and administrative aspects of the REACH system.

To somewhat simplify the registration of the 143,000 substances and to limit vertebrate animal testing as far as possible, substance information exchange forums (SIEFs) are formed amongst legal entities (such as manufacturers, importers, and data holders) who are dealing with the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |title=Substance Information Exchange Fora&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |publisher=[[European Chemicals Agency]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223062045/http://echa.europa.eu/sief_en.asp |archivedate=2009-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows them to join forces and finances to create 1 registration dossier. However, this creates a series of new problems as a SIEF is the cooperation between sometimes a thousand legal entities that did not know each other at all before but suddenly must:
*find each other and start communicating openly and honestly
*start sharing data
*start sharing costs in a fair and transparent way
*democratically and in full consensus take the most complex decisions
in order to complete a several thousand end points dossier in a limited time.

The [[European Commission]] supports businesses affected by REACH by handing out &amp;ndash; free of charge &amp;ndash; a software application ([[IUCLID]]) that simplifies capturing, managing, and submitting data on chemical properties and effects. Such submission is a mandatory part of the [[REACh authorisation procedure|registration process]]. Under certain circumstances the performance of a [[chemical safety assessment]] (CSA) is mandatory and a [[chemical safety report]] (CSR) assuring the safe use of the substance has to be submitted with the dossier. Dossier submission is done using the web-based software [[REACH-IT]].

The aim of REACH is to improve the protection of human health and the environment by identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances. At the same time, innovative capability and competitiveness of the EU chemicals industry should be enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Reach|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|website = TEPPFA|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The European Commission’s (EC) White Paper of 2001 on a ‘future chemical strategy’ proposed a system that requires chemicals manufactured in quantities of greater than 1 tonne to be ‘registered’, those manufactured in quantities greater than 100 tonnes to be ‘evaluated’, and certain substances of high concern (for example carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic to reproduction - CMR’s) to be ‘authorised’.

The EC adopted its proposal for a new scheme to manage the manufacture, importation and supply of chemicals in Europe on in October 2003. This proposal eventually became law once the European Parliament officially approved its final text of REACH. It came into force on 1 June 2007.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
One of the major elements of the REACH [[regulation]] is the requirement to communicate information on [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] up and down the [[supply chain]]. This ensures that manufacturers, importers, and also their customers are aware of information relating to [[health]] and [[safety]] of the products supplied. For many [[retail]]ers the obligation to provide information about [[Chemical substance|substance]]s in their products within 45 days of receipt of a request from a [[consumer]] is particularly challenging. Having detailed information on the substances present in their products will allow retailers to work with the manufacturing base to substitute or remove potentially harmful substances from products. The list of harmful substances is continuously growing and requires [[organization]]s to constantly monitor any announcements and additions to the REACH scope. This can be done on the [[European Chemicals Agency]]'s website.

===Registration===
A requirement is to collect, collate and submit data to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and non-isolated intermediates) manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) will have to be authorised.

Chemicals will be registered in three phases according to the tonnage of the substance evaluation:

More than 1000 tonnes a year, or substances of highest concern, must be registered in the first 3 years;

100-1000 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 6 years;

1-100 tonnes a year must be registered in the first 11 years.

In addition, industry should prepare risk assessments and provide controls measures for using the substance safely to downstream users.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Evaluation===
Evaluation provides a means for the authorities to require registrants, and in very limited cases downstream users, to provide further information.

There are two types of evaluation: dossier evaluation and substance :

Dossier evaluation is conducted by authorities to examine proposals for testing to ensure that unnecessary animal tests and costs are avoided, and to check the compliance of registration dossier with the registration requirements.

The relevant authorities perform substance evaluation when there is a reason to suspect that a substance presents a risk to human health or the environment (e.g. because of its structural similarity to another substance). Therefore, all registration dossiers submitted for a substance are examined together and any other available information is taken into account.&lt;ref name="TEPPFA, The European Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association"/&gt;

===Authorisation===
{{main|REACH authorisation procedure}}
The REACH proposal sets up a system under which the use of substances with properties of very high concern and their placing on the market can be made subject to an authorisation requirement.

This authorisation requirement ensures that risks from the use of such substances are either adequately controlled or justified by socio-economic grounds, having taken into account the available information on alternative substances or processes.

The Regulation enables restrictions of use to be introduced across the European Community where this is shown to be necessary. Member States or the Commission may prepare such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = www.teppfa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information exchange===
[[File:REACh Dates.png|{{largethumb}}|REACh Key Dates]]

Manufactures and/or importers should develop risk reduction measures for all known uses of the chemical including downstream uses. Downstream users such as plastic pipe producers should provide detail of their uses to their suppliers. In cases where downstream users decide not to disclose this information, they need to have their own CSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.teppfa.eu/reach/|title = REACh|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = TEPPFA, The Plastic Pipes and Fittings Association|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;


==History==
REACH is the product of a wide-ranging overhaul of EU chemical policy.  It passed the first reading in the [[European Parliament]] on 17 November 2005, and the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] reached a political agreement for a common position on 13 December 2005. The European Parliament approved REACH on 13 December 2006 and the Council of Ministers formally adopted it on 18 December 2006. Weighing up expenditure versus profit has always been a significant issue, with the estimated cost of compliance being around €5&amp;nbsp;billion over 11&amp;nbsp;years, and the assumed health benefits of saved billions of euro in healthcare costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=EU backs landmark chemicals law | date=13 December 2005 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524772.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been different studies on the estimated cost which vary considerably in the outcome. It came into force on 20 January 2009, and will be fully implemented by 2015.

A separate regulation – the [[CLP Regulation]] (for "Classification, Labelling, Packaging") – implements the United Nations [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) and will steadily replace the previous [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] and [[Dangerous Preparations Directive]].

The REACH regulation was amended in April 2018 to include specific information requirements for [[nanomaterials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euon.echa.europa.eu/view-article/-/journal_content/title/improved-clarity-on-nanomaterials-in-the-eu-member-states-vote-to-amend-reach-annex-1|title=Improved clarity on nanomaterials in the EU - Member States vote to amend REACH Annexes|last=|first=|date=|publisher=The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==
The legislation was proposed under dual reasoning: protection of [[health|human health]] and protection of [[natural environment|the environment]].

Using potentially [[toxic substances]] (such as [[phthalate]]s or [[brominated flame retardant]]s) is deemed undesirable and REACH will force the use of certain substances to be phased out. Using potentially toxic substances in products other than those [[ingest]]ed by humans (such as [[electronic device]]s) may seem to be safe, but there are several ways in which chemicals can enter the human body and the environment. Substances can leave particles during [[consumer]] use, for example into the air where they can be inhaled or ingested. Even where they might not do direct harm to humans, they can contaminate the air or water, and can enter the food chain through plants, fish or other animals. According to the European Commission, little safety information exists for 99 percent of the tens of thousands of chemicals placed on the market before 1981.&lt;ref name="US affected"/&gt; There were 100,106 chemicals in use in the EU in 1981, when the last survey was performed. Of these only 3,000 have been tested and over 800 are known to be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. These are listed in the Annex 1 of the [[Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC)|Dangerous Substances Directive]] (now Annex VI of the [[CLP Regulation]]).

Continued use of many toxic chemicals is sometimes justified because "at very low levels they are not a concern to health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pesticides 'in a third of foods' | date=27 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5384138.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these substances may [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in the human body, thus reaching dangerous concentrations. They may also [[chemical reaction|chemically react]] with one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Food chemicals 'may harm humans' | date=21 September 2006 | publisher=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5366028.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing new substances with new risks.

==In non-EU countries==
A number of countries outside of the European Union have started to implement REACH-regulations or are in the process of adopting such a regulatory framework to approach a more globalized system of chemicals registration under the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130708194823/http://www.icis.com/Articles/2010/05/31/9362538/reach-like+regulations+enacted+globally.html ICIS.com REACH-like regulations enacted globally] retrieved July 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Balkan countries such as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] are in the process of adopting the EU REACH system under the auspices of the EU IPA programme. [[Switzerland]] has moved towards implementation of REACH through partial revision of the Swiss Chemical Ordinance on February 1, 2009.  The new Chemicals Management Regulation in [[Turkey]] is paving the way for the planned adoption of REACH in 2013. [[China]] has moved towards a more efficient and coherent system for the control of chemicals in compliance with GHS.

==Controversy==
Apart from the potential costs to [[industry]] and the complexity of the new law, REACH has also attracted concern because of [[animal testing]]. Animal tests on [[vertebrate]]s are now required but allowed only once per each new substance and if suitable alternatives cannot be used.  If a company pays for such tests, it must sell the rights of the results for a "reasonable" price, which is not defined.  There are additional concerns that access to the necessary information may prove very costly for potential registrants needing to purchase it.

An opinion in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2009 by Thomas Hartung and Constanza Rovida estimated that 54 million vertebrate animals would be used under REACH and that the costs would amount to €9.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;T. Hartung &amp; C. Rovida: Chemical regulators have overreached. Opinion in Nature, vol. 460, 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartung is the former head of European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a news release, ECHA criticised assumptions made by Hartung and Rovida; ECHA's alternative assumptions reduced sixfold the number of animals.&lt;ref&gt;ECHA - [http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf New study inaccurate on the number of test animals for REACH] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215231108/http://echa.europa.eu/doc/press/pr_09_11_animal_testing_20090828.pdf |date=2010-02-15 }}. Helsinki, 28 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

On 8 June 2006, the REACH proposal was criticized by non-EU countries, including the United States, India and [[Brazil]], which stated that the bill would hamper global trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Beunderman | title=EU chemicals bill under fire from US-led coalition | date=June 9, 2006 | publisher=EUobserver.com | url=http://euobserver.com/9/21813 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Only representative services==
Non-EU consultancies offer "only representative" services, though according to REACH it is not possible to register a substance if your "only representative" consultancy company is not based in the EU, unless it is subcontracted to an EU-based registrant.

Only representatives are EU based entities that must comply with REACH (Article 8) and should operate standard, transparent working practices. The Only Representative assumes responsibility and [[Legal liability|liability]] for fulfilling obligiations of importers in accordance with REACH for substances being brought into the EU by a non-EU manufacturer.

The SIEFs will bring new challenges. An article in the business news service [[Chemical Watch]] described how some "pre-registrants" may simply be consultants hoping for work ("gold diggers") while others may be aiming to charge exorbitant rates for the data they have to offer ("jackals").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Authorisation List==
The [[European Chemical Agency]] (ECHA) has published the REACH Authorisation List,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echa.europa.eu/addressing-chemicals-of-concern/authorisation/recommendation-for-inclusion-in-the-authorisation-list/authorisation-list|title=Page has moved - ECHA|website=echa.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to tighten the use of [[substance of very high concern|Substances of Very High Concern]] (SVHCs). The list is an official recommendation from the ECHA to the [[European Commission]]. The list is also regularly updated and expanded. Currently the Candidate List for Authorisation comprises a total of 173 SVHCs, some of which are already active on the Authorization List.

To sell or use these substances, manufacturers, importers, and retailers in the [[European Union]] (EU) must apply for authorization from the [[European Chemical Agency|ECHA]]. The applicant is to submit a chemical safety report on the risks entailed by the substance, as well as an analysis of possible alternative substances or technologies including present and future [[research and development]] processed.

'''Russian Orthodox bell ringing''' has a history starting from the [[baptism of Rus]] in 988 and plays an important role in the traditions of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

==Theology==
The ringing of bells is one of the most essential elements of an Orthodox church.&lt;ref name="ZB"&gt;

*Summon the faithful to services
*Express the triumphal joy of the Christian Church
*Announce important moments during the services both to those in church and to those who are not able to be physically present in the church, so that all may be united in prayer
*Strengthen Christians in piety and faith by its sound, which Orthodox Christians believe is "alloyed with divine grace to disperse and destroy the forces of cruelty and of demonic suggestion"&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{Citation

*Proclaim important events, such as the death of a member of the church; the arrival of an important person, such as the [[bishop]] or civil ruler; an emergency such as [[fire]] or [[flood]]; or victory in battle (as dramatically recreated in the triumphant conclusion of the [[1812 Overture]]).

The use of bells is not only practical, but is also considered to be spiritual. Bells are sometimes referred to as "singing icons", because they establish the [[acoustics|acoustic]] space of an Orthodox [[temple]] just as painted [[icon]]s and [[hymnology|hymnography]] define its visual and [[nous|noetic]] space, respectively.  Icons are considered "scripture in image" as bells are "scripture in sound".

There are several liturgical services which point out the importance of bells in the Russian Orthodox Church: ''[[Blessing]] the [[Foundation (engineering)|Foundation]] of a New [[Bell tower|Bell Tower]]'', ''Blessing a New Bell Tower'' (after construction is completed), ''Blessing, Naming, and [[Chrismation|Chrismating]] a Bell''. There is also a service for the blessing of a bell ringer.

Bells are blessed with a ritual containing many of the elements of the [[Baptism|Rite of Baptism]]. The new bell is blessed with [[holy water]] and [[censed]], both outside and inside, and the priest [[Laying on of hands|lays hands]] on the bell to bless it.  During the rite, the bell is "named" (that is, [[consecration|consecrated]] in honour of a [[saint]], whose [[icon]] has often been molded into the side of the bell when it was [[Bellfounding|cast]] at the [[foundry]]—but though a bell may be called the "Gabriel" bell, it would never be called the "St. Gabriel" bell, because a bell is not a saint).

The bell is also [[anointed]] with [[chrism]], just as an Orthodox Christian is at [[chrismation]]. The theological understanding of bells as "weapons" in [[spiritual warfare]], and their role in the Christian life is emphasized during the rite by the [[scripture]] [[lection|lesson]] from {{bibleverse||Numbers|10:1-10|HE}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: Make for yourself two silver trumpets … And they shall be for you for the calling of the assembly … When you sound an alarm … And if you shall go forth to war … And in the days of your rejoicing …"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of bells is symbolic of the proclamation of the [[Gospel]]. Sometimes Orthodox churches and monasteries will combine the use of bells with the striking of a wooden or metal [[semantron]], with the semantron being sounded first, then the bells being rung later. The quieter and simpler sound of the semantron is understood to symbolize the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s, for it is the symbol only of a coming event, whereas the ringing of the bells is spread far into the air symbolizing the annunciation of the Gospel throughout the world.&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:The Tsar Bell Moscow.jpg|thumb|The [[Tsar Bell]] standing beside the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in [[Moscow]]; the sculpting of the wall of the bell can be seen in the broken section.]]

After the conversion of [[Kievan Rus]] to Christianity in the 10th century, bells came gradually into use everywhere. Originally, a flat piece of wood or metal called a [[semantron]] would be beaten rhythmically with a mallot to summon the faithful to services.  This was especially true in [[monastery|monasteries]], some of which still to this day use both semantrons and bells.

While the semantron was inherited from Greece, the use of church bells was imported into Russia from Western Europe.&lt;ref name="ZB"/&gt;  The [[Russian language|Russian]] word for bell is ''kolokol'', which comes from the German word ''glocke'', derived from the Latin ''clocca'', which in turn appears to come from the Irish ''clog''.&lt;ref name="CatEn"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   The word for bell in [[Church Slavonic]] is ''kampan'', which is derived from Latin ''campana''. During the fifteenth century the semantron began to be gradually replaced by bells.&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;  At that time, several [[foundry|foundries]] for [[Bellfounding|bell making]] were established in Russia.  Russian church bells are commonly cast using a mixture of bronze and tin, often with silver added to the [[bell metal]], to produce their unique sonority and resonance. Russian bells also tend to differ from Western bells in the proportion of their height to width, and the method of varying the thickness of the walls of the bell. The clapper ("tongue") of the bell also follows a different design than that used in the West.

The art of bellfounding reached its pinnacle in the 18th century, with the production of unimaginably huge bells. The largest bell in the world, the [[Tsar Bell]] (218 [[Short ton|tons]]) was cast in 1733 for the [[Ivan the Great Bell Tower]] in [[Moscow]]. Unfortunately, the Tsar Bell was damaged in a fire in 1737 before it could be successfully hung, and stands today at the base of the tower. The largest working bell in the world is the [[Dormition]] Bell (144,000 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) which hangs in the same Ivan the Great Bell Tower.

After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], the [[Soviet Union]] severely [[persecution of Christians|persecuted Christianity]]. Numerous bells were destroyed and during certain periods the production of church bells all but stopped. After [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] the production of bells resumed, and has experienced a surge of activity as many of the churches that were destroyed are being rebuilt.

==Technique of ringing==
[[Image:Ipatios monastery Kostroma 19.jpg|thumb|Ringing the bells at [[Ipatiev Monastery]] in [[Kostroma]], Russia.]]
[[File:Bell-ringer yaroslavl 2012.ogv|thumb|Bell-ringer demonstrating Russian ringing on a portable belfry]]

Technically, bells rung in the Russian tradition are sounded exclusively by [[Chime (bell instrument)|chiming]] (i.e., moving only the clapper so that it strikes the side of a stationary bell) and never by swinging the bell. For the Russian tradition a special complex system of ropes is used, designed individually for each belltower. All the ropes are gathered at approximately one point, where the bell-ringer (''zvonar'') stands. Some ropes (the smaller ones) are played by hand, the bigger ropes are played by foot. The major part of the ropes (usually - all ropes) are not actually pulled, but rather pressed. Since one end of every rope is fixed, and the ropes are kept in tension, a press or even a punch on a rope makes a clapper strike the side of its bell.

The secrets of this technique have passed from generation to generation, but by the 20th century this art was almost lost. Training took place only at workshops until 2008, then the first permanent traditional bell-ringing school opened in Moscow, under the leadership of [[Drozdihin Ilya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvkultura.ru/news.html?id=267190&amp;cid=178 |title=Russia. The TV channel "Culture". The school bell ringers opens in Moscow |publisher=Tvkultura.ru |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No melody is employed, as in the Western [[carillon]], but rather a complicated polyrhythmical sequence of sounds is produced. "The foundation of Orthodox bell ringing lies not in melody but in rhythm, with its intrinsic dynamic, and in the interaction of the [[timbre]]s of [various] bells."&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt; These sequences have a very special [[harmony]], since Russian bells (unlike Western European ones) are not tuned to a single note.  Western bells usually have an [[octave]] between the loudest upper tone ("ring") and the loudest lower tone ("hum"). Russian bells have a [[Leading-tone|seventh]] between these sounds. Generally, a good Russian bell is tuned to produce a whole scale of sounds (up to several dozen of them). This effect is accomplished both by the composition of the [[alloy]] from which the bell is cast and the sculpting of the sides of the bell in the mold.

==Types of ringing==
[[Image:C0230-Old-Kstovo-church.jpg|thumb|A bell-ringer works the ropes on top of a small church in Old [[Kstovo]].]]

The Russian Orthodox [[typicon]] provides for different types of [[Campanology|bell ringing]]. Different ringing is used on different days (on working days, on Sunday, on holy days, during [[Fasting|fast]]s, [[Lent]], [[Easter]] etc.) Different ringing is required for different services (for morning service, service for the dead, [[Liturgy]], etc.). These differences are accomplished by ringing particular bells in particular ways.

===Terminology===
To understand the Russian Orthodox method of bell ringing, it is necessary to recognize a few items of terminology. The bells in an Orthodox bell tower (''zvonnitsa'') are organized into three groups:
* ''Zazvonny''— the smallest, or [[soprano]] bells.
* ''Podzvonny''— the middle, or [[alto]] bells.
* ''Blagovestnik''— the largest, or [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]] bells.

Within each of these three groups there may be several bells of varying size, all within the general range of the group. The larger the bell, the deeper its voice.

A ''zvon'' is a toll on any bell or bells.

A ''zvonar'' is a bell ringer. In the Orthodox church, this is a [[tonsure]]d (clerical) position, and there is a distinct service of the "Setting Apart of a Bell Ringer". The use of electric bells is forbidden in the Orthodox Church, because it is a sacred function, and may only be performed by a member of the church. Before he goes into the belltower, the zvonar will go to the priest (or the [[igumen]] if it is a [[monastery]]) for a [[blessing]] to ring the bells.

Different ringing is used at different moments of the service (before the service, during the most essential parts of the [[All-Night Vigil]] or [[Divine Liturgy]], while the departed is being carried to the [[cemetery]], etc.). Four kinds of canonical tolls are distinguished, which, rung separately or in combination, comprise all the diversity of Orthodox bell-ringing: ''Blagovest'', ''Perebor'', ''Perezvon'', and ''Trezvon''.

===Blagovest===
[[Image:Seattle - St. Nicholas Cathedral bells 02.jpg|thumb|left|Bells at St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Memorial Cathedral, [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].]]

The [[blagovest]] is the measured striking of a single large bell (called the ''blagovestnik''). Blagovest means "[[annunciation]]", or "[[Gospel|good news]]" because with this ringing the believers are notified that the [[Divine Service (Eastern Orthodoxy)|divine service]] is about to begin in the church.

As a separate toll before the beginning of a divine service, the blagovest commences
with three slow strokes (i.e., with rather long pauses between), and thereafter continues
with more frequent, measured strokes, sometimes ending with three more slow strokes. According to the Typikon, the blagovest should last for as long as it takes to read through [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]] ([[Septuagint]]; KJV: Psalm 119) once, or [[Psalm 51|Psalm 50]] (KJV: Psalm 51) twelve times.

Depending on the type of the divine service, the blagovest is classified as "regular"
(''obyknovenny'', i.e., fast and often accomplished by swinging the clapper to both sides of
the bell), or "Lenten" (''postny'', i.e., slow, and on only one side of the bell). On [[Great Feasts]] the blagovest is tolled on the largest blagovestnik in the tower and the toll as a rule is faster, louder, and longer.

Besides the normal blagovest, in Orthodox ringing there is another, named “[[tidal]]”
(''valovoy'') or "great" (''bolshoi''), when strokes on the largest blagovestnik are mixed with
tolls on another blagovestnik.

The Blagovest can be sounded on different bells, depending on the day. Large bell towers typically have five ''Blagovestniki'' (ranged from larger to smaller): 
*[[Great Feast|Festal]] or Triumphal (''Prazdnichny'' or ''Torzhestvenny'')
*[[Polyeleos]] (''Polyeleyny'')
*[[Lord's Day|Sunday]] (''Voskresny'')
*Daily or [[Feria]]l (''Budnichny'' or ''Prostodnevny'')
*Small or [[Great Lent|Lenten]] (''Maly'' or ''Postny'').

===Perebor===
The ''Perebor'' {{lang-ru|[[:ru:Перебор|Перебор]]}}) is the funeral zvon. Each individual bell is struck once, from the smallest to the largest, in a slow, steady peal. After that, all of the bells are struck together at the same time. Striking the bells from the smallest to the largest symbolizes the stages of a person’s life from birth to death; the final striking of all the bells together symbolizes the end of earthly life. During the perebor, each stroke of a bell should not be made until the sound of the previous bell has died away. The perebor may be repeated as many times as necessary, and is tolled as the body of the deceased is carried from the temple (church building) to the grave.

===Perezvon===
The ''Perezvon'' ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:Перезвон|Перезвон]]}}) is the striking of each of the bells, once or several times, from largest to the smallest, with a final stroke on all at once. The pattern may be repeated many times, but the final stroke on all bells is made only at the very end.

This peal symbolizes what the Orthodox Church holds to be the ''[[kenosis]]'' (self-emptying) of [[God the Son]] when he became [[incarnation (Christianity)|incarnate]] ({{bibleverse||Philippians|2:7-8|KJV}}), and is sounded only twice a year, on [[Great Friday]] and [[Great Saturday]] during those moments which recount Jesus' [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|death on the cross]] and his [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]].

===Trezvon===
[[File:Fort Ross Festival 2018-6075.jpg|thumb|Victor Avdienko, Bell Ringer &amp; Percussionist, San Francisco Symphony, ringing bells in front of the orthodox chapel at the [[Fort Ross]] Festival 2018, Sonoma County, California]]
The ''Trezvon'' (triple-peal) is the rhythmical ringing of multiple bells, using all the major groups of the bell scale. The trezvon is the most joyous of the various types of rings.  The order of ringing the different bells is not fixed, but may be composed by the bell-ringer himself and prompted by his creativity and self-expression. For the trezvon, the elaborate pattern is repeated three times, with a short pause between each repetition. All three groups of bells participate in the trezvon (soprano, alto, bass), and each group has its own part in the peal. Traditionally, the [[meter (music)|meter]] for a trezvon is 3/4 or 4/4. The largest bell which can participate in it is the blagovestnik which was used to ring the blagovest for the given service, or a smaller bell, but not a larger one.

The trezvon is usually rung in three stages: the ''beginning'', the ''zvon'' itself, and the ''finale''. The beginning usually consists of three slow tolls on the blagovestnik for that day, symbolizing the [[Holy Trinity]]. The main part of the trezvon, the zvon, is often performed in several movements— one, two, or three, often called “verses”— each of which is finished with one, two, or three chords (formed by striking several select bells at once), corresponding to the number of verses.  Each movement might have its own particular rhythm, dynamic, and composition. The trezvon is usually finished with three chords. The length of the
trezvon is normally the length of the time it takes to read of Psalm 50; but on more festive occasions it should be longer.

The ''Dvuzvon'' (double-peal) is the same as a Trezvon, except the pattern is repeated only twice instead of three times.

==Occasions==
The above types of zvons may be combined and rung at particular times during the same service, or used exclusively on certain occasions. The following are general guidelines, and cannot accommodate the full richness and diversity of the Russian Orthodox Church. There are also variations in local tradition.

*All-Night Vigil
*Divine Liturgy
*Holy Week and Pascha
*Feast days
*Funerals

'''Silvia Maciá''' (born 1972) is an American [[marine biologist]] and [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Barry University]] in [[Miami Shores, FL]].  Courses she has taught include [[marine biology]], [[oceanography]], [[marine ecosystems|tropical marine ecosystems]], [[ecology]], [[environmental science]] and [[botany]].

Her research interests include [[pipefish]] mating behavior, [[seagrass]] community ecology, [[coral reef]] grazing ecology and seagrass restoration. Her research involves both laboratory and field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barry.edu/biology/faculty/macia.html|title=Silvia Maciá, PhD : Faculty and Staff :  Biology : College of Arts and Sciences : Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida|website=www.barry.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciá is perhaps best noted for her discovery that [[Caribbean reef squid]] (''Sepioteuthis sepioidea'') can fly. She and her biologist husband Michael Robinson were boating on the north coast of [[Jamaica]] when she spotted something fly out of the water. She initially thought they were [[flying fish]] but after watching for a few seconds, she realized they were squid.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-squid-fly/|title=''Fact or Fiction: Can a Squid Fly Out of Water?''|author=Ferris Jabr|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7836">This is compilation of published '''[[detonation]] velocities''' for various high explosive compounds. Detonation velocity is the speed with which the detonation shock wave travels through the explosive. It is a key, directly measurable indicator of explosive performance, but depends on density which must always be specified, and may be too low if the test charge diameter is not large enough. Especially for little studied explosives there may be divergent published values due to charge diameter issues. In liquid explosives, like nitroglycerin, there may be two detonation velocities, one much higher than the other. The detonation velocity values presented here are typically for the highest practical density which maximizes achievable detonation velocity.&lt;ref name="Cooper1996"&gt;Cooper, Paul W. (1996). ''Explosives Engineering'', New York: Wiley-VCH.  {{ISBN|0-471-18636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The velocity of detonation is an important indicator for overall energy and power of detonation, and in particular for the [[brisance]] or shattering effect of an explosive which is due to the detonation pressure. The pressure can be calculated using Chapman-Jouguet theory from the velocity and density.

'''Telecanthus''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word "tele" (τῆλε) meaning far, and the [[Latin]] word [[canthus]], meaning either corner of the [[Human eye|eye]], where the [[eyelid]]s meet) refers to increased distance between the [[medial canthi]] of the eyes, while the [[inter-pupillary distance]] is normal. This is in contrast to [[hypertelorism]], where the inter-pupillary distance is increased.

The distance between the inner corner of the left eye and the inner corner of the right eye is called intercanthal distance. In most people, the intercanthal distance is equal to the distance between the inner corner and the outer corner of each eye, that is, the width of the eye. The average interpupillary distance is 60–62 millimeters (mm), which corresponds to an intercanthal distance of approximately 30–31 mm.&lt;ref name="ent"&gt;{{cite web|title="Resident Manual of Trauma to the Face, Head, and Neck, Ed. 1"|url=http://www.entnet.org/sites/default/files/Trauma-Chapter-3.pdf|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation where intercanthal distance is intensely bigger than the width of the eye is called telecanthus (tele= Greek τηλε = far, and Greek ακανθα = thorn). This can be an ethnic index or an indication for hypertelorism or [[hypotelorism]], if it is combined with abnormal relation to the interpupillary distance (A D STEAS).

''Traumatic Telecanthus'' refers to telcanthus resulting from traumatic injury to the [[nasal-orbital-ethmoid complex|nasal-orbital-ethmoid]] (NOE) complex. The diagnosis of traumatic telecanthus requires a measurement in excess of those normative values.  The pathology can be either unilateral or bilateral, with the former more difficult to measure.&lt;ref name="ent" /&gt;

== Systemic associations ==

Telecanthus is often associated with many congenital disorders. Congenital disorders such as [[Down syndrome]], [[fetal alcohol syndrome]], [[Cri du Chat syndrome]], [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Turner syndrome]], [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]] often present with prominent [[epicanthal fold]] and if these folds are nasal (most commonly are) they will cause telecanthus.{{fact|date=September 2016}}

"'''Time Enough at Last'''" is the eighth episode of the American [[television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. The episode was adapted from a short story written by [[Lynn Venable (writer)|Lynn Venable]] (pen name of Marilyn Venable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hill, Angela (''Oakland Tribune'')|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_22263716/give-em-hill-twilight-zone-el-cerrito-author|title=Give 'Em Hill: El Cerrito woman lends 'Twilight Zone' inspiration|work= San Jose Mercury News|date=December 30, 2012|accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short story appeared in the January 1953 edition of the [[science fiction]] [[magazine]] ''[[If (magazine)|If: Worlds of Science Fiction]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Venable, Lynn|title=Time Enough at Last|work=IF: Worlds of Science Fiction|url=https://archive.org/details/If_Worlds_Of_Science_Fiction_v01n06_Quinn_Jan_1953_Gorgon776 |date=January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Venable, Lynn|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/32633 |title=Time Enough at Last|work=IF: Worlds of Science Fiction|date=January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  about seven years before the television episode first aired. "Time Enough at Last" became one of the most famous episodes of the original ''Twilight Zone'' and has been frequently parodied since. It is "the story of a man who seeks salvation in the rubble of a ruined world"&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;[[Rod Serling|Serling, Rod]]. Promotional spot for "Time Enough at Last". Original airdate: 13 November 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; and tells of Henry Bemis {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|m|ɪ|s}}, played by [[Burgess Meredith]], who loves [[book]]s, yet is surrounded by those who would prevent him from reading them. The episode follows Bemis through the [[post-apocalyptic]] [[world]], touching on such social issues as [[anti-intellectualism]], the dangers of reliance upon [[technology]], and the difference between aloneness (solitude) and loneliness.

==Opening narration==
{{quote|Witness Mr. Henry Bemis, a charter member in the fraternity of dreamers. A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page, but who is conspired against by a bank president and a wife and a world full of tongue-cluckers and the unrelenting hands of a clock. But in just a moment, Mr. Bemis will enter a world without bank presidents or wives or clocks or anything else. He'll have a world all to himself... without anyone.}}

==Plot==
Henpecked, [[Far sightedness|far sighted]] [[bank teller]] and avid [[Bibliophile|bookworm]] Henry Bemis (Meredith) works at his window in a [[bank]], while reading ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', which causes him to shortchange an annoyed customer. Bemis's angry boss (Taylor), and later his nagging wife (deWit), both complain to him that he wastes far too much time reading "[[wiktionary:doggerel|doggerel]]." As a cruel joke, his wife asks him to read [[poetry]] from one of his books to her; he eagerly obliges, only to find that she has inked over the text on every page, obscuring the words. Seconds later, she destroys the book by ripping the pages from it, much to Henry's dismay.

The next day, as usual, Henry takes his lunch break in the bank's [[bank vault|vault]], where his reading will not be disturbed. Moments after he sees a newspaper headline, which reads "[[Teller-Ulam design|H-Bomb]] Capable of Total Destruction," an enormous explosion outside the bank violently shakes the vault, knocking Bemis unconscious. After regaining consciousness and recovering the thick glasses required for him to see, Bemis emerges from the vault to find the bank demolished and everyone in it dead. Leaving the bank, he sees that the entire city has been destroyed, and realizes that a nuclear war has devastated Earth, but that his being in the vault has saved him.

{{quote|Seconds, minutes, hours. They crawl by on hands and knees for Mr. Henry Bemis, who looks for a spark in the ashes of a dead world. A telephone connected to nothingness. A neighborhood bar, a movie, a baseball diamond, a hardware store, the mailbox of what was once his house and is now a rubble. They lie at his feet as battered monuments to what was, but is no more.  Mr. Henry Bemis on an eight-hour tour of a graveyard.}}

Finding himself totally alone in a shattered world with food to last him a lifetime (but no one to share it with) and no means of leaving to look for other survivors, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a [[revolver]] he has found, Bemis sees the ruins of the public [[library]] in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) realizes that he has all the time in the world to read them without interruption.

His despair gone, Bemis contentedly sorts the books he looks forward to reading for years to come, with no obligations to get in the way. Just as he bends down to pick up the first book, he stumbles, and his glasses fall off and shatter. In shock, he picks up the broken remains of the glasses he is virtually [[blindness|blind]] without, and says, "That's not fair. That's not fair at all. There was time now. There was—was all the time I needed…! It's not fair!  It's not fair!" and bursts into tears, surrounded by books he now can never read.

==Closing narration==
{{quote|The best laid plans of mice and men... and Henry Bemis... the small man in the glasses who wanted nothing but time. Henry Bemis, now just a part of a smashed landscape, just a piece of the rubble, just a fragment of what man has deeded to himself. Mr. Henry Bemis... in the Twilight Zone.}}

The closing narration was a sort of nod to Burgess Meredith's acting credits, as he was the lead in the 1939 movie ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]''.

==Production==
[[File:Burgess Meredith The Twilight Zone.jpg|thumb|Burgess Meredith as Henry Bemis]]
"Time Enough at Last" was one of the first episodes written for ''The Twilight Zone''.&lt;ref name="mp3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook35278.htm |title=Time Enough At Last: Twilight Zone Story read by Bill Mills |publisher=Fictionwise eBooks |accessdate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203030/http://ebooks.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook35278.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It introduced [[Burgess Meredith]] to the series; he went on to star in three more episodes, being introduced as "no stranger to ''The Twilight Zone''" in promotional spots for season two's "[[The Obsolete Man]]". He also narrated for the 1983 film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'', which made reference to "Time Enough at Last" during its opening sequence, with the characters discussing the episode in detail.

Footage of the exterior steps of the library was filmed several months after production had been completed. These steps can also be seen on the exterior of an [[Eloi]] public building in [[MGM]]'s 1960 version of ''[[The Time Machine (1960 film)|The Time Machine]]''.&lt;ref name="zicree"&gt;Zicree, Marc Scott. ''The Twilight Zone Companion''. Sillman-James Press, 1982 (second edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brahm]] was nominated for a [[Directors Guild of America|Directors Guild]] award for his work on the episode.&lt;ref name="Directors Guild of AmeriCa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dga.org/Awards/Explore.aspx|title=Directors Guild of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book that Bemis was reading in the vault and that flips open when the bomb explodes is ''[[A History of the Life and Voyages of Christopher Columbus]]'' by [[Washington Irving]].

==Themes==
[[Image:Time Enough themes.jpg|thumb|left|Humanity's propensity for destruction and [[suicide]] are among the episode's themes.]]
Although the overriding message may seem to "be careful what you wish for, you just might get it", there are other themes throughout the episode as well.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt; Paramount among these is the question of solitude versus loneliness, as embodied by Bemis' moment of near-suicide. Additionally, the portrayal of societal attitudes towards books speaks to the contemporary decline of traditional literature and how, given enough time, reading may become a relic of the past.&lt;ref name="ochse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.storytellersunplugged.com/2006/03/end-of-books-bemis-condition.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506100624/http://www.storytellersunplugged.com/2006/03/end-of-books-bemis-condition.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-06 |author=Weston Ochse |title=The End of Books: The Bemis Condition |work=Storytellers Unplugged |accessdate=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarris"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarris, Andrew|title=Rod Serling: Viewed from Beyond the Twilight Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the ending "punishes Bemis for his antisocial behavior, and his greatest desire is thwarted".&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanyard, Stewart T.  |author2=Gaiman, Neil |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Dimensions Behind the Twilight Zone: A Backstage Tribute to Television's Groundbreaking Series|publisher= Ecw Press|date= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rod Serling]]'s concluding statement in the episode alludes to [[Robert Burns]]' [[Scots language]] poem "[[To a Mouse]]." The poem concludes: "The best-laid schemes o' mice an men / ''Gang aft agley''" (translation: "Often go awry").

Although "Time Enough at Last" implies that [[nuclear warfare]] has destroyed humanity, [[film criticism|film critic]] [[Andrew Sarris]] notes that the episode's necessarily unrealistic format may have been what allowed its production to commence:&lt;ref name="sarris" /&gt;

{{quote|Much of the implacable seriousness of ''The Twilight Zone'' is seemingly keyed by the clipped, dour delivery of Serling himself and the interlocutor. He never encourages us to laugh, or even smile, even when the plot twist is at least darkly funny. For example, in 'Time Enough at Last' ... The [[Nuclear weapon|H-bomb]] is still lurking in the background of the bookworm's 'accident.' The point is that the bomb could never have gone off on network television were the plot couched in a more realistic format.}}

In the era of the [[Internet]] and [[eBook]]s, the irony depicted in "Time Enough at Last" has an [[information age]] counterpart, according to [[Weston Ochse]] of ''Storytellers Unplugged''. As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has time to read, with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be "only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis at the end of the world"—that is, a [[power outage]] has the potential to give them time to read, yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books—namely the [[computer]].&lt;ref name="ochse" /&gt;

===Similar episodes===
''The Twilight Zone'' often explored similar themes throughout its run.&lt;ref name="nostalgia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/television/drama/twilightzone.htm |title=The Twilight Zone |work=Nostalgia Central }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Time Enough at Last" has strong thematic ties to a number of other episodes in the series, starting with that of isolation, first explored in the series [[Television pilot|pilot]], "[[Where Is Everybody?]]".  It is also a prominent theme in the previous episode "[[The Lonely (The Twilight Zone)|The Lonely]]". Additionally, in a plot very similar to that of "Time Enough at Last", "[[The Mind and the Matter]]" tells of a man who uses his mind to erase humanity, only to find that  existence without other people is unbearable. The notion of being an outsider, lost in a sea of [[conformity]], was one of the most common themes of the series.&lt;ref name="zicree" /&gt;

Other thematic elements in this episode can be found throughout the series, as well. "[[The Obsolete Man]]" takes the episode's literary subtext—the notion that reading may eventually be considered "obsolete"—to an extreme: The state has declared books obsolete and a librarian (also played by Meredith) finds himself on trial for his own [[obsolescence]]. This notion, akin to [[Ray Bradbury]]'s short story "[[The Pedestrian]]" (1951), is also alluded to in the episode "[[Number 12 Looks Just Like You]]", in which a perfect and equal world contradictorily considers works like those of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] "smut".&lt;ref name="backstage" /&gt;

===Comics===
The comic book version of ''The Simpsons'', ''Simpsons Comics'', published a story called "The Last Fat Man", based partially on "Time Enough at Last", and includes a short scene where [[Homer Simpson]] shoos a bespectacled man who is reading a book out of a nuclear bunker so he can eat in it, unintentionally taking shelter in it.

*Episode 12 of [[Revolution (TV series)|''Revolution'']], titled "Ghosts", has Jim Hudson's character who goes by the name of Henry Bemis. Henry (Jim) has become the town librarian, until Miles convinces him to help the rebels and go back to his real name.
*The line, "Seconds, minutes, hours, they crawl by on hands and knees" was referenced to in ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' Season 2 episode, "Speed Demon", where the villain, HIM, torments the Powerpuff Girls before revealing that they have unknowingly arrived 50 years into the future, landing in a Townsville that HIM now controls.
*In the season 14 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Strong Arms of the Ma]]", a postman is accidentally trapped under a car in front of the Simpson house. He intends to read ''The Twilight Zone Magazine'' but discovers that his glasses were broken in the accident while the ''Twilight Zone'' main-theme music is heard in the background.
*''The Scary Door'', a [[show-within-a-show]] on ''[[Futurama]]'' parodying ''The Twilight Zone'', pokes fun at the final twist in "Time Enough at Last". When the man in the episode loses his glasses, he realizes he can still read large print since his eyesight is not as bad as he perceived; his eyes fall out, but he declares he can read [[Braille]]; his hands fall off, and as he screams, his tongue falls out and then his head falls off. [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] comments, "Cursed by his own [[hubris]]."
*The ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Wasted Talent]]" features an end scene similar to the ending of "Time Enough At Last". In the ''Family Guy'' version, a lone brain cell discovers it is the last of its kind (as Peter drank so much alcohol throughout the episode that Brian worries that Peter may have killed his brain cells), and with a book in hand and stacks of other books surrounding him, prepares to begin reading, but looks down and his glasses shatter, after which, dismayed, he picks them up and says " No! It's not fair! There was finally going to be TIME!...", much like what happens to Mr. Bemis.
*The closing credits of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', season 5, episode 1, "Y2K, You're OK", include a parody of the final scene, where Drew is left alone in his bomb shelter with his "literature", in this case pornographic magazines, after the nuclear explosion, only to have his glasses break in the same manner, whereupon he repeated the final lines from Burgess Meredith.
*In the ''[[Fear the Walking Dead]]'' episode "Buried" (Season 4, Episode 4), Nick and Luciana are scavenging in an abandoned library when they see, amid a trail of bloodied books on the floor, a pair of broken spectacles that resemble those belonging to Henry Bemis in "Time Enough At Last." Nearby, they see a zombie who, as a human, had slashed his own wrists, presumably because he could no longer read once his glasses broke.

{{In line citation|date=April 2017}}[[Image:Solfege Ireland.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|Solfège table in an Irish classroom]]

'''Tonic sol-fa''' (or '''tonic sol-fah''') is a pedagogical technique for teaching sight-singing, invented by [[Sarah Ann Glover]] (1785–1867) of Norwich, England and popularised by [[John Curwen]] who adapted it from a number of earlier musical systems. It uses a system of musical notation based on movable do [[solfège]], whereby every tone is given a name according to its relationship with other tones in the key: the usual staff notation is replaced with anglicized solfège syllables (e.g. ''do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do'') or their abbreviations (''d, r, m, f, s, l, t, d''). "''Do''" is chosen to be the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] of whatever key is being used (thus the terminology ''moveable Do''). The original solfège sequence started with "Ut" which later became "Do".

==Overview==
Glover developed her method in Norwich from 1812 resulting in the "Norwich Sol-fa Ladder" which she used to teach children to sing. She published her work in the ''Manual of the Norwich Sol-fa System'' (1845) and ''Tetrachordal System'' (1850) &lt;ref&gt;Harris, Clement Antrobus. "The War between the Fixed and Movable Doh." The Musical Quarterly 4, no. 2 (1918): 184-95. https://www.jstor.org/stable/738052.&lt;/ref&gt;

Curwen was commissioned by a conference of [[Sunday school]] teachers in 1841 to find and promote a 
way of teaching music for Sunday school singing. He took elements of the Norwich Sol-fa and other techniques later adding hand signals. It was intended that his method could teach singing initially from the Sol-fa and then a transition to [[staff notation]].

Curwen brought out his ''Grammar of Vocal Music'' in 1843, and in 1853 started the Tonic Sol-Fa Association. The ''Standard Course of Lessons on the Tonic Sol-fa Method of Teaching to Sing'' was published in 1858.

In 1872, Curwen changed his former course of using the Sol-fa system as an aid to sight reading, when that edition of his ''Standard Course of Lessons'' excluded the staff and relied solely on Tonic Sol-fa.

In 1879 the Tonic Sol-Fa College was opened. Curwen also began publishing, and brought out a periodical called the ''Tonic Sol-fa Reporter and Magazine of Vocal Music for the People'', and in his later life was occupied in directing the spreading organisation of his system. The Sol-fa system was widely adopted for use in education, as an easily teachable method in the reading of music at sight, but its more ambitious aims for providing a superior method of musical notation have not been generally adopted.

By the end of the nineteenth century, this notation was very widespread in Britain, and it became standard practice to sell sheet music (for popular songs) with the tonic sol-fa notation included.

Some of the roots of ''tonic sol-fa'' may be found in items such as
* the use of syllables in the 11th century by the monk [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido de Arezzo]]
* the cipher notation proposed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in France in 1746,
* its further development by [[Pierre Galin]] and popularization by [[Aimé Paris]] and [[Emile Chevé]], and
* the ''Norwich sol-fa'' of [[Sarah Ann Glover]] of England. Reverend [[John Curwen]] (1816–1880) was instrumental in the development of tonic sol-fa in England, and was chiefly responsible for its popularity. [[Image:Curwen Hand Signs MT.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Curwen's Solfege hand signs. This version includes the tonal tendencies and interesting titles for each tone.]]

When John Windet printed the 1594 edition of the ''Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter'', he added the initials of the six syllables of Guido (''U, R, M, F, S, L'') underneath the note. Windet explained, "...I have caused a new print of note to be made with letter to be joined to every note: whereby thou mayest know how to call every note by his right name, so that with a very little diligence thou mayest more easilie by the viewing of these letters, come to the knowledge of perfect solfeying..." Rousseau, Curwen and others would have been aware of this popular [[psalter]].

[[Benjamin Carl Unseld|B. C. Unseld]] and [[Theodore F. Seward]], with Biglow and Main publishers, imported Curwen's ''tonic sol-fa'' to the United States, though the method was never widely received. Before this, the 9th edition of the ''[[Bay Psalm Book]]'' (Boston, USA) had appeared with the initials of four-note syllables (''fa, sol, la, me'') underneath the staff. Reverend [[John Tufts (music educator)|John Tufts]], in his ''An Introduction to the Singing of Psalm Tunes in a Plaine &amp; Easy Method'', moved the initials of the four-note syllables onto the staff in place of "regular notes", and indicated rhythm by punctuation marks to the right of the letters. These may be considered American forerunners of Curwen's system, though he may not have been aware of them. Tufts' ''Introduction'' was popular, going through several editions. Nevertheless, his work probably did more to pave the way for [[shape note]]s. When Unseld and Steward introduced tonic sol-fa in the late 1800s, it was considered "something new".

In 1972 [[Roberto Goitre]] printed one of the most important modern versions of the method in ''Cantar Leggendo'' with the ''moveable Do''.

[[Solmization]] that represents the functions of pitches (such as tonic sol-fa) is called "functional" solmization.  All musicians that use functional solmization use "do" to represent the tonic (also known as the "keynote") in the major mode.  However, approaches to the minor mode fall into two camps.  Some musicians use "do" to represent the tonic in minor (a parallel approach), whereas others prefer to label the tonic in minor as "la" (a relative approach)  Both systems have their advantages: The former system more directly represents the scale-degree functions of the pitches in a key; the latter more directly represents the intervals between pitches in any given key signature.

==Notation==
In Curwen's system, the notes of the major scale (of any [[key (music)|key]]) are notated with the single letters d, r, m, f, s, l, and t. For notes above the principal octave, an [[apostrophe]] follows the letter; notes below the principal octave have a subscript mark. [[Chromaticism|Chromatic]] alterations are marked by the following vowel, "e" for [[sharp (music)|sharp]] (pronounced "ee") and "a" for [[flat (music)|flat]] (pronounced "aw").&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Tonic sol-fa|author=Bernarr Rainbow and Charles Edward McGuire|accessdate=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ascending and descending [[chromatic scale]] is notated:
 d de r re m f fe s se l le t d'
 d' t ta l la s sa f m ma r ra d

Such chromatic notes appear only as [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] or as preparation for a [[modulation (music)|modulation]]; once the music has modulated, then the names for the new key are used. The modulation itself is marked by [[superscript]] of the old note name preceding its new name; for example, in modulation to the [[dominant (music)|dominant]], the new tonic is notated as &lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;d. The music then proceeds in the new key until another modulation is notated.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Minor keys use l (la) as the tonic. The ascending sixth scale degree in [[melodic minor]] is noted as ba (pronounced "bay") instead of fe, which is reserved for the sharp f of the major scale.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

Rhythms are notated with [[bar line]]s (used as in [[staff notation]]) and colons designating beats within the measure. [[Time signature]]s and [[rest (music)|rests]] are not used.&lt;ref name="Grove"/&gt;

== Examples ==
* The beginning of the "Conversation" towards the end of the [[Steven Spielberg]] motion picture ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' uses both verbal and hand signals.

In domains of [[physics]] and [[electrical engineering]], the '''Universal Dielectric Response''', or '''UDR''', refers to the observed emergent behaviour  of the [[dielectric]] properties exhibited by diverse solid state systems. In particular this widely observed response involves power law scaling of dielectric properties with [[frequency]] under conditions of [[alternating current]], AC. First defined in a landmark article by [[A. K. Jonscher]] in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The 'universal'dielectric response| journal= Nature| year=1977| volume=267| issue=5613| page=673| bibcode=1977Natur.267..673J| doi=10.1038/267673a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the origins of the UDR were attributed to the dominance many-body interactions in systems, and their analogous RC network equivalence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Jonscher| first1= Andrew K.| title= The universal dielectric response and its physical significance| journal= ." IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation| year=1992| volume=27| issue=3| page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Dielectric Response manifests in the variation of AC Conductivity with frequency and is most often observed in complex systems consisting of multiple phases of similar or dissimilar materials. Such systems, which can be called heterogenous or composite materials, can be described from a dielectric perspective as a large network consisting of resistor and capacitor elements, known also as an [[RC circuit|RC network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=McCullen | first1= Nicholas J. | title= The robustness of the emergent scaling property of random RC network models of complex materials | journal= . Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics  | year=2009 | volume=42 | issue=6
| page=064001| bibcode= 2009JPhD...42f4001M | doi= 10.1088/0022-3727/42/6/064001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At low and high frequencies, the dielectric response of heterogeneous materials is governed by percolation pathways. If a heterogeneous material is represented by a network in which more than 50% of the elements are capacitors, [[percolation]] through capacitor elements will occur. This percolation results in conductivity at high and low frequencies that is directly proportional to frequency. Conversely, if the fraction of capacitor elements in the representative RC network (P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) is lower than 0.5, dielectric behavior at low and high frequency regimes is independent of frequency. At intermediate frequencies, a very broad range of heterogeneous materials show a well-defined emergent region, in which power law correlation of [[admittance]] to frequency is observed. The power law emergent region is they key feature of the UDR. In materials or systems exhibiting UDR, the overall dielectric response from high to low frequencies is symmetrical, being centered at the middle point of the emergent region, which occurs in equivalent RC networks at a frequency of :&lt;math&gt;\omega = (RC)^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;. In the power law emergent region, the  admittance of the overall system follows the general power law proportionality &lt;math&gt; Y\propto\omega^{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt;, where the power law exponent α can be approximated to the fraction of capacitors in the equivalent RC network of the system α≅P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Universality of the emergent scaling in finite random binary percolation networks| journal= PLOS One | year=2017 | volume=12 |issue=2 | pages= e0172298| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0172298| pmid= 28207872 | pmc= 5312937 | last1= Zhai | first1= C | last2= et al | bibcode= 2017PLoSO..1272298Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of the UDR ==
The power law scaling of dielectric properties with frequency is valuable in interpreting [[impedance spectroscopy]] data towards the characterisation of responses in emerging [[ferroelectric]] and [[multiferroic]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=MacDonald | first1= J.R.| title= Generalizations of ''universal dielectric response''and a general distribution‐of‐activation‐energies model for dielectric and conducting systems| journal= Journal of Applied Physics| year=1985| volume=58| issue=5| page=1971| bibcode=1985JAP....58.1971M| doi=10.1063/1.336004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1= Pattanayak | first1= Samita| title= Generalizations of ''Effect of Dy-substitution on structural, electrical and magnetic properties of multiferroic BiFeO3 ceramics| journal= Ceramics International | year=2014| volume=40| issue=6| page=7983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vensim''' is [[simulation software]] developed by Ventana Systems. It primarily supports [[continuous simulation]] ([[System Dynamics|system dynamics]]), with some [[Discrete event simulation|discrete event]] and [[agent-based model]]ling capabilities. It is available commercially and as a free "Personal Learning Edition".

== Modeling environment ==

Vensim provides a graphical modeling interface with [[stock and flow]] and [[causal loop diagram]]s, on top of a text-based system of equations in a [[declarative programming]] language. It includes a patented method for interactive tracing of behavior through causal links in model structure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vensim.com/causal-tracing/|title=Vensim Causal Tracing™|website=Vensim - Ventana Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/EP0527907A1?cl=en&amp;dq=causal+tracing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVhI3i2ZbOAhWLKCYKHbilAGkQ6AEIHjAA|title=Simulation system employing causal tracing. US Patent Application EP19910909851, Feb. 26 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patents.justia.com/patent/5428740|title=Applying successive data group operations to an active data group. Patent # 5,428,740|website=Justitia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a language extension for automating quality control experiments on models called Reality Check.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sdr.4260100205/pdf|title=Reality check: A bridge between systems thinking and system dynamics|first1=David W.|last1=Peterson|first2=Robert L.|last2=Eberlein|journal=System Dynamics Review|volume=10|issue=2–3|pages=159–174|year=1994|doi=10.1002/sdr.4260100205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modeling language supports arrays (subscripts) and permits mapping among dimensions and aggregation. Built-in allocation functions satisfy constraints that are sometimes not met by conventional approaches like [[logit]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://vensim.com/allocation-by-priority-alloc-p/ Vensim Allocation by Priority]&lt;/ref&gt; It supports discrete delays, queues and a variety of stochastic processes.

There are multiple paths for cross sectional and time-series data import and export, including text files, spreadsheets and ODBC. Models may be calibrated against data using optimization, [[Kalman Filter]]ing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/27424|title=Hypothesis, estimation, and validation of dynamic social models : energy demand modeling|last1=Peterson|first1=David Walter|year=1975|type=Ph.D.|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods. Sensitivity analysis options provide a variety of ways to test and sample models, including Monte Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling.

Vensim model files can be packaged and published in a customizable read-only format that can be executed by a freely available Model Reader. This allows sharing of interactive models with users who do not own the program and/or who the model author does not wish to have access to the model's code base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/|title=Vensim Model Reader|website=Vensim - Ventana Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;
