The '''1966 flood of the Arno''' ({{lang-it|Alluvione di Firenze del 4 novembre 1966}}) in [[Florence]] killed 101 people and damaged or destroyed millions of masterpieces of art and rare books. It is considered the worst [[flood]] in the city's history since 1557. With the combined effort of Italian and foreign volunteers alike, or ''angeli del fango'' ("Mud Angels"), many of these fine works have been restored. New methods in [[Art conservation|conservation]] were devised and [[Art conservation and restoration|restoration]] laboratories established. However, even decades later, much work remains to be done.

== Overview ==
Located in the [[Tuscany]] region of [[Central Italy]], the [[Arno]] river is approximately {{convert|240|km|mi}} long.  It flows from the Mount Falterona hills of the [[Apennine Mountains]] to the [[Ligurian Sea]], just {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} west of [[Pisa]].  Lush vineyards and olive groves line the river's scenic course to the west, out to sea. Principally utilized for [[irrigation]] purposes, only {{convert|32|km|mi}} of the river is used for navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia | year=2007 | url=http://gme.grolier.com/cgi-bin/article?assetid=0017000-0 | accessdate =23 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Arno River | encyclopedia=The World Book Encyclopedia | volume=1 | publisher=World Book, Inc. | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest flows of the river generally occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the [[orography]] of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the [[floodplain]] with great force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florence Floods: 4 November 1966 | journal=The Geographical Journal | date=June 1967 | volume=133 | issue=2 | pages=277–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline of events ==
[[File:1966 Arno Florence flood 2008.JPG|thumb|Square in Florence with a white [[high water mark]] of the 1966 flood. At this point the marker is about {{convert|4|m|ft}} high.]]

===3 November===

* After a long period of steady rain, the Levane and La Penna dams in Valdarno began to discharge more than {{convert|2000|m3|cuft}} of water per second toward Florence.
* At 14:30, the Civil Engineering Department reported "'an exceptional quantity of water.'"
* Cellars in the [[Florence#Subdivisions|Santa Croce]] and San Frediano areas began to flood.
* Police received calls for assistance from villagers up the Arno Valley.
* The flood's first victim, a 52-year-old worker, died at the Anconella [[Water purification|water treatment plant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===4 November 1966===

* At 04:00, engineers, fearing that the Valdarno dam would burst, discharged a mass of water that eventually reached the outskirts of Florence at a rate of {{convert|60|km/h}}.
* At 07:26, the Lungarno delle Grazie cut off gas, electricity and water supplies to affected areas.
* By 08:00, army barracks were flooded.
* By 09:00, hospital emergency generators (the only source of electrical power remaining) failed.
* Landslides obstructed roads leading to Florence, while narrow streets within city limits funneled floodwaters, increasing their height and velocity.
* By 09:45, the [[Piazza del Duomo, Florence|Piazza del Duomo]] was flooded.
* The powerful waters ruptured central heating oil tanks, and the oil mixed with the water and mud, causing greater damage.
* Florence was divided in two, and officials were unable to immediately reach citizens of the city past the Piazza Michelangelo.
* At its highest, the water reached over {{convert|6.7|m|ft}} in the Santa Croce area.
* By 20:00, the water began to lower.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clarkson, Christopher | title = The Florence Flood of November 1966 &amp; Its Aftermath | year = 2003 | url = http://www.ndl.go.jp/en/publication/ndl_newsletter/135/lecture1_135_353.pdf | format = PDF

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
The flood has had a lasting impact on Florence, economically and culturally. City officials and citizens were unprepared for the storm and the widespread devastation that it caused. There were virtually no emergency measures in place, at least partially because Florence is located in an area where the frequency of flooding is relatively low. In fact, approximately 90% of the city's population were completely unaware of the imminent disaster.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Residents were set to celebrate their country's World War I victory over [[Austria]] on 4 November, [[Armed Forces Day#Italy|Armed Forces Day]]. In commemoration, businesses were closed and many of their employees were out of town for the public holiday. While many lives were likely spared as a result, the locked buildings greatly inhibited the salvaging of valuable materials from numerous institutions and shops, with the exception of a number of jewellery stores whose owners were warned by their nightwatchmen.

5,000 families were left homeless by the storm, and 6,000 stores were forced out of business.  Approximately 600,000 tons of mud, rubble and sewage severely damaged or destroyed numerous collections of books, manuscripts and fine art. In fact, it is estimated that between 3 and 4 million books and manuscripts were damaged, as well as 14,000 movable works of art.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

Artist [[Marco Sassone]], in a 1969 interview, recalled the impact of the flood on Florence's residents: "The only thing you could do was watch and be helpless. Nature was master...the women became crazy with fear. They began throwing things from the windows and screaming 'who is going to save my children?'" It was reported that 101 people lost their lives in the flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Phyllis. County Artist Relives Florence Disaster. The Register, Sunday 2 November 1969, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collections affected===
* Archives of the Opera del [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] (Archivio di Opera del Duomo): 6,000 volumes of documents and 55 illuminated manuscripts were damaged.
* [[Gabinetto Vieusseux|Gabinetto Vieusseux Library]] (Biblioteca del Gabinetto Vieusseux): All 250,000 volumes were damaged, including titles of romantic literature and Risorgimento history; submerged in water, they became swollen and distorted. Pages, separated from their text blocks, were found pressed upon the walls and ceiling of the building.
* [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library]] (Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze): Located alongside the Arno, the National Library was cut off from the rest of the city by the flood. 1,300,000 items (a third of their holdings) were damaged, including prints, maps, posters, newspapers and a majority of works in the Palatine and Magliabechi collections.
* The State Archives ([[Archivio di Stato di Firenze|Archivio di Stato]]): Roughly 40% of the collection was damaged, including property and financial records; birth, marriage and death records; judicial and administrative documents; and police records, among others.

== Funding and assistance ==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--most of section has no citations--&gt;
Realizing the immense wealth and importance of Florentine culture in a global context, many individuals and organizations contributed to the conservation mission, providing both funding and manpower. Art historian and professor Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti assembled a committee with [[List of mayors of Florence|Mayor Piero Bargellini]] as chairman to raise awareness of the needs of Florence's art and academic institutions. Members included prominent figures from around the world, representatives of their own respective institutions.

A number of other international committees were formed with the intention of sponsoring various institutions in Florence:
* The Franco-Italian Committee aided the Church of Santa Maria Maddalena di Pazzi in Borgo Pinti.
* The U.S. Committee to Rescue Italian Art, composed of 25 sub-committees and chaired by [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis]], assisted in restoring frescoes around the city.
* The Viennese armory was responsible for restoring the arms and armor of the [[Bargello]] Museum.
* A Dutch committee sponsored the Buonarroti House Museum.
* A group of Germans repaired the musical instruments of the Bardini Museum.
The work of and contributions made by these committees were supervised by a central committee in Rome.

Additional funding came from various governments, [[UNESCO]], and the International Committee for the Assistance of Museums, Works of Art, Libraries and Archives, among others.  The city of [[Edinburgh]] (Scotland), twinned with Florence, sent practical help for the citizens in the form of double-decker buses to temporarily replace those which had been lost in the floods.  When these eventually returned home, they operated with the international 'GB' registration plate still affixed to the rear; each also carried a small plaque presented by the Florentine transport authorities indicating their gratitude for the gesture made by the people of Edinburgh.

Charity auctions were also organised. In a show of support for the Florentine art community, [[Pablo Picasso]] had one of his paintings, ''Recumbent Woman Reading'', auctioned off on an internationally televised programme. He donated the $105,000 it earned to restoration efforts in Italy. Similarly, [[Pietro Annigoni]] and [[Luciano Guarnieri]] donated the money they earned from selling 575 colour [[lithographs]] (depicting the events surrounding the flood and its aftermath), produced from 13 of their drawings.

Florentine native [[Franco Zeffirelli]] produced the short documentary ''[[Florence: Days of Destruction]]'' to raise awareness of the flood. Released a month after the disaster, it reputedly raised more than $20 million for reconstruction efforts.&lt;ref name='NGA'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |title=National Gallery of Art - Videos and Podcasts, December 2011 |publisher=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=29 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201205345/http://www.nga.gov/podcasts/lectures/2011.shtm |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was narrated in English and Italian by actor [[Richard Burton]].&lt;ref name='DukeLib'&gt;{{cite web| url=https://blogs.library.duke.edu/preservation/2012/02/15/florence-days-of-destruction-a-film-by-franco-zeffirelli/|title=Preservation Underground - Florence: Days of Destruction (A Film by Franco Zeffirelli)|publisher=Duke University Library|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many institutions from around the world financially compensated employees who travelled to Italy and aided in the restoration of Florence, many others volunteered their services for absolutely no pay. Collectively, these people have been fondly referred to as "Mud Angels", due to their commitment to working in such deplorable conditions.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967"&gt;{{cite book | last=Batini | first=Giorgio | title=4 November 1966: The River Arno in the Museums of Florence:Galleries, Monuments, Churches, Libraries, Archives and Masterpieces Damaged by the Flood | year=1967 | publisher=Bonechi | location=Florence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Thorough flood... | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=November 1986 | volume=128 | issue=1004 | page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "Mud Angels"===
[[List of mayors of Florence|Mario Primicerio]], the mayor of Florence from 1995 to 1999, helped celebrate the Mud Angels' (''angeli del fango'') efforts during an anniversary celebration in 1996. Thirty years earlier, he was a professor who lent his assistance in preserving the priceless artefacts of Florence. The Angels cleaned the city of refuse, mud and oil, and retrieved works of art, books and other materials from flooded rooms; experts from around the world volunteered their time and knowledge in the conservation of the aforementioned materials.

In a 1996 interview, Primicerio offered three principal reasons as to why the Mud Angels felt compelled to help: a concern for future generations, a feeling of international unity and a pervasive sense of solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first=Mario |last=Primicerio |url=http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |title=We are really delighted to invite the Mud Angels to Florence: Interview with Mario Primicerio, the Mayor of Florence |year=1996 |accessdate=21 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217085124/http://www.mega.it/allu/eng/intventt.htm |archivedate=17 February 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|What we were doing was dictated by the desire to give back the traces of the history of the past to future generations, so that it could be used for the spiritual growth of people who perhaps had yet to be born...it was the international community that worked to try to save Florence, this unique patrimony which belonged to the whole world.|Mario Primicerio|Speciale Alluvione}}

===The "Flood Ladies"===
The [[Flood Ladies]] were a group of international female artists who contributed artworks to the city of Florence following the catastrophic 1966 flood of the Arno as a sign of solidarity and to help repair the psychological damage done by the flood. The group was formed in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] in 1966. Contributors to the collection lived all over the world. In 2014 the organization Advancing Women Artist Foundation headed an effort to preserve, exhibit and acknowledge the contribution of these women.

== Conservation measures ==
Many experts in the field of conservation, such as [[Peter Waters]], utilised their knowledge in restoring the works of art and literature ravaged by the flood. Staff from the Central Institute of Restoration and Institute of Book Pathology, for example, volunteered their time, efforts, and expertise in this enormous undertaking. New concepts, such as "phased conservation," and methods in conservation, such as mass deacidification, were conceived during this period after the flood ravaged the city of Florence.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Cities and Disaster: The Florence Flood of 1966 | url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| accessdate =5 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070517215628/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/c-d/cities06.html| archivedate= 17 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and records===
Priorities were established during the process of conserving damaged books and records, the most critical of which became the retrieval of materials from flooded rooms. After they were rescued, books and records were typically washed and disinfected. In certain cases, [[Bookbinding|bindings]] were cut and sheets treated individually.  Following a thorough cleansing, the materials were then dried in Florentine libraries, space permitting, or at locations outside of the city, such as [[kiln|tobacco kilns]] and [[granaries]]. In some circumstances, large quantities of books were covered with sawdust, as a means of drawing out moisture. When not washed prior to drying, dried mud was then scraped off the exterior of the books.

One or both of two drying techniques was applied: interleaving by hand and/or drying with the aid of domestic heaters or other mechanical equipment. Interleaving involved the placement of blotting papers within the text-block of a book and replacing them once they were fully soaked; a variety of papers were used, including mimeograph paper and green blotting paper (the latter of which ultimately caused more damage). In kilns, the [[humidity]] level was slowly lowered from ninety to forty percent. If deemed necessary, bindings were removed and dried separately.  Removed pages were hung out to dry on an apparatus similar to a [[clothes line]].

Fearing the spread of [[mold]], workers completed these tasks with the greatest speed possible. After they were disinfected and dried, the items were then reassembled, restored and, if necessary, rebound. [[Library catalog|Card catalogs]] and in some cases, the actual books and documents were reproduced by reprinting on early [[Printing press|presses]], [[photocopying]], or copying by hand.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Florentine Flood Disaster | journal=The Burlington Magazine | date=April 1967 | volume=109 | issue=769 | pages=192–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Libraries and Archives of Florence | journal=Times Literary Supplement | date=1 December 1966| first=Nicolai | last=Rubinstein | page=1133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = http://data.scl.utah.edu/fmi/xsl/stream/details.xsl?-recid=354&amp;a::v=1O9iEOa749 | title = The Restoration of Books: Florence 1968 | medium = DVD | publisher = Royal College of Art | location = London | date = 1968 | accessdate= 27 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Library Centers of Florence: a case study====
Initially the transportation of large numbers of books to other institutes (to repair and rebind) was considered, but decided against on logistical grounds. Within six months of the flood, the National Library of Florence had 144 workers on hand: three binders, eight binder trainees, two librarians, forty-two workmen, eighty-one student volunteers and eight other library staff members.

Together they devised a logical and efficient method of book repair, involving nine separate and clearly defined steps:

* Books were selected for treatment. The details of work to be done were recorded on a formatted card that accompanied its respective book throughout its treatment. Once work was completed, the card was permanently filed. A universal language utilising symbols, created with [[foreign worker]]s in mind, was employed in the formatting of this card.  Symbols were assigned to key phrases that communicated the condition of each book and how its repair was to be conducted, such as:
** historically important-only to be dealt with by experts
** incomplete
** medium mud
** rebind
** collation part missing
* The book was photographed.
* The book's collation was verified and its covers removed and stored in a marked case (if they were to be used in a new binding).
* If necessary, the book was carefully taken apart to wash it in warm water and disinfect it with Topane.
* In certain cases, the leaves of the book were [[mass deacidification|deacidified]] and buffered.
* The text-block was pressed.
* The text-block was dried in specially designed cabinets.
* Sections of the book were then reconstructed and the text-blocks collated.
* Finally, each book was wrapped in a paper sheet that had been impregnated with an antimicrobial substance, then they were set aside for any later repair or rebinding. The binding was completed in the main reading room of the library, which had been converted (temporarily) for this purpose.

This methodical nine-part system enabled workers to process between seventy and a hundred books a day.&lt;ref name="Clarkson, Christopher 2003" /&gt;

After the Florence flood, the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale was not allowed to put books back into the lower levels.&lt;ref&gt;Lenzuni, Anna. “Coping with Disaster.” Preservation of library materials: conference held at the National Library of Austria, Vienna, 7–10 April 1986. Ed. Merrily A. Smith. IFLA publications, 40–41. München: Saur, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paintings===
Many panel paintings were critically damaged as a result of water saturating their wood, causing the glue and [[gesso]], which compose the priming layer, to dissolve. Consequently, the paintings' colours dissolved as well. In addition, the moisture caused paintings to buckle and crack or develop blisters, and the paint to chip and fall.  Actions were taken to stabilize the problem by applying [[rice paper]] to the affected paintings and storing them in cool, stable environments where humidity was slowly decreased. In extreme cases, the paint layer was extracted from the wood and gesso and then reapplied to a new support. [[Nystatin]], an antifungal, was sprayed on the wood to prevent mold from growing. Treatment facilities were established at locations such as the Boboli Garden Lemon-House, where over two hundred of these panel paintings were restored.

Similar measures were necessary to conserve canvas paintings. First, an original canvas was relined and gauze applied to the painted surface, which was then ironed. This process is referred to as the ''rintelatura'', or "new canvas" method. Relatively minor surface work was often completed with a variety of solvents and/or types of [[resin]].

===Frescoes===
[[Fresco]]es demanded more complicated treatment. Normally water, once it evaporates, will leave a layer of residual salt on the surface of the wall that absorbed it. In some instances, the resultant [[efflorescence]] obscured painted images. In other cases, the impermeability of the fresco plaster caused the salt to become trapped beneath the surface, causing bubbles to form and erupt, and the paint to fall. The adhesion of the plaster to the wall was often also seriously compromised. A fresco could only be detached when fully dry. To dry a fresco, workers cut narrow tunnels beneath it, in which heaters were placed to draw out moisture from below (instead of outwards, which would have further damaged the paintings). Within a few days, the fresco was ready to be detached.

Fuel oil, which coated many painted works of art, was removed by using Japanese tissue paper to apply a solvent, which dissolved the tar. An [[absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]], such as [[talcum powder]], was then distributed on the tissue paper.

===Sculpture and other objects===
It became imperative to clean sculpture immediately, before it fully absorbed the oil. Flaking sculpture was sprayed with a [[silicate]] mixture, while wooden pieces were treated with [[insecticides]] and toxic gases to kill insects and prevent future infestation. [[Weapon]]ry, like firearms and swords, were taken apart, cleaned with [[Kerosene|paraffin]], and finally lubricated to prevent future rusting.

[[Bronze]] objects were kept in dehumidification chambers for a few weeks and cleaned with distilled water or polished. For more severely damaged pieces, experts completed "depth cleaning," which entailed the use of small drills and vacuuming. Similar measures were taken with gold.  Broken objects were reassembled using photographs and other retrieved documentation.&lt;ref name="Batini 1967" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Florentine Flood Disaster" /&gt;

===Effect on preservation and conservation awareness===
The disastrous results of the flood established an international awareness of the need for preservation and conservation education and facilities.  In the United States, for example, it is no coincidence that the [[National Historic Preservation Act]] was passed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stipe | first=Robert and Antoinette J. Lee | url=http://www.emich.edu/public/geo/history.html#preservationact | title=The American Mosiac: Preserving A Nation's Heritage | year=1987 | publisher= U.S. Committee, International Council on Monuments and Sites | location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the next twenty years:
{{Quotation|2,000 to 3,000 preservation organizations actively engaged in public education, advocacy, preservation and restoration projects of various kinds, many of them operating revolving funds. In terms of geographic interest, distinctions among the regions are no longer drawn. Membership in the National Trust for Historic Preservation grew from 10,700 in 1966 to 185,000 in 1986. More than 35 university graduate professional and technical courses directly related to historic preservation were created in the interim. It would be reasonable to estimate that more than 54,000 jobs were created in the administrative aspect of preservation alone.|Robert E. Stipe and Antoinette J. Lee}}

===Work outstanding===
A significant amount of restorative work remains to be done in Florence.  Due to a lack of awareness, funding, and manpower, a great number of works of art and books lie in storage, dirty and damaged.  Christopher Clarkson, noted conservator, called attention to this problem in a 2007 letter, stating that the National Library still has a "warehouse" full of books to be repaired and bound; many others need cleaning or reassembling.  According to a 1993 report, approximately 25% of the 80,000 items belonging to the Magliabecchi and Palatino collections had not been fully restored in the nearly thirty years since the flood.  The number of conservators that work at the library presently is only about a tenth of the amount that worked there immediately after the flood.&lt;ref name="channel4.com"/&gt;

==Environmental measures==

Regional officials in Tuscany are responsible for organizing a massive project, the purpose of which is to not only protect the area from future flooding but to maintain high water quality and effectively utilize water resources.

Work commenced in 1984, with the construction of the Bilancino Dam, near Florence.  The Sieve tributary and spillway at [[Pontedera]] are among other developments.  The national government has funded a majority of these various subprojects, with the city of Florence being the primary recipient of the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Bilancino Dam, A Reservoir for Florence | url=http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm | accessdate =1 March 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041221224245/http://www.comune.firenze.it/servizi_pubblici/ambiente/acqua/ciclo/Inglese/1BILenglish.htm |archivedate = 21 December 2004|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abstract expressionism''' is a post–[[World War II]] [[art movement]] in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Editors of Phaidon Press|title=The 20th-Century art book.|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=London|isbn=0714835420|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put [[New York City]] at the center of the western [[art world]], a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term ''abstract expressionism'' was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]], it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine ''[[Der Sturm]]'', regarding [[German Expressionism]]. In the United States, [[Alfred Barr]] was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Barbara; "Abstract Expressionism", 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style ==
[[File:SMITH CUBI VI.JPG|thumb|upright|[[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]],'' [[Cubi]] VI'' (1963), [[Israel Museum]], [[Jerusalem]]. David Smith was one of the most influential American sculptors of the 20th century.]]

Technically, an important predecessor is [[surrealism]], with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]], or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]]. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]''. Paalen considered ideas of [[quantum mechanics]], as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay ''Totem Art'' (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as [[Martha Graham]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Barnett Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Neufert, ''Auf Liebe und Tod, Das Leben des Surrealisten Wolfgang Paalen'', Berlin (Parthas) 2015, S. 494ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America's newest art movement and included a list of "the men in the new movement." Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, [[Arshile Gorky|Gorky]] and others. Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett Newman Foundation, archive 18/103&lt;/ref&gt; Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his "white writing" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the [[all-over painting|"all-over"]] look of Pollock's drip paintings.

The movement's name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German [[expressionism|Expressionists]] with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]], and Synthetic [[Cubism]]. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic.&lt;ref name="Shapiro 2000 p. 189-190"&gt;Shapiro, David/Cecile (2000), "Abstract Expressionism: The politics of apolitical painting." p. 189–190 In: Frascina, Francis (2000–1): ''Pollock and After: The Critical Debate''. 2nd ed. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist [[Jay Meuser]], who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting ''Mare Nostrum'', "It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples." Pollock's energetic "[[action painting]]s", with their "busy" feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]'s [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]] and the rectangles of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s [[Color Field]] paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists' works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emma Kunz]], and later on Rothko, [[Barnett Newman]], and [[Agnes Martin]], abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher and Hendel Teicher (eds.). ''3 X Abstraction''. NY: The Drawing Center and /New Haven: Yale University Press. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]], but also by the [[Mexican muralism|muralists]] of [[Mexico]] such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as [[The Art of This Century Gallery]]. The [[McCarthy era]] after World War II was a time of artistic [[censorship]] in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally [[abstract art|abstract]] then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Guilbaut. ''How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art'', University of Chicago Press, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the movement is closely associated with painting, and painters such as [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Willem de Kooning]], Jackson Pollock, and others, [[Collage|collagist]] [[Anne Ryan]] and [[sculpture|certain sculptors]] in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50253062&amp;tab=holdings ''Americancan Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s An Illustrated Survey,''] (New York School Press, 2003.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-1-4}} pp12–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and his wife [[Dorothy Dehner]], [[Herbert Ferber]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[Ibram Lassaw]], [[Theodore Roszak (artist)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Phillip Pavia]], [[Mary Callery]], Richard Stankiewicz, [[Louise Bourgeois]], and [[Louise Nevelson]] in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists [[David Hare (artist)|David Hare]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[James Rosati]], [[Mark di Suvero]], and sculptors [[Richard Lippold]], Raoul Hague, [[George Rickey]], [[Reuben Nakian]], and even [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Seymour Lipton]], [[Joseph Cornell]], and several others&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12"&gt;Marika Herskovic, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/oclc/50666793&amp;tab=holdings ''New York School Abstract Expressionists Artists Choice by Artists''] (New York School Press, 2000.) {{ISBN|0-9677994-0-6}} p.11–12&lt;/ref&gt; were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the [[Ninth Street Show]],&lt;ref name="Marika Herskovic 2000. p.11-12" /&gt; a famous exhibition curated by [[Leo Castelli]] on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including [[Frank O'Hara]] and photographers such as [[Aaron Siskind]] and [[Fred McDarrah]], (whose book ''The Artist's World in Pictures'' documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably [[Robert Frank]]—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

== Art critics of the post–World War II era ==


{{quote|At a certain moment the canvas began to appear to one American painter after another as an arena in which to act. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.|[[Harold Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Abstract Expressionism, by Barbara Hess, Taschen, 2005, back cover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries ([[The Art of This Century]], [[Pierre Matisse]] Gallery, [[Julien Levy Gallery]] and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Barnett Newman]], who functioned as critics as well.

While New York and the world were yet unfamiliar with the New York [[avant-garde]] by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: [[Clement Greenberg]] advocated [[Jackson Pollock]] and the [[Color Field|color field]] painters like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Hans Hofmann]]; [[Harold Rosenberg]] seemed to prefer the action painters such as [[Willem de Kooning]] and [[Franz Kline]], as well as the seminal paintings of [[Arshile Gorky]]; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of ''[[ARTnews]]'', championed [[Willem de Kooning]].

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as "followers"&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Hess, "Willem de Kooning", George Braziller, Inc. New York, 1959 p.13&lt;/ref&gt; or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, [[Mark Tobey]] became the first American painter since [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]] (1895) to win top prize at the [[Venice Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomkins, Calvin. ''Off the Wall: A Portrait of Robert Rauschenberg'' [Deckle Edge] [Paperback], p. 5. Publisher: Picador; Revised and Updated edition (November 29, 2005) {{ISBN|0-312-42585-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newman-Onement 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Barnett Newman]], ''Onement 1,'' 1948. During the 1940s Barnett Newman wrote several articles about the new American painting.]]

[[Barnett Newman]], a late member of the [[The Art of This Century Gallery|Uptown Group]], wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists' Sessions at Studio 35: "We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings and Interviews'', (ed.) by John P. O'Neill, pp. 240–241, [[University of California Press]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, "Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Barnett Newman Selected Writings Interviews'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strangely the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist; [[Clement Greenberg]]. As long-time art critic for the ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]'', he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist [[Robert Motherwell]] joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Clement Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Jackson Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock's work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via [[Cubism]] and [[Cézanne]] to [[Monet]], in which painting became ever-'purer' and more concentrated in what was 'essential' to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Greenberg, "Art and Culture Critical essays", ("The Crisis of the Easel Picture"), Beacon Press, 1961 pp.: 154–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Pollock's work has always polarised critics. [[Harold Rosenberg]] spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock's work, in which "what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event". "The big moment came when it was decided to paint 'just to paint'. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The Tradition of the New'', Chapter 2, "The American Action Painter", pp.23–39&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[John Canaday]]. [[Meyer Schapiro]] and [[Leo Steinberg]] along with Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics [[Michael Fried]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], and [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

== History ==

=== World War II and the Post-War period ===

[[File:'Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental', oil on canvas painting by Richard Pousette-Dart, 1941-42, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Pousette-Dart]], ''Symphony No. 1, The Transcendental,'' 1941–42]]

During the period leading up to and during [[World War II]], modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from [[Varian Fry]]) were [[Hans Namuth]], [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Peggy Guggenheim]], [[Leo Castelli]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[André Masson]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[André Breton]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Piet Mondrian]]. A few artists, notably [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Pierre Bonnard]] remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. In Europe after the war there was the continuation of [[Surrealism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]], and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Outsider art|Art brut]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Dubuffet]]: ''L’Art brut préféré aux arts culturels'' [1949](=engl in: ''Art brut. Madness and Marginalia'', special issue of ''Art &amp; Text'', No. 27, 1987, p. 31-33)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Staël]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]], [[Pierre Soulages]] and [[Jean Messagier]], among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openlibrary.org/books/OL22161138M/Younger_European_painters_a_selection. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, ''Younger European painters: a selection'', exhibition catalogue, 2 December 1953 – 21 February 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called ''Abstract Expressionists''.

==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====

[[File:Gorky-The-Liver.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arshile Gorky]], ''The Liver is the Cock's Comb'' (1944), oil on canvas, 73{{fraction|1|4}} × 98" (186 × 249 cm) [[Albright–Knox Art Gallery]], [[Buffalo, New York]]. Gorky was an [[Armenians|Armenian]]-born [[United States|American]] painter who had a seminal influence on abstract expressionism. De Kooning said: "I met a lot of artists — but then I met Gorky... He had an extraordinary gift for hitting the nail on the head; remarkable. So I immediately attached myself to him and we became very good friends."&lt;ref&gt;''Willem de Kooning'' (1969) by Thomas B. Hess&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Surrealism]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Cubism]], [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America such as [[Hans Hofmann]] from Germany and [[John D. Graham]] from Ukraine. Graham's influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Richard Pousette-Dart]] among others. Gorky's contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as [[lyrical abstraction]]&lt;ref name =dorment&gt;Dorment, Richard.

Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann's protégés was [[Clement Greenberg]], who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was [[Lee Krasner]], who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.



==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all [[Contemporary art]] that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like [[Pablo Picasso]]'s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via [[Cubism]] and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as [[Navajo people|Navaho]] [[sand painting]]s, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art,&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, Richard, et al., ''Introducing Postmodernism,'' Ikon Books, Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2003, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process—the placing of unstretched raw [[canvas]] on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock's breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Peter Voulkos]], and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The new [[art movements]] of the 1960s essentially followed the lead of abstract expressionism and in particular the innovations of Pollock, De Kooning, Rothko, Hofmann, Reinhardt, and Newman. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including [[Fluxus]], [[Neo-Dada]], [[Conceptual art]], and the [[feminist art movement]] can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]],&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda, Ch.1 in: ''Women Artists at the Millennium'' (edited by C. Armstrong and C. de Zegher) MIT Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Griselda Pollock]]&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, Griselda, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catherine de Zegher]]&lt;ref&gt;De Zegher, Catherine, and Teicher, Hendel (eds.), ''3 X Abstraction''.

Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent 'uptown' galleries included: the [[Charles Egan Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xPBPAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;dq=%22charles+egan+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-CluVdSYL4b5yASbmYCgBg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw|title=George McNeil|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sidney Janis|Sidney Janis Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=%22janis+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QypuVfDEBtKTyAS66IOQBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22janis%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=Janis Gallery abstract|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Betty Parsons Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNCJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=%22betty+parsons+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCpuVYq4EsuxyASNjoGACA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22betty%20parsons%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Kootz Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgALtJ2GKIUC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;dq=%22kootz+gallery%22+abstract&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mypuVY-QAdX_yQTHyIOoDw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kootz%20gallery%22%20abstract&amp;f=false|title=New York Modern|work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tibor de Nagy Gallery]], the [[Stable Gallery]], the [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the [[Tenth Street galleries]] exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

==== Action painting ====

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms [[action painting]] and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French [[tachisme]].

The term was coined by the American critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.poetrymagazines.org.uk/magazine/record.asp?id=9798
| title = ''The American Action Painters''

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of [[New York School (art)|New York School]] painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was "an arena in which to act". While abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Franz Kline]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like [[Clement Greenberg]], focused on their works' "objectness." To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings' clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists' [[Existentialism|existential]] struggle.

[[File:'Boon' oil on canvas painting by James Brooks, 1957, Tate Gallery.jpg|thumb|''Boon'' by [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], 1957, [[Tate Gallery]]]]
Rosenberg's critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting's creation. This spontaneous activity was the "action" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, [[painterly]] gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] part of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] manifestation of the act of pure creation.&lt;ref&gt;based (very) loosely on a lecture by Fred Orton at the Uni of Leeds and H. Geldzahler, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970, NY 1969''&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic [[action painting]]s, with their "busy" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I,'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'', collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]],'' [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV,'' [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&amp;BioArtistIRN=25281&amp;MnuID=2&amp;GalID=1|title=International Paintings and Sculpture - Woman V|work=nga.gov.au|accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]].

Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Painting Number 2 at MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]&lt;/ref&gt;As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an "[[Action Painting|action painter]] because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting ''Number 2'' (1954). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters [[Franz Kline]] (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and [[Cy Twombly]], who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the [[Collective unconscious]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://arthistoryunstuffed.com/abstract-expressionism-redefining-art-part-one/ Jeanne Willette, abstract expressionism, redefining art, part one]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/abex/hd_abex.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Abstract Expressionism]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Robert Motherwell]] in his ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/489403 Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79007 MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Joan Mitchell]], and [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks' paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to [[Lyrical Abstraction]] that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: April 5 through June 7, 1970, ''Statement of the exhibition''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and [[Robert Motherwell]] can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and [[Color field|Color field painting]]. In the 1940s [[Richard Pousette-Dart]]'s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and Jackson Pollock in that decade as well.

[[Color Field painting]] initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Ad Reinhardt]] and several series of paintings by [[Joan Miró]]. [[Art critic]] [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from [[Action painting]]. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Mark Tobey]], and especially [[Ad Reinhardt]] and [[Barnett Newman]], whose masterpiece ''[[Vir heroicus sublimis]]'' is in the collection of [[MoMA]], used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbol and sign as replacement of imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MoMA Learning|title=What is Abstract Expressionism: Mark Rothko|url=https://education.moma.org/moma/learningresources/cms_page/view/366521|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s [[Frank Stella]] in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the [[San Francisco Bay area]]. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an "all-over" approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of [[Action painting]], while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the [[Color field]] painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.

Although Pollock is closely associated with [[Action Painting]] because of his style, technique, and his painterly ''touch'' and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale [[Water Lilies]] of [[Claude Monet]] done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic [[Michael Fried]], and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his ''drip'' paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic ''drip'' painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery in New York City Pollock showed ''Number 12, 1952'', a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by [[Nelson Rockefeller]] for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=1961+Fire+damages+art+collection+of++Governor+Rockefellers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Puraoeksco&amp;sig=kXNGISm1LkNM53NlzW4ZePgUlAY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=efvDTfSeMYHt0gGvjtn2Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false August 16, 1976 NY Magazine, p.66] Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp Pollock #12 1952 at NY State Mall project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313223525/http://ogs.ny.gov/esp/CT/History.asp |date=March 13, 2014 }} Retrieved May 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Arshile Gorky]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a [[surrealist]], he was also one of the first painters of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] who used the technique of ''staining.'' Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as ''grounds.'' In Gorky's most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]]. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his [[oil paint]] in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined [[calligraphy]] and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, [[Sam Francis]]' style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, [[Action painting]] and Color Field painting.

Having seen [[Jackson Pollock]]'s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, [[Helen Frankenthaler]] began to produce ''stain paintings'' in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is ''Mountains and Sea''. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87871332 'Color Field' Artists Found a Different Way] Retrieved August 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Frankenthaler also studied with [[Hans Hofmann]].

Hofmann's paintings are a symphony of color as seen in ''The Gate,'' 1959–1960. Hofmann was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the U.S. Hans Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of [[Modernism]]. Hofmann was a young artist working in [[Paris]] who painted there before [[World War I]]. Hofmann worked in Paris with [[Robert Delaunay]], and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Matisse's work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]] were both profoundly influenced by [[Helen Frankenthaler]]'s stain paintings after visiting her studio in [[New York City]]. Returning to [[Washington, DC.]], they began to produce the major works that created the ''color field movement'' in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name="Fenton1"&gt;Fenton, Terry.

It also was one of the first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one.

In [[Abstract art|abstract painting]] during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the [[Hard-edge painting]] exemplified by [[John McLaughlin (artist)|John McLaughlin]], emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of [[Geometric abstraction]] began to appear in artist studios and in radical [[avant-garde]] circles. [[Clement Greenberg]] became the voice of ''Post-painterly abstraction;'' by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964.

== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued by [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the [[CIA]], who saw it as representative of the USA as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the [[socialist realist]] styles prevalent in [[communism|communist]] nations and the dominance of the European art markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html CIA and AbEx] Retrieved November 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The book by [[Frances Stonor Saunders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/CIAcultCW.html |title=Ratical.org |publisher=Ratical.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/oclc/43114251?loc=#tabs |title=Worldcatlibraries.org |publisher=Worldcatlibraries.org |date= |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (published in the UK as ''Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War'') details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of [[cultural imperialism]] via the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell's series ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic'' addressed some of those political issues. [[Tom Braden]], founding chief of the CIA's [[International Organizations Division]] (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] said in an interview, "I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/modern-art-was-cia-weapon-1578808.html Modern Art was a CIA 'Weapon'] Retrieved September 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by [[Michael Kimmelman]], chief art critic of ''[[The New York Times]]'', called ''Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War'', argues that much of this information (as well as the revisionists' interpretation of it) concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s is flatly false, or at best (contrary to the revisionists' avowed historiographic principles) decontextualized.&lt;ref name=kimmelman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kimmelman|first1=Michael|last2=Frascina|first2=Francis, ed.|title=Pollock and After: The Critical Debate|chapter=Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War|date=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415228664|pages=294–306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNzRUNbKKA4C&amp;pg=PA294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other books on the subject include ''Art in the Cold War'' by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time; and ''Pollock and After'' edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] painter [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]] (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group [[Les Automatistes]], helped introduce a related style of [[abstract impressionism]] to the Parisian art world from 1949. [[Michel Tapié]]'s groundbreaking book, ''Un Art Autre'' (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement's initial affect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded [[Tachisme]], [[Color Field painting]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Fluxus]], [[Pop Art]], [[Minimalism]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with [[Hard-edge painting]] ([[Frank Stella]], [[Robert Indiana]] and others) and [[Pop Art|Pop artists]], notably [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in Britain. [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. [[Minimalism]] was exemplified by artists such as [[Donald Judd]], [[Robert Mangold]] and [[Agnes Martin]].

However, many painters, such as [[Jules Olitski]], [[Joan Mitchell]] and [[Antoni Tàpies]] continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism|Neo-expressionist]] and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as [[Pop Art]]. This also helped to make [[New York City|New York]] into a cultural and artistic hub.&lt;ref name="New York and Abstract Expressionism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abstract Expressionist New York|url=http://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1085?locale=en|publisher=MoMA|accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Animal Research Institute Buildings''' is a heritage-listed set of [[research station]] buildings at 681 Fairfield Road, [[Yeerongpilly, Queensland|Yeerongpilly]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is also known as Stock Experiment Station (1909-1932) and Animal Research Station (1932-1953). It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 13 June 2008.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|22217|Animal Research Institute (former)|602598|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The former [[Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly|Animal Research Institute at Yeerongpilly]] was established by the [[Department of Agriculture and Stock (Queensland)|Department of Agriculture and Stock]] in 1909 as the Stock Experiment Station. The Station was the first purpose-built, farm-based facility of Australia's first Stock Institute and its work was primarily to research and control diseases in [[livestock]], develop [[vaccine]]s and improve animal health and production. The complex was extended over time to accommodate the changing needs of the Institute, the [[University of Queensland]]'s first veterinary training facility in 1938-1940 and then, between 1933 and 1967, the interrelated work of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt; In 1889 an Intercolonial Stock Conference in [[Melbourne]] recommended that an Australasian Stock Institute be established to study diseases in livestock; however the various colonies could not reach agreement on the matter. The first such institute was set up in Queensland in 1893 following a deputation of stock owners to the then Colonial Secretary, the Hon. [[Berkeley Basil Moreton]]. The [[Queensland Stock Institute]] was initially set up in rented premises in Turbot Street, [[Brisbane]], under [[bacteriologist]] [[Charles Joseph Pound]]. The premises included a laboratory and a museum.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:C. J. Pound pictured with his microscope.JPG|thumb|C. J. Pound at his microscope]]
Pound was a "[[microscopist]]" who trained in London in microscopy, [[physiology]] and bacteriology and at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]] in developing vaccines, then a new technology. Arriving in [[Sydney]] in 1892, he worked first for the [[Ministry of Health (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Health]] before taking up the position in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

As part of his work for the new Stock Institute, in 1894 Pound proved that [[cattle tick]]s transmitted [[Redwater disease|Redwater Disease]] (Bacillary [[Hemoglobinuria]]), which was causing heavy losses in Queensland cattle. He conducted the first [[inoculation]] studies into this disease in Australia and established a methodology and dosage that are still used worldwide. He trained stockowners in the techniques of collecting recovered blood, [[Defibrillation|defibrillating]] it and using this vaccine to inoculate their stock. To facilitate this, he invented the "Pound" syringe and arranged for it to be manufactured. Backed by his lectures and published articles, this work made a major contribution to the success of Queensland's cattle industry. Pound's activities also included obtaining pathological specimens of various manifestations of diseases in stock and other domesticated animals, and items sent in by stock owners were added to the museum's collection. However, the primary object of the Institute in 1895 was to cultivate the pleuro-pneumonia virus for inoculating cattle. In 1897 administration of the Institute passed from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Queensland Department of Agriculture, founded in 1887.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1899 new premises for the Institute were constructed in the then Brisbane suburb of Normanby (now within [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]). The two-storey red brick building, located next to the [[Brisbane Grammar School]] residence on College Road, included rooms for Mr Pound and clerical work; a general laboratory; plus chemistry, incubator, sterilizing and photographic rooms on the ground floor, and a museum, library and lecture room on the first floor. Outbuildings included two stalls and loose-boxes, plus other facilities for stock used in experiments.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Due to the government's increased focus on human health, Pound was transferred to the Health Section of the Home Secretary's Department as Government Bacteriologist and the department was renamed the Bacteriological Institute. He was the only scientist in Australia then producing [[tuberculin]], used in diagnosing human and bovine tuberculosis, and also carrying out work on [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:Sydney Dodd (1874-1926), veterinarian and scientist.jpg|thumb|Sydney Dodd (1874-1926), veterinarian and scientist]]
In 1907, due to concerns about the impact of [[cattle tick]] on the dairy industry, the Institute returned to the control of the Department of Agriculture and Stock and Dr Sydney Dodd was appointed Principal Veterinary Surgeon and Bacteriologist for three years. He continued research work on the eradication of cattle ticks and the diseases caused by them. At his suggestion, the Department acquired {{convert|23|ha}} of land at Yeerongpilly for an experimental station capable of accommodating the animals needed for research and sufficient for grass and crops to make the farm self-supporting in fodder. The Yeerongpilly site was more suitable than other sites considered as it was bounded on the north by the river, on the south by the railway line, leaving only narrow frontages on the east and west to adjoining land and public roads, thereby reducing the danger that disease could spread.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The first land sales in the Yeerongpilly area had begun in the 1850s and [[arrowroot]] and [[cotton]] were initially grown, being replaced by [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] before the industry moved north following a series of cold winters. In 1879, the [[Yeerongpilly Divisional Board]] was formed. The development of rail links in the 1880s opened the area to residential development; but this slowed in the late 19th century following the 1893 floods, which submerged much of Yeerongpilly; and the depression of the 1890s. In the early 20th century, development increased again and most of the area was connected to electricity by the 1920s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Stock Experiment Station complex, designed by Dodd, opened in 1909 making Queensland the first state to possess such a facility. As well as Dodd, it employed two laboratory assistants and two farm workers. The offices and laboratories were housed in a timber building, the Stock Experiment Station Main Building, probably designed by [[Arthur Morry]], who was then the Department's architect. It had five rooms off a central corridor that led to a large, sixth room. There were verandahs on the eastern, northern and western sides. The rooms were all airy and well-lit, with fly-proof shields to windows and doors. The main laboratory in the room at the rear was fitted-out with shelves, cupboards and workbenches, much of which remains in 2011. There were also support structures and animal yards, along with a post mortem room, sheep and pig pens and an incinerator.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1909 a stable was erected to the north of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. The Department of Agriculture and Stock Annual Report for 1910 described the building:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The stable provide four stalls, a loose-box, and feed-room, with a room for harness, tools, etc., and another room for small animals, specially ventilated. The manger fittings are of iron, with water-pots and hay-racks combined. The floors of stalls are laid with a special channelled stable brick, and a tramway is laid the whole length of the building with an overhead traveller for removing the carcasses of dead animals."&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar building of 12 stalls, designated as cattle byres, was erected immediately to the north but it does not survive. The total cost of the complex to October 1909 was {{A£|5,000}}.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1910 Dodd resigned and Pound was transferred from the Bacteriological Institute, taking charge of the new Station until his retirement in 1932, when the facility was renamed the Animal Health Station and a large wing was added to the northern side of the main building to provide additional laboratories. This wing comprised three rooms accessed by a verandah on the western side, part of which was later in-filled. Some original benches and bookcases have been removed. A verandah annex accommodating toilet, store, shower and dressing room on the 1909 section was extended in 1940 to include a ladies dressing room and the whole was modified in 1958 for further laboratory space and updated staffroom and toilets.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Facilities for undertaking post mortems were an essential part of the work of the Stock Experiment Station. The first detached post mortem building was erected in the 1920s and by the early 1930s a new one was required. This building, the Animal Morgue, was erected in 1934 to designs prepared by [[Department of Public Works (Queensland)|Department of Public Works]] architect DFW Roberts. It comprised a single room with a purpose-built concrete mortuary table in the centre and two concrete dissecting benches against the northern wall. As much as possible of the building was constructed of concrete for ease of cleaning and hygiene. It was well ventilated with ceiling vents and a Robinson's Patent ventilator on the roof. The joins between walls and floor were coved. The windows and doors were timber and fly-screens were provided to all openings. Taps operated by foot remain at the dissecting bench in the north-eastern corner.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In the 1930s, staff carried out the first animal husbandry research studies in Queensland with nutritional experiments on pigs and poultry. Major alterations were undertaken in 1939 to convert the Animal Health Station for use as an anatomy school by the [[University of Queensland|University of Queensland's]] Veterinary School. In April 1935 [[Premier of Queensland|Queensland Premier]] [[William Forgan Smith]] had stated the reasoning behind the government's funding of a veterinary school for Queensland - that:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Queensland ... was a primary producer, and its problems could in large measure be solved by research; veterinary science would supplement the contribution of agriculture ... a scientific veterinary staff would enable the Department of Agriculture and Stock to deal efficiently with all aspects of veterinary problems and only a Queensland school could meet Queensland's needs ..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[The Courier (Brisbane)|The Courier]] Mail concurred:&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"animal husbandry, sheep, beef and dairy cattle supported the whole edifice of the state's economy. The need was clear ..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Subsequently, in 1936, a faculty of Veterinary Science had been established within the University of Queensland to provide local training for veterinarians. For practical and economic reasons the faculty used the existing facilities at the Animal Health Station at Yeerongpilly and the [[North Queensland]] Stock Experiment Station at [[Oonoonba, Queensland|Oonoonba]] in [[Townsville]] (est. 1915), as it was thought that their work would complement that of the Veterinary Science Department.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A dedicated building for the School was planned for the Yeerongpilly site and its first stage - comprising part of the animal hospital and the northern wing of the main building - was completed in 1938. Facilities for anatomy were still required so the 1909 stable was altered for this purpose by infilling the door openings on the north with weatherboards and casement windows, lining interior walls with VJ pine boards, inserting a ceiling and covering the brick floor with a concrete slab. (It is not clear if all brick floors were simply covered or some removed. Some channeled brick flooring remains in the room on the south-eastern corner of the stable in 2011.) In {{circa|1940}} a [[Skillion roof|skillion-roofed]], weatherboard-clad annex was erected along the stable's eastern side.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The final two stages in the building of the Veterinary School were completed by 1940 commencing with the remainder of the Hospital Block and the southern wing, and ending with the eastern (entry) wing. It contained five laboratories, offices, library, dark room, stores, toilets, locker and common rooms; the northern wing offices, lecture rooms, X-ray room and operating theatres; and the southern wing a museum, preparation room, post-mortem room and common room. The Hospital Block was L-shaped forming a courtyard at the rear of Main Building. It provided accommodation for cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and small animals receiving treatment. A two-storey fodder store was located on the south-western corner of the Hospital Block and a blacksmith shop on the eastern end of its southern wing. The construction of the Veterinary School was completed for {{A£|26,000}}.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School suspended its activities during [[World War II]]. The [[United States Army|United States Army's]] 3rd Medical Laboratory arrived in Brisbane in June 1942, and its Headquarters Section moved into the new Veterinary School buildings soon after. The functions of a Medical Laboratory (on behalf of US Army medical units) included: water analyses; examination of food supplies; investigation of [[epidemic]]s and [[epizootic]]s; and the distribution of special laboratory supplies. The laboratories performed special [[Serology|serological]], bacteriological, [[pathological]] and chemical examinations, and would have played an important role in safeguarding the health of US troops operating in a tropical environment.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Medical Laboratories could also furnish support for [[post mortem]] examinations. The USA Quartermaster had a [[morgue]] in Yeerongpilly by October 1943, and this was probably the morgue at the School. US military personnel who died in Australia were buried locally, including at [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], and their bodies were returned to the USA after the war.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The 3rd Medical Laboratory was the only laboratory in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] until mid 1943, and it also functioned as a [[Malaria]] School. Apparently it did not treat any patients. A Veterinary Officer also served at the Headquarters section, to supervise the animal section of the laboratory. In August 1943 the 3rd Medical Laboratory was replaced at Yeerongpilly by the 8th Medical Laboratory, which left Australia in late August 1944. The circular garden arrangement with flagpole located in front of the Veterinary School is a typical US Army design, and probably dates from the period of US occupation. The Veterinary School was handed back to the government in excellent order, with some improvements, in September 1944. After the departure of the US Army, staff from the Stock Experiment Station Main Building moved into the Veterinary School Main Building. In 1946-7 the university moved into relocated timber buildings on site. The University of Queensland's Veterinary School remained there in temporary accommodation until February 1961 when the school moved to the university's [[St Lucia, Queensland|St Lucia]] campus.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Dr FHS Roberts, Parasitologist, Yeerongpilly Animal Health Station, May 1937.jpeg|thumb|Dr FHS Roberts, Parasitologist, 1937]]
By the early 1930s, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, later CSIRO, established in 1926 by the Australian Government) were conducting research on stock in Queensland, collaborating with and complementing the work of the Department of Agriculture and Stock. This interaction saw responsibilities for certain aspects of pest control and research shift between the organizations. Over time a number of scientists involved in animal research worked for both organizations. Among these scientists, one who had a longstanding and important association with Yeerongpilly was Dr Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts (1901-1972). Born in [[Rockhampton]], Roberts studied at the University of Queensland and was based at Yeerongpilly from 1933 as an [[Entomology|entomologist]] and [[Parasitology|parasitologist]]. Roberts specialized in researching parasitic diseases of livestock and was sent abroad for this purpose, and additionally researched domestic animal parasites.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

From 1945, CSIR were using the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. In 1947 Roberts was appointed as principal research officer and officer-in charge of the new CSIR Veterinary Parasitology Laboratory at Yeerongpilly. The CSIR announced in early 1948 that in tandem with beef production expansion, Queensland would become the Australian centre for research into the industry. In June of that year the Department of Agriculture and Stock announced that the CSIR would be granted for ten years, "free of interest" the buildings at the State Animal Health laboratory.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cairns Post|Cairns Post]], 15 June 1948, p3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, CSIR was renamed CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. A timber wing was added on the southern side of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building in 1950 to provide additional facilities for CSIRO's Veterinary Parasitology Laboratory. Under the leadership of Roberts, this laboratory became known internationally for its work on parasitic diseases of cattle. A number of other subsidiary buildings were also erected on the site during this period to accommodate the work of CSIRO.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1954, the Animal Health Station was renamed the Animal Research Institute and from 1967 Queensland Government laboratory staff were again housed in the Stock Experiment Station Main Building, following CSIRO's departure for new laboratories at Long Pocket, [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1952 about {{convert|21|acre}} of the site was transferred to the [[Brisbane City Council]] and then on to the State Electricity Authority for the development of the [[Tennyson Power Station]], which has since been demolished to make way for riverside apartment blocks and a tennis centre.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

There are several buildings on site that are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. In 1956 three buildings were erected at the rear of western wing of the Veterinary School Hospital Block - two brick buildings accommodating animal stalls and a metal-clad and framed building for stores. The c.1938 garage adjacent to the northern end of the hospital was also extended as part of these additions. In 1960 a brick staff amenities building was erected adjacent to the stores building and abutting the western wall of the Hospital Block. These buildings demonstrate the expansion of the Animal Research Institute in the 1950s and early 1960s but are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Several timber buildings erected in the early 1950s to provide additional offices and laboratory accommodation are located immediately to the rear of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. These buildings are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Work carried out by the Institute over the years includes testing to diagnose diseases of cattle, sheep, goats, horses, deer, pigs and poultry. It is famous for its research into cattle tick fever and developing vaccines against stock diseases. Research work has been carried out on plant poisons, infectious and parasitic diseases, trace element deficiencies and metabolic disorders. Many diseases of livestock were first diagnosed and described at Yeerongpilly, leading to effective control measures being developed. The research undertaken by the Institute has been a major factor in the development of pastoral primary industries in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Following road works in 1983 the main entrance to the Institute was relocated from Fairfield Road to Ortive Street.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1999 the Department of Primary Industries opened the CJ Pound Laboratory at the Tick Fever Research Centre at [[Wacol, Queensland|Wacol]], in honour of a man who was described by one newspaper as the "boffin" who "saved the cattle industry".&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 2011 the Institute has vacated the site which is to be redeveloped.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Animal Research Institute Yeerongpilly plan c 1983.svg|thumb|Site plan, circa 1983]]
The former Animal Research Institute is a complex of buildings, [[sheds]] and animal pens on a {{convert|12|ha}} site in the Brisbane suburb of Yeerongpilly. Those structures considered of state-level heritage significance are: the Stock Experiment Station Main Building (1909), an associated Stable (1909), the purpose-built Animal Morgue (1934), and the Veterinary School Main Building and Hospital Block (1938-1940). The entire Institute site is bound on the north by King Arthur Terrace, to the east by Fairfield Road, on the south by the [[Tennyson railway line|Tennyson Branch Railway line]], and to the west by an easement shared with the [[Queensland Tennis Centre]]. Its entrance is on King Arthur Terrace on the north-eastern corner and the significant buildings are clustered on higher ground across the eastern half of the site with the remaining, lower area comprising many large, fenced yards of grass.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Stock Experiment Station Main Building ===
The Stock Experiment Station Main Building is a large timber-framed building comprising a central rectangular core with wings to the north (1932) and south (1950). All the building's phases feature verandahs, some of which are enclosed. The building is low-set and single-storey except for the southern wing which, in using the slope of the land, is two-storey. The roof is hipped and sheeted with corrugated metal and has three metal ventilators on the centre ridge which are not original. This building occupies the centre of the site facing east onto a large asphalted forecourt used for car parking. The view this forecourt provides of what has historically been the front [[facade]] of the earliest building on the Institute site is considered of cultural heritage significance, while the asphalt itself is not.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The different phases of construction of this building are distinguishable in its fabric. The original 1909 core is in a Federation style, the northern wing (1932) has elements typical of the interwar classical style, and the southern wing (1950) is in a post-war functionalist style. The exterior of the building is clad with chamferboards on the core and southern wing and weatherboards on the northern wing. The core is surrounded by verandahs which are mostly enclosed. The southern and northern wings are long and narrow and have verandahs on their western sides providing access to the rooms that open from them.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The composition of the eastern facade reflects the symmetrical plan of the core. The open verandah has a small, projecting central gabled entrance with decorative timber battens and arches sheltering a short timber stair. A later timber ramp provides access to its southern end, which is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Each verandah end is enclosed with glazing, weatherboards, and fibrous cement sheeting. The verandah balustrade is a timber post and rail arrangement that is not original and therefore not of cultural heritage significance. The verandah ceiling is tongue-and-groove jointed boarding on the rake and the floor is recent shot-edge boards.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building's 1909 core comprises six rooms and a central hall leading off the east-facing front verandah to one of the rooms, a large laboratory, to the west. The hall has a decorative timber battened arch with moulded [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] and [[architrave]]. All rooms (except the laboratory) have pressed metal ceilings, pressed metal [[cornices]], and decorative, ventilated ceiling roses some of which have evidence of gas pendant lights which are not extant. The ceiling of the former laboratory is lined with flat sheeting with no [[cornice]]. The other rooms, formerly laboratories and store rooms, have plastered walls with rounded corners which are stop-chamfered near the ceiling. The hall walls are timber, vertically-jointed boards. There are no skirtings or rails throughout and all walls and ceilings are painted. The floors are lined with non-original carpet or vinyl, coverings which are not of cultural heritage significance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The rooms feature a number of built-in timber cabinets, shelves, work benches, and freestanding furniture that are early or original. Original internal doors are timber with stop-chamfered detailing and have early or original brass (as well as more recent) [[door furniture]]. A number of recent doors have been installed throughout the 1909 core and are not of cultural heritage significance. Timber French doors with glazing and decorative [[bolection]] moulding and timber casement windows open onto the eastern verandah. Some of these doors and windows retain original glazed fanlights with curved brass opening stays and mechanisms with ceramic knobs. Projecting from the north- western corner of the rear, western verandah are a number of smaller rooms containing toilets and a shower, a staff room, and a small laboratory. The walls and ceilings of these rooms are lined with fibrous cement sheeting and rounded cover strips, and the floors are finished with vinyl, ceramic tiles, and terrazzo. The 1909 laboratory contains equipment, cupboards, and workbenches.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The core of the Station Main Building is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. There is a small, timber enclosure under the core on its southern side that contains a small laboratory with shelving, workbenches, and cupboards.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Station Main Building's northern wing comprises three rooms and a semi-enclosed, west-facing verandah. It is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. Tongue-and-groove jointed boarding lines the ceilings of each room and the floors are covered in vinyl or carpet. The walls of the central room are sheeted while the walls of the other two rooms have vertically-jointed boards with moulded belt rails. The rooms contain some solid timber furniture, wall-hung cupboards, and workbenches that appear original to the 1932 construction date. One original timber-boarded door remains in the southern-most room. The original windows are timber-framed and double- hung or casements with fanlights. Air conditioning units have replaced some windows however those remaining retain original brass hardware.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The southern wing comprises two levels, four rooms on the upper floor and three rooms and a toilets area on the lower, connected by a stair to west-facing verandahs. This building wing is founded on a concrete slab partially suspended and supported on brick-faced [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]]. The rooms have plasterboard ceilings with a large coved cornice, plasterboard walls, a square timber skirting, and vinyl covered floors. The rooms contain solid timber built-in workbenches and wall- hung cupboards that are original to the 1950 construction date. The rooms also feature a number of solid timber, freestanding pieces of furniture. The doors are timber with a glazed panel and some have screens. The original windows are timber-framed with two layers, an inner set of double hung sashes and an outer layer of casements. Those on the eastern side have timber brackets with slots for a workbench shield. The toilet ceilings and walls are sheeted, and the floor is a vinyl composite coved to the wall. The fixtures are original.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Adjacent to the western side of the Stock Experiment Station's northern wing is a small building, rectangular in plan with a Dutch [[gable]] roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting, weatherboard clad walls, and a concrete slab floor. The top section of the exterior walls is in-filled with mesh to the [[soffit]] allowing ventilation of the interior. A channel in the slab drains into a drainage trough running around the base of the south-western corner. A concrete ramp leads to a door on the side of the building and a large concrete open-topped tank is positioned next to the north-eastern side. The doors are timber, one having a screen. Some windows have been sheeted up to hold air conditioning units, while others are later aluminium-framed sliders.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Stable ===
The Stable (1909) is located nearby to the north of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. It is a long rectangle in plan with a hipped and gabled roof. A small secondary gable extends about three- quarters the length of the main ridge to assist ventilation. All roof planes are sheeted with corrugated metal. The stable is timber-framed, and clad in weatherboards. The floor is a concrete slab with areas of early brick flooring visible in the rooms on its eastern side. The gable end walls have ventilated weatherboards at the apex. The interior is divided into a number of rooms by a combination of vertically-jointed boarding and sheet walls. The doors are all modern and not significant. The early windows are double-hung timber sashes. Some have had air conditioning units installed in the bottom sash. Channels in the floor connect to an external concrete spoon drain that runs around the base of the building. In the largest room, facing west, meshed ventilation windows are positioned near the floor. A freestanding building which is not significant is located on the eastern side of the stable separated by a very narrow space with a concrete spoon drain.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Animal Morgue ===
[[File:Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly - Animal Morgue, 2004.jpg|thumb|Animal morgue, 2004]]
The Animal Morgue (1934) is situated north of the Stable. The morgue is a cement-rendered concrete structure, square in plan, with a timber-framed pyramid roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A large metal ventilation fleche caps the ridge. A timber lean-to that is not significant shelters the entry doors. There are prominent stepped [[architraves]] around the exteriors of the windows. The interior walls are cement-rendered with coving to all corners. The floor is concrete, while the ceiling is white-painted cement sheet with dark- stained timber battens forming a geometric pattern. The ceiling features lattice timber ventilation panels and a skylight at the southern end made with translucent corrugated plastic sheeting. The double door is timber with multi-light glazed panels. The windows are multi-light, timber double-hung sashes and have external hinged timber-framed screens. There are small high level windows in the west wall. All glass in the building is obscured. A steel I-beam [[Span (architecture)|spans]] the width of the room from north to south. In the north-western corner is a concrete dissecting bench with drain and in the north-eastern corner is a similar bench with a ceramic sink and associated foot-operated tap. These tables drain to an integrated concrete surface gutter that runs around the western and northern edges of the floor. There is a central floor drain.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Veterinary School Main Building ===
[[File:Vet School main building (2011).jpg|thumb|Vet School main building, 2011]]
The Veterinary School Main Building is located to the south-east of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building, facing east towards Fairfield Road. It is a large, single storey, U-shaped building of brick construction with a hipped roof clad with tiles. The building is notable for its Interwar Classical design and detailing, including its symmetrical plan form, high ceilings, interior colour scheme of white paint and dark-stained timber, and the rhythmic placement of its windows. The exterior of the building is glazed brick with cream- painted, cement-rendered dressings. The symmetrical front facade has a central pedimented entry and flanking wings with rhythmically placed windows terminating in projecting bays. The entry is prominent, having brick planters and metal [[pedestal]] lights with large globe-shaped shades. A metal [[awning]] shelters the door and is not significant.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The entry foyer has a terrazzo floor, rendered walls scored to imitate stonework, moulded timber picture rail, decorative plaster cornice, and stained and clear lacquered timber doors with leaded glazing panels, [[sidelights]], and fanlights. A timber-framed reception window opens into the adjacent room. The room features timber, wall-hung display cabinet and pigeon holes, and a large amount of veterinary science paraphernalia.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building plan is arranged around a central corridor that runs down all wings providing access to variously sized rooms on either side. The entry (eastern) wing contains laboratories, offices, toilets, and store rooms. The southern wing contains similar spaces and also a dark room and the post-mortem room. This is a large room, its floor set lower than the other rooms with coved concrete skirtings. It has a large doorway to the exterior in-filled with more recent glazing and a timber door, and a steel I-beam on the ceiling above the door. The northern wing again contains laboratories, offices and store rooms, but also a large lecture room with dais and kitchenette, and an equine operating theatre. Another large room, it has concrete floors, coved concrete skirtings, walls tiled to shoulder height, a steel I-beam and hoist trolley fixed to the ceiling above the large doorway to the exterior.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School building interior has sheeting and batten cover strips lining its ceilings in a geometric pattern. The ceiling ventilation panels have all been sheeted over. Walls are rendered, and floors are finished with carpet, vinyl, or sealed concrete coved to the walls. There are dark-stained and clear-finished timber skirtings, cornices, picture rails, and architraves in most rooms. Room names are painted on timber panels and fixed above doorways. The timber doors match the other timberwork in the building with circular, glass observation panels, or panels with bolection moulding. Most retain original brass hardware and some the original auto-closers. Windows are timber-framed double-hung sashes or timber-framed fixed panes; many of which have external, hinged, timber-framed screens and retain original brass hardware.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building retains many original items of built-in and freestanding furniture including terrazzo-topped, cantilevered concrete work benches, solid timber cabinets, drawers, cupboards, ceramic pedestal basins, wall-hung timber display cases, and picture frames. The toilets retain original partitions and doors as well as many fixtures and fittings. Cupboards and store rooms retain original timber shelving.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The main facade of the building looks to the east and a grassed area where a large, circular garden bed formed by concrete edging is positioned. Its shape and extent are significant but not the edging. In its centre is a steel flagpole dating from the period of the School's occupation during WWII. The building wings facing to the west enclose a small [[courtyard]] which has large sections of concrete pathway and some plantings, none of which are significant.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Veterinary School Hospital Block ===
[[File:Vet School Hospital Block (2011).jpg|thumb|Vet School Hospital Block, 2011]]
The Veterinary School Hospital Block is located to the west of the Veterinary School Main Building and its L-shaped plan completes a large grassed courtyard between the two. The hospital block is long and narrow with small stalls for animals along the western range, a two-level, brick fodder store in the south-western corner, a series of work rooms by the yard entrance on the north-west, further work rooms in the southern range terminating to the east with a blacksmith's room with forge and [[chimney]]. It combines glazed brickwork (the same as in the Veterinary School Main Building adjacent) and timber construction with a hipped roof over the fodder store and skillion roofs elsewhere; all clad with corrugated metal sheets. The interior walls of the animal stalls are painted brick with concrete floors. Enclosure on the yard side is by timber half-doors, steel mesh, and fly screens. Small, high-level windows feature on the rear wall. A timber and mesh enclosure runs along the front of the animal stalls and a concrete [[Apron (architecture)|apron]] with drain extends into the courtyard. The workrooms and blacksmith's room have timber double-hung sash windows and ceilings of jointed boarding. The forge is sheeted over internally. The upper level of the fodder store is accessed by a timber stair and door on its western facade, where a large timber beam and part of a pulley is fixed to the ceiling above the doorway. There is evidence of a trap door into the lower level. The three-bay garage on the northern end of the hospital block's western range of rooms opens to the north. Adjacent to this is a small reception office, gate, and store rooms that attach to the north-western end of the Veterinary School Main Building.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Additions have been made to the western side of the Hospital Block and are not of heritage significance. Nor are the garages that were part of its original construction (1938–40).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
The Animal Research Institute Buildings were listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 13 June 2008 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The Animal Research Institute at Yeerongpilly was the oldest facility of its kind in Queensland, its work having begun with the establishment of the Stock Experiment Station in 1909 - the state's first purpose-built, farm-based animal research laboratory - and continued until its closure in 2010. The place demonstrates the enduring importance of the pastoral primary industries to Queensland's economy and the commitment of successive governments to supporting this industry through scientific research into its productivity, most particularly the diseases that threatened its profitability.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School Main Building and Hospital Block (1938-1940) were the first purpose-built facility for tertiary-level veterinary science training in Queensland. The buildings demonstrate the formalisation of professional training in the medical and veterinary sciences, and its physical association within professional facilities, an approach being strongly advocated by the state government at the time.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Over the course of its long history the Animal Research Institute (former) has accommodated the work of the state government's Animal Research Institute, the University of Queensland Veterinary School and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The place is associated with important scientific advances in diagnostic research into the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock, and the development and supply of vaccines, to which all of these organisations have contributed.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The circular garden bed and flagpole at the front of the Veterinary School Main Building provide the only evidence of the occupation of it, and other parts of the site now demolished, by the United States Army during World War II. The 3rd Medical Laboratory, based there from 1942 until 1943 when the 8th Medical Laboratory took its place, played an important role in safeguarding the health of US troops operating in a tropical environment and was the only laboratory in the South West Pacific Area until mid 1943.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

The Stock Experiment Station Main Building (1909), Stable (1909) and Animal Morgue (1934) are important as a demonstration of the principal characteristics of an animal research facility, comprising research laboratories, offices, animal accommodation and handling, and facility for conducting post mortems.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School Main Building and Hospital Block (1938-1940) are important as a demonstration of the principal characteristics of Queensland's first veterinary school, including formally composed facades, offices, a lecture room, library, laboratories, animal operating and post-mortem rooms, animal stalls, fodder store and blacksmith.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Stock Experiment Station Main Building, Animal Morgue, Veterinary School Main Building, and Hospital Block are substantially intact and retain original interior and exterior detailing to facilitate superior functionality, as well as built-in and loose furniture, fixtures, and fittings used specifically for performing animal research, all of which provide a clear demonstration of the original function of the place.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''

The core of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building and the Stable, the earliest parts of the former Animal Research Institute, have a special association with Charles Joseph Pound (b. 1866, d. 1946), the inaugural director of the Queensland Stock Institute, the first such laboratory in Australia, and head of the facility at Yeerongpilly from 1910 to 1932 when he retired. Pound is credited with the research and development that provided a means of preventing the spread of Redwater Disease, which caused heavy losses to Queensland's vital cattle industry during the late nineteenth century. Under the auspices of the Institute Pound conducted the first inoculation studies into this disease in Australia and established a methodology and dosage that are still used worldwide.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The former Animal Research Institute also has a special association with the internationally renowned parasitologist and entomologist Dr Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts (b. 1901, d. 1972) who began work at the Yeerongpilly research facility in 1933 when it was known as the Animal Health Station. Following World War II, he returned to work at Yeerongpilly and under his direction as principal research officer and officer-in-charge of CSIRO's veterinary parasitology laboratory (1947-1966) the Yeerongpilly institute gained an international reputation for its studies of parasitic diseases in cattle.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

[[Image:0008MAN-KourosHead2.jpg|left|thumb|Head of a kouros in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] bearing a typical '''archaic smile'''.]]

The '''Archaic smile''' was used by Greek Archaic sculptors,&lt;ref name=AT/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; especially in the second quarter of the 6th century BCE, possibly to suggest that their subject was alive, and infused with a sense of well-being. One of the most famous examples of the Archaic Smile is the [[Kroisos Kouros]]. 

The dying warrior from the west pediment of the Temple of Aphaia, Aegina, Greece is an interesting context as the warrior is near death.

In the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] Period of [[ancient Greece]] (roughly 600&amp;nbsp;BCE to 480&amp;nbsp;BCE), the art that proliferated contained images of people who had the archaic smile.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

During those two centuries before the mid-5th century BCE, the archaic smile was widely sculpted, as evidenced by statues found in excavations all across the Greek mainland, Asia Minor, and on islands in the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name=AT/&gt; It has been theorized that in this period, artists felt it either represents that they were blessed by the gods in their actions, thus the smile, or that it is similar to pre-planned smiles in modern photos.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}.
[[Image:Moscophoros22.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Moscophoros]]'' of the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], ca 570 BCE]]
The significance of the convention is not known, although it is often assumed that for the Greeks this kind of smile reflected a state of ideal health and well-being. It is best anthropological practice to assume expertise in execution of craft and to look for formal/stylistic reasons why cultural artifacts appear as they do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://veronica2305.tripod.com/Archaic%20Age.htm Middle Archaic Phase(Smile)] Retrieved 24 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been suggested that it is simply the result of a technical difficulty in fitting the curved shape of the mouth to the somewhat blocklike head typical of Archaic sculpture. Richard Neer theorizes that the Archaic Smile may actually be a marker of status since aristocrats of multiple cities throughout Greece were referred to as the ''Geleontes'' or "smiling ones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2012|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are alternative views to the archaic smile being "flat and quite unnatural looking". This is how [[John Fowles]] describes the archaic smile in his novel ''[[The Magus (novel)|The Magus]]'' (Chapter 23): "...full of the purest metaphysical good humour [...] timelessly intelligent and timelessly amused. [...] Because a star explodes and a thousand worlds like ours die, we know this world is. That is the smile: that what might not be, is [...] When I die, I shall have this by my bedside. It is the last human face I want to see." To viewers habituated to [[realism (arts)|realism]], it could be seen as a movement towards naturalism.

{{infobox barium}}
'''Barium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Ba''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;56. It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery [[alkaline earth metal]]. Because of its high chemical [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern times as [[Barium hydroxide|baryta]], does not occur as a [[mineral]], but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.

The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are [[Baryte|barite]] (now called baryte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/min-549.html |website=www.mindat.org |title=Baryte: Baryte mineral information and data.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nrmima.nrm.se&lt;/ref&gt;) ([[barium sulfate]], BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[witherite]] ([[barium carbonate]], BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), both insoluble in water. The name ''barium'' originates from the alchemical derivative "baryta", from [[Greek language|Greek]] βαρύς (''barys''), meaning "heavy." ''Baric'' is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of [[electrolysis]].

Barium has few industrial applications.  Historically, it was used as a [[getter]] for [[vacuum tube]]s and in oxide form as the emissive coating on [[Hot cathode#Oxide-coated cathodes|indirectly heated cathodes]]. It is a component of [[Yttrium barium copper oxide|YBCO]] ([[High-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductors]]) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. [[Barium sulfate]] is used as an insoluble additive to [[oil well]] [[drilling fluid]], as well as in a purer form, as X-ray [[radiocontrast agent]]s for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. The soluble barium [[ion]] and soluble compounds are poisonous, and have been used as [[rodenticide]]s.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[File:Barium 1.jpg|thumb|left|Oxidized barium]]
Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kresse, Robert |author2=Baudis, Ulrich |author3=Jäger, Paul |author4=Riechers, H. Hermann |author5=Wagner, Heinz |author6=Winkler, Jocher |author7=Wolf, Hans Uwe |chapter=Barium and Barium Compounds |editor=Ullman, Franz |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |date=2007 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon [[redox|oxidation]] in air yielding a dark gray [[Barium oxide|oxide]] layer. Barium has a medium [[specific weight]] and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is very difficult to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

At room temperature and pressure, barium has a [[body-centered cubic]] structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 [[picometer]]s, expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1.8{{e|-5}}/°C.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} It is a very soft metal with a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1.25.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Its melting temperature of {{convert|1000|K|C F}}&lt;ref name="Lide2004"&gt;{{cite book|last = Lide |first= D.

Barium is chemically similar to magnesium, calcium, and strontium, but even more reactive. It always exhibits the oxidation state of +2, except in a few rare and unstable molecular species that are only characterised in the gas phase such as BaF.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Reactions with [[chalcogen]]s are highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]] (release energy); the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature, and therefore barium is stored under oil or in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Reactions with other [[nonmetal]]s, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and hydrogen, are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|2–3}} Reactions with water and alcohols are very exothermic and release hydrogen gas:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
: Ba + 2 ROH → Ba(OR)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑ (R is an alkyl group or a hydrogen atom)

Barium reacts with [[ammonia]] to form complexes such as Ba(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

The metal is readily attacked by most acids. [[Sulfuric acid]] is a notable exception because [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] stops the reaction by forming the insoluble [[barium sulfate]] on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Müller, Hermann|chapter=Sulfuric Acid and Sulfur Trioxide|editor=Ullman, Franz|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|date=2007|publisher=Wiley-VCH|doi=10.1002/14356007.a03_325.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barium combines with several metals, including [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[lead]], and [[tin]], forming [[intermetallics|intermetallic phases]] and alloys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Ferro, Riccardo|author2= Saccone, Adriana|last-author-amp= yes|page=355|title=Intermetallic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|date=2008|isbn=978-0-08-044099-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and barium ions provide no specific coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=87|title=Qualitative analysis and the properties of ions in aqueous solution|author=Slowinski, Emil J.|author2=Masterton, William L.|publisher=Saunders|date=1990|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-03-031234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are denser than the [[strontium]] or [[calcium]] analogs, except for the [[halide]]s (see table; [[zinc]] is given for comparison).

[[Barium hydroxide]] ("baryta") was known to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.

Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green [[flame test|flame]], which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound. The color results from [[spectral line]]s at 455.4, 493.4, 553.6, and 611.1&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;!---BaO forms a peroxide when heated in air.&lt;ref name=O2/&gt;---&gt;

===Isotopes===

Of the stable isotopes, barium-138 composes 71.7% of all barium, and the lighter the isotope, the less abundant.&lt;ref name="iso" /&gt;

In total, barium has about 50 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 114 and 153. The most stable metastable isotope is barium-133 with a half-life of approximately 10.51&amp;nbsp;years.  Five other isotopes have half-lives longer than a day.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt; Barium also has 10 [[meta state]]s, out of which barium-133m1 is the most stable with a half-life of about 39 hours.&lt;ref name="NUBASE" /&gt;&lt;!---&lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Ba is a standard calibrant for [[gamma-ray]] detectors in nuclear physics studies.---&gt;

==History==
[[File:Humphry Davy Engraving 1830.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]], who first isolated barium metal]]
Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral baryte were found in volcanic rock near [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], and so were called "Bologna stones." Alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The phosphorescent properties of baryte heated with organics were described by V. Casciorolus in 1602.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

[[Carl Scheele]] determined that baryte contained a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only [[barium oxide]]. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] also isolated [[barium oxide]] two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called "barote" by [[Guyton de Morveau]], a name that was changed by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] to ''baryta.'' Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist [[William Withering]] noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of [[Cumberland]], now known to be [[witherite]]. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Davy, H. (1808) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=102 Electro-chemical researches on the decomposition of the earths; with observations on the metals obtained from the alkaline earths, and on the amalgam procured from ammonia]," ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', vol. 98, pp. 333–370.&lt;/ref&gt; Davy, by analogy with [[calcium]], named "barium" after baryta, with the "-ium" ending signifying a metallic element.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book| page = 80| url = https://books.google.com/?id=yb9xTj72vNAC| title = The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide| author = Krebs, Robert E. | publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| date = 2006| isbn = 0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bunsen]] and [[Augustus Matthiessen]] obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[barium chloride]] and [[ammonium chloride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1002/jlac.18550930301|title = Masthead|date = 1855|journal = Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume = 93|issue = 3|pages = fmi–fmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1002/prac.18560670194|title =Notizen|date =1856|last1 =Wagner|first1 =Rud|last2 =Neubauer|first2 =C.|last3 =Deville|first3 =H.

The production of pure oxygen in the [[Brin process]] was a large-scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s, before it was replaced by electrolysis and [[fractional distillation]] of liquefied air in the early 1900s. In this process barium oxide reacts at {{convert|500|-|600|C|F}} with air to form barium peroxide, which decomposes above {{convert|700|C}} by releasing oxygen:&lt;ref name=O2&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Jensen|first1 = William B.|title = The Origin of the Brin Process for the Manufacture of Oxygen|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|volume = 86|pages = 1266|date = 2009|doi = 10.1021/ed086p1266|issue = 11 |bibcode = 2009JChEd..86.1266J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA681|page = 681|title = The development of modern chemistry|isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2|author1 = Ihde, Aaron John|date = 1984-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
The abundance of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13&amp;nbsp;µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is baryte (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}} with deposits in many parts of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than baryte, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

The baryte reserves are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion [[tonne]]s. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, was produced in 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|5}} Baryte production has risen since the second half of the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. M.

The mined ore is washed, crushed, classified, and separated from quartz. If the quartz penetrates too deeply into the ore, or the iron, zinc, or lead content is abnormally high, then [[froth flotation]]&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=zNicdkuulE4C&amp;pg=PA223--&gt; is used. The product is a 98% pure baryte (by mass); the purity should be no less than 95%, with a minimal content of iron and [[silicon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|7}} It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}}
:BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 C → BaS + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;↑

The water-soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds: reacting BaS with oxygen produces the sulfate, with nitric acid the nitrate, with carbon dioxide the carbonate, and so on.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}} The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|6}} Barium metal is produced by reduction with [[aluminium]] at {{convert|1100|C}}. The [[intermetallic compound]] BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is produced first:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:3 BaO + 14 Al → 3 BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an intermediate reacted with barium oxide to produce the metal. Note that not all barium is reduced.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:8 BaO + BaAl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Ba&amp;darr; + 7 BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide:&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:BaO + Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

and the overall reaction is&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}
:4 BaO + 2 Al → 3 Ba&amp;darr; + BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

Barium vapor is condensed and packed into molds in an atmosphere of argon.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure barium.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

A similar reaction with silicon at {{convert|1200|C}} yields barium and [[barium metasilicate]].&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and the product is rather impure.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Gemstone===
The barium mineral, [[benitoite]] (barium titanium silicate), occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of [[California]].

==Applications==

===Metal and alloys===
Barium, as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium, is used to remove unwanted gases ([[getter]]ing) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}} Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low [[vapor pressure]] and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}

Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to [[silumin]] (aluminium–silicon alloys) that refines their structure, as well as&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|4}}
* [[bearing alloy]]s;
* lead–tin [[solder]]ing alloys – to increase the creep resistance;
* alloy with nickel for [[spark plug]]s;
* additive to steel and cast iron as an inoculant;
* alloys with calcium, manganese, silicon, and aluminium as high-grade steel deoxidizers.

===Barium sulfate and baryte===
[[File:BariumXray.jpg|thumb|left|[[Amoebiasis]] as seen in a radiograph of a barium-filled colon]]
[[Barium sulfate]] (the mineral baryte, BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is important to the petroleum industry as a [[drilling fluid]] in [[oil well|oil and gas wells]].&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} The precipitate of the compound (called "blanc fixe", from the French for "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes; as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers; as a paper coating pigment; and in [[nanoparticle]]s, to improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.&lt;ref name="Ullman2005" /&gt;{{rp|9}}

Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca. 4.5&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it is used as a [[radiocontrast]] agent in [[medical imaging|X-ray imaging]] of the digestive system ("[[barium meal]]s" and "[[Lower gastrointestinal series|barium enemas]]").&lt;ref name="Lide2004" /&gt;{{rp|4–5}} [[Lithopone]], a [[pigment]] that contains barium sulfate and [[zinc sulfide]], is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 102| url = https://books.google.com/?id=uEJHsZWyO-EC| title= Medicinal applications of coordination chemistry| author = Jones, Chris J.| author2 = Thornback, John| last-author-amp = yes | publisher =Royal Society of Chemistry| date = 2007| isbn =0-85404-596-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other barium compounds===

Other compounds of barium find only niche applications, limited by the toxicity of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (barium carbonate is a [[rat poison]]), which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal is kept in an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.&lt;ref name=bariumtoxic/&gt;

'''Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage''' ('''BECCS''') is a potential [[climate change mitigation|greenhouse gas mitigation]] technology which produces [[negative carbon dioxide emission]]s by combining [[bioenergy]] (energy from [[biomass]]) use with [[Geology|geologic]] [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref name=Obersteiner&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.294.5543.786b |title=Managing Climate Risk |year=2001 |last1=Obersteiner |first1=M. |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5543 |pages=786–7 |pmid=11681318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of BECCS is drawn from the integration of trees and crops, which extract [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the atmosphere as they grow, the use of this biomass in processing industries or power plants, and the application of [[carbon capture and storage]] via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection into geological formations.&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"&gt;{{Cite web

In the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), BECCS was indicated as a key technology for reaching low carbon dioxide atmospheric concentration targets.&lt;ref name=IPCC2007&gt;{{cite book |first1=Brian |last1=Fisher |first2=Nebojsa |last2=Nakicenovic |first3=Knut |last3=Alfsen |first4=Jan Corfee |last4=Morlot |first5=Francisco |last5=de la Chesnaye |first6=Jean-Charles |last6=Hourcade |first7=Kejun |last7=Jiang |first8=Mikiko |last8=Kainuma |first9=Emilio |last9=La Rovere |chapter=Issues related to mitigation in the long-term context |chapterurl=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter3.pdf |pages=169–250 |editor1-first=Bert |editor1-last=Metz |title=Climate Change 2007: Mitigation of Climate Change |series=Working Group III contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC |isbn=978-0-521-88011-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The negative emissions that can be produced by BECCS has been estimated by the [[Royal Society]] to be equivalent to a 50 to 150 [[Parts per million|ppm]] decrease in [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations]]&lt;ref name=RoyalSociety&gt;{{Cite web

==Negative emission==

[[Image:Carbon flow.jpg|thumb|400px|Carbon flow schematic for different energy systems.]]

The main appeal of BECCS is in its ability to result in negative emissions of [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The capture of carbon dioxide from [[bioenergy]] sources effectively removes CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=read&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2004.07.003 |title=Bio-energy with carbon storage (BECS): A sequential decision approach to the threat of abrupt climate change |year=2005 |last1=Read |first1=Peter |last2=Lermit |first2=Jonathan |journal=Energy |volume=30 |issue=14 |pages=2654}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bio-energy is derived from biomass which is a [[renewable energy source]] and serves as a carbon sink during its growth. During industrial processes, the biomass combusted or processed re-releases the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere. The process thus results in a net zero emission of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, though this may be positively or negatively altered depending on the carbon emissions associated with biomass growth, transport and processing, see below under environmental considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bbb.3 |title=Food and fuel for all: Realistic or foolish? |year=2007 |last1=g. Cassman |first1=Kenneth |last2=Liska |first2=Adam J. |journal=Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining |volume=1 |pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbon capture and storage]] (CCS) technology serves to intercept the release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the atmosphere and redirect it into geological storage locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0961-9534(03)00013-8 |title=Potential market niches for biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage—Opportunities for energy supply with negative CO2 emissions |year=2003 |last1=Möllersten |first1=Kenneth |last2=Yan |first2=Jinyue |last3=r. Moreira |first3=Jose |journal=Biomass and Bioenergy |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a biomass origin is not only released from biomass fuelled power plants, but also during the production of [[Pulp (paper)|pulp]] used to make paper and in the production of biofuels such as [[biogas]] and [[bioethanol]]. The BECCS technology can also be employed on such industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0360-5442(03)00002-1 |title=Potential and cost-effectiveness of CO2 reductions through energy measures in Swedish pulp and paper mills |year=2003 |last1=Möllersten |first1=K. |last2=Yan |first2=J. |last3=Westermark |first3=M. |journal=Energy |volume=28 |issue=7 |pages=691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that through the BECCS technology, carbon dioxide is trapped in geologic formations for very long periods of time, whereas for example a tree only stores its carbon during its lifetime. In its report on the CCS technology, IPCC projects that more than 99% of carbon dioxide which is stored through geologic sequestration is likely to stay in place for more than 1000 years. While other types of carbon sinks such as the ocean, trees and soil may involve the risk of [[negative feedback loop]]s at increased temperatures, BECCS technology is likely to provide a better permanence by storing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in geological formations.&lt;ref name="Global Status of BECCS Projects 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCC5&gt;IPCC, (2005)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter5.pdf  "Chapter 5: Underground geological storage" IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.] Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. De Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, pp195-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that has been released  to date is believed to be too much to be able to be absorbed by conventional sinks such as trees and soil in order to reach low emission targets.&lt;ref name=hare&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-9027-9 |title=How Much Warming are We Committed to and How Much can be Avoided? |year=2006 |last1=Hare |first1=Bill |last2=Meinshausen |first2=Malte |journal=Climatic Change |volume=75 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the presently accumulated emissions, there will be significant additional emissions during this century, even in the most ambitious low-emission scenarios. BECCS has therefore been suggested as a technology to reverse the emission trend and create a global system of net negative emissions.&lt;ref name=Obersteiner/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPCC2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=hare/&gt;&lt;ref name=Azar&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10584-005-3484-7 |title=Carbon Capture and Storage from Fossil Fuels and Biomass – Costs and Potential Role in Stabilizing the Atmosphere |year=2006 |last1=Azar |first1=Christian |last2=Lindgren |first2=Kristian |last3=Larson |first3=Eric |last4=Möllersten |first4=Kenneth |journal=Climatic Change |volume=74 |pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2007.09.005 |title=System study of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture in bio-based motor fuel production |year=2008 |last1=Lindfeldt |first1=Erik G. |last2=Westermark |first2=Mats O. |journal=Energy |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the emissions would not only be zero, but negative, so that not only the emissions, but the absolute amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere would be reduced.

==Technology==
{{Main|Carbon capture and storage}}
The main technology for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture from biotic sources generally employs the same technology as carbon dioxide capture from conventional fossil fuel sources. Broadly, three different types of technologies exist: [[post combustion capture|post-combustion]], [[pre-combustion]], and [[Oxy-fuel combustion process|oxy-fuel combustion]].&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, (2005)[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_chapter3.pdf "Chapter 3: Capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage.] Prepared by Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Metz, B., O. Davidson, H. C. De Coninck, M. Loos, and L. A. Meyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, pp 105-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cost==

The [[sustainability|sustainable]] technical potential for net negative emissions with BECCS has been estimated to 10 [[Gigatonne|Gt]] of {{CO2}} equivalent annually, with an economic potential of up to 3.5 Gt of {{CO2}} equivalent annually at a cost of less than 50 €/tonne, and up to 3.9 Gt of {{CO2}} equivalent annually at a cost of less than 100 €/tonne.&lt;ref name="IEA-GHG Ecofys BECCS report"&gt;{{citation

Currently, most schematic BECCS systems are not cost-efficient compared to normal CCS. The IPCC states that estimations for BECCS cost range from $60-$250 per ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-ccs-idUSBREA2P1LK20140326|title=Extracting carbon from nature can aid climate but will be costly: U.N.|date=2017-03-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, "normal" CCS (from coal and natural gas processing) costs have been decreasing to less than $35 per ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.c2es.org/technology/factsheet/CCS|title=Carbon Capture Use and Storage {{!}} Center for Climate and Energy Solutions|website=www.c2es.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With limited large-scale testing, BECCS faces many challenges to be a financially viable alternative.

==Policy==

Based on the current [[Kyoto Protocol]] agreement, carbon capture and storage projects are not applicable as an emission reduction tool to be used for the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM) or for [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/climat/emission/index_en.htm Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) from ec.europa.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising CCS technologies as an emission reduction tool is vital for the implementation of such plants as there is no other financial motivation for the implementation of such systems. There has been growing support to have fossil CCS and BECCS included in the protocol. Accounting studies on how this can be implemented, including BECCS, have also been done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11027-006-9034-9 |title=Equal Opportunity for Biomass in Greenhouse Gas Accounting of CO2 Capture and Storage: A Step Towards More Cost-Effective Climate Change Mitigation Regimes |year=2006 |last1=Grönkvist |first1=Stefan |last2=Möllersten |first2=Kenneth |last3=Pingoud |first3=Kim |journal=Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies for Global Change |volume=11 |issue=5–6 |pages=1083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techno-economics of BECCS and the TESBiC Project==

The largest and most detailed techno-economic assessment of BECCS was carried out by cmcl innovations and the TESBiC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmclinnovations.com/TESBIC |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106035708/http://www.cmclinnovations.com/TESBIC/ |archivedate=2012-11-06 |df= }}{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; group (Techno-Economic Study of Biomass to CCS) in 2012. This project recommended the most promising set of biomass fueled power generation technologies coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The project outcomes lead to a detailed “biomass CCS roadmap” for the U.K..

== Environmental considerations==
{{See also|Issues relating to biofuels}}
Some of the environmental considerations and other concerns about the widespread implementation of BECCS are similar to those of CCS. However, much of the critique towards CCS is that it may strengthen the dependency on depletable fossil fuels and environmentally invasive coal mining. This is not the case with BECCS, as it relies on renewable biomass. There are however other considerations which involve BECCS and these concerns are related to the possible increased use of [[biofuels]].

Biomass production is subject to a range of sustainability constraints, such as: scarcity of arable land and fresh water, [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], competition with food production, [[deforestation]] and scarcity of phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;Ignacy, S.: (2007) [http://www.unctad.org/en/docs/ditcted200712_en.pdf  "The Biofuels Controversy"], United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 12&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to make sure that biomass is used in a way that maximizes both energy and climate benefits. There has been criticism to some suggested BECCS deployment scenarios, where there would be a very heavy reliance on increased biomass input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=https://news.mongabay.com/2007/11/carbon-negative-bioenergy-to-cut-global-warming-could-drive-deforestation/

Large areas of land would be required to operate BECCS on an industrial scale. To remove 10 billion tons of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, upwards of 300 million hectares of land area (larger than India) would be required.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a result, BECCS risks using land that could be better suited to agriculture and food production, especially in developing countries.

These systems may have other negative side effects. There is however presently no need to expand the use of biofuels in energy or industry applications to allow for BECCS deployment. There is already today considerable emissions from point sources of biomass derived CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which could be utilized for BECCS. Though, in possible future bio-energy system upscaling scenarios, this may be an important consideration.

The BECCS process allows CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be collected and stored directly from the atmosphere, rather than from a fossil source. This implies that any eventual emissions from storage may be recollected and restored simply by reiterating the BECCS-process. This is not possible with CCS alone, as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted to the atmosphere cannot be restored by burning more fossil fuel with CCS.

== Current projects ==
Most CCS projects include adding capture to an existing power plant, usually coal or another fossil fuel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-negative-emissions-tested-worlds-first-major-beccs-facility|title=Analysis: Negative emissions tested at world's first major BECCS facility {{!}} Carbon Brief|date=2016-05-31|work=Carbon Brief|access-date=2017-05-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With complete capture, these processes would be carbon neutral. Decatur, Illinois in the United States has many corn plants run by [[Archer Daniels Midland]] (ADM), where corn is processed into syrups and ethanol.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The plant emits high amounts of carbon dioxide as a byproduct of the process. With the CCS fitting, the plant ideally becomes carbon negative, since corn absorbs carbon dioxide when it grows, and all the carbon dioxide produced during processing is being captured and sequestered in the [[Mount Simon Sandstone|Mount Simon]] sandstone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The project cannot be completely carbon negative, as carbon dioxide is produced during the combustion of the ethanol that is being produced. The project is one of the only CCS projects in use to not be coupled with [[Enhanced oil recovery|EOR]]. The Southern Illinois Basin is considered one of the best injection sites, due to its sandstone composition and depth (injection site is 2,000 meters below the surface),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/global-status-beccs-projects-2010/5-decatur-illinois-united-states|title=5. Decatur, Illinois, United States {{!}} Global CCS Institute|website=hub.globalccsinstitute.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its possible capacity (geologists project storage capacity of 27-109 Gt carbon dioxide).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalccsinstitute.com/projects/illinois-industrial-carbon-capture-and-storage-project|title=Illinois Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage Project {{!}} Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute|website=www.globalccsinstitute.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blackwater''' is a form of [[pollution]] produced in [[coal preparation plant|coal preparation]].&lt;ref name=def&gt;{{cite web|title=Modelling and Control of Blackwater Treatment in Coal Preparation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01496398108058319#.UvKtBvl_vJE|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Control of blackwater in coal preparation plant recycle and discharge.

After the recovery of the coal particles from this slurry, the remaining water is black, contains very fine particles of coal.  This blackwater cannot be [[industrial wastewater treatment|processed in a water treatment plant]].&lt;ref&gt;Shiao-Hung Chiang and James T. Cobb "Coal Conversion Processes, Cleaning and Desulfurization" in Kirk-othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology Wiley-VCH, 2000. {{DOI|10.1002/0471238961.0312050103080901.a01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disasters==
Impoundments for storage of blackwater and other coal-related wastes have a troubled history with often severe environmental consequences.

In February 1972, three dams holding a mixture of coal slurry in [[Logan County, West Virginia]] failed in succession:  {{convert|130000000|USgal|m3}} of [[toxic]] water were released in the [[Buffalo Creek Flood]].  As discussed in the book [[The Buffalo Creek Flood: An Act of Man]], out of a population of 5,000 people, 125 people were killed, 1,121 were injured, and over 4,000 were left homeless. The flood caused 50 million dollars in damages. Despite evidence of negligence, the [[Pittston Coal Company]], which owned the compromised dam, called the event an "[[Act of God]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Environmental Justice Case Study: Buffalo Creek Disaster | url=http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/Jones/buffalo.html#Problem | accessdate=October 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, a {{convert|900|ft|m|sing=on}} high, {{convert|2000|ft|m|sing=on}} long valley fill in [[Lyburn, West Virginia]] failed and slid into a sediment pond at the toe of the fill, generating a large wave of water and sediment that destroyed several cars and houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Massey Valley Fill Disaster, Lyburn, WV | url=http://www.ohvec.org/galleries/mountaintop_removal/006/index.html | date=2002-07-19 | accessdate=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies''' ('''CMRS''') in [[Oxford]], [[England]], is a programme for international students (mainly American) to study in Oxford, and also encourages research in the humanities and fields of medieval and renaissance studies. It was founded by Dr. John and Dr. Sandra J.K.M Feneley in 1975. In 2014, CMRS became part of the global network of Middlebury College C.V. Starr Schools Abroad and is now known as the Middlebury College-CMRS Oxford Humanities Program (M-CMRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/study-abroad/medieval-renaissance-studies|title=United Kingdom {{!}} Middlebury|work=Middlebury|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CMRS has long been affiliated with [[Keble College, Oxford]], and participants are associate members of the College with access to all its facilities. Among the American colleges and universities that have sent students to CMRS are [[The University of Georgia]], [[Elmhurst College]], [[St. Mary's College of California]], [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]], [[St. Olaf College]], [[William Jewell College]], [[Middlebury College]].

CMRS is located in St. Michael's Hall on Shoe Lane, close to [[Carfax, Oxford|Carfax]] at the very center of Oxford. St Michael's Hall is a large building and contains, among other things, a lecture hall, teaching rooms, offices for the M-CMRS  administration, the Feneley Library, and several floors of student accommodation, including a kitchen, dining room, and Junior Common Room.

Ten weeks of each semester coincide with Oxford University's Michaelmas or Hilary Terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''''chreia''''' or '''''chria''''' ({{lang-el|[[wikt:χρεία#Ancient Greek|χρεία]]}}) was, in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]], both a genre of literature and one of the [[progymnasmata]].

==Definition==

A chreia was a brief, useful (χρεία means "use") anecdote about a particular character.  That is, a chreia was shorter than a narration—often as short as a single sentence—but unlike a maxim, it was attributed to a character.  Usually it conformed to one of a few patterns, the most common being "On seeing..." (ιδών or ''cum vidisset''), "On being asked..." (ἐρωτηθείς or ''interrogatus''), and "He said..." (ἔφη or ''dixit'').&lt;ref&gt;On the meaning of ''chria'' cf. Quintilian, ''Institutio oratoria'' 1,9,4. and Seneca, ''Epistulae morales'' 33,7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The following chreia, the most common in ancient sources, is illustrative:

{{Quotation|[[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], on seeing a youth misbehaving, struck his [[pedagogy|paedagogus]], adding "Why do you teach such things?"}}

Chreiai could be silly:

{{Quotation|[[Olympias]], on hearing that her son [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] was proclaiming himself the offspring of Zeus, said "Won't this fellow stop slandering me to Hera?"}}

Or solemn:

{{Quotation|A [[Sparta|Laconian]], who had become a prisoner of war and was being sold, on being asked by someone what he could do, said, "Be free."}}

Wise:

{{Quotation|[[Aristeides]], on being asked what justice is, said: "Not desiring the possessions of others."}}

Or witty:

{{Quotation|Diogenes, on being asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, said: "Because they suppose they might become lame and blind but they never suppose they might take up philosophy."}}

Or all of these:

{{Quotation|[[Socrates]] the philosopher, when a certain student named Apollodorus said to him, "The Athenians have unjustly condemned you to death," said with a laugh, "But did you want them to do it justly?"}}

As a literary genre the chreia was a subject of collection. Scholars such as [[Plutarch]] or [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] kept their own private collections of chreiai.  Published collections were also available.  The chreia is primarily known, however, for its role in education.  Students were introduced to simple chreiai almost as soon as they could read.  Later they practiced the complex grammar of Greek by putting these chreiai through changes of [[voice (grammar)|voice]] and [[grammatical tense|tense]].  As one of the last stages in their preparation for rhetoric—this is where chreiai serve as one of the progymnasmata—they would elaborate the theme of a chreiai into a formal eight-paragraph essay.  The student would praise, paraphrase, explain, contrast, compare, provide an example, make a judgment, and, in conclusion, exhort the reader.

Chreiai are also common in the [[New Testament]], mainly in the [[Gospel]]s. An example is in Mark 13: 1-2:

{{Quotation|And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down (King James Version.)}}

The famous passage in Luke 20: 21-25 also has the typical structure of a chreia, though its length is somewhat unusual:

{{Quotation|And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar's. And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's. (King James Version.)}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1221">'''Clean growth''' is a way to achieve [[economic growth]], using [[clean technology]], and allowing [[sustainable development]].

The aim is to rise standard of living with a reduced environmental impact.

Scientists and politicians use this terminology. For example, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said : 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our first goal is to find the way to achieve "clean" growth and I want to defend this idea here today. We haven't got to choose between saving the planet and growth. We need to have growth and save the planet. So we need a growth that consumes less energy and fewer raw materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26147">The '''Clore Leadership Programme''' is the first initiative of its kind in the UK aimed at developing and strengthening leadership across the cultural and creative sectors. The Programme was initiated in 2003 by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation] and is sustained by a partnership between private philanthropy and public funding. The organisation invests in individuals, drawing on their creative potential to raising the game in the arts and creative sectors.

The Programme awards its flagship Clore Fellowships annually to exceptional individuals drawn from across the UK and beyond, and runs a choice of programmes tailored to the leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=31&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are drawn from a range of specialisms including the visual and performing arts, film and digital media, libraries, museums, archives and heritage, and cultural policy. In the last 10 years, over 250 fellowships have been awarded and nearly 1000 leaders have attended the Short Courses, enabling the participants to form a well-networked and connected arts leadership sector. Graduates of the scheme dot the salient points of the cultural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008, By Simon Tait&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, in particular the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

==Background==
Initiated by the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation], and sustained by the Foundation's generous support, the Programme is the UK's first cross-disciplinary leadership programme for the cultural and creative sector. It was established as an independent organisation in 2004, after Dame [[Vivien Duffield]] had instigated research into the need for leadership training in the cultural programme.&lt;ref&gt;Arts Industry, 16 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; That research discovered that leadership development was often a question of accident rather than design, and that – without getting in the way of serendipity – it was time to put some of the design in place.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2011/dec/14/culture-leaders-clore-leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the vision of its Founding Director [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], the Programme focused initially on the Fellowship Programme, aimed at shaping creative leaders through in-depth learning, and tailored as far as possible to the needs, aspirations and circumstances of between 20 and 30 individuals a year. The structure of the Fellowship programme is based on recommendations which were made to the Clore Duffield Foundation by John Holden and [[Robert Hewison]], (see [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Full.pdf their report]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, and the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/cms/user_files/files/CLP%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report%20Summary.pdf Executive Summary]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). The course is unique outside the US, and includes workshops and residential courses, an extended placement, individually-selected training, mentoring and coaching, as well as opportunities for research and the development of skills.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was first established, the Clore Leadership Programme has been a pioneer in leadership development, a source of expert advice and an inspirational example for other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the [http://www.cloresocialleadership.org.uk/ Clore Social Leadership Programme].

Developments in the Programme since 2004 have included:

•	Intensive fortnight-long residential Short Courses

•	A Board Development programme, to strengthen governance in the cultural sector

•	The extension of the Fellowships to a small number of international participants

•	One- and two-day follow-up courses (Clore Plus)

•	An association with the University of Hong Kong to create Asia’s first Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme 
 
•	One-week courses for Emerging Leaders

•	The creation of consortia of large-scale national cultural organisations, to support the Fellowship programme

•	The introduction of leadership development days, run in partnership with other organisations

==Founders==
The founding Director of the Clore Leadership Programme was [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]], who from 1997–2001 had been Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.  In July 2008 he stepped down and was succeeded as Director by Sue Hoyle. The current Chair is [[Sandy Nairne]], former Director of the National Portrait Gallery.

==Courses==
From freelancers, entrepreneurs to heads of established institutions, the Clore Leadership Programme nurtures dynamic and diverse leaders. Each year, the Programme awards fellowships and designs programmes tailored to the varied leadership needs of arts professionals at different stages of their career. These include awarding the Clore Fellowship (annually), and running four residential Short Courses (each runs for a fortnight), an Emerging Leaders’ Course (a week’s residential programme) and a number of Clore Plus days (follow-up courses for those who have been through the various programmes at Clore). The Programme also works in partnership with others to deliver leadership development days.

===The Clore Fellowship Programme===

The flagship [http://www.cloreleadership.org/fellowships.aspx Clore Fellowship] is offered to arts and creative industries’ practitioners drawn primarily from the UK. The Fellowship spans a year of intense activity, and includes residential courses, group workshops, projects, and a customised programme of personal and professional development. Each Fellow embarks on a programme of tuition, research, training and secondment, tailored to their specific cultural sector, interests and aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 19 Jan 2008, By Peter Aspden&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main features that distinguishes Clore from other leadership programmes is the cross-cultural element. People doing the programme are drawn from the arts and culture sector in its widest sense, and Fellows are seconded to other cultural organisations rather than other libraries or organizations similar to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Impact, Journal of Career Development Group | Summer 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme offers a number of [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=53 International Fellowships] to exceptional individuals from prioritised countries outside the UK. These include Chevening Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office in countries such as India, China, Jordan and Egypt, and the Hong Kong Scholarships on the Clore Leadership Programme funded by the [http://www.hab.gov.hk/ Home Affairs Bureau] of the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The Clore Duffield Foundation supports the core costs of the Fellowship programme. Individual fellowships are supported by a range of public funders, philanthropic foundations, Consortia partners  and international partners, and are awarded to 25 and individual participants every year. The Programme also  occasionally accepts self-funded Fellowships.

===Short Course on Cultural Leadership===
[http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx Short Courses] offer numerous opportunities every year for ambitious and creative individuals to undergo a two-week intensive residential training course structured to deliver essential knowledge and skills required by cultural leaders today. The Short Course Programme is supported by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England], through a three-year commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cloreleadership.org/short-courses.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emerging Leaders’ Course===
The [http://www.cloreleadership.org/page.aspx?p=36 Emerging Leaders Programme] is a 5-day residential course aimed at people in the early stages of their career. This Programme is funded by [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England] through a commissioned grant to develop resilient leadership.

==Partners==
The work of the Clore Leadership Programme would not have been possible without the extensive support it receives from its funding partners drawn from the public, private and cultural sectors. The principal funders of the Programme are the [http://www.cloreduffield.org.uk/ Clore Duffield Foundation] and [http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/ Arts Council England]. The Programme is also supported by an mix of International Funders, Consortia Partners and Funders from UK and Ireland.

==Impact and Alumni==

The Clore Fellows and course participants have gone from strength to strength, steering new projects, establishing innovative arts organisations, enabling higher growth and assuming key leadership positions in the arts sectors all over the world. The results have been extraordinarily successful — Clore graduates are now in top jobs at the likes of the Royal Academy and the Arts Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable cultural leaders from the UK and abroad have walked through its doors and on to better jobs, including Gavin Reid, previously a trumpet player, who since undertaking the programme is now Director of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programme is rooted in the belief that organisations which deliberately foster leadership and support their future leaders, do better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529214430/http://www.internationalartsmanager.com/2014/05/22/wheres-next-generation-music-leaders/ |archivedate=2014-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other luminaries include Axel Rüger, formerly Curator of Dutch Paintings for the National Gallery, who has made the leap to Director of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam while Moira Sinclair, previously Director of Vital Arts, an arts and health initiative, is now Executive Director, Arts Council London.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/observations-clore-leadership-programme-provides-a-step-up-for-future-royal-ballet-supremos-1764846.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is predicted that their expertise will  play a major role in helping the arts weather the stormy years ahead.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme draws on the creative potential of leaders to raise the game in the arts and creative sectors. The idea behind initiating the Programme was to transform the cultural sector as a whole through the actions of emerging leaders and the work they do, both individually and collaboratively. As [[Nick Merriman]],  Director, Manchester Museum, University of Manchester, said:  “It (Clore Leadership Programme) has helped everyone take investment in leadership much more seriously and to think realistically about succession planning.” &lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside leadership development, the Programme has also had a positive impact on the sustainability of the entire sector  and is seen to have been a key player in “a silent revolution in the arts in Britain, where they are now incomparably better managed than they’ve ever been before.” &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/6230572/Clore-Leadership-Programme-enhances-the-arts.html&lt;/ref&gt;  “Thirty years ago, when faced with severe cuts, the sector almost collapsed. This is not the case now and that reflects the quality of the leadership we have. Clore has been a key part of that," said Mark Taylor, Director of the Museums Association.&lt;ref&gt;Museums Journal, June 2013, by John Holt&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clore Leadership Programme has not only succeeded in creating a cadre of creative and cultural leaders,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artsprofessional.co.uk/magazine/270/article/generous-leadership&lt;/ref&gt; but has stimulated investment in leadership on the part of governments, agencies, foundations and charities. The Programme has inspired other initiatives in the UK and beyond, including the Clore Social Leadership Programme for leaders from the social sector, Asia’s first [http://www.culture.hku.hk/ Advanced Cultural Leadership Programme] in Hong Kong, and a capacity-building course for arts managers in South Asia ([http://www.arthinksouthasia.org/ ARThink South Asia Fellowship]) created by a graduate of the Clore Programme.

'''Cog's ladder''' of group development is based on the work, "Cog's Ladder: A Model of Group Growth", by [[George O. Charrier]], an employee of [[Procter and Gamble]], published in a company newsletter in 1972.  The original document was written to help group managers at Procter and Gamble better understand the dynamics of group work, thus improving efficiency.  It is now also used by the [[United States Naval Academy]], the [[United States Air Force Academy]], and other businesses – to help in understanding group development.&lt;ref&gt;Malthus, T. R., &amp; Mandal, B. N. (2008). The Principle of population: An essay on principle of population, as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other writers. New Delhi, India: Global Vision Pub. House. p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
The basic idea of Cog's ladder is that there are five steps necessary for a small group of people to be able to work efficiently together.  These stages are the ''polite stage'', the ''why we're here stage'', the ''power stage'', the ''cooperation stage'' and the ''esprit stage''.  Groups can only move forward after completing the current stage as in [[Jean Piaget]]'s stage model.

===Polite stage===
An introductory phase where members strive to get acquainted or reacquainted with one another. During this phase, the basis for the group structure is established and is characterized by polite social interaction. All ideas are simple, controversy is avoided and all members limit self-disclosure.  Judgements of other members are formed, and this sets the tone for the rest of the group's time.

===Why we're here stage===
Group members will want to know why they have been called together. The specific agenda for each planning session will be communicated by the moderator or leader. In this phase, individual need for approval begins to diminish as the members examine their group's purpose and begin to set goals.  Often, social cliques will begin to form as members begin to feel as though they "fit in."

===Power stage===
Bids for power begin between group members in an effort to convince each other that their position on an issue is correct.  Often, the field of candidates vying for leadership narrows, as fewer members strive to establish power.  Some of those who contributed freely to the group discussion in earlier stages now remain silent, wishing not to engage in a power struggle.  It is noted that interactions arising out of this phase do not usually result in optimum solutions.  Hence, there is a great need for structure and patience in this stage.*

===Cooperation stage===
Members not only begin to accept that others have an opinion worth expressing, but a team spirit replaces vested interests.  Often, new levels of creativity are achieved, and the group's productivity soars.  If new individuals are introduced into the membership at this point, they will be viewed as outsiders or intruders, and the group will have to evolve again, much as it did initially.

===Esprit stage===
Esprit de corps:  a golden rule by [[Henri Fayol]] is closely associated with this stage of Cog's, which says that nothing has higher pinnacles to reach than spirit of corps.

Mutual acceptance with high cohesiveness and a general feeling of esprit.  Charrier states that the planning team can do its finest work and be most productive in this final stage in the model.  It is also noted that this stage will not always be achieved; however, for this level of cooperation, as well as productivity, the other four stages must be met.

==Comparisons==
Cog's ladder is very similar to [[Forming-storming-norming-performing|Tuckman's stages]], another stage model of groups, which lacks the "Why We're Here" stage, and calls the remaining four stages "Forming", "Storming", "Norming", and "Performing". There are also other similar models, some of which are cyclic rather than reaching an end state.

'''Commensurability''' is a concept in the [[philosophy of science]] whereby [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] are commensurable if scientists can discuss them using a shared [[nomenclature]] that allows direct comparison of theories to determine which theory is [[scientific realism|more valid or useful]].  On the other hand, theories are '''incommensurable''' if they are embedded in starkly contrasting [[Paradigm|conceptual frameworks]] whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite [[empirical evidence]] favoring one theory over the other.  Discussed by [[Ludwik Fleck]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fleck/ Ludwik Fleck (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]; Fleck's term for incommensurability was "''niewspółmierność''".&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.

== Introduction of the term ==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] both independently introduced the idea of incommensurability to the philosophy of science. In both cases the [[concept]] came from [[mathematics]] and in its original sense is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of two [[variable (research)|variables]], such as the prediction of the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]] from the relationship of its [[Edge (geometry)|sides]].

The term commensurability was coined because of a series of problems that both authors found when trying to interpret successive scientific [[theories]]. Without doubt its implementation is better understood thanks to the critiques that both Kuhn and Feyerabend have made in response to certain [[thesis|theses]] proposed by followers of the [[received view of theories]]. These include the famous ''thesis on the accumulation of scientific knowledge'', which states that the body of [[scientific knowledge]] has been increasing with the passage of time. Both Kuhn and Feyerabend reject this thesis, in favor of a [[scientific modelling|model]] that sees both [[Paradigm shift|revolutions]] and periods of [[Normal science|normalcy]] in the [[history of science]].

Another equally important thesis proposes the existence of a [[standard language|neutral language]] of comparison which can be used to formulate the [[empiricism|empirical consequences]] of two competing theories. This would allow one to choose the theory with the greatest empirically verified contents or explanatory powers &amp;ndash; or the greatest content that is not falsified if the formulation is [[Karl Popper|Popperian]].

The idea at the root of this second thesis does not just relate to the existence of said language but also implies at least two further postulates.{{original research inline|date=March 2015}} Firstly, this choice between theories presupposes that they can be intertranslated, for example between theory A and its successor B – and in the case of Popper that B can be deduced from A. Secondly, it is assumed that the choice is always carried out under the same standards of [[rationality]].

In both cases the concept of incommensurability makes the viability of the thesis impossible. In the first, by showing that certain empirical consequences are lost between successive theories. In the second case, by confirming that it is possible to make a rational choice between theories even when they can not be translated into a neutral language. However, although the reasons for the introduction of these counter arguments, and the criticism from which they arise, are the same, the sense in which the coauthors use them are in no way identical. For this reason the idea of incommensurability will be discussed for each coauthor separately.

== Perspectives ==

=== Feyerabend's perspectives ===
Feyerabend locates incommensurability within a principle from the field of [[semantics]] which has the underlying idea that the change in significance in the basic terms of a theory changes the totality of the terms of the new theory, so that there are no empirically common meanings between T and T'.

Feyerabend is credited with coining the modern philosophical sense of "incommensurability,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas Van Fraassen|Van Fraassen]], Bas. ''The Empirical Stance''. Yale UP: 2002. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/#FeyRouInc "The Incommensurability of Scientific Theories"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. "...he had developed his notion of the incommensurability of scientific theories more than ten years prior to the appearance of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)"&lt;/ref&gt; which lays the foundation for much of his philosophy of science. He first presented his notion of incommensurability in 1952 to [[Karl Popper]]'s [[London School of Economics]] seminar and to a gathering of illustrious Wittgensteinians ([[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Peter Geach]], [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]) in [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe's]] Oxford flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/|title = Paul Feyerabend |accessdate=4 February 2012|author = Preston, John|date = 1 June 2009|publisher = [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that frameworks of thought, and thus [[scientific paradigm]]s, can be incommensurable for three reasons. Briefly put, Feyerabend's notion of incommensurability is as follows:
# The interpretation of observations is implicitly influenced by theoretical assumptions. It is therefore impossible to describe or evaluate observations independently of theory.
# Paradigms often have different assumptions about which intellectual and operational scientific methods result in valid scientific knowledge.
# Paradigms can be based on different assumptions regarding the structure of their domain, which makes it impossible to compare them in a meaningful way. The adoption of a new theory includes and is dependent upon the adoption of new terms. Thus, scientists are using different terms when talking about different theories. Those who hold different, competing theories to be true will be talking over one another, in the sense that they cannot a priori arrive at agreement given two different discourses with two different theoretical language and dictates.

According to Feyerabend, the idea of incommensurability cannot be captured in [[formal logic]], because it is a phenomenon outside of logic's domain.

==== Theories ====
In 1989, Feyerabend presented an idea informed by Popper's [[critical rationalism]] whereby "investigation starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation, which, in its turn, is formed by the expectation." (Feyerabend, 1989; pp.&amp;nbsp;96). [[Scientific method]]ology then resolves problems by inventing theories that should be relevant and falsifiable, at least to a greater degree than any other alternative solution. Once an alternative theory is presented the critical phase commences regarding T' which must answer the following questions: (a) why has theory T been successful up until now and (b) why has it failed. If the new theory T' answers both questions then T is discarded.

That is, a new theory T', in order to be an adequate successor to the refuted theory T, must have a collection of additional predictions regarding T (Class A), as well as a collection of successful predictions that coincide to a certain degree with the old theory (Class S). These Class S predictions constitute those parts of the new theory containing new truths and they therefore exclude a series of consequences of T, the failures in the old theory, which are part of the untrue (false) contents of the new theory (Class F).

Given this model it is possible to construct [[Relational theory|relational statements]] between certain terms from T and from T', which will be the basis for the comparison between the theories. This will allow a choice between the two in the light of their empirical contents. But, if we come across a theory T' in which Class S is empty then the theories are incommensurable with each other.

However, Feyerabend clarifies this by stating that, incommensurability between T and T' will depend on the interpretation given to the theories. If this is instrumental, every theory that refers to the same language of [[observation]] will be commensurable. In the same way, if a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] perspective is sought then it will favour a unified position which employs the most highly abstracted terms of whatever theory is being considered in order to describe both theories, giving a significance to the observational statements as a function of these terms, or, at least to replace the habitual use they are given.

It can be noted that the instrumentalist interpretation recognizes the existence of certain statements whose truth is not only dependent on the observational statements but also on the evaluation criteria they are subjected to, which are anchored in the theories. For example, to afirm the relational character of [[longitude]], this asseveration can not be decided solely using observational terms. Its truth value, in part, depends on the theory that establishes the sense in which the terms are used. In this case they relate to [[quantum mechanics]] (QM) as opposed to [[classical mechanics]] (CM). In this sense, the instrumentalist position only deals with the empirical consequences and leaves to one side the relationship that the concepts have with each other.

In this same way Feyerabend comments that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13238504|title=Philosophical papers|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521316421|edition=1st|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=13238504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is certain, of course, that the relativist scheme has very often given us numbers that are practically identical to the numbers obtained from CM, but this does not mean that the concepts are very similar...[For] even if ...yielding strictly identical predictions can be used as an argument to show that the concepts must match, at least in this case, different magnitudes based on different concepts can give identical values for their respective scales while being different magnitudes...[So] it is not possible to make a comparison of the contents, nor is it possible to make a judgement regarding its verisimilitude.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]}}

==== Realist objections ====

In relation to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an [[argument]] elaborated by [[Carnap]] and comments that the use of such abstract concepts leads to an impossible position, as "...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection." (Feyerabend, pp.&amp;nbsp;373). As before it follows that they can not be used to confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term.

Therefore, Feyerabend considers that both the instrumentalist and the realist interpretations are flawed, as they try to defend the idea that incommensurability is a legitimately unsolvable idea with which to revoke the theses of the accumulation of knowledge and [[panrationalism]] in science. 
 
This leads to the following consideration: if each new theory has its own observational basis, within the meaning of the theoretical framework, how can we hope that the observations that are produced could eventually refute it. Furthermore, how can we actually recognize that the new position explains what it is supposed to explain or if it is deviating off into other areas and therefore how can the theories be definitively compared.

Feyerabend's answer to the first consideration lies in noting that the initial terms of a theory depend on the postulates of the theory and their associated grammatical rules, in addition, the predictions derived from the theory also depend on the underlying conditions of the system. Feyerabend doesn't explore the point further, but it can be assumed that if the prediction does not agree with the observation and if we have a high degree of confidence in the description that we have made from the initial [[material conditional|conditions]] than we can be sure that the error must be present in our theory and in its underlying terms. 
 
In dealing with the second consideration Feyerabend asks "why should it be necessary to have a [[terminology]] that allows us to say that two theories refer to the same experiment. This supposes a unificationist or possibly a realist aspiration, whose objective appears to be the truth, however, it is assumed that the theory can be compared under a criterion of empirical adequacy. Such an approach would build on the relationship established between the observational statement that describes the outcome of an experiment formulated for each theory independently, which is compared with the predictions that each theory posits. In this way the selection is made when a theory is an empirically better fit. If the objection to the possible deviation of the new theory is not answered it is irrelevant as often history has shown that in fact differing points of view change or modify their fields of application, for example the physics of [[Aristotle]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]."

==== Theory selection ====
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
The above implies that the process of choosing between theories does not obey a universal rationality. Feyerabend has the following view regarding whether the absence of a universal rationality constitutes an irrational position:

{{quote|No, because each individual event is rational in the sense that some of its features can be explained by reasons that are or were accepted at the time in which they occurred, or that were invented in the course of their development. Yes, because even these local reasons, which change over time, are not sufficient to explain all the important features of a particular event.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend uses this reasoning to try to shed light on one of Popper's arguments, which says that we are always able to change any statement, even those reference systems that guide our critical thinking. However, the two thinkers reach different conclusions, Popper assumes that it is always possible to make a criticism once the new criteria have been accepted, so the selection can be seen as the result of a rationality "''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''" to the selection. While, Feyerabend's position is that this solution is merely a verbal ornament whenever the standards are influenced by Popper's first world, the physical world, and they are not just developed in the third world. That is, the standards are influenced by the expectations of their originators, the stances they imply and the ways of interpreting the world they favour, but this is strictly analogous to the same process of the scientific revolution, that leads us to believe that the thesis of incommensurability can also be applied to standards, as is shown by the following asseveration:

{{quote|Even the most puritanical rationalist will be forced to stop arguing and use propaganda, for example, not because some of their arguments have become invalid, but because the psychological conditions have disappeared that allowed effective argument and therefore influence over the others|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend states that the Popperian criticism is either related to certain clearly defined procedures, or is totally abstract and leaves others with the task of fleshing it out later with specific contents, making Popper's rationality a "mere verbal ornament." This does not imply that Feyerabend is an [[irrationalist]] but that he considers that the process of scientific change can not be explained in its totality in the light of some rationality, precisely because of incommensurability.

=== Kuhn's perspectives ===
The second coauthor of the thesis of incommensurability is [[Thomas Kuhn]], who introduced it in his 1962 book, ''[[The structure of scientific revolutions]]'', in which he describes it as a universal property that defines the relationship between successive [[paradigm]]s. Under this meaning incommensurability goes beyond the field of semantics and covers everything relating to its practical application, from the study of problems to the associated methods and rules for their resolution. However, the meaning of the term was continually refined throughout Kuhn's work, he first placed it within the field of semantics and applied a narrow definition, but later he redefined it in a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] sense, wherein changes are found in the relationships between similarities and differences that the subjects of a defining matrix draw over the world.

In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote that "the historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them".&lt;ref name=SSR/&gt;{{rp|111}} According to Kuhn, the proponents of different scientific paradigms cannot fully appreciate or understand the other's point of view because they are, as a way of speaking, living in different worlds. Kuhn gave three reasons for this inability:
# Proponents of competing paradigms have different ideas about the importance of solving various scientific problems, and about the standards that a solution should satisfy.
# The vocabulary and problem-solving methods that the paradigms use can be different: the proponents of competing paradigms utilize a different conceptual network.
# The proponents of different paradigms see the world in a different way because of their scientific training and prior experience in research.

In a postscript (1969) to ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn added that he thought that incommensurability was, at least in part, a consequence of the role of [[similarity sets]] in normal science. Competing paradigms group concepts in different ways, with different similarity relations. According to Kuhn, this causes fundamental problems in communication between proponents of different paradigms. It is difficult to change such categories in one's mind, because the groups have been learned by means of exemplars instead of definitions. This problem cannot be resolved by using a neutral language for communication, according to Kuhn, since the difference occurs prior to the application of language.

Kuhn's thinking on incommensurability was probably in some part influenced by his reading of [[Michael Polanyi]] who held that there can be a logical gap between belief systems and who also said that scientists from different schools, "think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008553295|title=Personal knowledge : towards a post-critical philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780203442159|location=London|pages=151|oclc=1008553295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phases ====

Given his changing definition of incommensurability Pérez Ransanz has identified three phases in Kuhn's work, or at least in how it deals with this concept. As we have seen above the first phase was seen in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (SSR) and it is characterized by an overall vision that is applied to paradigms. This perspective was replaced in the 1970s by a localist and semanticist vision in which incommensurability is now defined as the relationship between two theories that are articulated in two languages that are not completely interchangeable, as Kuhn states in the following extract:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/756577696|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=|others=Hacking, Ian,|year=|isbn=9780226458113|edition= Fourth|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=756577696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The phrase "without common measure" is converted into "without common language". To state that two theories are incommensurable means that there is no neutral language, or other type of language, into which both theories, conceived as sets of statements, can be translated without remainder or loss... [Although] the majority of the terms shared by the two theories function in the same way in both...|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

The above only prohibits one type of comparison, that which is carried out between the statements of these two theories in a one-to-one relationship. An idea that underlies this formulation is that translation implies [[symmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] so that if theory T is translatable with theory T', then T' can be translated to T, and furthermore if there is a third theory T'' and this can be translated to T', then theories T and T' cannot be incommensurable, as long as the transitive relationship and the symmetrical relationship assures that their statements can be compared one to another.

It should be noted that Kuhn did not deny that two incommensurable theories may have a common reference environment and in this sense he did not state that it was impossible to compare them, his thesis solely refers to the ability to translate the statements belonging to two theories in a one-to-one relationship, as is shown in the following passage:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|The terms that retain their meanings following a change in theory provide a suitable base for the discussion of the differences and for the comparisons that are relevant in the selection of theories. [Continued in a footnote] It may be noted that these terms are not independent of the theory, but they are simply used in the same way in the two theories in question. It follows that the comparison is a process that compares the two theories, it is not a process that can evaluate the theories separately.|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

This is relevant because it allow us to elucidate that Kuhn's sense of [[rationality]] is linked to the ability to comprehend, and not to the same capacity for translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43602287|title=Kuhn y el cambio científico|last=Pérez Ransanz|first=Ana Rosa|date=1999|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=|isbn=9681641892|edition=1st|location=México|pages=|language=es|oclc=43602287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third stage of Kuhn's work the formulation of the thesis of incommensurability became refined in [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] terms and is explained as a function of the change in the relations of similarity and difference between two theories. Kuhn declared that this change relates to the concepts of Class A not only because there is a change in the way of referring to the concepts but also because their underlying structure becomes altered, that is, the meaning changes – its intention – but also its reference. In this way Kuhn states that not all of the semantic changes are changes that lead to incommensurability, they are only those that, by being made in the basic categories, operate in a [[Holism|holistic manner]] meaning that all the relationships between these terms becomes altered. This uses taxonomic terms to define incommensurability as the impossibility to prove the taxonomic structures of two theories, an impossibility that is expressed as a necessarily incomplete translation of the terms.

==== Taxonomic characterization ====

[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] characterization allowed Kuhn to postulate his no-overlap [[principle]], since, if the taxonomic categories are divisions in a logical sense then this implies that the relations established between these concepts and the rest are necessarily hierarchical. It is for exactly this type of relationship that the changes in categories are holistic, as the modification of a category necessarily implies the modification of the surrounding categories, which explains why once the change takes place the taxonomies can not be comparable – they are isomorphic. 
  
This characterization was already present in Kuhn's writing along with remnants of semantic characterization, which he developed in full towards the end of the 1980s in his taxonomic characterization. An advantage of this characterization is the belief that the criteria that allow the identification of a concept with its references are many and varied, so that a coincidence of criteria is not necessary for successful communication except for those categories that are implicated. Kuhn saw the relations between concepts as existing in a multidimensional space, the categories consist of partitions in this space and they must coincide between the communicators, although this is not the case for the criteria that establish a connection between this space and the associated reference.

==== Reluctance ====

An important clarification that should be made, and which constantly appears in Kuhn's writing, is his reluctance to equate translation and interpretation, a comparison that Kuhn attributes to the analytical tradition of [[philosophy]]. Translation is an almost mechanical activity which produces a Quinean translation manual that relates sequences of words in such a way that their truth values are conserved. However, the process of interpretation implies the development of translation hypotheses, which have to be successful when they allow external preferences to be understood in a coherent and meaningful way. Kuhn then rejected the idea of a universal translatability but not the principle of universal intelligibility, a distinction that is very important in understanding Kuhn's rejection of his critics, such as [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]].

However, without a doubt the previous idea invites us to question how is it that we are able to interpret in the first place. Kuhn's solution consists in affirming that this is like learning a new language. How is it that we are able to learn a new language when we are confronted with a holistic change such as is implied by the notion of incommensurability? Kuhn's work suggests four aspects to this question:

* Firstly, in order to carry out such an [[assimilation (psychology)|assimilation]] it is necessary that the complementary [[vocabulary]] is easily understood.
* Secondly, definitions must fulfill a minimal role, it is the paradigmatic examples that introduce the use of the new concepts, in such a way that an ostensive or stipulative component is essential.
* Thirdly, [[Class (philosophy)|class concepts]] cannot be learned in isolation, but in relation to a series of contrast sets.
* Fourthly, the process of learning involves the generation of expectations, which are the basis of the projectability of the class terms, in such a way that in their turn they form the basis of, among other things, inductive inferences. And lastly, as the criteria for relating the class and its reference vary, this forms the way of learning the subject matter.

=== Conclusion ===

It can be concluded that Kuhn's idea of incommensurability, despite its various reformulations, manages to seriously problematize both the idea of accumulation of a neutral language as well as of the very idea of a neutral language, without falling into [[irrationalism]] nor stating that the common reference level is irrelevant. An idea that differentiates him from Feyerabend who states in books such as ''Problems of Empiricism'' and ''[[Against Method]]'' that if the new theory deviates into new areas, this is not a problem of the theory, as often the conceptual progress leads to the disappearance and not to the refutation or resolution of the old questions.

==Meta-incommensurability==
A more general notion of incommensurability has been applied to the sciences at the meta-level in two significant ways.

Eric Oberheim and [[Paul Hoyningen-Huene]] argue that [[Scientific realism|realist]] and [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realist]] philosophies of science are also incommensurable, thus scientific theories themselves may be meta-incommensurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBERHEIM|first=Eric|last2=HOYNINGEN-HUENE|first2=Paul|date=1997|title=INCOMMENSURABILITY, REALISM AND META-INCOMMENSURABILITY|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23917953|journal=Theoria: An International Journal for Theory, History and Foundations of Science|volume=12|issue=3(30)|pages=447–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Nicholas Best describes a different type of incommensurability between philosophical theories of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=Nicholas W.|date=September 2015|title=Meta-Incommensurability between Theories of Meaning: Chemical Evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1162/POSC_a_00176|journal=Perspectives on Science|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=361–378|doi=10.1162/posc_a_00176|issn=1063-6145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that if the meaning of a first-order scientific theory depends on its second-order theory of meaning, then two first order theories will be meta-incommensurable if they depend on substantially different theories of meaning. Whereas Kuhn and Feyerabend’s concepts of incommensurability do not imply complete incomparability of scientific concepts, this incommensurability of meaning does.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">The '''Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking''', or CMIS, is a theoretical construct designed to predict how people will seek information.  It was first developed by J. David Johnson and has been utilized by a variety of disciplines including [[Library and Information Science]] and [[Health Communication]].

The CMIS has been empirically tested in health and organizational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D., &amp; Meischke, H. (1993). Cancer-related channel selection:  An extensionfor a sample of women who have had a mammogram. Women &amp; Health, 20, 31-44.; Johnson, J. D., Donohue, W. A., Atkin, C. K., &amp; Johnson, S. H. (1995). A comprehensive model of information seeking: Tests focusing on a technical organization. 
Science Communication, 16, 274-303.&lt;/ref&gt; It has inherent strengths for studying how people react to health problems such as cancer.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Johnson, J. D., Andrews, J. E. &amp; Allard, S. (2001). A Model for Understanding and Affecting Genetics Information Seeking. Library and Information Science Research 23(4): 335-349.&lt;/ref&gt; It specifies "antecedents" that explain why people become information seekers, "information carrier characteristic" that shape how they go about looking for information, and "information seeking actions" that reflect the nature of the search itself.

==Design==

[[File:Diagram of the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking.jpg|thumb|right|The Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking]]
The CMIS has been quantitatively tested and performs well when it comes to health information seeking behaviors (HISB).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There are three main schemas in the CMIS. These are:  Antecedents, information field, and information seeking actions.  The antecedents are those factors that determine how an information consumer will receive the information.  Those factors are:  Demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs.  These factors are fluid and can change during the health information seeking process.  The second schema is the information fields that consist of characteristics and utilities.  This schema is concerned with the channels and carriers of information.  A person’s understanding is developed through the information field.  The third schema involves the transformational processes and measured by the consumer’s understanding of the messages received through the information field.  The final schema involves information seeking actions.  This is what the consumer does as a result of the first two schemas through information seeking.  There are three major dimensions:  the scope, depth, and method of information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Antecedents==
The CMIS antecedents—demographics, personal experience, salience, and beliefs—are factors that determine an individual's natural predisposition to search for information from particular information carriers. Certain types of health information seeking can be triggered by an individual's degree of personal experience with disease.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D. (1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the CMIS framework, two personal relevance factors, salience and beliefs, are seen as the primary determinants in translating a perceived gap into an active search for information. Salience refers to the personal significance of health information to the individual, such as perceptions of risk to one's health, which are likely to result in information seeking action. However, people also may be motivated to gather information to determine the implications of health events for themselves and/or others related to their future activities, a factor directly related to the rapidly growing field of genetics. An individual's beliefs about the nature of a particular disease, its impacts, and level of control, all directly relate to self-efficacy, one of our key variables, and one that plays an important role in information seeking and people's more general pattern of actions related to health.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, J. D.(1997). Cancer-related information seeking. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information Carrier Characteristics==

The information carrier characteristics are drawn from a model of Media Exposure and Appraisal (MEA) that has been tested on a variety of information carriers, including both sources and channels, and in a variety of cultural settings. Following the MEA, the CMIS focuses on editorial tone, communication potential, and utility. In the CMIS, characteristics are composed of editorial tone, which reflects an audience member's perception of credibility, while communication potential relates to issues of style and comprehensiveness. Utility relates the characteristics of a medium directly to the needs of an individual, and shares much with the uses and gratifications perspectives. For example, is the information contained in the medium relevant, topical, and important for the individual's purposes? In general, utility is very important for health information seeking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Information Seeking Actions==

There are several types of information seeking actions that can result from the impetus provided by the factors identified by the CMIS. For example, search behavior can be characterized by its extent, or the number of activities carried out, which has two components: scope, the number of alternatives investigated; and, depth, the number of dimensions of an alternative investigated. There is also the method of the search, or channel, as another major dimension of the search.  For instance, an individual might choose the method of consulting a telephone information service, decide to have a narrow scope by only asking questions about smoking cessation clinics, but investigate every recommendation in detail, thus increasing the depth of the search.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Stages in the CMIS==

A key concept from the CMIS is the notion of “stages,” or “cancer involvement”.  According to the CMIS, an individual may be at one of four stages regarding a cancer threat, and thereby have differing information needs and behaviors.

The first stage, ''Casual'', is characterized by a general lack of concern or interest. At this stage, individuals are not purposive in their search for cancer-related information; rather, their search is accidental and aimless, even apathetic.
 
The second stage is ''Purposive-Placid''. This is characterized by the question, “What can I do to prevent cancer?” Individuals here might have some passing interest in cancer or genetic information, but are generally still not affected or directly concerned.

The third stage is ''Purposive-Clustered''. Here, an individual will be in closer proximity to cancer. This is the point at which a person is motivated to look for practical information that will address the specific problem. For example, a first-degree relative of a recently diagnosed breast cancer patient may seek genetic screening or [[BRCA mutation|BRCA]] 1/2 testing. The person could clearly benefit from such information- seeking behavior since medical authorities acknowledge that early detection of cancer leads to earlier treatments and better treatment outcomes.

The fourth stage, ''Directed'', includes individuals who have been diagnosed as having cancer. Such individuals need knowledge for making informed decisions about treatment and management of the disease.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11706">'''Cyber-utopianism''' – the belief that online communication is in itself emancipatory, and that the Internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor – has accompanied the Internet from its beginnings; and was the subject of critique by the [[Critical Art Ensemble]] as early as 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Stepehn Wilson, ''Information Arts'' (2002) p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; While the romantic view of [[cyberspace]] was partially dented by the bursting of the [[dot-com bubble]], utopian views of the internet continued to re-invent themselves through the [[Noughties]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Buckley/D. Clark, ''The Rough Guide to the Internet'' (2009) p. 312-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Rushkoff]] sings the praises of Web 2.0 by stating, "The Internet's ability to network human beings is its very life's blood. It fosters communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community... The ideas, information, and applications now launching on Web sites around the world capitalize on the transparency, usability, and accessibility that the internet was born to deliver".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas |date=2002 |title=Renaissance Now!

The rise of [[Internet censorship and surveillance by country|Internet censorship and surveillance]] across the world has led to a growing number of "cyber skeptics" arguing that repressive governments are able to adapt their tactics to respond to threats, using technology against the interests of dissenting movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:UA005.016.098.00001|title=The Impact of Information and Communication Technology on State Sovereignty: An Analysis of the Cyber Utopian and Cyber Skeptic Perspectives - Tufts Digital Library|work=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, cyber-utopianism, particularly in global politics, was powerfully critiqued by [[Evgeny Morozov]] in his 2011 book ''The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom''.&lt;ref&gt;[[R. Sassower]], ''Digital Exposure: Postmodern Capitalism'' (2013) p. ix and p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging his own past as a cyber-utopian, Morozov calls the belief naive and stubborn for its refusal to acknowledge the downside – the opportunities for authoritarian monitoring and control – of cyber-space.&lt;ref name="morozov"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=The Net Delusion|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-353-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He goes on to blame the "former hippies" in the 1990s, for causing this utopian belief.
:"Cyber-utopians ambitiously set out to build a new and improved United Nations, only to end up with a digital Cirque du Soleil"&lt;ref name="morozov" /&gt;

== Origins: Californian ideology ==
[[The Californian Ideology]] is a set of beliefs combining bohemian and [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian]] attitudes from the [[counterculture of the 1960s]] with [[techno-utopianism]] and support for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism|url = https://www.amazon.com/From-Counterculture-Cyberculture-Stewart-Utopianism/dp/0226817423|publisher = University Of Chicago Press|date = 2008-05-15|location = Chicago, Ill.|isbn = 9780226817422|last = Turner|first = Fred}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beliefs are thought by some to have been characteristic of the culture of the IT industry in [[Silicon Valley]] and the West Coast of the United States during the dot-com boom of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/the-californian-ideology-2 |title=The Californian Ideology |last1=Barbrook |first1=Richard |last2=Cameron |first2=Andy |website=Imaginary Futures |publisher= |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Curtis]] connects it to [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist]] philosophy. Such an ideology of digital utopianism fuelled the first generation of Internet pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;J.M Reagle jr, ''Good Faith Collaboration'' (2010) p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further criticisms ==
Critical reservations about popular positivist readings of the Internet have surfaced repeatedly over the decades: In 2006, [[Andrew Keen]] wrote that [[Web 2.0]] is a "grand utopian movement" similar to "communist society" as described by [[Karl Marx]]. According to Shirky, "By lowering transaction costs, social tools provide a platform for communities of practice...Communities of practice are inherently cooperative, and are beautifully supported by social tools, because that is exactly the kind of community whose members can recruit one another or allow themselves to be found by interested searchers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shirky |first=Clay |date=February 2009 |title=Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Everybody |publisher=Penguin Books |page=190 |isbn=978-0143114949 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=Nov 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from [[The New Yorker]] from 2010, Malcolm Gladwell argues his doubts about the emancipatory and empowering qualities of social media in general. In the article he criticizes [[Clay Shirky]] for propagating and overestimating the revolutionary potential of social media. In the conclusion he says: "Shirky considers this model of activism an upgrade. But it is simply a form of organizing which favors the weak-tie connections that give us access to information over the strong-tie connections that help us persevere in the face of danger."&lt;ref name="gladwell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=Small Change|journal=The New Yorker|date=4 October 2010|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-utopianism has been compared to a [[secular religion]] for the postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;B. Neilson, ''Free Trade in the Bermuda Triangle'' (2004) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognate utopias==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Cyber-utopianism is somewhat derivative of the views espoused by the [[Extropianism|Extropians]], whose ultimate goal is to upload human consciousness to the Internet.

Additionally, [[Ray Kurzweil]]'s books, especially ''The Age of Spiritual Machines'', espouses a kind of cyber-utopianism, in that he views an event, the Singularity, where advances in technology will be so rapid as to represent a barrier after which life will be experientially different, incomprehensible, and advanced.

==Cyber-dystopia==

In August 2007, David Nye presented the idea of cyber-dystopia, which envisions a world made worse by technological advancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nye |first=David E. |date=August 2007  |title=Technology Matters: Questions to Live With  |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/technology-matters |location= |publisher=The MIT Press |page= |isbn=9780262640671 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber-dystopias center around the principles of the individual losing control, becoming dependent and being unable to stop change. Nye describes a society where the elite use technology to oppress and control mass groups of people. He also presents technology as a form of false hope; promising success and change, but causing pain and inconvenience when that goal is not reached. In her book ''Personal Connections'', Nancy Baym talks about the way a cyber-dystopia would negatively affect social interactions. "The dystopian alternative is usually articulated as a fear that new media will take people away from their intimate relationships, as they ''substitute'' mediated relationships or even media use itself for face to face engagement".&lt;ref name=Baym/&gt;{{rp|36}} She compares this fear with the fear that many felt during the introduction of the television and the telephone, as people grew weary about the potential for substitution of meaningful relationships.&lt;ref name=Baym&gt;{{cite book |last=Baym |first=Nancy K. |date=Apr 2010 |title=Personal Connections in the Digital Age |url=http://www.polity.co.uk/book.asp?ref=9780745643328 |location= |publisher=Polity |isbn=9780745643311 |accessdate=April 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28–36}}

The dystopian voices of [[Andrew Keen]], [[Jaron Lanier]], and [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] have pointed out that what we as a society are sacrificing to the cult of cyber-utopians is our humanity. Lanier describes it as "an apocalypse of self-abdication".&lt;ref name="Lanier 15"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lanier |first=Jaron |date=February 2011 |title=You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto |publisher=Vintage |page=15 |isbn=978-0307389978 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lanier states that "consciousness is attempting to will itself out of existence".&lt;ref name="Lanier 15"/&gt; He then asks us to consider, "What is a person?".&lt;ref name="Lanier 15"/&gt; Lanier warns that by emphasizing the crowd we are de-emphasizing individual humans and when you ask people to stop being people, they revert to mob-like behaviors. Keen and Carr also agree that there is a dangerous mob mentality that dominates the internet. Keen states that rather than creating more democracy, the internet is empowering the rule of the mob and that rather than fostering a renaissance of social equality it has created a "selfie-centered"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keen |first=Andrew |date=January 2015 |title=The Internet Is Not the Answer |publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press |isbn=978-0802123138 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; culture of voyeurism and [[narcissism]].

As Nicholas Carr states in ''The Glass Cage'', "the prevailing methods of computerized communication and coordination pretty much ensure that the role of people will go on shrinking. We’ve designed a system that discards us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carr |first=Nicholas |date=September 2014 |title=The Glass Cage: Automation and Us |publisher=Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0393240764 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 15, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cyber anthropology}}
'''Cyborg anthropology''' is a discipline that studies the interaction between humanity and technology from an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] perspective. The discipline is relatively new, but offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society.

== History ==
[[Donna Haraway]]’s 1984 ''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"]]''[[Cyborg Manifesto|"A Cyborg Manifesto"]] was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A sub-focus group within the [[American Anthropological Association]]'s annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled "Cyborg Anthropology", which cites Haraway's "Manifesto". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Gary Lee|last2=Dumit|first2=Joseph|last3=Williams|first3=Sarah|year=1995|title=Cyborg Anthropology|url=|journal=Cultural Anthropology|volume=10|pages=264-269|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sub-group was closely related to [[science and technology studies|STS]] and the [[Society for the Social Studies of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumit, Joseph. Davis-Floyd, Robbie. Cyborg Anthropology. Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Amber Case]] has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/amber-case/|title=Amber Case, Cyborg Anthropologist Information, Facts, News, Photos -- National Geographic|first=National Geographic|last=Society|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Illustrated Dictionary of Cyborg Anthropology|last=Case|first=Amber|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1494773519|location=|pages=9|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many academics have helped develop cyborg anthropology, and many more who haven't heard the term still are today conducting research that may be considered cyborg anthropology, particularly research regarding technologically advanced prosthetics and how they can influence an individual's life. A 2014 summary of holistic American anthropology intersections with cyborg concepts (whether explicit or not) by Joshua Wells explained how the information-rich and culture-laden ways in which humans imagine, construct, and use tools may extend the cyborg concept through the human evolutionary lineage&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Joshua|date=2014|title=Keep Calm and Remain Human: How We Have Always Been Cyborgs and Theories on the Technological Present of Anthropology|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00938157.2014.872460|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=43|pages=5-34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Amber Case generally tells people that the actual number of self-described cyborg anthropologists is "about seven".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://caseorganic.com/2008/11/robots-robots-everywhere-a-field-guide-to-cyborg-anthropology/|title=Robots, Robots, Everywhere – A Field Guide to Cyborg Anthropology {{!}} The World is not a desktop|website=caseorganic.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://cyborganthropology.com/Main_Page The Cyborg Anthropology Wiki], overseen by Case, aims to make the discipline as accessible as possible, even to people who do not have a background in anthropology.

== Methodology ==
Cyborg anthropology uses traditional methods of anthropological research like ethnography and participant observation, accompanied by statistics, historical research, and interviews. By nature it is a multidisciplinary study; cyborg anthropology can include aspects of [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[cybernetics]], [[feminist theory]], and more.  It primarily focuses on how people use  discourse about science and technology in order to make these meaningful in their lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.downey.sts.vt.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1995-Cyborg-Anthropology-.pdf/|title= Cyborg Anthropology: Anthropologies of the Body {{!}} Volume 10, Number 2, May 1995 |website=downey.sts.vt.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== 'Cyborg' origins and meaning ===
Originally coined in a 1960 paper about [[space exploration]], the term is short for cybernetic organism.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.scribd.com/doc/2962194/Cyborgs-and-Space-Clynes-Kline?autodown=pdf Cyborgs and Space]," in ''Astronautics'' (September 1960), by Manfred E. Clynes and Nathan S. Kline.&lt;/ref&gt; A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like [[Cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]s, [[insulin pump]]s, and [[bionic]] limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cyborg Handbook|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Gray|editor-first=Chris Hables|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto" suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She goes on to say that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cybercultures Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-18378-2|editor-last=Bell|editor-first=David|location=|pages=291-324|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto|quote=|editor-last2=Kennedy|editor-first2=Barbara|via=Georgetown University Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital vs. cyborg anthropology ===
{{Main|Digital anthropology}}

[[Digital anthropology]] is concerned with how digital advances are changing how people live their lives, as well as consequent changes to how anthropologists do ethnography and to a lesser extent how digital technology can be used to represent and undertake research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://savageminds.org/2012/03/22/digital-anthropology-group-is-happening-now/|title=Digital Anthropology Group Is Happening Now|last=Thompson|first=Matt|date=2012-03-22|website=Savage Minds|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyborg anthropology also looks at disciplines like [[genetics]] and nanotechnology, which are not strictly digital. Cybernetics/informatics covers the range of cyborg advances better than the label digital.

== Key concepts and research ==

=== Actor–network theory ===
{{main|Actor–network theory}}
Questions of [[subjectivity]], agency, actors, and structures have always been of interest in [[social anthropology|social]] and [[cultural anthropology]]. In cyborg anthropology the question of what type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture ([[Silicon Valley]]), government sanctions ([[net neutrality]]), specific innovative humans ([[Steve Jobs]]), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. [[Actor-network theory]] (ANT), proposed by [[Bruno Latour]], is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network Theory|last=Latour|first=Bruno|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyborganthropology.com/Defining_Cyborg_Anthropology|title=Defining Cyborg Anthropology - Cyborg Anthropology|website=cyborganthropology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Wells explain how new forms of networked political expression such as the [[Pirate Party]] movement and [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source software]] philosophies are generated from human reliance on information technologies in all walks of life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Researchers like Kathleen Richardson have conducted ethnographic research on the humans who build and interact with artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Anthropology of Robots and AI: Annihilation Anxiety and Machines|last=Richardson|first=Kathleen|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=978-1138831742|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Stuart Geiger, a PhD student at [[University of California, Berkeley]] suggested that robots may be capable of creating a culture of their own, which researchers could study with ethnographic methods. Anthropologists react to Geiger with skepticism because, according to Geiger, they believe that culture is specific to living creatures and ethnography limited to human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ford|first=Heather|date=2012-01-15|title=The ethnography of robots|url=http://ethnographymatters.net/blog/2012/01/15/the-ethnography-of-robots/|journal=Ethnography Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Posthumanism ===
The most basic definition of anthropology is the study of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/|title=American Anthropological Association|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cyborgs, by definition, describe something that is not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the study of humans may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a [[Posthumanism|posthuman]] condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans. 

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] of technology [[Zeynep Tufekci]] argues that any symbolic expression of ourselves, even the most ancient cave painting, can be considered "posthuman" because it exists outside of our physical bodies. To her, this means that the human and the "posthuman" have always existed alongside one another, and anthropology has always concerned itself with the posthuman as well as the human.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Neil L. Whitehead and Michael Welsch point out that the concern that posthumanism will decenter the human in anthropology ignores the discipline's long history of engaging with the unhuman (like spirits and demons that humans believe in) and the culturally "subhuman" (like marginalized groups within a society).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human No More? Digital Subjectivities, Unhuman Subjects, and the End of Anthropology|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|last2=Wesch|first2=Michael|publisher=University Press of Colorado|year=2012|isbn=978-1-60732-170-5|location=Boulder|pages=1-21|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Contrarily, Wells, taking a deep-time perspective, points out the ways that tool-centric and technologically communicated values and ethics typify the human condition, and that cross-cultural and ethnological trends in conceptions of lifeways, power dynamics, and definitions of humanity often incorporate information-rich technological symbology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''De Mensurabili Musica''''' (concerning measured music) is a musical treatise from the early 13th century (medieval period, c. 1240)  and is the first of two treatises traditionally attributed to French music theorist [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]];&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas. ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 628&lt;/ref&gt; the other is ''de plana musica'' &lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of western Music - I (Music from the earliest notations to the 16th Century)'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) p196/7&lt;/ref&gt; (Concerning Plainchant). ''De Mensurabili Musica'' was the first to explain a modal rhythmic system that was already in use at the time: the [[rhythmic mode]]s.  The six rhythmic modes set out by the treatise are all in [[triple time]] and are made from combinations of the note values [[mensural notation|''longa'' (long) and ''brevis'' (short)]] and are given the names ''[[trochee]], [[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]], [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]], [[anapest]], [[spondaic]]'' and ''[[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]]'', although ''trochee, dactyl'' and ''spondaic'' were much more common. It is evident how influential Garlandia's &lt;ref&gt;There has been recent scholarly debate on whether Johannes de Garlandia actually wrote the treatise. Some music historians believe that he was simply editor of the treatises. More information can be found on his Wikipedia page.&lt;/ref&gt; treatise has been by the number of theorists that have used its ideas. Much of the surviving music of the [[Notre Dame School]] from the 13th century is based on the rhythmic modes set out in ''De Mensurabili Musica''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4106">In the [[mental health]] field, a '''dual relationship''' is a situation where multiple roles exist between a [[therapist]], or other mental health practitioner, and a client.&lt;ref name=Zur&gt;{{cite web|last=Zur|first=O.|title=Dual relationships, multiple relationships &amp; boundaries in psychotherapy, counseling &amp; mental health|url=http://www.zurinstitute.com/dualrelationships.html|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dual relationships are also referred to as '''multiple relationships''', and these two terms are used interchangeably in the research literature.&lt;ref name = Zur /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=M. B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice.|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]] (also referred to as the APA [[ethics code]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Psychological Association|title=Ethical principles of psychologists and code of conduct|url=http://www.apa.org/ethics/code/index.aspx|accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a resource that outlines ethical standards and principles to which practitioners are expected to adhere. Standard 3.05 of the APA ethics code outlines the definition of multiple relationships. Dual or multiple relationships occur when:

*a professional and personal relationship take place simultaneously between the psychologist and the client
* the psychologist has a relationship with a person closely related to or connected to their client
* the psychologist has intentions to enter into a future relationship with the client or someone closely related to the client

In addition, the standard provides a description of when to avoid multiple relationships (e.g., when the relationship causes harm to the client or impairs the psychologist's competence) and when these relationships are ''not'' considered unethical (e.g., when the relationship does not exploit the client or impair competence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=L.W.|author2=Battaglia, J. |author3=Epstein, R.S. |title=Frontier ethics: Mental health care needs and ethical dilemmas in rural communities|journal=[[Psychiatric Services]]|year=1999|volume=50|issue=4|pages=497–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nickel|first=M.B.|title=Professional boundaries: The dilemma of dual and multiple relationships in rural clinical practice|journal=Counseling and Clinical Psychology Journal|year=2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Werth|first=J.L.|author2=Hastings, S.L. |author3=Riding-Malon, R. |title=Ethical challenges of practicing in rural areas|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|year=2010|volume=10|issue=1|pages=105–127|doi=10.1002/jclp.20681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Other Fields==
Several "helping" fields which are not strictly psychological in nature, but which still involve a therapeutic counseling environment, also have stringent policies involving dual relationships and the avoidance of such relationships. For example, the National Association of Social Workers [NASW], which regulates 132,000 social workers across the world, names multiple types of dual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics|url=http://socialworkers.org/pubs/code/code.asp|publisher=National Association of Social Workers|page=Section 1.02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes sexual, financial, personal or religious relationships which could become exploitative due to the differences in power between the worker and the client. Social workers are advised by the NASW to communicate with their clients when such a relationship arises or could arise, and are advised to take steps to avoid dual relationships wherever possible. The NASW recognizes, however, that dual relationships can be unavoidable in some types of communities, such as in rural communities or military installations.

'''Ecosystem diversity''' deals with the variations in [[ecosystem]]s within a [[geographical location]] and its overall impact on human existence and the [[environmental impact|environment]].

Ecosystem diversity is a type of [[biodiversity]]. It is the variation in the [[ecosystems]] found in a region or the variation in ecosystems over the whole planet. Biodiversity is important because it clears out our water, changes out climate, and provides us with food. Ecological diversity includes the variation in both [[Terrestrial ecosystem|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. Ecological diversity can also take into account the variation in the [[complexity]] of a [[biological community]], including the number of different [[ecological niche|niches]], the number of [[trophic level]]s and other ecological processes. An example of ecological diversity on a global scale would be the variation in ecosystems, such as [[desert]]s, [[forest]]s, [[grassland]]s, [[wetland]]s and [[ocean]]s. Ecological diversity is the largest scale of biodiversity, and within each ecosystem, there is a great deal of both [[Species diversity|species]] and [[genetic diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Margaret|last= Cunningham|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-biodiversity-definition-and-relation-to-ecosystem-stability.html|website=study.com|series= DSST Environment &amp; Humanity: Study Guide &amp; Test Prep |title=What is Biodiversity? - Definition and Relation to Ecosystem Stability|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2009|chapter=Ecosystems|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;u=colu91149&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CCX3233900080&amp;asid=ece573364e176588534845e3350339a7|title=Environmental Science: In context|series=In Context Series |volume=1|pages=242–246|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|oclc=277051356|isbn=978-1-4103-3754-2

== Impact ==

Diversity in the ecosystem is significant to human existence for a variety of reasons. Ecosystem diversity boosts the availability of [[oxygen]] via the process of [[photosynthesis]] amongst plant organisms domiciled in the habitat. Diversity In an aquatic environment helps in the [[water purification|purification of water]] by plant varieties for use by humans. Diversity increases plant varieties which serves as a good source for medicines and [[herb]]s for human use.  A lack of diversity in the ecosystem produces an opposite result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naveh|first=Z.|date=1994-09-01|title=From Biodiversity to Ecodiversity: A Landscape-Ecology Approach to Conservation and Restoration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1994.tb00065.x/abstract|journal=Restoration Ecology|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=180–189|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.1994.tb00065.x|issn=1526-100X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Some examples of ecosystems that are rich in diversity are:
* [[Deserts]]
* [[Forests]]
* [[Large marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Marine ecosystem]]s
* [[Old growth forest]]s
* [[Rainforest]]s
* [[Tundra]]
* [[Coral Reef]]s
* [[Marine biology|Marine]]


== Ecosystem diversity as a result of evolutionary pressure ==
Ecological diversity around the world can be directly linked to the evolutionary and [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that constrain the [[Diversity index|diversity]] outcome of the ecosystems within different [[Niche segregation|niches]]. [[Tundra|Tundras]], [[Rainforest|Rainforests]], coral reefs and [[deciduous forests]] all are formed as a result of [[Evolutionary pressure|evolutionary pressures]]. Even seemingly small evolutionary interactions can have large impacts on the diversity of the [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] throughout the world. One of the best studied cases of this is of the honey bee's interaction with [[Flowering plant|angiosperms]] on every continent in the world except [[Antarctica|Antartica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://animals.mom.me/continents-bees-not-found-5374.html|title=On What Continents Are Bees Not Found?|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010 Robert Brodschneider, and Karl Crailsheim conducted a study about the health and nutrition in honey bee colonies, the study conducted focused on: overall colony health, adult nutrition, and [[larva]] nutrition as a function of the effect of [[Pesticide|pesticides]], [[Monoculture|monocultures]] and genetically modified crops to see if the anthropogenically created problems can have an effect pollination levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brodschneider|first=Robert|date=2010|title=Nutrition and health in Honey bees|url=https://www.apidologie.org/articles/apido/pdf/2010/03/m09120.pdf|journal=Apidologie|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicate that human activity does have a role in the destruction of the fitness of the bee colony. The extinction or near extinction of these pollinators would result in many plants that feed humans on a wide scale, needing alternative pollination methods &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/12.000/www/m2015/2015/bee_tech.html|title=Mission 2015: Bee Technology|website=web.mit.edu|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Crop pollinating insects are worth annually 14.6 billion to the [[Economy of the United States|US economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/5193-Decline-of-bees-forces-China-s-apple-farmers-to-pollinate-by-hand|title=Decline of bees forces China's apple farmers to pollinate by hand|website=www.chinadialogue.net|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost to hand pollinate over insect pollination will cost an estimated 5,715-$7,135 per hectare additionally. Not only will there be a cost increase but also an decrease in colony fitness, leading to a decrease in genetic diversity, which studies have shown has a direct link to the long term survival of the honey bee colonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/06/130617111341.htm|title=Genetic diversity key to survival of honey bee colonies|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to a study, there are over 50 plants that are dependent on bee pollination, many of these being key staples to feeding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020735/http://gears.tucson.ars.ag.gov/beeclass/Pollination.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=2007-09-30|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study conducted states that as a direct result of a lack of [[Plant diversity and evolution|plant diversity]], will lead to a decline in the bee population fitness, and a low bee colony fitness has impacts on the fitness of plant ecosystem diversity. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2018/08/22/Plant-biodiversity-essential-to-bee-health/7391534949396/|title=Plant biodiversity essential to bee health|work=UPI|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing for bee pollination and working to reduce [[Anthropogenic|anthropogenically]] harmful footprints, bee pollination can increase flora growth genetic diversity and create a unique ecosystem that is highly diverse and can provide a habitat and niche for many other organisms to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/why-bees-are-important-to-our-planet/|title=Why Bees Are Important to Our Planet - One Green Planet|website=www.onegreenplanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the evolutionary pressures of bees being located on six out of seven continents, there can be no denying the impact of [[Pollinator|pollinators]] on the ecosystem diversity. The [[pollen]] collected by the bees is harvested and used as an energy source for winter time, this act of collecting pollen from local plants also has a more important effect of facilitating the movement of genes between [[Organism|organisms]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Min|last2=Compton|first2=Stephen G.|last3=Peng|first3=Fo-En|last4=Zhang|first4=Jian|last5=Chen|first5=Xiao-Yong|date=2015-06-07|title=Movements of genes between populations: are pollinators more effective at transferring their own or plant genetic markers?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455804/|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=282|issue=1808|doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.0290|issn=0962-8452|pmc=4455804|pmid=25948688}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The new evolutionary pressures that are largely [[Anthropogenic|anthropogenically]] catalyzed can potentially cause wide spread collapse of ecosystems. In the north Atlantic sea, a study was conducted that followed the effects of the human interaction on surrounding ocean habitats. They found that in there was no [[habitat]] or [[trophic level]] that in some way was effected negatively by human interaction, and that much of the diversity of life was being stunted as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lotze|first=Heike K.|last2=Milewski|first2=Inka|date=October 2004|title=TWO CENTURIES OF MULTIPLE HUMAN IMPACTS AND SUCCESSIVE CHANGES IN A NORTH ATLANTIC FOOD WEB|url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/03-5027|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=1428–1447|doi=10.1890/03-5027|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Spatial Development Perspective''' (ESDP) is a document approved by the Informal Council of Ministers of Spatial Planning of [[European Commission]] in [[Potsdam]] in 1999. It is a legally non-binding document forming a policy framework with 60 policy options for all tiers of [[Administration (business)|administration]] with a planning responsibility. The [[strategic]] aim is to achieve a balanced and [[sustainable]] [[spatial development]] strategy.

== Key concepts ==
With the aim to provide an [[Regional integration|integrated]], multi-sectoral and indicative [[strategy]] for the [[spatial development]], the key ideas of ESDP are: 
* an integrated approach - Not just to look at specific sectors of development activity (e.g. environment, economic development, or transport), but to recognise that they all affect each other; 
* spatial development - a much wider view of the development, vital for integrative approach; 
* strategic aspects - interlinked actions to achieve balanced and sustainable territorial development; 
* indicative views - the responsibility lies with the developed regions and territories to implement the development principals.

== Spatial policy guidelines ==
# Development of a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] and balanced urban system, and strengthening of the partnership between urban and rural areas, so as to create a new urban-rural relationship.
# Promotion of integrated transport and communication concepts, which support the polycentric development of the EU territory, so that there is gradual progress towards parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge. 
# Wise management of the natural and cultural heritage, which will help conserve regional identities and cultural diversity in the face of globalisation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34042">{{short description|A philosophical argument asserting a problem with believing both evolution and philosophical naturalism simultaneously}}
The '''evolutionary argument against naturalism''' ('''EAAN''') is a philosophical argument asserting a problem with believing both [[theory of evolution|evolution]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|philosophical naturalism]] simultaneously. The argument was first proposed by [[Alvin Plantinga]] in 1993 and "raises issues of interest to epistemologists, philosophers of mind, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers of religion".&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Beilby(2002) p vii&lt;/ref&gt; The EAAN argues that the combined belief in both evolutionary theory and naturalism is epistemically [[self refuting idea|self-defeating]]. The argument for this is that if both evolution and naturalism are true, then the probability of having reliable cognitive faculties are low.

==Development of the idea==
The idea that "naturalism" undercuts its own justification was put forward by [[Arthur Balfour]].&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"&gt;Victor Reppert, C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason (2003) p 46&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. S. Lewis]] popularised it in the first edition of his book ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' in 1947.&lt;ref name = Nathan&gt;{{cite journal| last = Nathan| first = N.M.L.| year = 1997| title = Naturalism and Self-Defeat: Plantinga's Version| journal = Religious Studies| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 135–42| jstor = 20008086| doi = 10.1017/S0034412597003855}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar arguments were advanced by [[Richard Taylor (philosopher)|Richard Taylor]] in ''Metaphysics'',&lt;ref name = Beilbyix&gt;Beilby(2002) p ix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen R. L. Clark|Stephen Clark]],&lt;ref name = Nathan/&gt;&lt;ref name = Balfour&gt;Arthur Balfour, The Foundations of Belief: Notes Introductory to the Study of Theology, 8th ed. Rev. with a new introduction and summary (1906) pp 279-285&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Purtill]]&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Purtill&gt;Richard Purtill, Reasons to Believe (1974) pp 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. P. Moreland]].&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name = Moreland&gt;J. P. Moreland, "God and the Argument from Mind", in Scaling the Secular City (1978) pp 77-105&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[Victor Reppert]] developed a similar argument in detail in his book ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason''.&lt;ref name="Reppert2003"/&gt; Contemporary philosophers who have employed a similar argument against physical determinism are [[James N. Jordan|James Jordan]] and [[William Hasker]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea, In Defense of the Argument from Reason (2003) pp 204-275&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga proposed his "evolutionary argument against naturalism" in 1993.&lt;ref name = Beilbyix/&gt; In the twelfth chapter of his book ''Warrant and Proper Function'', Plantinga developed Lewis' idea,&lt;ref name = Nathan/&gt; and constructed two formal arguments against evolutionary naturalism.&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt; He further developed the idea in an unpublished manuscript entitled "Naturalism Defeated" and in his 2000 book ''Warranted Christian Belief'',&lt;ref name = Beilbyix/&gt; and expanded the idea in ''Naturalism Defeated?'', a 2002 anthology edited by [[James Beilby]]. He also responded to several objections to the argument in his essay "Reply to Beilby's Cohorts" in Beilby's anthology.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002 p 2"&gt;Beilby(2002) p 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2008 publication ''Knowledge of God'' Plantinga presented a formulation of the argument that solely focused on semantic [[epiphenomenalism]] instead of the former four jointly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name = Plantinga2008&gt;Alvin Plantinga, Michael Tooley, Knowledge of God (2008) pp 31-51&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plantinga's 1993 formulation of the argument==
Plantinga's argument attempted to show that to combine naturalism and evolution is self-defeating, because, under these assumptions, the probability that humans have reliable cognitive faculties is low or inscrutable.&lt;ref name = Warrant&gt;{{cite book|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|authorlink=Alvin Plantinga|title=Warrant and Proper Function|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-507864-0|doi=10.1093/0195078640.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He claimed that several thinkers, including [[C. S. Lewis]], had seen that evolutionary naturalism seemed to lead to a deep and pervasive skepticism and to the conclusion that our unreliable cognitive or belief-producing faculties cannot be trusted to produce more true beliefs than false beliefs. He claimed that "[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] himself had worries along these lines" and quoted from an 1881 letter:&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/bc/2008/julaug/11.37.html |title=Evolution vs. Naturalism&amp;nbsp;— Books &amp; Culture |author=Alvin Plantinga |authorlink=Alvin Plantinga |date=July–August 2008 |publisher=[[Christianity Today]] |accessdate=2009-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beilby p 3"&gt;Beilby p 3&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|But then with me the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trustworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind?|Charles Darwin, to William Graham 3 July 1881&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/darwinletters/calendar/entry-13230.html|title=Darwin Correspondence Project&amp;nbsp;— Letter 13230&amp;nbsp;— Darwin, C. R. to Graham, William, 3 July 1881|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the letter, Darwin had expressed agreement with William Graham's claim that natural laws implied purpose and the belief that the universe was "not the result of chance", but again showed his doubts about such beliefs and left the matter as insoluble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[James Moore (biographer)|Moore, James William]] |author2=[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond, Adrian J.]] |title=Darwin |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth [Eng.] |year=1992 |page=653 |isbn=0-14-013192-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin only had this doubt about questions beyond the scope of science, and thought science was well within the scope of an evolved mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mark Isaak |title=The counter-creationism handbook |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2007 |pages=17–18 |isbn=0-520-24926-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]] said that by presenting it as "Darwin's doubt" that evolutionary naturalism is self-defeating, Plantinga failed to note that Darwin at once excused himself from philosophical matters he did not feel competent to consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ruse, Michael |title=Darwinism and its discontents |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-521-82947-X|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Evan Fales, agreed that this citation allowed Plantinga to call the source of the problem EAAN addresses ''Darwin's Doubt''.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby p 46&lt;/ref&gt; Also, contrary to Ruse's claim, Plantinga gave the name "Darwin's Doubt" not to the idea that the conjunction of naturalism and evolution is self-defeating, but rather to the view that given naturalism and evolution our cognitive faculties are unlikely to be reliable.  Plantinga asserts that "this doubt arises for naturalists or atheists, but not for those who believe in God. That is because if God has created us in his image, then even if he fashioned us by some evolutionary means, he would presumably want us to resemble him in being able to know; but then most of what we believe might be true even if our minds have developed from those of the lower animals."&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b/&gt;

Plantinga defined:
* ''N'' as naturalism, which he defined as "the idea that there is no such person as God or anything like God; we might think of it as high-octane atheism or perhaps atheism-plus."&lt;ref name=Plantinga2008b/&gt;
* ''E'' as the belief that human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary theory
* ''R'' as the proposition that our faculties are "reliable", where, roughly, a cognitive faculty is "reliable" if the great bulk of its deliverances are true. He specifically cited the example of a thermometer stuck at {{convert|72|°F}} placed in an environment which happened to be at 72&amp;nbsp;°F as an example of something that is not "reliable" in this sense&lt;ref name="Beilby2002 p 2"/&gt;

and suggested that the [[conditional probability]] of R given N and E, or P(R|N&amp;E), is low or inscrutable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/plantinga_alvin/naturalism_defeated.pdf|title=Naturalism Defeated, by Alvin Plantinga|accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's argument began with the observation that our beliefs can only have evolutionary consequences if they affect behaviour. To put this another way, natural selection does not directly select for true beliefs, but rather for advantageous behaviours. Plantinga distinguished the various theories of mind-body interaction into four jointly exhaustive categories:

#[[epiphenomenalism]], where behaviour is not caused by beliefs. "if this way of thinking is right, beliefs would be ''invisible'' to evolution" so P(R|N&amp;E) would be low or inscrutable&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 6&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Semantic'' epiphenomenalism, where beliefs have a causative link to behaviour but not by virtue of their ''semantic'' content.  Under this theory, a belief would be some form of long-term neuronal event.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 6-7. Here Plantinga cites [[Robert Cummins]] as suggesting that this is the "received view"&lt;/ref&gt; However, on this view P(R|N&amp;E) would be low because the semantic content of beliefs would be invisible to natural selection, and it is semantic content that determines [[truth-value]].
#Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour, but ''maladaptive'', in which case P(R|N&amp;E) would be low, as R would be selected against.
#Beliefs are causally efficacious with respect to behaviour and also adaptive, but they may still be false. Since behaviour is caused by both belief and desire, and desire can lead to false belief, natural selection would have no reason for selecting true but non-adaptive beliefs over false but adaptive beliefs. Thus P(R|N&amp;E) in this case would also be low.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 8-9&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga pointed out that innumerable belief-desire pairs could account for a given behaviour; for example, that of a prehistoric hominid fleeing a tiger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Perhaps Paul very much ''likes'' the idea of being eaten, but when he sees a tiger, always runs off looking for a better prospect, because he thinks it unlikely the tiger he sees will eat him.  This will get his body parts in the right place so far as survival is concerned, without involving much by way of true belief.&amp;nbsp;... Or perhaps he thinks the tiger is a large, friendly, cuddly pussycat and wants to pet it; but he also believes that the best way to pet it is to run away from it.&amp;nbsp;... Clearly there are any number of belief-cum-desire systems that equally fit a given bit of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Plantinga | first1 =  | year = | title = Warrant and Proper Function | url = | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = 225–226 | doi = 10.1093/0195078640.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, Plantinga argued, the probability that our minds are reliable under a conjunction of [[metaphysical naturalism|philosophical naturalism]] and [[Naturalistic Evolution|naturalistic evolution]] is low or inscrutable. Therefore, to assert that naturalistic evolution is true also asserts that one has a low or unknown probability of being right. This, Plantinga argued, epistemically [[defeater|defeats]] the belief that naturalistic evolution is true and that ascribing truth to naturalism and evolution is internally dubious or inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Fitelson and Sober's response===
In a 1998 paper [[Branden Fitelson]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] set out to show that the arguments presented by Plantinga contain serious errors. Plantinga construed evolutionary naturalism as the conjunction of the idea that human cognitive faculties arose through evolutionary mechanisms, and naturalism which he equated to atheism. Plantinga tried to throw doubt on this conjunction with a preliminary argument that the conjunction is probably false, and a main argument that it is self-defeating, if you believe it you should stop believing it.&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, they criticised Plantinga's use of a [[Bayes Theorem|Bayesian]] framework in which he arbitrarily assigned initial probabilities without [[empirical evidence]], predetermining the outcome in favor of traditional theism, and described this as a recipe for replacing any non-deterministic theory in the natural sciences, so that for example a probable outcome predicted by [[quantum mechanics]] would be seen as the outcome of God's will. Plantinga's use of R to mean that "the great bulk" of our beliefs are true fails to deal with the cumulative effect of adding beliefs which have variable reliability about different subjects. Plantinga asserted that the traditional theist believes being made in God's image includes a reflection of divine powers as a knower, but [[cognitive science]] finds human reasoning subject to biases and systematic error. Traditional theology is not shown to predict this varying reliability as well as science, and there is the [[theodicy|theological problem]] of the omnipotent Creator producing such imperfection. They described how Plantinga set out various scenarios of belief affecting evolutionary success, but undercut the low probability he previously required when he suggested an "inscrutable" probability, and by ignoring availability of variants he fails to show that false beliefs will be equally adaptive as his claim of low probability assumes. Even if his claims of improbability were correct, that need not affect belief in evolution, and they considered it would be more sensible to accept that evolutionary processes sometimes have improbable outcomes.&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt;

They assessed Plantinga's main argument which asserts that since the reliability of evolutionary naturalism is low or of inscrutable value, those believing it should withhold assent from its reliability, and thus withhold assent from anything else they believe including evolutionary naturalism, which is therefore self-defeating. They found this unconvincing, having already disputed his argument that the reliability is low. Even if ''E&amp;N'' defeated the claim that 'at least 90% of our beliefs are true,' they considered that Plantinga must show that it also defeats the more modest claim that 'at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true'. They considered his sentiment that high probability is required for rational belief to be repudiated by philosophical lessons such as the [[lottery paradox]], and that each step in his argument requires principles different from those he had described. They concluded that Plantinga has drawn attention to unreliability of cognitive processes that is already taken into account by evolutionary scientists who accept that science is a fallible exercise, and appreciate the need to be as scrupulous as possible with the fallible cognitive processes available. His [[hyperbolic doubt]] as a defeater for evolutionary naturalism is equally a defeater for theists who rely on their belief that their mind was designed by a non-deceiving God, and neither "can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson/&gt;

===Robbins' response===
[[Indiana University South Bend]] Professor of Philosophy J. Wesley Robbins contended that Plantinga's argument applied only to [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian philosophies of mind]] but not to pragmatist philosophies of mind.  Robbins' argument, stated roughly, was that while in a Cartesian mind beliefs can be identified with no reference to the environmental factors that caused them, in a pragmatic mind they are identifiable ''only'' with reference to those factors. That is to say, in a pragmatic mind beliefs would not even exist if their holder had not come in contact with external belief-producing phenomena in the first place.&lt;ref name = Robbins&gt;{{cite journal| last = Robbins| first = J. Wesley| year = 1994| title = Is Naturalism Irrational?| journal = Faith and Philosophy| volume = 11| issue = 2| pages = 255–59| url =| doi=10.5840/faithphil199411216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Naturalism Defeated?''===
A collection of essays entitled ''Naturalism Defeated?'' (2002) contains responses by 11 philosophers to EAAN.&lt;ref&gt;Summarised, unless otherwised referenced, from the [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=1105 review by John F Post]&lt;/ref&gt; According to James K. Beilby, editor of the volume, Plantinga's proposition "raises issues of interest to epistemologists, philosophers of mind, evolutionary biologists, and philosophers of religion".&lt;ref name="Ref-1" /&gt; The responsive essays include the following:
* William Ramsey argued that Plantinga "overlooks the most sensible way . . . to get clear on how truth can be a property of beliefs that bestows an advantage on cognitive systems". He also argued that ''some'' of our cognitive faculties ''are'' slightly unreliable, and ''E&amp;N'' seems better suited than theism to explain this imperfection.
* [[Jerry Fodor]] argued that there is a plausible historical scenario according to which our minds were selected because their cognitive mechanisms produced, by and large, adaptive true beliefs.
* Evan Fales&lt;ref&gt;Fales's article, "Plantinga's Case Against Naturalistic Epistemology" is also reprinted at p387 et seq. of ''Intelligent Design Creationism and Its Critics'' ([[Robert T. Pennock]], editor, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plantinga had not demonstrated that the reliability of our cognitive faculties is improbable, given Neo-Darwinism, and emphasizes that "if Plantinga's argument fails here, then he will not have shown that [N&amp;E] is probabilistically incoherent." Also, given how expensive (in biological terms) our brain is, and considering we are rather unremarkable creatures apart from our brains, it would be quite improbable that our rational faculties be selected if unreliable. "Most of our eggs are in that basket," said Fales. Fales argued along the same as Robbins: take a [[mental representation]], of heat, for example. Only so long as it is really caused by heat can we call it a mental representation of heat; otherwise, it is not at all a mental representation, of heat or of anything else: "so long as representations [semantics] are causally linked to the world via the syntactic structures in the brain to which they correspond [syntax], this will guarantee that syntax maps onto semantics in a generally truth-preserving way."&lt;ref name = Fales&gt;{{cite journal| last = Fales| first = Evan| year = 1996| title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology| journal = Philosophy of Science| volume = 63| issue = 3| pages = 432–51| jstor= 188104| doi = 10.1086/289920}}, cited in ''Naturalism Defeated?'' as being an earlier version of Fales' response.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a direct response to one of Plantinga's scenarios where, according to Plantinga, false-belief generating mechanisms may have been naturally selected.
* Michael Bergmann suggested that [[Thomas Reid]] offered the resources for a commonsense (Reidian) defense of naturalism against EAAN.
* [[Ernest Sosa]] drew on features of [[Descartes]]' epistemology to argue that while "[i]ssues of circularity do arise as to how we can rationally and knowledgeably adopt [an epistemically propitious] view about our own epistemic powers," nonetheless, "these problems are not exclusive to naturalism."
* James Van Cleve suggested that even if the probability thesis is true, it need not deliver an undefeated defeater to R, and that even if one has a defeater for R, it doesn't follow that one has a defeater for everything.
* Richard Otte thought that the argument "ignore[d] other information we have that would make R likely."
* William Talbott suggested that "Plantinga has misunderstood the role of undercutting defeaters in reasoning."
* [[Trenton Merricks]] said that "in general, inferences from low or inscrutable conditional probability to defeat are unjustified."
* [[William Alston]] argued that the claim that P(R/N&amp;E) is low is poorly supported; if, instead, it is inscrutable, this has no clear relevance to the claim that (1) is a defeater for N&amp;E.

''Naturalism Defeated?'' also included Plantinga's replies to both the critical responses contained in the book and to some objections raised by others, including Fitelson &amp; Sober:
* Plantinga expounded the notion of ''Rationality Defeaters'' in terms of his theory of warrant and proper function and distinguishes between Humean Defeaters and Purely Alethic Defeaters, suggesting that although a naturalist will continue to assume R "but (if he reflects on the matter) he will also think, sadly enough, that what he can't help believing is unlikely to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 211&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plantinga argued that ''semantic epiphenomenalism'' is very likely on N&amp;E because, if [[materialism]] is true, beliefs would have to be neurophysiological events whose ''propositional'' content cannot plausibly enter the causal chain.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp211-213 - he says that these arguments are "related in ways that are not entirely clear to arguments made by [[Jaegwon Kim]] in ''Mind in a Physical World''&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that the ''reliability'' of a cognitive process requires the truth of a substantial proportion of the beliefs it produces, and that a process which delivered beliefs whose probability of truth was in the neighbourhood of 0.5 would have a vanishingly unlikely chance of producing (say) 1000 beliefs 75% of which were true.
* In ''The conditionalisation problem,'' Plantinga discussed the possibility that N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; i.e. "Naturalism plus R," could be a basic belief thus staving off defeat of R, suggesting that this procedure cannot be right in general otherwise every defeater could automatically be defeated, introducing the term "''defeater-deflector''&lt;ref&gt;''ie'' something that prevents D (a supposed Defeater) from being a defeater in the first place, as opposed to a defeater-defeater which defeats D Beilby(2002) p224.&lt;/ref&gt; " and initially exploring the conditions under which a defeater-deflector can be valid.
* Plantinga concluded that the objections pose a challenge to EAAN, but that there are successful arguments against the objections.

===Ruse's response===
In a chapter titled 'The New Creationism: Its Philosophical Dimension', in ''The Cultures of Creationism'', philosopher of science [[Michael Ruse]] discussed EAAN. He argued:
*That the EAAN conflates methodological and metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name=Coleman187&gt;Coleman(2004) p187&lt;/ref&gt;
*That "we need to make a distinction that Plantinga fudges" between "the world as we can in some sense discover" and "the world in some absolute sense, metaphysical reality if you like." Then, "Once this distinction is made, Plantinga's refutation of naturalism no longer seems so threatening."&lt;ref name=Coleman188&gt;Coleman(2004) p188&lt;/ref&gt;
*That "It is certainly the case that organisms are sometimes deceived about the world of appearances and that this includes humans. Sometimes we are systematically deceived, as instructors in elementary psychology classes delight in demonstrating. Moreover, evolution can often give good reasons as to why we are deceived." We know there are misconceptions arising from selection as we can measure them against reliable touchstones, but in Plantinga's hypothesised deceptions we are deceived all the time which is "not how evolution's deceptions work".&lt;ref name=Coleman188/&gt; He comments that in Plantinga's thinking we have confusion between the world as we know it, and the world as it might be knowable in some ultimate way, but "If we are all in an illusion then it makes no sense to talk of illusion, for we have no touchstone of reality to make absolute judgements."&lt;ref name=Coleman190/&gt;

Ruse concluded his discussion of the EAAN by stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To be honest, even if Plantinga's argument [the EAAN] worked, I would still want to know where theism ends (and what form this theism must take) and where science can take over. Is it the case that evolution necessarily cannot function, or it is merely false and in another God-created world it might have held in some way&amp;nbsp;— and if so, in what way? Plantinga has certainly not shown that the theist must be a creationist, even though his own form of theism is creationism.&lt;ref name=Coleman190&gt;Coleman(2004) pp189–190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==C.S. Lewis framing==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Supposing there was no intelligence behind the universe, no creative mind. In that case, nobody designed my brain for the purpose of thinking. It is merely that when the atoms inside my skull happen, for physical or chemical reasons, to arrange themselves in a certain way, this gives me, as a by-product, the sensation I call thought. But, if so, how can I trust my own thinking to be true? It's like upsetting a milk jug and hoping that the way it splashes itself will give you a map of London. But if I can't trust my own thinking, of course I can't trust the arguments leading to Atheism, and therefore have no reason to be an Atheist, or anything else. Unless I believe in God, I cannot believe in thought: so I can never use thought to disbelieve in God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Plantinga's 2008 formulation of the argument==
In the 2008 publication ''Knowledge of God'' Plantinga presented a formulation of the argument that solely focused on semantic [[epiphenomenalism]] instead of the former four jointly exhaustive categories.&lt;ref name = Plantinga2008/&gt;

Plantinga stated that from a materialist's point of view a belief will be a neuronal event. In this conception a belief will have two different sorts of properties:&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)pp 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;
*''electro-chemical'' or ''neurophysiological'' properties (''NP'' properties for short)
*and the property of having ''content'' (It will have to be the belief that ''p'', for some proposition ''p'').
Plantinga thought that we have something of an idea as to the history of NP properties: structures with these properties have come to exist by small increments, each increment such that it has proved to be useful in the struggle for survival. But he then asked how the ''content'' property of a belief came about: "How does it [the content] get to be associated in that way with a given proposition?"&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)p 34&lt;/ref&gt;

He said that materialists offer two theories for this question: According to the first, content ''[[Supervenience|supervenes]] upon'' NP properties; according to the second, content ''is reducible to'' NP properties. (He noted that if content properties are reducible to NP properties, then they also supervene upon them.) He explained the two theories as follows:
*Reducibility: A belief is a disjunction of conjunctions of NP properties.
*Strong Supervenience (S+): For any possible worlds ''W'' and ''W*'' and any structures ''S'' and ''S*'', if ''S'' has the same NP properties in ''W'' as ''S*'' has in ''W*'', then ''S'' has the same content in ''W'' as ''S*'' has in ''W*''. Supervenience can either be broadly logical supervenience or nomic supervenience.
Plantinga argued that neural structures that constitute beliefs have ''content'', in the following way: "At a certain level of complexity, these neural structures start to display content. Perhaps this starts gradually and early on (possibly C. elegans [a small worm with a nervous system composed of only a few neurons] displays just the merest glimmer of consciousness and the merest glimmer of content), or perhaps later and more abruptly; that doesn't matter. What does matter is that at a certain level of complexity of neural structures, content appears. This is true whether content properties are reducible to NP properties or supervene on them."&lt;ref name="Plantinga/Tooley 2008p 37"&gt;Plantinga/Tooley (2008)p 37&lt;/ref&gt;
So given materialism some neural structures at a given level of complexity acquire content and become beliefs. The question then is according to Plantinga: "what is the likelihood, ''given materialism'', that the content that thus arises is in fact ''true''?"&lt;ref name="Plantinga/Tooley 2008p 37"/&gt;

This way of proceeding replaced the first step of Plantinga's earlier versions of the argument.

==EAAN, intelligent design and theistic evolution==
In his discussion of EAAN, [[Michael Ruse]] described Plantinga as believing in the truth of the attack on evolution presented by [[intelligent design]] advocate [[Phillip E. Johnson]], and as having endorsed Johnson's book ''[[Darwin on Trial]]''. Ruse said that Plantinga took the [[Conflict thesis|conflict between science and religion]] further than Johnson, seeing it as not just a clash between the philosophies of naturalism and theism, but as an attack on the true philosophy of theism by what he considers the incoherent and inconsistent philosophy of naturalism.&lt;ref name=Coleman187/&gt;

Plantinga has stated that EAAN is not directed against "the theory of evolution, or the claim that human beings have evolved from simian ancestors, or anything in that neighborhood".&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) p 1&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that the problems raised by EAAN do not apply to the conjunction of [[theism]] and contemporary evolutionary science.&lt;ref&gt;Beilby(2002) pp 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''Evolution and Design'' Plantinga outlines different ways in which [[theism]] and [[evolutionary theory]] can be combined.&lt;ref&gt;For Faith and Clarity, Philosophical Contributions to Christian Theology, Ed. James Beilby (2006) p 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the foreword to the anthology ''Naturalism Defeated?'' James Beilby wrote: "Plantinga's argument should ''not'' be mistaken for an argument against evolutionary theory in general or, more specifically, against the claim that humans might have evolved from more primitive life forms. Rather, the purpose of his argument is to show that the denial of the existence of a creative deity is problematic."&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt;

The '''Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing''' ({{lang-de|{{no italics|'''Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung}}}}''', or '''BAM''') is a [[Germany|German]] material research institute.

==History==
Its historical origins start in 1870, a year before Germany was unified, as the ''Mechanisch-Technische Versuchsanstalt''. From 1904-19 there was the ''Königliches Materialprüfungsamt''. From 1920-45 there was the ''Staatliches Materialprüfungsamt'' (MPA) and from 1919-45 there was the ''Chemisch-Technische Reichsanstalt'' (CTR). 

In 1954 the ''Bundesanstalt für mechanische und chemische Materialprüfung'' was formed, becoming the ''Bundesanstalt für Materialprüfung'' in 1956. In 1969 it became a government agency (Bundesoberbehörde). In 1986 the name changed to ''Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung''.

==Function==
Within the interconnected fields of materials, chemistry, environment and safety, the main areas are:

* Statutory functions relating to technical safety in the public domain, especially as regards dangerous materials and substances
* Collaboration in developing statutory regulations, for example on safety standards and threshold values
* Advising the Federal Government and industry on safety aspects of materials and chemical technology
* The development and supply of reference materials and methods, in particular for chemical analysis and materials testing
* Assisting in the development of standards and technical regulations for the evaluation of substances, materials, structures and processes with reference to damage prediction and preservation of national economic values.

==Structure==
It is owned by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology. Its competences are to improve safety in technology and chemistry through research and development, testing, analysis, approvals, advice and information.

The headquarters in Berlin are near the [[Berlin Botanischer Garten station]].

===Departments===
The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing is subdivided into departments and divisions. The staff sums up to about 1700 members.

* Analytical chemistry; reference materials
* Chemical safety engineering
* Containment systems for dangerous goods
* Materials and environment
* Materials engineering
* Materials protection and surface technologies
* Safety of structures
* [[Non-destructive testing]]
* Accreditation, Quality in Testing

[[Image:Survey instruments-2.png|thumb|A surveyor's shed showing equipment used for geomatics]]
'''Geomatics''' is defined in the [[ISO/TC 211]] series of standards as the "[[academic discipline|discipline]] concerned with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, presentation of [[geographic data or geographic information]]".&lt;ref&gt;ISO/TR 19122:2004(en)
Geographic information/Geomatics — Qualification and certification of personnel [https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:tr:19122:ed-1:v1:en]&lt;/ref&gt; Under another definition it "consists of products, services and tools involved in the collection, integration and management of geographic data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedgeomatics.net/about-us.html|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=Applied Geomatics Research Laboratory|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes '''geomatics engineering''' (and [[surveying engineering]]) and is related to geospatial science (also geospatial engineering and geospatial technology).

==Overview and etymology ==

Michel Paradis, a French-Canadian surveyor, introduced ''geomatics'' as a new scientific term in an article published in 1981 in ''The Canadian Surveyor'' and in a keynote address at the centennial congress of the [[Canadian Institute of Geomatics|Canadian Institute of Surveying]] in April 1982. He claimed that at the end of the 20th century the needs for geographical information would reach a scope without precedent in history and in order to address these needs, it was necessary to integrate in a new discipline both the traditional disciplines of land surveying and the new tools and techniques of data capture, manipulation, storage and diffusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Paradis|first1= Michel|title= De l'arpentage à la géomatique|journal= Le géomètre canadien|date= September 1981|volume= 35| issue = 3|page=262 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geomatics includes the tools and techniques used in [[land surveying]], [[remote sensing]], [[cartography]], [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), [[Satellite navigation|global-navigation satellite systems]] ([[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], [[Compass navigation system|Compass]]), [[photogrammetry]], [[geophysics]], [[geography]], and related forms of earth [[map]]ping. The term was originally used in [[Canada]], because it is similar in origin to both French and English,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} but has since been adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]], and many other international authorities, although some (especially in the [[United States]]) have shown a preference for the term ''geospatial technology''.{{ref}}{{verify source|date=April 2015}}

The related field of ''hydrogeomatics'' covers the area associated with surveying work carried out on, above or below the surface of the sea or other areas of water. The older term of [[hydrography|hydrographics]] was considered{{by whom|date=April 2015}} too specific to the preparation of marine charts, and failed to include the broader concept of positioning or measurements in all marine environments.

A ''geospatial network'' is a network of collaborating resources for sharing and coordinating geographical data and data tied to geographical references. One example of such a network is the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]]'s efforts to provide ''ready global access to geographic information''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

A number{{quantify|date=April 2015}} of university departments which were once titled "surveying", "survey engineering" or "[[topographic]] science" have re-titled themselves using the terms "geomatics" or "geomatic engineering".

The rapid progress and increased visibility of geomatics since the 1990s has been made possible by advances in [[computer]] hardware, [[computer science]], and [[software engineering]], as well as by airborne and space observation [[remote-sensing]] technologies.

The science of deriving information about an object using a sensor without physically contacting it is called remote sensing, which is a part of geomatics.

'''Geospatial science''' is an academic discipline incorporating fields such as [[surveying]], [[geographic information systems]], [[hydrography]] and [[cartography]]. Spatial science is typically concerned with the measurement, management, analysis and display of spatial information describing the Earth, its physical features and the built environment.&lt;ref name="QUT"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |title=Queensland University of Technology, ''Undergratuate Program - Spatial Science (Surveying)'' |access-date=2008-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719223038/http://www.bee.qut.edu.au/study/courses/undergraduate/spatial.jsp |archive-date=2008-07-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cleanup merge|Geomatics engineering|date=April 2016}}
'''Geomatics Engineering, Geomatic Engineering, Geospatial Engineering''' is a rapidly developing engineering discipline that focuses on spatial information (i.e. information that has a location). The location is the primary factor used to integrate a very wide range of data for spatial analysis and visualization. Geomatics engineers apply engineering principles to spatial information and implement relational data structures involving measurement sciences, thus using geomatics and acting as spatial information engineers. Geomatics engineers manage local, regional, national and global spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics Engineering also involves aspects of Computer Engineering, Software Engineering and Civil Engineering.

Geomatics is a field that incorporates several others such as the older field of land [[surveying engineering]] along with many other aspects of spatial data management ranging from [[data science]] and [[cartography]] to [[geography]]. Following the advanced developments in digital data processing, the nature of the tasks required of the professional land surveyor has evolved and the term "surveying" no longer accurately covers the whole range of tasks that the profession deals with. As our societies become more complex, information with a spatial position associated with it becomes more critical to decision-making, both from a personal and a business perspective, and also from a community and a large-scale governmental viewpoint.

Therefore, the geomatics engineer can be involved in an extremely wide variety of information gathering activities and applications. Geomatics engineers design, develop, and operate systems for collecting and analyzing spatial information about the land, the oceans, natural resources, and manmade features.

The more traditional [[land surveying]] strand of geomatics engineering is concerned with the determination and recording of boundaries and areas of [[real property]] parcels, and the preparation and interpretation of legal land descriptions.  The tasks more closely related to [[civil engineering]] include the design and layout of public infrastructure and urban subdivisions, and mapping and control surveys for construction projects.

Geomatics engineers serve society by collecting, monitoring, archiving, and maintaining diverse spatial data infrastructures. Geomatics engineers utilize a wide range of technologically advanced tools such as digital [[theodolite]]/distance meter total stations, [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) equipment, digital aerial imagery (both satellite and air-borne), and computer-based [[geographic information system]]s (GIS). These tools enable the geomatics engineer to gather, process, analyze, visualize and manage spatially related information to solve a wide range of technical and societal problems.

Geomatics engineering is the field of activity that integrates the acquisition, processing, analysis, display and management of spatial information. It is an exciting and new grouping of subjects in the spatial and environmental information sciences with a broad range of employment opportunities as well as offering challenging pure and applied research problems in a vast range of interdisciplinary fields.

In different schools and in different countries the same education curriculum is administered with the name [[surveying]] in some, and in others with the names geomatics, geomatics engineering, geospatial (information) engineering, surveying engineering, or geodesy and geoinformatics. While these occupations were at one time often taught in [[civil engineering]] education programs, more and more universities include the departments relevant for geo-data sciences under [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]], [[computer science]] or [[applied mathematics]]. These facts demonstrate the breadth, depth and scope of the highly interdisciplinary nature of geomatics engineering.
The job of ''geospatial engineer'' is well established in the U.S. military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/construction-engineering/geospatial-engineer.html|title=Geospatial Engineer Jobs (12Y)|author=|date=|website=goarmy.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalguard.com/12y-geospatial-engineer|title=12Y Geospatial Engineer - National Guard|author=|date=|website=www.nationalguard.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geoscience Research Institute (GRI)''' is a [[creationist]] institute of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] that specializes in "original research and the study of scientific and Biblical literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://grisda.org/about-gri/our-mission//|title=Mission statement|ref=harv|access-date=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1958, it is located on the campus of [[Loma Linda University]] in [[California]].

In keeping with the teachings of the church, they have a [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] agenda, with beliefs based on a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative and rejection of the [[scientific theory]] of [[evolution]] from a single ancestor for all life forms. 
== History ==
The Geoscience Research Institute began in 1957 with the forming of a Seventh Day Adventist Committee on the Teaching of Geology and Paleontology, which selected biologist [[Frank Lewis Marsh]] and chemist P. Edgar Hare to inaugurate courses in those fields, promoting the religious beliefs of the church. The GRI was officially founded in 1958 and was originally located on the campus of [[Andrews University]] in [[Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] and [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Richard M. Ritland was added to the group in 1960, differences in approach soon led to disagreements over whether it was permissible to reinterpret biblical and prophetic accounts in light of scientific evidence, with Hare and Ritland supporting that view while Marsh favored the historic Adventist interpretations. After a number of years of acrimony, Hare decided in 1964 to remain with the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]], where he had gone to conduct laboratory studies. Although Hare chose to continue in the Adventist church, his views leaned toward [[theistic evolution]]. Also in 1964, Ritland outmaneuvered Marsh to become the head of the institute, and Marsh was transferred to Andrews University.

By the late 1960s, Ritland's more flexible approach fell out of favor with a new and more doctrinally rigid church president, [[Robert H. Pierson]], who laid down the following guidelines:&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;Numbers (2006), p320-327&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|In our controversy with proponents of the evolution theory, we must keep in clear perspective — ''the [[Bible]] and the [[Spirit of Prophecy (Adventist)|Spirit of Prophecy]] are not on trial.''}}

Such constraints led Ritland to resign as GRI director in 1970 and join Marsh in the biology department at Andrews University. Ritland was replaced by Robert H. Brown, a physicist who eagerly committed the institute to the more [[Christian apologetics|apologetic]] mission of showing that Earth "originated within six consecutive rotations of the planet" no more than 10,000 years ago and "experienced a universal destruction as portrayed in Genesis 6-8."

Brown was fascinated by radioactive time clocks. He dismissed [[radiocarbon dating]] that contradicted church doctrine but embraced evidence suggesting that the raw materials of Earth were billions of years old. His views, described as "schizoid" by science historian [[Ronald Numbers]], displeased both [[Young Earth creationism|young-Earth]] conservatives such as Marsh and [[Robert V. Gentry]] and [[Progressive Adventism|liberals]] such as Ritland and Hare. Numbers nevertheless states that Brown's achievements included "polishing the tarnished image of creationism," especially compared to the "sometimes slipshod presentations" of the [[Institute for Creation Research]].&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt;

Brown's successor, [[Ariel A. Roth]], moved the institute to Loma Linda University in 1980. Both Brown and Roth dedicated the institute to salvaging [[flood geology]] and repeatedly dismissed scientists skeptical of its credibility.&lt;ref name="numbers"/&gt;

Greenhouse gas monitoring is the direct [[measurement]] of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and levels.  There are several different methods of measuring carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, including [[Infrared gas analyzer|infrared analyzing]] and [[manometry]]. [[Methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are measured by other instruments. Greenhouse gases are measured by [[satellite monitoring]] such as the [[Orbiting Carbon Observatory]] and networks of [[ground station]]s such as the [[Integrated Carbon Observation System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.economist.com/science-technology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15603891 |title=Highs and lows |publisher=The Economist |date=March 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

=== Carbon dioxide monitoring ===

==== Manometry ====
Manometry is a key measurement tool for atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] by first measuring the volume, temperature, and pressure of a particular amount of dry air. The air sample is dried by passing it through multiple dry ice traps and then collecting it in a five liter vessel. The temperature is taken via a thermometer and pressure is calculated using [[manometry]]. Then, [[liquid nitrogen]] is added, causing the [[carbon dioxide]] to condense and become measurable by volume.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Daniel C.|date=2010|title=Charles David Keeling and the Story of Atmospheric CO2 Measurements|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/ipdf/10.1021/ac1001492|journal=Analytical Chemistry|language=en|volume=82|issue=19|pages=7865–7870|doi=10.1021/ac1001492|issn=0003-2700|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ideal gas law]] is accurate to 0.3% in these pressure conditions.

==== Infrared gas analyzer ====
Infrared analyzers were used at [[Mauna Loa Observatory]] and at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] between 1958 and 2006. IR analyzers operate by pumping an unknown sample of dry air through a 40 cm long cell. A reference cell contains dry [[carbon dioxide]]-free air.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A glowing [[nichrome]] filament radiates broadband [[IR radiation]] which splits into two beams and passes through the gas cells. [[Carbon dioxide]] absorbs some of the radiation, allowing more radiation that passes through the reference cell to reach the detector than radiation passing through the sample cell. Data is collected on a strip chart recorder. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] in the sample is quantified by calibrating with a standard gas of known [[carbon dioxide]] content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Titrimetry ====
[[Titrimetry]] is another method of measuring atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] that was first used by a Scandinavian group at 15 different [[Ground station|ground stations.]] They began passing a 100.0 mL air sample through a solution of [[barium hydroxide]] containing [[cresolphthalein]] indicator.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methane gas monitoring ===

==== Differential absorption lidar ====
Range-resolved infrared [[differential absorption lidar]] (DIAL) is a means of measuring [[methane emissions]] from various sources, including active and closed landfill sites.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innocenti|first=Fabrizio|last2=Robinson|first2=Rod|last3=Gardiner|first3=Tom|last4=Finlayson|first4=Andrew|last5=Connor|first5=Andy|date=2017|title=Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) Measurements of Landfill Methane Emissions|url=https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/9/9/953|journal=Remote Sensing|language=en|volume=9|issue=9|pages=953|doi=10.3390/rs9090953|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Differential absorption lidar|DIAL]] takes vertical scans above [[methane]] sources and then spatially separates the scans to accurately measure the [[methane emissions]] from individual sources. Measuring [[methane emissions]] is a crucial aspect of [[climate change research]], as methane is among the most impactful gaseous [[hydrocarbon]] species.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

=== Nitrous oxide monitoring ===

====Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS)====
[[Nitrous oxide]] is one of the most prominent [[Anthropogenic climate change|anthropogenic]] [[Ozone depletion|ozone-depleting]] gases in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheese|first=Patrick E.|last2=Walker|first2=Kaley A.|last3=Boone|first3=Chris D.|last4=Bernath|first4=Peter F.|last5=Funke|first5=Bernd|date=2016|title=Nitrous oxide in the atmosphere: First measurements of a lower thermospheric source|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2015GL067353|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=43|issue=6|pages=2866–2872|doi=10.1002/2015gl067353|issn=0094-8276|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is released into the atmosphere primarily through natural sources such as soil and rock, as well as [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] process like farming. Atmospheric [[nitrous oxide]] is also created in the atmosphere as a product of a reaction between nitrogen and electronically excited [[ozone]] in the lower [[thermosphere]].

The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment‐Fourier Transform Spectrometer ([[ACE-FTS]]) is a tool used for measuring [[nitrous oxide]] concentrations in the upper to lower [[troposphere]]. This instrument, which is attached to the Canadian satellite [[SCISAT-1|SCISAT]], has shown that [[nitrous oxide]] is present throughout the entire atmosphere during all seasons, primarily due to energetic particle precipitation. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Measurements taken by the instrument show that different reactions create [[nitrous oxide]] in the lower thermosphere than in the mid to upper [[mesosphere]].  The [[ACE-FTS]] is a crucial resource in predicting future [[ozone depletion]] in the upper stratosphere by comparing the different ways in which [[nitrous oxide]] is released into the atmosphere. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Satellite monitoring ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25130">Various aspects of communication have been the subject of study since ancient times, and the approach eventually developed into the academic discipline known today as communication studies.

==Pre-20th century==
In ancient [[Greece]] and Rome, the study of [[rhetoric]], the art of [[Eloquence|oratory]] and [[persuasion]], was a vital subject for [[student]]s. One significant ongoing debate was whether one could be an effective speaker in a base cause ([[Sophists]]) or whether excellent rhetoric came from the excellence of the orator's character ([[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Cicero]]). Through the European Middle Ages and [[Renaissance]] [[grammar]], rhetoric, and [[logic]] constituted the entire [[trivium (education)|trivium]], the base of the system of classical learning in Europe.

Communication has existed since the beginning of human beings, but it was not until the 20th century that people began to study the process. As communication technologies developed, so did the serious study of communication. When World War I ended, the interest in studying communication intensified. The social-science study was fully recognized as a legitimate discipline after World War II.

Before becoming simply communication, or communication studies, the discipline was formed from three other major studies: psychology, sociology, and political science.&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson D. Pooley, “The New History of Mass Communication Research,” in History of Media and Communication Research: Contested Memories, edited with David Park (New York: Peter Lang, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Communication studies focus on communication as central to the human experience, which involves understanding how people behave in creating, exchanging, and interpreting messages.

== United States ==

=== 1900s–20s ===
Though the study of communication reaches back to antiquity and beyond, early twentieth-century work by [[Charles Horton Cooley]], [[Walter Lippmann]], and [[John Dewey]] have been of particular importance for the academic discipline as it stands today. In his 1909 ''Social Organization: a Study of the Larger Mind'', Cooley defines communication as "the mechanism through which human relations exist and develop—all the symbols of the mind, together with the means of conveying them through space and preserving them in time." This view gave processes of communication a central and constitutive place in the study of social relations. ''[[Public Opinion (book)|Public Opinion]]'', published in 1922 by Walter Lippmann, couples this view with a fear that the rise of new technologies in mass communication allowed for the 'manufacture of consent,' and generated dissonance between what he called 'the world outside and the pictures in our heads,' referring to the rift between the idealized concept of democracy and its reality. John Dewey's 1927 ''[[The Public and its Problems]]'' drew on the same view of communications, but instead took a more optimistic reform agenda, arguing famously that "communication can alone create a great community," as well as "of all affairs, communication is the most wonderful."

Cooley, Lippmann, and Dewey capture themes like the central importance of communication in social life, the impact of changing technology upon culture, and questions regarding the relationship between communication, democracy, and community. These concepts continue to drive scholars today. Many of these concerns are also central to the work of writers such as [[Gabriel Tarde]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]], who have also made significant contributions to the field.

In 1925, Herbert A. Wichelns published the essay "The Literary Criticism of Oratory" in the book ''Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James Albert Winans.''&lt;ref&gt;Herbert A. Wichelns, "The Literary Criticism of Oratory," in ''Studies in Rhetoric and Public Speaking in Honor of James Albert Winans'' (New York: The Century Co., 1925), 181–216.&lt;/ref&gt; Wicheln's essay attempted to "put rhetorical studies on par with literary studies as an area of academic interest and research."&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Medhurst, "The Academic Study of Public Address: A Tradition in Transition," in ''Landmark Essays in American Public Address,'' ed. Martin J. Medhurst (Hermagoras Press 1993), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Wichelns wrote that oratory should be taken as seriously as literature, and therefore, it should be subject to criticism and analysis. Although the essay is now standard reading in most rhetorical criticism courses, it had little immediate impact (from 1925–1935) on the field of rhetorical studies.&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Medhurst, "The Academic Study of Public Address: A Tradition in Transition," in ''Landmark Essays in American Public Address,'' ed. Martin J. Medhurst (Hermagoras Press 1993), p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1930s–50s===
The institutionalization of communication studies in U.S. higher education and research has often been traced to [[Columbia University]], the [[University of Chicago]], and the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]], where early pioneers such as [[Paul F. Lazarsfeld]], [[Harold Lasswell]], and [[Wilbur Schramm]] worked.  The work of Samuel Silas Curry, who founded the School of Expression in 1879 in Boston, is also noted in early communication research.  Today, the School of Expression is known as Curry College, located in Milton, MA, which houses one of the nation's oldest Communication programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curry.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Applied Social Research]] was established in 1944 at Columbia University by Paul F. Lazarsfeld. It was a continuation of the Rockefeller Foundation-funded Radio Project that he had led at various institutions (University of Newark, Princeton) from 1937, which had been at Columbia as the Office of Radio Research since 1939. In its various incarnations, the Radio Project had involved Lazarsfeld himself, and people like Adorno, [[Hadley Cantril]], [[Herta Herzog]], Gordon Allport, and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]] (who went on to be president of CBS). Lazarsfeld and the Bureau mobilized substantial sums for research, and produced, with various co-authors, a series of books and edited volumes that helped define the discipline, such as ''Personal Influence'' (1955) which remains a classic in what is called the 'media effects'-tradition.

From the 1940s and onwards, the University of Chicago was home to several committees and commissions on communications, as well as programs that educated communication scholars. In contrast to what took place at Columbia, these programs explicitly claimed the name 'communications' for themselves. The Committee on Communication and Public Opinion, also funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, was staffed with, in addition to Lasswell, people such as [[Douglas Waples]], [[Samuel A. Stouffer]], [[Louis Wirth]], and [[Herbert Blumer]], all of whom held positions elsewhere at the university. They formed a committee that essentially served as a scholarly and educational extension of the federal government's increasing interest in communications during times of war, particularly the [[Office of War Information]]. Chicago later provided an institutional home for The Hutchins Commission on the Freedom of the Press and the Committee on Communication (1947–1960). The latter was a degree-granting program that counted [[Elihu Katz]], [[Bernard Berelson]], [[Edward Shils]], and [[David Riesman]] amongst its faculty, alumni include [[Herbert J. Gans]] and Michael Gurevitch. The committee also produced publications such as Berelson and [[Morris Janowitz|Janowitz]]' ''Public Opinion and Communication'' (1950) and the journal ''Studies in Public Communication''.

The Institute for Communications Research was founded at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1947 by Wilbur Schramm, who was a key figure in the post-war institutionalization of communication studies in the U.S. Like the various Chicago committees, the Illinois program claimed the name 'communications' and granted graduate degrees in the subject. Schramm, who, in contrast to the more social science-inspired figures at Columbia and Chicago, had a background in English literature, developed communication studies partly by merging existing programs in speech communication, rhetoric, and, especially, journalism under the aegis of communication. He also edited a textbook ''The Process and Effects of Mass Communication'' (1954) that helped define the field, partly by claiming Lazarsfeld, Lasswell, [[Carl Hovland]], and [[Kurt Lewin]] as its founding fathers. He also wrote several other manifestos for the discipline, including ''The Science of Human Communication'' 1963. Schramm established three important communication institutes: the Institute of Communications Research (University of Illinois), the Institute for Communication Research (Stanford University), and the East-West Communication Institute (Honolulu). Many of Schramm's students, such as [[Everett Rogers]], went on to make important contributions of their own.

=== 1950s===
Universities combined scholars of speech and mass media together under the term communication, which turned out to be a difficult process. While east coast universities did not see human communication as an important area for research, the field grew in the midwest. The first college of communication was founded at Michigan State University in 1958,&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. (2001). The department of communication at Michigan State University as a seed institution for communication course. Communication Studies, 52, 234–248.&lt;/ref&gt; led by scholars from Schramm's original ICR and dedicated to studying communication scientifically. MSU was soon followed by important departments of communication at [[Purdue University]], [[University of Texas-Austin]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Iowa]], and the [[University of Illinois]].  Walter Annenberg endowed three Schools for Communication at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[The University of Southern California]], and [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simonson and John Durham Peters, "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media had long been studied by Adorno and his colleagues at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]], but German communication research further expanded rapidly at institutions such as the University of Hamburg, which opened the Hans Bredow Institute for Radio and Television in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson, Peter, and John Durham Peters. "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968." In International Encyclopedia of Communication, edited by Wolfgang Donsbach. Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Associations related to Communication Studies were founded or expanded during the 1950s. The National Society for the Study of Communication (NSSC) was founded in 1950 to encourage scholars to pursue communication research as a social science.&lt;ref&gt;William F. Eadie, "Communication as an Academic Field: USA and Canada," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This Association launched the Journal of Communication in the same year as its founding. Like many communication associations founded around this decade, the name of the association changed with the field. In 1968 the name changed to the International Communication Association (ICA).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simonson and John Durham Peters, "Communication and Media Studies, History to 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of what has been called 'medium theorists', arguably defined by [[Harold Innis]]' (1950) ''Empire and Communications'' grew increasingly important, and was popularized by [[Marshall McLuhan]] in his ''Understanding Media'' (1964). “McLuhan recognized that the evolution of communication played a crucial role in the human historical development and that social changes following the World Wars were directly connected with the rising of electrical communication technologies, which contributed in transforming the world into a ‘global village.’” &lt;ref&gt;Paolo Magaudda, "Communication Studies," in Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, ed. Dale Southernton (n.p.: n.p., 2011), [21].&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective informs the later work of [[Joshua Meyrowitz]] (''No Sense of Place'', 1986).

Two developments in the 1940s shifted the paradigm of communication studies in the 1950s and thereafter toward a more quantitative orientation.  One was cybernetics, as formulated by [[Norbert Wiener]] in his ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;Paris: Librairie Hermann &amp; Cie, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; The other was [[information theory]], as recast in quantitative terms by [[Claude E. Shannon]] and [[Warren Weaver]] in their ''Mathematical Theory of Communication''.&lt;ref&gt;Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1949. {{ISBN|0-252-72548-4}}. Shannon &amp; Weaver's seminal work, which had developed during [[World War II]], originally appeared during 1948 in ''Bell System Technical Journal 27'', 379–423 (July) and 623–656 (October).&lt;/ref&gt; These works were widely appropriated to, and offered for some the prospect of, a general theory of society.

The tradition of [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] was, as in Europe, an important source of influence for many researchers. While done out of sociology departments, the work of [[Jürgen Habermas]], the US-based [[Leo Löwenthal]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Siegfried Kracauer]], as well as earlier figures like Adorno and [[Max Horkheimer]] continued to inform a whole tradition of cultural criticism that often focused both empirically and theoretically on the [[culture industry]].

In 1953, to address growing needs in the industry, [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] began offering a [[master of science]] degree in [[technical writing]]. In the 1960s the degree title became [[technical communication]]. It was the brainchild of longtime RPI professor and administrator Jay R. Gould.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard David Ramsey]]. (1990). The life and work of Jay R. Gould. ''Journal of Technical Writing and Communication 20'', 19-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 1950’s [[Bernard Berelson]] remarked that the field of communication was becoming too disjointed and argued that the field was dying with no new ideas or directions. This is “often referred to as his obituary for communication research.” &lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mullikin Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies, History Since 1968," in International Encyclopedia of Communication, ed. Wolfgang Donsbach, Boston, MA: Wiley-Blackwell. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, new developments in media technology helped advance the field.

Other advances in communication studies came from the United States Information Agency and the work of Paul R. Conroy, USIA's Chief of Professional Training. As Dr. Conroy detailed in Antioch Review in 1958 &lt;ref&gt; Paul R. Conroy, "On Giving a Good Account of Ourselves," The Antioch Review, Vol. 18, No 4 (Winter 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;, USIA's program to help State Department employees and other personnel position the U.S. in the best possible light helped codify -- in a training environment focused on mock news conferences and other role-playing encounters -- now commonly-accepted media training, crisis communication, and interpersonal communication principles. 

Dr. Conroy was among the first to focus on principles of real-time message delivery - rather than simply message development - and the first to format such principles in a large-scale and repeatable training curriculum on the scale of USIA's global training program for its personnel.  "It is not enough to have a clear concept of the message," Dr. Conroy summarized in Antioch Review, "Communication, after all, is an art. And since any art usually requires practice in the skilled application of sound techniques, it is better if the practice is guided rather than haphazard."

=== 1960s===
In the 1960s, Gould and his colleagues experienced increasing demand for doctoral-level studies in technical and business communication.  As a result, in 1965 RPI began its Ph.D. program in communication and rhetoric.  This Ph.D. degree program became a prototype for other technologically oriented programs in the United States and other industrialized countries.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of [[cultivation theory]], pioneered by [[George Gerbner]] at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania]]. This approach shifted emphasis from the short-term effects that had been the central interest of many earlier media studies, and instead tried to track the effects of exposure across time.

In the early 1960s Communication Studies began to move towards a more independent field, and move out of the departments of [[sociology]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[English language|English]]. The changes in the department are considered a result of the historical events taking place at the time. “Despite the different interpretations given to the changes around the time of World War II, mostly shaped by increasing technological innovations in the ways people communicate, communication became a relevant and recurrent issue in human and social science, opening the doors to the centrality of communication in social theories in the 1960s and 1970s.” &lt;ref&gt;Magaudda, "Communication Studies," in Encyclopedia of Consumer Culture, [22].&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of many of these sociological changes taking place in society, communication and mass media acquired the role of explaining these changes to the public. In response to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Vietnam War]], and other dramatic cultural shifts, critics using [[Cultural Marxism|Marxist]] and [[feminist theory]] to study dominant cultures became prominent in scholarly conversations. [[Cultural Studies]] related to mass media and critics asked why a number of big organizations had such an influence on society.

The political turmoil of the 1960s worked to the field’s advantage because mass media scholars began to explore the influence that media had on culture and society.&lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  “Growing recognition of the importance of the media by both industry and the public, as well as increasing respect for the field at the university leveled to increased support for new scholarship.” &lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, national and international communications conferences started to be held and associations such as the Speech Association of America (now [[National Communication Association]]) and [[International Communication Association]] (ICA) increased membership. With each year that passed, the number of communication journals published grew rapidly and by 1970 there were nearly one hundred of them published. After 1968, communication studies started to mature into its own discipline and gained respect in developed nations.&lt;ref&gt;Simonson and Peters, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1970s–80s===
The Journal of Communication referred to the 1970s as a “time of ferment, particularly in the speech field. As social scientists pushed for recognition of ‘communication’ as the dominant term, rhetorical and performance scholars reconsidered and redefined their theories and methodologies.” &lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  Speech Criticism combined with other sectors such as journalism and broadcasting to form of Communication Studies. In addition to the subgroups of the field making changes, national associations frequently changed their formal names to adapt to the growing field of communication. For example, in 1970 the Speech Association of America became the Speech Communication Association.&lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio and television continued to develop throughout the 1970s and this boom in diversity “forced scholars to adopt a more convergent model of communication.” &lt;ref&gt;Parcell, "Communication and Media Studies," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no longer only one source for each message and there was almost always more than one path from sender to receiver. 
	
[[Neil Postman]] founded the [[media ecology]] program at [[New York University]] in 1971. Media ecologists draw on a wide range of inspirations in their attempts to study media environments in an even broader and more culturally-driven fashion. This perspective is the basis of a separate professional association, the Media Ecology Association.

In 1972, [[Maxwell McCombs]] and [[Donald Shaw (academic)|Donald Shaw]] published a groundbreaking article that offered an [[agenda-setting theory]] that paved a new conception of short-term effects of the media. This approach, organized around additional ideas such as framing, priming, and gatekeeping, has been highly influential, especially in the study of political communication and news coverage.

The 1970s also saw the development of what became known as [[uses and gratifications]] theory, developed by scholars such as Elihu Katz, [[Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. Instead of seeing audiences as passive entities experiencing effects from a one-way model (sender to receiver), they are analyzed through the paradigm of actively seeking out content based on their own pre-existing communication needs.

In 1980 the [[US Department of Education]] classified “communication” as a practical discipline, which was associated primarily with learning journalism and media production. The same classification system deemed speech and rhetorical studies a subcategory of English.&lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
By the 1980s many colleges and universities across the country decided to rename departments to include the word “communication” in the department title. Other schools began titling their departments [[Mass Communication]], or created independent communication departments. “Often these new schools merge the professional fields of print, broadcast, public relations, advertising, information science, and speech with growing research programs more broadly defined communication research.” &lt;ref&gt;Eadie, "Communication as an Academic," in International Encyclopedia of Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this point in time communication studies began to gain recognition in schools worldwide.

Written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980, "The Universal Communication Law" states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate." In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf (communication that it is dehydrated, thirsty per se, dying); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.). Everything living communicates." [[citation needed]]

==Germany==
Communication studies in Germany has a rich hermeneutic heritage in philology, textual interpretation, and historical studies. The post-World War II era, however, has seen the rise of a number of new paradigms.

[[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] pioneered work on the [[spiral of silence]] in a tradition that has been widely influential across the world and has proven to be easily compatible with the dominant paradigms in, for instance, the United States.

In the 1970s, [[Karl Deutsch]] came to [[West Germany]], and his [[cybernetics]] inspired work has been widely influential there as elsewhere.

The work of the Frankfurt School has been a cornerstone of much German work on communication, in addition to Horkheimer, Adorno, and Habermas, figures like [[Oskar Negt]] and [[Alexander Kluge]] has been important in the development of this strand of thought.

An important competing paradigm has been the systems theory developed by [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his students.

Finally, from the 1980s and onwards, theorists like [[Friedrich Kittler]] have led the development of a 'new German medium theory', aligned partly with the Canadian medium theory of Innis and McLuhan and partly with [[post-structuralism]].

Major aims of the project are to understand how humans are affecting the deep-sea environment and to provide policy makers with accurate scientific information, enabling effective management strategies to protect deep sea ecosystems.The HERMIONE project is funded by the [[European Commission]]'s [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and is the successor to the [[HERMES project]], which concluded in March 2009.&lt;ref name=hermes&gt;[http://www.eu-hermes.net/ '''HERMES''' website, http://www.eu-hermes.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Europe's deep-ocean margin, from the [[Arctic]] to the [[Iberian Margin]], and across the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Black Sea]],  spans a distance of over 15,000&amp;nbsp;km and hosts a number of diverse habitats and ecosystems. [[Deep water coral]] reefs, [[undersea mountains]] populated by a multitude of organisms, vast [[submarine canyon]] systems, and [[hydrothermal vent]]s are some of the features contained therein.&lt;ref name=schloesser2&gt;Schloesser, Manfred (2009). [http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/geowissenschaften/ausbrueche_tiefsee_schlammvulkans_haakon_mosby_135655.html Ausbrüche des Tiefsee-Schlammvulkans Haakon Mosby] ("Outbreaks of the Deep Sea Mud Volcano Haakon Mosby"). ''Innovations Report'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional view of the deep-sea realm as a hostile and barren place was discredited long ago, and scientists now know that much of Europe's deep sea is rich and diverse.&lt;ref name=marum1&gt;Marum - Zentrum für Marine Umweltwissenschaften an der Universität Bremen (2009). [http://portal.gmx.net/de/themen/wissen/tiere/8563192-Methusalem-Austern-leben-doch-noch.html Erstmals lebende Tiefseeaustern im Mittelmeer entdeckt!] ("For the First Time, Living Deep Sea Oysters Discovered in the Mediterranean!"). ''GMX'' (website).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the deep sea is increasingly threatened by humans: most of this deep-ocean frontier lies within Europe's [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) and has significant potential for the exploitation of biological, energy, and mineral resources. Research and exploration over the last two decades has shown clear signs of direct and indirect [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]] in the deep sea, resulting from such activities as [[overfishing]],&lt;ref name=bailey1&gt;Bailey et al. (2009). [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2009/03/06/rspb.2009.0098.full.pdf "Long-term changes in deep-water fish populations in the northeast Atlantic: a deeper reaching effect of fisheries?".] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' 10.1098/rspb.2009.0098.&lt;/ref&gt; [[marine debris|littering]] and [[marine pollution|pollution]]. This raises concerns because deep-sea processes and ecosystems are not only important for the marine [[food chain|web of life]], but also fundamentally contribute to the global [[biogeochemical cycle]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Continuing with the knowledge obtained by the HERMES project (EC FP6), which contributed significantly to our understanding of deep-sea ecosystems,&lt;ref name=ocean1&gt;See for instance [http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/22_1.html the March 2009 issue of ''Oceanography''], dedicated to HERMES, with 16 articles on its contributions. (PDFs viewable at website.)&lt;/ref&gt; the HERMIONE project investigates ecosystems at critical sites on Europe's deep-ocean margin, aiming to make major advances in knowledge of their distribution and functioning, and their contribution to ecosystem goods and services.{{Clarify|date=December 2009}} HERMIONE places special emphasis on human impact on the deep sea and on the translation of scientific information into science policy for the sustainable use of marine resources. To design and implement effective governance strategies and management plans to protect our deep seas for the future, understanding the extent, natural dynamics and interconnection of ocean ecosystems, and integrating socio-economic research with natural science, are important. To achieve this, HERMIONE uses a highly interdisciplinary and integrated approach, engaging experts in [[biology]], [[ecology]], [[biodiversity]], [[oceanography]], [[geology]], [[sedimentology]], [[geophysics]] and [[biogeochemistry]], who will work alongside socio-economists and policy-makers.

== Hotspot research ==
The HERMIONE project focuses on deep-sea "hotspot" ecosystems including [[submarine canyon]]s, open slopes and deep basins, [[chemosynthetic]] environments, deep water coral reefs, and [[seamount]]s.  Hotspot ecosystems support high species diversity, numbers of individuals, or both, and are therefore important in maintaining margin-wide biodiversity and abundance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  HERMIONE research ranges from investigation of the ecosystems' dimensions, distribution, interconnection and functioning, to understanding the potential impacts of [[climate change]] and anthropogenic disturbance. The ultimate objective is to provide stakeholders and policymakers with the scientific knowledge necessary to support deep-sea governance, sustainable management and conservation of these ecosystems.

To obtain the data needed, HERMIONE scientists are spending over 1000 days at sea, using more than 50 research vessels across Europe.  Sharing vessels and equipment between partners will bring benefits through shared knowledge, expertise and data, and will also maximise the research effort, increasing efficiency and productivity. State-of-the-art technology will be used, with [[remotely operated underwater vehicle|Remotely Operated Vehicles]] (ROVs) one of the critical pieces of equipment being used for a wide range of delicate manoeuvres and high-resolution surveys, from precision sampling of methane gas at [[cold seep]]s to [[bathymetry|microbathymetry]] mapping to examine the structure of the seabed.  Large arrays of [[mooring (oceanography)|instrumented moorings]], shared by different partner institutions, will be deployed in common experimental areas, allowing HERMIONE to develop experimental strategies beyond any national capacity.

=== Study areas ===
[[Image:Map of research areas.jpg|thumb|alt=map of HERMIONE scientific study areas|Map of HERMIONE areas of scientific research]]

The HERMIONE study sites were selected on the following basis:

*The Arctic because of its importance in monitoring climate change;
*Nordic margin with abundant cold-water corals, extensive [[hydrocarbon exploration]] and the Haakon-Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) natural laboratory;
*Celtic margin with a mid-latitude canyon, cold water corals and the long term [[Porcupine Abyssal Plain]] (PAP) monitoring site;
*Portuguese margin with the highly diverse [[Nazaré Canyon|Nazare]] and [[Setubal canyon]]s;
*Seamounts in the Atlantic and western Mediterranean as important biodiversity hotspots potentially under threat;
*[[Mid-Atlantic Ridge|Mid Atlantic Ridge]] (MAR) [[ESONET]] site to link [[cold seep]] to [[hydrothermal vent|hot seep]] chemosynthetic studies;
*Mediterranean cold water cascading sites in the Gulf of Lions and outflows of the Adriatic and Aegean Seas.

The HMMV, PAP, MAR and central Mediterranean sites link to the ESONET long-term monitoring sites and will provide valuable background information.

HERMIONE scientists use cutting-edge technology to try to answer these questions.&lt;ref name=weaver1 /&gt;  High-resolution mapping of the seafloor will be carried out to determine the location and distribution of cold-water corals, and photographic observations will be made to assess changes in the status of known reefs over time, such as their response to climatic variation or their recovery from destruction by fishing trawlers.  To assess biodiversity and its relationship with environmental factors such as climate change, [[DNA barcoding]] and other molecular techniques will be used.

=== Submarine canyons ===
Submarine canyons are deep, steep-sided valleys that form on continental margins.  Stretching from the shelf to the deep sea, they dissect much of the European margin.  They are one of the most complex seascapes known to humans; their rugged topography and challenging environmental conditions mean that they are also one of the least explored.  Advances in technology over the last two decades have allowed scientists to uncover some of the mysteries of canyons, the size of which often rival the [[Grand Canyon]],&lt;ref&gt;Tyler et al. (2009). [http://www.tos.org/oceanography/issues/issue_archive/22_1.html "Europe's Grand Canyon"] ''Oceanography'' 22 (1), March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; USA.

One of the most important discoveries is that canyons are major sources and sinks for sediment and organic matter on continental margins.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard et al. (1979). "Currents in submarine canyons and other seavalleys" ''AAPG Studies in Geology'' (8), Tulsa, OK&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carson et al.

Particle flux through canyons has been found to be between two and four times greater than on the open slope,&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; though the transfer of particles through canyons is thought to be largely "event-driven",&lt;ref&gt;Palanques et al.

Determining what drives sediment transport and deposition within canyons is one of the major challenges for HERMIONE.

The capacity of canyons to focus and concentrate organic matter can promote high abundances and diversity of fauna.  However, variability in environmental conditions and topography is very high, both within and between canyons, and this is reflected in the variability of the structure and dynamics of the biological communities.&lt;ref&gt;Pattenden (2009) "The influence of submarine canyons on the structure and dynamics of megafauna communities" ''PhD Thesis'', University of Southampton&lt;/ref&gt;  Our understanding of biological processes in canyons has greatly improved with the use of submersibles and ROVs, but this research has also revealed that the relationships between fauna and canyons are more complex than previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia et al.

HERMIONE will address this challenge by examining canyon ecosystems from different biogeochemical provinces and topographic settings, in light of the complex interactions among habitat (topography, water masses, currents), mass and energy transfer, and biological communities.

=== Open slopes and deep basins ===
Open slopes and deep basins make up &gt; 90% of the ocean floor and 65% of the Earth's surface, and many of the goods and services provided by the deep sea (e.g., oil, gas, climate regulation and food) are produced and stored by them.  They are intricately involved in global biogeochemical and ecological processes, and so are essential for the functioning of our biosphere and human wellbeing.

Recent research in the HERMES (EC-FP6) project gathered a large body of information on local biodiversity at large scales, different latitudes and in different hotspot ecosystems, but the research also highlighted the high degree of complexity of deep-sea habitats.  This information is fundamental to our understanding of the factors that control biodiversity at much larger scales, from hundreds to thousands of kilometres.  HERMIONE will conduct further studies on the mosaic of habitats found in deep-sea slopes and basins, and will investigate the relationships within and between these habitats, their biodiversity and ecology, and their interconnection with other hotspot ecosystems.

Investigating the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change in the deep sea is a theme that runs through all HERMIONE research.  To the biological communities on open slopes and in deep basins, seafloor warming through climate change is a major threat.  Up to 85% of methane reservoirs along the continental margin could be destabilised, which would not only release climate-warming methane gas into the atmosphere, but would also have unknown and potentially devastating consequences on benthic communities.  The role of climatic variation on deep-sea benthos is not well understood, although large-scale changes in the structure of seafloor communities have been observed over the last two decades.  The use of long-term, deep-sea observatories, e.g., the Hausgarten deep-sea observatory in the Arctic and the time-series analysis of the Catalan margin and Southern Adriatic Sea, will help HERMIONE scientists to examine recent changes in benthic communities, and to study decadal variability in physical processes, such as the dense shelf water cascading events in submarine canyons.&lt;ref name="Flushing submarine canyons"/&gt;

HERMIONE aims to provide quantitative estimates of the potential consequences of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning, to examine how deep-sea benthos adapt to large-scale changes, and, for the first time, to create conceptual models integrating deep-sea biodiversity and quantitative analyses of ecosystem functioning and processes.

=== Seamounts ===
Seamounts are underwater mountains that rise from the depths of the ocean, and whose summits can sometimes be found just a few hundred metres below the sea surface.  To be classified as a seamount the summit must be 1000 m higher than the surrounding seafloor,&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, P. (2007) "Seamount characteristics" p. 3-25 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and under this definition there are an estimated 1000–2800 seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and around 60 in the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchingman, A., Lai, S., Morato, T., and Pauly, D. (2007). "How many seamounts are there and where are they located?" p.26-40 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamounts enhance water flow through localised tides, eddies, and upwelling, and these physical processes may enhance primary production.&lt;ref&gt;White, M., Bashmachnikov, I., Aristegui, H., and Martins, A. (2007). "Physical processes and seamount productivity" p.65-84 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seamounts may therefore be considered as hotspots of marine life; fauna benefit from the enhanced hydrodynamics and phytoplankton supply, and thrive on the slopes and summits.  Suspension feeders, such as gorgonian sea fans and the cold-water corals like Lophelia pertusa, often dominate the rich benthic (seafloor-dwelling) communities.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A., Baco, A., Griffiths, H., Hart, T., and Hall-Spencer, J.M. (2007). "Corals on seamounts" p.141-169 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; The enhanced abundance and diversity of fauna is not limited to benthic species, as fish are known to aggregate over seamounts.&lt;ref&gt;Morato, T. and Clark, M.R. (2007). "Seamount fishes: Ecology and life histories" p.170-188 in ''Seamounts: Ecology, Fisheries and Conservation.'' T.J. Pitcher, T. Morato, P.J.B. Hart, M.R. Clark, N. Haggan, and R.S. Santos (eds), ''Fish and Aquatic Resource Series'', Blackwell, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, this knowledge has led to increasing commercial exploitation of seamount fish by the fishing industry, and a number of seamount fish populations have already been depleted.  Part of HERMIONE research will assess the threats and impacts of human activities on seamounts, including comparing data from seamounts in different stages of fisheries exploitation to understand more about the impacts of fishing activities., both on target species and non-target species, and their habitats.

Despite our increasing knowledge on seamounts, there is still very little known about the relationships between their ecosystem functioning and biodiversity, and that of the surrounding areas.  This information is vital in order to improve our understanding of connectivity between seamount hotspots and adjacent areas, and HERMIONE research will aim to discover whether seamounts act as centres of speciation (the evolution of new species), or if they play a role as "stepping stones", allowing fauna to colonise and disperse across the oceans.

=== Chemosynthetic ecosystems ===
Chemosynthetic environments - such as hot vents, cold seeps, mud volcanoes and sulphidic brine pools - show the highest biomass and productivity of all deep-sea ecosystems.  The chemicals found in the fluids, gases and mud that escape from such systems provide an energy source for chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea, which are the primary producers in these systems. A huge variety of fauna profits from the association with chemosynthetic microbes, supporting large communities that can exist independently of sunlight.  Some of these environments, such as methane (cold) seeps, can support up to 50,000 times more biomass than communities that rely on photosynthetic production alone.&lt;ref&gt;Sibuet, M. and Olu-Le Roy, K. (2002)"Cold seep communities on continental margins: Structure and quantitative distribution relative to geological and fluid venting patterns". Pp. 235-251 in ''Ocean Margin Systems'' Wefer, G., Billett, D.S.M., Hebbeln, D., Jorgensen, B.B., Schluter, M. and Van Weering, T.C.M. (eds), Springer Verlag, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the extreme gradients and diversity in physical and chemical factors, hydrothermal vents also remain incredibly fascinating ecosystems. HERMIONE researchers aim to illustrate the tight coupling between geosphere and biosphere processes, as well as their immense heterogeneity and interconnectivity, by observing and comparing the spatial and temporal variation of chemosynthetic environments in European Sea’s.

Methane cycling and carbonate formation by microorganisms in chemosynthetic environments have implications for the control of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;Boetius, A. et al. (2007) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6804/full/407623a0.html "A marine microbial consortium apparently mediating anaerobic oxidation of methane"] ''Nature'' 407, p.623-626, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, R.J. et al. (2007) "Biogeochemistry and biodiversity of methane cycling in subsurface marine sediments (Skagerrak, Denmark)" ''Environmental Microbiology'', 9, p.1146-1161&lt;/ref&gt;  Methane can be trapped and stored under the seabed as a gas hydrate, and under different conditions, can either be controlled by microbial consumption, or can escape into the surrounding seawater, and ultimately the atmosphere. Our understanding of the biological controls of methane seepage and feedback mechanisms for global warming is limited. The distribution and structure of cold seep communities can act as an indicator for changes in methane fluxes in the deep sea, e.g. by seafloor warming.&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;Niemann H. et al.(2006) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7113/full/nature05227.html "Novel microbial communities of the Haakon Mosby mud volcano and their role as a methane sink"] ''Nature'' 443, p.854-858, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Using multibeam echosounder data and 3D seismic data with in situ studies at seep sites, and by investigating the life histories of fauna at such ecosystems, HERMIONE scientists aim to understand more about their interconnectivity and resilience, and the implications for climate change.

The great variety of fauna present in chemosynthetic environments is a real challenge to scientists.  Only a tiny fraction of microorganisms at vents and seeps has been identified, and a huge amount is still to be discovered. Their identification, their association with fauna, and the relationship between their diversity, function and habitat, are vital areas of research as biological communities act as important filters, controlling up to 100% of vent and seep emissions.&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;  By using DNA barcoding and genome analysis in addition to traditional methods of identification and experimentation, HERMIONE scientists will study the relationship between community structure and ecosystem functioning at a variety of vents, seeps, brine pools and mud volcanoes.

== Socio-economics, governance and science-policy interfaces ==
With increasing ocean exploration over the last two decades has come the realisation that humans have had an extensive impact on the world’s oceans, not just close to our shores, but also reaching down into the deep sea.  From destructive fishing practices and exploitation of mineral resources to pollution and litter, evidence of human impact can be found in virtually all deep-sea ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.M., Collins, M.A., Gordon, J.D.M., Zuur, A.F., and Priede, I.G. (2009) [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1664/1965.full.pdf "Long-term changes in deep-water fish populations in the northeast Atlantic: a deeper reaching effect of fisheries?"]''Proceedings of the Royal Society B'' {{doi|10.1098/rspb.2009.0098}}, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Galil, B.S., Golik, A., and Turkay, M. (1995) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V6N-3YMFRG6-3S&amp;_user=126770&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1158904856&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000010399&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=126770&amp;md5=40971b16522441babb3c3589be3dcb8b "Litter at the bottom of the sea: A sea bed survey in the Eastern Mediterranean"] ''Marine Pollution Bulletin'' 30, p22-24, January 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the international community has set a series of ambitious goals aimed at protecting the marine environment and its resources for future generations.  Three of these initiatives, decided on by world leaders during the [[Earth Summit 2002|2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg), are to achieve a significant reduction in biodiversity loss by 2010, to introduce an ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010, and to designate a network of [[marine protected area]]s by 2012.  A crucial requirement for implementing these is the availability of high-quality scientific data and knowledge, as well as effective [[science policy|science-policy]] interfaces to ensure the policy relevance of research and to enable the rapid translation of scientific information into science policy.

HERMIONE aims to provide this by filling the knowledge gap about threatened deep-sea ecosystems and their current status with respect to anthropogenic impacts (e.g. litter, chemical contamination).  Socio-economists and natural scientists work together in HERMIONE, researching the socio-economics of anthropogenic impacts, mapping human activities that affect the deep sea, assessing the potential for valuing deep-sea ecosystem goods and services, studying governance options and designing and implementing real-time science-policy interfaces.

HERMIONE natural and social science results will provide national, regional (EU), and global policy-makers and other stakeholders with the information needed to establish policies to ensure the sustainable use of the deep ocean and conservation of deep-sea ecosystems.

This is a list of political topics, including political science terms, political philosophies, political issues, etc.

'''[[Politics]]''' is the process by which groups of people make decisions. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within civil [[government]]s, politics is observed in all human group interactions, including [[corporation|corporate]], [[academia|academic]], and [[religion|religious]] institutions. Politics consists of "social relations involving authority or power"&lt;ref&gt;[http://dict.die.net/politics/ Definition of politics from die.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the regulation of a political unit,&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=303454 Politics (definition)@Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the methods and tactics used to formulate and apply [[policy]].&lt;ref name="freedict"&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/politics Definition of politics from "The Free Dictionary"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Political science]]''' (also known as political studies) is the study of political behavior and examines the acquisition and application of [[political power|power]]. Related areas of study include [[political philosophy]], which seeks a rationale for politics and an ethic of public behavior, and [[public administration]], which examines the practices of governance.

'''LIS Cross-National Data Center''', formerly known as the '''Luxembourg Income Study''' ('''LIS'''), is a non-profit organization registered in Luxembourg which produces a cross-national [[database]] of [[micro-economic]] [[income]] [[data]] for [[social science]] research. The project started in 1983 and is headquartered in [[Luxembourg]]. The database includes over 300 datasets from about 50 high- and middle-income countries, with some countries represented for over 30 years. Nationally representative [[household]] income survey data is commonly, though not exclusively, provided by the participant country's national statistics collection agency (e.g. [[Statistics Canada]]; the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]]). These and other agencies make annual financial contributions which support the database production and maintenance.

The LIS database contains [[Anonymity|anonymised]] [[Demographics|demographic]], [[income]], labour market, and expenditure information at two different levels of analysis ([[household]] and persons). The data have, as far as is practical, been transformed to a structure which make different national data equivalent. Data access is only provided for research projects in the social sciences, commercial use is not permitted. For data security reasons the datasets cannot be [[downloaded]] or directly accessed. After being granted permission to use the data, users submit [[SPSS]], [[SAS System|SAS]] or [[Stata]] programs under their username and password to a remote server. The [[statistical analysis|statistical results]] are automatically returned via [[email]]. 

Datasets in the database are grouped in intervals referred to as "waves": 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013. The LIS data are only suitable for [[cross-sectional analysis]] as households cannot be linked over time. 

Researchers must agree to publish their papers in the LIS working paper series. This does not preclude other forms of publication. As of 2015, there are over 600 research papers in the series. The data are particularly suitable for cross-national comparisons of [[poverty]] and [[Economic inequality|inequality]] and there are many papers on these topics in the working paper series.

LIS has recently included more middle-income countries. In 2007, a cross-national database on [[wealth]], named 'LWS', became available. It contains data from a subset of the countries participating in the LIS Database. 

The [http://www.lisdatacenter.org/ LIS website] contains [http://www.lisdatacenter.org/lis-luli-frontend-webapp/app/request-account-identification registration for data access], dataset contents, self-teaching tutorials, and a working paper series which includes abstracts and full texts.

==Countries Participating in LIS==
[[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[Colombia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Egypt]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Taiwan]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Uruguay]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">An '''oral law''' is a [[code of conduct]] in use in a given [[culture]], [[religion]] or community application, by which a body of rules of human behaviour is transmitted by [[oral tradition]] and effectively respected, or the single rule that is orally transmitted.

Many cultures have an oral law, while most contemporary legal systems have a formal written organisation. The oral tradition (from the [[Latin]] ''tradere'' = to transmit) is the typical instrument of transmission of the oral codes or, in a more general sense, is the complex of what a culture transmits of itself among the generations, "from father to son". This kind of transmission can be due to lack of other means, such as in illiterate or criminal societies, or can be expressly required by the same law.

There has been a continuous debate over oral versus written transmission, with the focus on the perceived higher reliability of written evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Finnegan, 195-201&lt;/ref&gt; primarily based on the "linear world of academia" where only written down records are accepted. However, "standard" theories of orality and literacy have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Goody, pp.27-68&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral law in jurisprudence ==
From a legal point of view, an oral law can be:
*a [[Habituation|habit]], or [[convention (norm)|custom]] with legal relevance or when the formal law expressly refers to it (but in this latter case, it is properly an indirect source of legal [[rights]] and [[Law of obligations|obligation]]s);
*a spoken command  or order that has to be respected as a [[law]] (in most modern western legal systems, some dispositions can be issued by word in given cases of emergency).
An oral law, intended as a body of rules, can be admitted in [[jurisprudence]] as long as it shows some efficacy, therefore it needs that the law is public, the human action is evaluated by a [[judge]] (ordinarily producing a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] according to the general interpretation of the law) and then a [[punishment]] has eventually to be put into effect. Some oral laws provide all these elements (for instance, some codes of conduct in use among criminal associations like [[the Mafia]] do have a well known law, a judge, a condemnation), while others usually miss some of them.

== Oral law in Judaism ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Halakha]] --&gt;
{{main|Oral Torah}}

Although the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term "[[Torah]]" is often translated as "Law", it can just as accurately be translated as "Instruction" or "teaching".  [[Rabbinic Judaism]] maintains that the books of the [[Tanakh]] were transmitted in parallel with an oral tradition, as relayed by God to Moses and from him handed on to the scholarly and other religious leaders of each generation.  Thus, in Judaism, the "Written Instruction" (''Torah she-bi-khtav'' תורה שבכתב) comprises the Torah and the rest of the [[Tanakh]]; the "Oral Instruction" (''Torah she-be'al peh'' תורה שבעל פה) was ultimately recorded in the [[Talmud]] (lit. "Learning") and [[Midrash]]im (lit. "Interpretations").  The interpretation of the [[Oral Torah]] is thus considered as the authoritative reading of the [[Tanakh|Written Torah]]. Further, [[Halakha]] (lit. "The Path", frequently translated as "Jewish Law") is based on a "Written Instruction" together with an "Oral Instruction". Jewish law and tradition is thus not based on a literal reading of the Tanakh, but on the combined oral and written tradition.

'''Orgasm''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὀργασμός ''orgasmos'' "excitement, swelling"; also '''sexual climax''') is the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual excitement during the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], resulting in rhythmic [[Muscle contraction|muscular contractions]] in the [[human pelvis|pelvic]] region characterized by sexual pleasure.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Little, Brown | isbn = 978-0-316-54987-5| page = 366 | last1 = Masters | first1 = William H. | first2=Virginia E. | last2=Johnson |author3=Reproductive Biology Research Foundation (U.S.) | title = Human Sexual Response | year= 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153 133–135] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160402152531/https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153 |date=April 2, 2016 }} for orgasm information, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 76] for G-spot and vaginal nerve ending information. {{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2012| isbn = 978-0618755714}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="health.discovery.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Orgasm|publisher=Health.discovery.com|accessdate=21 April 2010|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/human-biology/orgasm.htm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403181734/http://health.howstuffworks.com/sexual-health/sexuality/orgasm.htm|archivedate=April 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experienced by males and females, orgasms are controlled by the involuntary or [[autonomic nervous system]].

The health effects surrounding the human orgasm are diverse. There are many physiological responses during sexual activity, including a relaxed state created by prolactin, as well as changes in the [[central nervous system]] such as a temporary decrease in the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] activity of large parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] while there is no change or increased metabolic activity in the [[Limbic system|limbic]] (i.e., "bordering") areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Georgiadis"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Georgiadis JR, Reinders AA, Paans AM, Renken R, Kortekaas R |title=Men versus women on sexual brain function: prominent differences during tactile genital stimulation, but not during orgasm |journal=Human Brain Mapping |volume=30 |issue=10 |pages=3089–101 |date=October 2009 |pmid=19219848 |doi=10.1002/hbm.20733|last2=Reinders |last3=Paans |last4=Renken |last5=Kortekaas }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a wide range of [[sexual dysfunction]]s, such as [[anorgasmia]].

Orgasm in non-human animals has been studied significantly less than orgasm in humans, but research on the subject is ongoing.

==Definitions==
In a clinical context, orgasm is usually defined strictly by the muscular contractions involved during sexual activity, along with the characteristic patterns of change in heart rate, blood pressure, and often respiration rate and depth.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt; This is categorized as the sudden discharge of accumulated sexual tension during the [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], resulting in rhythmic muscular contractions in the pelvic region.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="health.discovery.com"/&gt; However, definitions of orgasm vary and there is sentiment that consensus on how to consistently classify it is absent.&lt;ref name=levine_orgasm&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Levine, R.J.|year=2004|title=An orgasm is... who defines what an orgasm is?|journal=[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]]|volume=19|pages=101–107 |doi=10.1080/14681990410001641663}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least twenty-six definitions of orgasm were listed in the journal ''[[Clinical Psychology Review]]''.&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mah |first1=K. |last2=Binik |first2=Y. M. |title=The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends |journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=823–56 |date=August 2001 |pmid=11497209 |doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some debate whether certain types of sexual sensations should be accurately classified as orgasms, including female orgasms caused by [[G-spot]] stimulation alone, and the demonstration of extended or continuous orgasms lasting several minutes or even an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author =  Schwartz, Bob | title = The One Hour Orgasm: A New Approach to Achieving Maximum Sexual Pleasure | publisher = Breakthru Publishing |date=May 1992 | isbn = 978-0-942540-07-9}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question centers around the clinical definition of orgasm, but this way of viewing orgasm is merely physiological, while there are also psychological, endocrinological, and neurological definitions of orgasm.&lt;ref name=levine_orgasm/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mah"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Mah |first1=K. |last2=Binik |first2=Y.

However, the sensations in both sexes are extremely pleasurable and are often felt throughout the body, causing a mental state that is often described as transcendental, and with [[vasocongestion]] and associated pleasure comparable to that of a full-contractionary orgasm. For example, modern findings support distinction between ejaculation and male orgasm.&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik/&gt; For this reason, there are views on both sides as to whether these can be accurately defined as orgasms.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;

==Achieving orgasm==
Orgasms can be achieved by a variety of activities, including [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal]], [[Anal sex|anal]] or [[oral sex]], [[non-penetrative sex]] or masturbation. Orgasm may also be achieved by the use of a [[sex toy]], such as a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|sensual vibrator]] or an [[erotic electrostimulation]]. It can additionally be achieved by stimulation of the [[nipple]]s or other [[erogenous zone]]s, though this is rarer.&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 978-0-8018-9396-4|publisher=JHU Press|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=6 November 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108 |author1=Barry R.

Orgasm by psychological stimulation alone was first reported among people who had [[spinal cord injury]].&lt;ref name="Komisaruk"/&gt; Although sexual function and [[sexuality after spinal cord injury]] is very often impacted, this injury does not deprive one of sexual feelings such as [[sexual arousal]] and erotic desires.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk"/&gt;

Scientific literature focuses on the psychology of female orgasm significantly more than it does on the psychology of male orgasm, which "appears to reflect the assumption that female orgasm is psychologically more complex than male orgasm," but "the limited empirical evidence available suggests that male and female orgasm may bear more similarities than differences. In one controlled study by Vance and Wagner (1976), independent raters could not differentiate written descriptions of male versus female orgasm experiences".&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;

===Males===

====Variabilities====
In men, the most common way of achieving orgasm is by physical sexual stimulation&lt;!-- NOTE: "Sexual stimulation" can mean or include non-physical stimulation; because it takes physical sexual stimulation of the genitals for most people to orgasm, the wording "physical sexual stimulation" is more accurate than "sexual stimulation." --&gt; of the [[Human penis|penis]].&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; This is usually accompanied by [[ejaculation]], but it is possible, though also rare, for men to orgasm without ejaculation (known as a "dry orgasm") or to ejaculate without reaching orgasm (which may be a case of [[delayed ejaculation]], a [[nocturnal emission]] or a case of [[anorgasmia|anorgasmic ejaculation]]).&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mah_&amp;_binik/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Men may also achieve orgasm by stimulation of the [[prostate]] ([[#Anal and prostate stimulation|see below]]).&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wibowo"/&gt;

====Two-stage model====
The traditional view of male orgasm is that there are two stages: emission following orgasm, almost instantly followed by a [[refractory period (sex)|refractory period]].&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; In 1966, [[Masters and Johnson]] published pivotal research about the phases of sexual stimulation.&lt;ref name=M&amp;J/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Masters and Johnson | url=http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/mandj.html | publisher=The Discovery Channel | accessdate=28 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060518002107/http://health.discovery.com/centers/sex/sexpedia/mandj.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work included women and men, and, unlike [[Alfred Kinsey]] in 1948 and 1953,&lt;ref name="Andersen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociology: Understanding a Diverse Society|isbn = 978-0-495-00742-5|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2007|page=338|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UILcQZS6Bi4C&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=Kinsey+criticized+Freud#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinsey%20criticized%20Freud&amp;f=false|author1=Margaret L. Andersen |author2=Howard Francis Taylor }}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to determine the [[physiology|physiological]] stages before and after orgasm.

Masters and Johnson argued that, in the first stage, "accessory organs contract and the male can feel the ejaculation coming; two to three seconds later the ejaculation occurs, which the man cannot constrain, delay, or in any way control" and that, in the second stage, "the male feels pleasurable contractions during ejaculation, reporting greater pleasure tied to a greater volume of ejaculate".&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; They reported that, unlike females, "for the man the resolution phase includes a superimposed refractory period" and added that "many males below the age of 30, but relatively few thereafter, have the ability to ejaculate frequently and are subject to only very short refractory periods during the resolution phase". Masters and Johnson equated male orgasm and ejaculation and maintained the necessity for a refractory period between orgasms.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

====Subsequent and multiple orgasms====
There has been little scientific study of multiple orgasm in men. In contrast to the two-stage model of male orgasm, Kahn (1939) equalized orgasm and ejaculation and stated that several orgasms can occur and that "indeed, some men are capable of following [an orgasm] up with a third and a fourth" orgasm.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Though it is rare for men to achieve multiple orgasms,&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; Kahn's assertion that some men are capable of achieving them is supported by men who have reported having multiple, consecutive orgasms, particularly without ejaculation.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Males who experience dry orgasms can often produce multiple orgasms, as the refractory period is reduced.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt;

An increased infusion of the [[hormone]] [[oxytocin]] during ejaculation is believed to be chiefly responsible for the refractory period, and the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period.&lt;ref&gt;Panksepp, Jaak (2004). ''Textbook of biological psychiatry.'' [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley-IEEE]]. p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Another chemical which is considered to be responsible for the male refractory period is [[prolactin]],&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haake"&gt;{{Cite news | last1 = Haake | first1 = P. | last2 = Exton | first2 = M.S. | last3 = Haverkamp | first3 = J. | last4 = Krämer | first4 = M. | last5 = Leygraf | first5 = N. | last6 = Hartmann | first6 = U. | last7 = Schedlowski | first7 = M. | last8 = Krueger | first8 = T.H.C. | date = April 2002 | title = Absence of orgasm-induced prolactin secretion in a healthy multi-orgasmic male subject | periodical = International Journal of Impotence Research | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–135 | url = http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v14/n2/full/3900823a.html | doi = 10.1038/sj/ijir/3900823 | accessdate = 2007-07-30 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Anecdotal reports on cabergoline suggest it may be able to eliminate the refractory period altogether, allowing men to experience multiple ejaculatory orgasms in rapid succession. At least one scientific study supports these claims,&lt;ref name="Prolactin"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Krüger TH, Haake P, Haverkamp J, et al. |title=Effects of acute prolactin manipulation on sexual drive and function in males |journal=The Journal of Endocrinology |volume=179 |issue=3 |pages=357–65 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14656205 |doi=10.1677/joe.0.1790357}}&lt;/ref&gt; although cabergoline is a hormone-altering drug and has many potential side effects. It has not been approved for treating sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Prolactin"/&gt;

Another possible reason for the lack or absence of a refractory period in men may be an increased infusion of the hormone [[oxytocin]]. It is believed that the amount by which oxytocin is increased may affect the length of each refractory period. A scientific study to successfully document natural, fully ejaculatory, multiple orgasms in an adult man was conducted at [[Rutgers University]] in 1995.

====Orgasmic factors and variabilities====
In women, the most common way to achieve orgasm is by direct sexual stimulation of the [[clitoris]] (meaning consistent [[Fingering (sexual act)|manual]], [[Oral sex|oral]] or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris). General statistics indicate that 70–80&amp;nbsp;percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm,&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph A.

====Clitoral and vaginal categories====
Discussions of female orgasm are complicated by orgasms in women typically being divided into two categories: clitoral orgasm and vaginal (or G-spot) orgasm.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex and Society" /&gt; In 1973, [[Irving Singer]] theorized that there are three types of female orgasms; he categorized these as [[vulva]]l, uterine, and blended, but because he was a philosopher, "these categories were generated from descriptions of orgasm in literature rather than laboratory studies".&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; In 1982, Ladas, [[Beverly Whipple|Whipple]] and Perry also proposed three categories: the tenting type (derived from clitoral stimulation), the A-frame type (derived from G-spot stimulation), and the blended type (derived from clitoral and G-spot stimulation).&lt;ref name="Bolin &amp; Whelehan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Sexuality: Biological, Psychological, and Cultural Perspectives|isbn = 978-0-7890-2672-9|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2009|page=276|accessdate=11 February 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lDQoIhOwwdYC&amp;pg=PA276|author1=Anne Bolin |author2=Patricia Whelehan }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Whipple and Komisaruk proposed [[cervix]] stimulation as being able to cause a fourth type of female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Bolin &amp; Whelehan"/&gt;

Female orgasms by means other than clitoral or vaginal/G-spot stimulation are less prevalent in scientific literature&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt; and most scientists contend that no distinction should be made between "types" of female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"/&gt; This distinction began with [[Sigmund Freud]], who postulated the concept of "vaginal orgasm" as separate from clitoral orgasm.&lt;!-- NOTE: Rules are "promulgated"; theories are "postulated."--&gt; In 1905, Freud stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. While Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, the consequences of this theory were considerable. Many women felt inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone, involving little or no clitoral stimulation, as Freud's theory made penile-vaginal intercourse the central component to women's sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Zastrow"&gt;{{cite book | author= Charles Zastrow|author-link = Charles Zastrow|title = Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year= 2007|page=228|accessdate = March 15, 2014| isbn = 978-0495095101 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tco4YjyZab4C&amp;pg=PT248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Irvine"&gt;{{cite book|title=Disorders of Desire: Sexuality and Gender in Modern American Sexology|isbn =978-1-59213-151-8|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|pages=37–38|accessdate=3 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uIJXT7ZCTCsC&amp;pg=PA37|author=Janice M.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major national surveys of sexual behavior were the [[Kinsey Reports]].&lt;ref name="Andersen"/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] was the first researcher to harshly criticize Freud's ideas about female sexuality and orgasm when, through his interviews with thousands of women,&lt;ref name="Andersen"/&gt; Kinsey found that most of the women he surveyed could not have vaginal orgasms.&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt; He "criticized Freud and other theorists for projecting male constructs of sexuality onto women" and "viewed the clitoris as the main center of sexual response" and the vagina as "relatively unimportant" for sexual satisfaction, relaying that "few women inserted fingers or objects into their vaginas when they masturbated". He "concluded that satisfaction from penile penetration [is] mainly psychological or perhaps the result of referred sensation".&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt;

Masters and Johnson's research into the female [[Human sexual response cycle|sexual response cycle]], as well as [[Shere Hite]]'s, generally supported Kinsey's findings about female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Hite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irvine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sex and Gender | publisher =[[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2002|pages=85–88| accessdate =25 August 2012| isbn = 978-0521635332|url =https://books.google.com/?id=BJ1V9r_J0sUC&amp;pg=PA85 |author1=John Archer |author2=Barbara Lloyd }}

====Clitoral and vaginal relationships====
{{Further|G-spot#Society and culture}}
Accounts that the vagina is capable of producing orgasms continue to be subject to debate because, in addition to the vagina's low concentration of nerve endings, reports of the G-spot's location are inconsistent—it appears to be nonexistent in some women and may be an extension of another structure, such as the [[Skene's gland]] or the clitoris, which is a part of the Skene's gland.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Richard Balon, Robert Taylor Segraves|title=Clinical Manual of Sexual Disorders|publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Pub]]|year=2009|accessdate=January 24, 2014|page=258|isbn=978-1585629053|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC&amp;pg=PA258|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140126060011/https://books.google.com/books?id=YuP3Hb0TMLQC&amp;pg=PA258|archivedate=January 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2012 ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' review examining years of research into the existence of the G-spot, scholars stated that "[r]eports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth".&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt;

Possible explanations for the G-spot were examined by Masters and Johnson, who were the first researchers to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. In addition to observing that the majority of their female subjects could only have clitoral orgasms, they found that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response. On this basis, they argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms,&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters and Johnson"/&gt; reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood; their notion that this provides the clitoris with sufficient sexual stimulation has been criticized by researchers such as [[Elisabeth Lloyd]].&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;

Australian [[Urology|urologist]] Helen O'Connell's 2005 research additionally indicates a connection between orgasms experienced vaginally and the clitoris, suggesting that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina and that therefore clitoral and vaginal orgasms are of the same origin.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; Some studies, using [[ultrasound]], have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse,&lt;ref name="Acton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buss, Meston"&gt;{{cite book|authors=David M. Buss, Cindy M. Meston|title=Why Women Have Sex: Understanding Sexual Motivations from Adventure to Revenge (and Everything in Between)|publisher= [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year=2009|accessdate=January 24, 2014|pages=35–36|isbn=978-1429955225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slyflT85lXIC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt; but O'Connell suggests that the clitoris's interconnected relationship with the vagina is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot. Having used [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology which enabled her to note a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the "clitoral bulbs" and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina, she stated that the vaginal wall is the clitoris; that lifting the skin off the vagina on the side walls reveals the bulbs of the clitoris—triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; O'Connell et al., who performed dissections on the female genitals of [[cadaver]]s and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks.&lt;ref name="Sloane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"/&gt; They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones,&lt;ref name="Sloane"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer, Lloyd"/&gt; and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;

French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported similar findings to that of O'Connell's. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D [[Medical ultrasonography|sonography]] of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina, arguing that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible.&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acton"&gt;See here [https://books.google.com/books?id=amNcvrLCGZEC&amp;pg=PT98] for the 2009 King's College London's findings on the G-spot and [https://books.google.com/books?id=kP9bCflZpVkC&amp;pg=PA145 page 145] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151028201436/https://books.google.com/books?id=kP9bCflZpVkC&amp;pg=PA145 |date=October 28, 2015 }} for ultrasound/physiological material with regard to the G-spot. {{cite book|author=Ashton Acton|title=Issues in Sexuality and Sexual Behavior Research: 2011 Edition|publisher=[[ScholarlyEditions]]|year=2012|accessdate=January 24, 2014|page=|isbn=978-1464966873|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slyflT85lXIC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll |first=Janell L.|title=Discovery Series: Human Sexuality|edition=1st|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|isbn=978-1111841898|year=2013&lt;!-- NOTE: Copyright date is 2013 inside of the book. --&gt;|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC&amp;pg=PT135|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buisson and Foldès 2009"&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Buisson|first=Odile|last2=Foldès  |first2=Pierre|title=The clitoral complex: a dynamic sonographic study|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|volume= 6|issue= 5|pages= 1223–31|year=2009 |pmid=19453931|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01231.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their 2009 published study, the "coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall".

Supporting a distinct G-spot is a study by [[Rutgers University]], published 2011, which was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain;&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt; brain scans showed that the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall&amp;nbsp;– where the G-spot is reported to be&amp;nbsp;– when several women stimulated themselves in a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional magnetic resonance]] (fMRI) machine.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt; "I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing," stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. "It's not like saying, 'What is the thyroid gland?' The G-spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing. It's a region, it's a convergence of many different structures."&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt; Commenting on Komisaruk's research and other findings, Emmanuele Jannini, a professor of endocrinology at the University of Aquila in Italy, acknowledged a series of essays published in March 2012 in ''The Journal of Sexual Medicine'', which document evidence that vaginal and clitoral orgasms are separate phenomena that activate different areas of the brain and possibly suggest key psychological differences between women.&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;

====Other factors and research====
Regular difficulty reaching orgasm after ample sexual stimulation, known as [[anorgasmia]], is significantly more common in women than in men ([[#Dysfunction and satisfaction|see below]]).&lt;ref name="Anorgasmia"/&gt; In addition to sexual dysfunction being a cause for women's inability to reach orgasm, or the amount of time for sexual arousal needed to reach orgasm being variable and longer in women than in men, other factors include a lack of communication between sexual partners about what is needed for the woman to reach orgasm, feelings of sexual inadequacy in either partner, a focus on only penetration (vaginal or otherwise), and men generalizing women's trigger for orgasm based on their own sexual experiences with other women.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flaherty"/&gt;

Scholars state "many couples are locked into the idea that orgasms should be achieved only through intercourse [vaginal sex]" and that "[e]ven the word ''[[foreplay]]'' suggests that any other form of sexual stimulation is merely preparation for the 'main event.'... ...Because women reach orgasm through intercourse less consistently than men, they are more likely than men to have [[Fake orgasm|faked an orgasm]]".&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Sex counselor [[Ian Kerner]] stated, "It's a myth that using the penis is the main way to pleasure a woman." He cites research concluding that women reach orgasm about 25% of the time with intercourse, compared with 81% of the time during oral sex ([[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name="Rob Baedeker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rob|first=Baedeker|title=Sex: Fact and Fiction|publisher=[[WebMD]]|pages=2–3|accessdate=28 November 2012|url=http://men.webmd.com/features/sex-fact-fiction?page=2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112134913/http://men.webmd.com/features/sex-fact-fiction?page=2|archivedate=January 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first large-scale empirical study worldwide to link specific practices with orgasm, reported in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'' in 2006, demographic and sexual history variables were comparatively weakly associated with orgasm. Data was analyzed from the Australian Study of Health and Relationships, a national telephone survey of sexual behavior and attitudes and sexual health knowledge carried out in 2001–2002, with a representative sample of 19,307 Australians aged 16 to 59. Practices included "vaginal intercourse alone (12%), vaginal + manual stimulation of the man's and/or woman's genitals (49%), and vaginal intercourse + manual + oral (32%)" and the "[e]ncounters may also have included other practices. Men had an orgasm in 95% of encounters and women in 69%. Generally, the more practices engaged in, the higher a woman's chance of having an orgasm. Women were more likely to reach orgasm in encounters including cunnilingus".&lt;ref name="Richters J"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual practices at last heterosexual encounter and occurrence of orgasm in a national survey|journal=[[The Journal of Sex Research]]|date=August 2006 |pmid=17599244 |doi=10.1080/00224490609552320 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=217–26 |vauthors=Richters J, Visser R, Rissel C, Smith A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies suggest that women exposed to lower levels of prenatal [[androgen]]s are more likely to experience orgasm during vaginal intercourse than other women.&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;

==== Exercise-induced ====
Kinsey, in his 1953 book ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', stated that exercise could bring about sexual pleasure, including orgasm.&lt;ref name=1990Rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butt|first1=DS|title=The sexual response as exercise.

===Anal and prostate stimulation===
{{see also|Pegging (sexual practice)|prostate massage|l1=Pegging}}

In both sexes, pleasure can be derived from the nerve endings around the anus and the anus itself, such as during [[anal sex]].

For women, penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris by the shared sensory nerves, especially the [[pudendal nerve]], which gives off the [[inferior anal nerves]] and divides into the [[perineal nerve]] and the [[dorsal nerve of clitoris|dorsal nerve of the clitoris]].&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt; The G-spot area, considered to be interconnected with the clitoris,&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt; may also be accessible through anal penetration; besides the shared anatomy of the aforementioned sensory nerves, orgasm by indirect stimulation of the clitoris or G-spot area through anal penetration may be aided by the close proximity between the vaginal cavity and the rectal cavity.&lt;ref name="Zdrok"&gt;{{cite book |first=Victoria|last=Zdrok| title = The Anatomy of Pleasure | publisher =Infinity Publishing|year = 2004|pages=100–102|accessdate = July 5, 2013| isbn = 978-0741422484 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Cx62zwSwbcsC&amp;pg=PA100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=bG8XqRO6rRQC&amp;pg=PA3 page 3] for women preferring anal sex to vaginal sex, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=bG8XqRO6rRQC&amp;pg=PA15 page 15] for reaching orgasm through indirect stimulation of the G-spot. {{cite book|author=Tristan Taormino|author-link=Tristan Taormino|title=The Ultimate Guide to Anal Sex for Women|isbn = 978-1-57344-221-3|publisher=Cleis Press|year=1997|pages=282 pages|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLv1ohTIiicC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Achieving orgasm solely by anal stimulation, however, is rare among women.&lt;ref name="Tarrant"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shira Tarrant|title=Politics: In the Streets and Between the Sheets in the 21st Century|isbn =978-1317814757|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2015|pages=247–248|accessdate=March 11, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6nwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valdez"&gt;{{cite book|author =Natasha Janina Valdez|title=Vitamin O: Why Orgasms Are Vital to a Woman's Health and Happiness, and How to Have Them Every Time!|isbn = 978-1-61608-311-3|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] Inc.|year=2011|page=79|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PsNKTB87isC&amp;pg=PT79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct stimulation of the clitoris, a G-spot area, or both, during anal sex can help some women enjoy the activity and reach orgasm from it.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"/&gt;

===Nipple stimulation===
For women, stimulation of the [[breast]] area during sexual intercourse or [[foreplay]], or solely having the breasts fondled, can create mild to intense orgasms, sometimes referred to as a ''breast orgasm'' or ''nipple orgasm''.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt; Few women report experiencing orgasm from nipple stimulation.&lt;ref name="Boston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Alfred C.

An orgasm is believed to occur in part because of the hormone [[oxytocin]], which is produced in the body during sexual excitement and arousal and labor. It has also been shown that oxytocin is produced when a man or woman's nipples are stimulated and become erect.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Levin R, Meston C |title=Nipple/Breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=450–4 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16681470 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.421.7798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Komisaruk also relayed, however, that preliminary data suggests that nipple nerves may directly link up with the relevant parts of the brain without uterine mediation, acknowledging the men in his study who showed the same pattern of nipple stimulation activating genital brain regions.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk 2"/&gt;

==Medical aspects==

===Physiological responses===
Masters and Johnson were some of the first researchers to study the sexual response cycle in the early 1960s, based on the observation of 382 women and 312 men. They described a cycle that begins with excitement as blood rushes into the genitals, then reaches a plateau during which they are fully aroused, which leads to orgasm, and finally resolution, in which the blood leaves the genitals.&lt;ref name="M&amp;J"/&gt;

In the 1970s, [[Helen Singer Kaplan]] added the category of desire to the cycle, which she argued precedes sexual excitation. She stated that emotions of anxiety, defensiveness and the failure of communication can interfere with desire and orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kaplan HS |title=Hypoactive sexual desire |journal=[[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–9 |year=1977 |pmid=864734|doi=10.1080/00926237708405343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1980s and after, Rosemary Basson proposed a more cyclical alternative to what had largely been viewed as linear progression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Martin | last=Portner | title=The Orgasmic Mind: The Neurological Roots of Sexual Pleasure | date=15 May 2008 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | work=Scientific American | accessdate=16 July 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102222534/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | archivedate=November 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In her model, desire feeds arousal and orgasm, and is in turn fueled by the rest of the orgasmic cycle. Rather than orgasm being the peak of the sexual experience, she suggested that it is just one point in the circle and that people could feel sexually satisfied at any stage, reducing the focus on climax as an end-goal of all sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Basson R |title=The female sexual response: a different model |journal=[[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]] |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=51–65 |year=2000 |pmid=10693116 |doi=10.1080/009262300278641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Males====
As a man nears orgasm during stimulation of the penis, he feels an intense and highly pleasurable pulsating sensation of [[Neuromuscular junction|neuromuscular]] [[euphoria]]. These pulses are a series of throbbing sensations of the [[bulbospongiosus muscle]]s that begin in the anal sphincter and travel to the [[glans penis|tip of the penis]]. They eventually increase in speed and intensity as the orgasm approaches, until a final "plateau" (the orgasmic) pleasure sustained for several seconds.&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; The length of a man's orgasm has been estimated at 10–15 seconds on average, though it is possible for them to last up to 30 seconds.

During orgasm, a human male experiences rapid, rhythmic contractions of the [[anus|anal sphincter]], the prostate, and the muscles of the penis. The [[sperm]] are transmitted up the [[vas deferens]] from the [[testicles]], into the prostate gland as well as through the [[seminal vesicle]]s to produce what is known as [[semen]].&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; The prostate produces a secretion that forms one of the components of ejaculate. Except for in cases of a dry orgasm, contraction of the sphincter and prostate force stored semen to be expelled through [[External urethral orifice (male)|the penis's urethral opening]]. The process takes from three to ten seconds, and produces a pleasurable feeling.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunn"/&gt; Ejaculation may continue for a few seconds after the euphoric sensation gradually tapers off. It is believed that the exact feeling of "orgasm" varies from one man to another.&lt;ref name="Mah"/&gt; Normally, as a man ages, the amount of semen he ejaculates diminishes, and so does the duration of orgasms. This does not normally affect the intensity of pleasure, but merely shortens the duration. After ejaculation, a refractory period usually occurs, during which a man cannot achieve another orgasm. This can last anywhere from less than a minute to several hours or days, depending on age and other individual factors.&lt;ref name=soc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Craighead"/&gt;

Women's orgasms are preceded by erection of the clitoris and moistening of the opening of the vagina. Some women exhibit a [[Flushing (physiology)|sex flush]], a reddening of the skin over much of the body due to increased blood flow to the skin. As a woman nears orgasm, the clitoral glans retracts under the [[clitoral hood]], and the [[labia minora]] (inner lips) become darker. As orgasm becomes imminent, the outer third of the vagina tightens and narrows, while overall the vagina lengthens and dilates and also becomes congested from engorged soft tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Anatomic and physiologic changes during female sexual response | website = Clinical Proceedings | publisher = Association of Reproductive Health Professionals | url = http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/cme/onlinecme/NYNCP/changes.cfm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708005232/http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/cme/onlinecme/NYNCP/changes.cfm | archivedate = 2008-07-08 | accessdate =1 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in the body, [[myofibroblast]]s of the nipple-[[Areolar connective tissue|areolar]] complex contract, causing erection of the nipples and contraction of the areolar diameter, reaching their maximum at the start of orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Sexual and Relationship Therapy]] | volume=21 | issue=1 | pages=237–249 | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/csmt/2006/00000021/00000002/art00011 | title=The Breast/Nipple/Areola Complex and Human Sexuality | accessdate=2 April 2011 | date=2 May 2006 | last=Levin | first=Roy | quote=Areola corrugation immediately after orgasm physically signals that orgasm has occurred | doi=10.1080/14681990600674674 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101093637/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/csmt/2006/00000021/00000002/art00011 | archivedate=January 1, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman experiences full orgasm when her uterus, vagina, anus, and [[human pelvis|pelvic]] muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. Most women find these contractions very pleasurable.

Researchers from the [[University of Groningen|University Medical Center of Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]] correlated the sensation of orgasm with muscular contractions occurring at a frequency of 8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz centered in the pelvis and measured in the anus. They argue that the presence of this particular frequency of contractions can distinguish between voluntary contraction of these muscles and spontaneous involuntary contractions, and appears to more accurately correlate with orgasm as opposed to other metrics like heart rate that only measure excitation. They assert that they have identified "[t]he first objective and quantitative measure that has a strong correspondence with the subjective experience that orgasm ultimately is" and state that the measure of contractions that occur at a frequency of 8–13&amp;nbsp;Hz is specific to orgasm. They found that using this metric they could distinguish from rest, voluntary muscular contractions, and even unsuccessful orgasm attempts.&lt;ref name = "Kortekaas 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=van Netten JJ, Georgiadis JR, Nieuwenburg A, Kortekaas R |title=8–13 Hz fluctuations in rectal pressure are an objective marker of clitorally-induced orgasm in women |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=279–85 |date=April 2008 |pmid=17186125 |doi=10.1007/s10508-006-9112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ancient times in Western Europe, women could be [[Medical diagnosis|medically diagnosed]] with a disorder called [[female hysteria]], the symptoms of which included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and "a tendency to cause trouble".&lt;ref name=Maines&gt;{{cite book |author=Maines, Rachel P. |title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8018-6646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women considered suffering from the condition would sometimes undergo "pelvic massage" — [[Fingering (sexual act)|stimulation of the genitals]] by the doctor until the woman experienced "hysterical paroxysm" (i.e., orgasm). Paroxysm was regarded as a medical treatment, and not a sexual release.&lt;ref name=Maines/&gt; The disorder has ceased to be recognized as a medical condition since the 1920s.

===Brain===
There have been very few studies correlating orgasm and brain activity in real time. One study examined 12 healthy women using a [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scanner while they were being stimulated by their partners. Brain changes were observed and compared between states of rest, sexual stimulation, faked orgasm, and actual orgasm. Differences were reported in the brains of men and women during stimulation. However, changes in brain activity were observed in both sexes in which the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear and anxiety shut down. Regarding these changes, [[Gert Holstege]] said in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'', "What this means is that deactivation, letting go of all fear and anxiety, might be the most important thing, even necessary, to have an orgasm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Mark | last=Henderson | title=Women fall into 'trance' during orgasm | date=20 June 2005 |  url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article1964119.ece |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate =8 December 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While stroking the clitoris, the parts of the female brain responsible for processing fear, anxiety and behavioral control start to diminish in activity. This reaches a peak at orgasm when the female brain's emotion centers are effectively closed down to produce an almost trance-like state. Holstege is quoted as saying, at the 2005 meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Development: "At the moment of orgasm, women do not have any emotional feelings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | first=Martin | last=Portner | title=The Orgasmic Mind: The Neurological Roots of Sexual Pleasure | date=15 May 2008 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | work=Scientific American | accessdate=7 July 2009 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102222534/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-orgasmic-mind | archivedate=November 2, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial reports indicated that it was difficult to observe the effects of orgasm on men using PET scans, because the duration of the male orgasm was shorter. However, a subsequent report by Rudie Kortekaas, et al. stated, "Gender commonalities were most evident during orgasm... From these results, we conclude that during the sexual act, differential brain responses across genders are principally related to the stimulatory (plateau) phase and not to the orgasmic phase itself."&lt;ref name="Georgiadis"/&gt;

Research has shown that as in women, the emotional centers of a man's brain also become deactivated during orgasm but to a lesser extent than in women. Brain scans of both sexes have shown that the [[pleasure center]]s of a man's brain show more intense activity than in women during orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific American Book of Love, Sex, and the Brain: The Neuroscience of How, When, Why, and Who we love'', Judith Horstman (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Human [[Electroencephalography|brain wave]] patterns show distinct changes during orgasm, which indicate the importance of the limbic system in the orgasmic response.&lt;ref name=health.discovery.com/&gt; Male and female brains demonstrate similar changes during orgasm, with brain activity scans showing a temporary decrease in the [[metabolism|metabolic]] activity of large parts of the [[cerebral cortex]] with normal or increased metabolic activity in the limbic areas of the brain.&lt;ref name="Georgiadis"/&gt;

[[EEG]] tracings from volunteers during orgasm were first obtained by Mosovich and Tallaferro in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1954 |title= Studies on EEG and sex function orgasm |journal=[[The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|Diseases of the nervous system]]|volume=15|issue=7|pages=218–20|last1= Mosovich |first1=A.|last2= Tallaferro |first2=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; These research workers recorded EEG changes resembling [[petit mal]] or the clonic phase of a [[grand mal]] seizure.

===Health===

====General====
Orgasm, and sexual activity as a whole, are physical activities that can require exertion of many major bodily systems. A 1997 study in the ''[[BMJ]]'' based upon 918 men age 45–59 found that after a ten-year follow-up, men who had fewer orgasms were twice as likely to die of any cause as those having two or more orgasms a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/315/7123/1641|title=Sex and Death: Are They Related?

(Note that as a rule, [[correlation does not imply causation]].)

There is some research suggesting that greater resting heart rate variability is associated with orgasms through penile-vaginal intercourse without additional simultaneous clitoral stimulation.&lt;ref name="Pappas"/&gt;

Kinsey's ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' showed that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of [[Women who have sex with women|sexual encounters with other women]], compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], &amp; [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; Like Kinsey, scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) found that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do,&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; and that female partners are more likely to emphasize the emotional aspects of lovemaking.&lt;ref name="Weiten"/&gt; In contrast, research by Diane Holmberg and Karen L.

Specifically in relation to simultaneous orgasm and similar practices, many sexologists claim that the problem of [[premature ejaculation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sexarchive.info/IES/italy.html |title=The International Encyclopedia of Sexuality: Italy |publisher=.hu-berlin.de |date=1 January 1999 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305193730/http://www.sexarchive.info/IES/italy.html |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the idea encouraged by a scientific approach in the early 20th century when mutual orgasm was overly emphasized as an objective and a sign of true sexual satisfaction in intimate relationships.

If orgasm is desired, anorgasmia may be attributed to an inability to relax. It may be associated with performance pressure and an unwillingness to pursue pleasure, as separate from the other person's satisfaction; often, women worry so much about the pleasure of their partner that they become anxious, which manifests as impatience with the delay of orgasm for them. This delay can lead to frustration of not reaching orgasmic sexual satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Carroll 2"/&gt; Psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]], in his 1927 book ''[[Die Funktion des Orgasmus]]'' (published in English in 1980 as ''Genitality in the Theory and Therapy of Neurosis'') was the first to make orgasm central to the concept of mental health, and defined [[neurosis]] in terms of blocks to having [[orgastic potency]]. Although orgasm dysfunction can have psychological components, physiological factors often play a role. For instance, delayed orgasm or the inability to achieve orgasm is a common side effect of many medications.

[[Menopause]] may involve loss of hormones supporting sexuality and genital functionality. Vaginal and clitoral atrophy and dryness affects up to 50%–60% of postmenopausal women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid = 10022110 | volume=281 | issue=6 | title=Sexual dysfunction in the United States: prevalence and predictors | date=February 1999 | journal=JAMA | pages=537–44 |vauthors=Laumann EO, Paik A, Rosen RC |doi = 10.1001/jama.281.6.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testosterone levels in men fall as they age.

==Theoretical biological and evolutionary functions of female orgasm{{anchor|Theoretical_biological_and_evolutionary_functions}}==

===Shifts in research===
The function or functions of the human female orgasm have been debated among researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wheatley|first1=John R|last2=Puts|first2=David A|editor1-last=Shackelford|editor1-first=Todd K|editor2-last=Hansen|editor2-first=Ranald D|title=The Evolution of Sexuality|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|chapter=Evolutionary Science of Female Orgasm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because male orgasms that expel [[sperm]] from the body into the vagina during sexual intercourse may result in conception, researchers have several hypotheses about the role, if any, of the female orgasm in the reproductive and therefore evolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; The literature started with the argument that female orgasm is a byproduct of shared early male ontogeny, where male orgasm is an [[adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shifted to investigate and also support the sire-choice hypothesis, which proposes that female orgasm has been shaped by [[natural selection]] to function in the selection of high quality sires (male parents) for offspring. Therefore, orgasm increases the chances of conceiving with males of a high genetic quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Puts | first1 = D.

===Selective pressure and mating===
Wallen K and Lloyd EA stated, "In men, orgasms are under strong selective pressure as orgasms are coupled with ejaculation and thus contribute to male reproductive success. By contrast, women's orgasms in intercourse are highly variable and are under little selective pressure as they are not a reproductive necessity."&lt;ref name="Wallen K, Lloyd EA"/&gt;

[[Desmond Morris]] suggested in his 1967 popular-science book ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' that the female orgasm evolved to encourage physical intimacy with a male partner and help reinforce the [[pair bond]]. Morris suggested that the relative difficulty in achieving female orgasm, in comparison to the male's, might be favorable in [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolution by leading the female to select [[Mating|mates]] who bear qualities like patience, care, imagination, intelligence, as opposed to qualities like size and aggression, which pertain to mate selection in other primates. Such advantageous qualities thereby become accentuated within the species, driven by the differences between male and female orgasm. If males were motivated by, and taken to the point of, orgasm in the same way as females, those advantageous qualities would not be needed, since self-interest would be enough.

===Fertility===

There are theories that the female orgasm might increase fertility.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; For example, the 30% reduction in size of the vagina could help clench onto the penis (much like, or perhaps caused by, the [[pubococcygeus muscle]]s), which would make it more stimulating for the male (thus ensuring faster or more voluminous ejaculation). The British biologists Baker and Bellis have suggested that the female orgasm may have a [[peristalsis]] or "upsuck" action (similar to the [[esophagus]]' ability to swallow when upside down), resulting in the retaining of favorable sperm and making conception more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1272 |last=Baker |first=R. R. |last2=Bellis |first2=M. A. |year=1993 |title=Human sperm competition: Ejaculate manipulation by females and a function for the female orgasm |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=887–909 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They posited a role of female orgasm in [[sperm competition]].

The observation that women tend to reach orgasm more easily when they are ovulating also suggests that it is tied to increasing fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Adam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jun/08/genetics.research |department=Science |date=8 June 2005 |title=Female orgasm all in the genes |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302095146/https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/jun/08/genetics.research |archivedate=March 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary biologist Robin Baker argues in ''[[Sperm Wars]]'' that occurrence and timing of orgasms are all a part of the female body's unconscious strategy to collect and retain sperm from more evolutionarily fit men.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} An orgasm during intercourse functions as a bypass button to a woman's natural cervical filter against sperm and pathogens. An orgasm before functions to strengthen the filter.

Desmond Morris proposed that orgasm might facilitate conception by exhausting the female and keeping her horizontal, thus preventing the sperm from leaking out. This possibility, sometimes called the "Poleaxe Hypothesis" or the "Knockout Hypothesis",  is now considered highly doubtful. A 1994 [[TLC (TV channel)|Learning Channel]] documentary on sex had fiber optic cameras inside the vagina of a woman while she had sexual intercourse. During her orgasm, her [[Pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] contracted and her [[Vaginal portion of cervix|cervix]] repeatedly dipped into a pool of semen in the [[vaginal fornix]], as if to ensure that sperm would proceed by the [[external orifice of the uterus]], making conception more likely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=[[Desmond Morris]] (host) |date=1994 | title=[[The Human Animal (TV series)|The Human Animal]] | medium=TV | publisher=The Learning Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá, in their discussion of the female orgasm, address how long it takes for females to achieve orgasm compared to males, and females' ability to have multiple orgasms, hypothesizing how especially well suited to multiple partners and [[insemination]] this is. They quote [[primate sexuality]] specialist Alan Dixson in saying that the monogamy-maintenance explanation for female orgasm "seems far-fetched" because "females of other primate species, and particularly those with multimale-multifemale [promiscuous] mating systems such as macaques and chimpanzees, exhibit orgasmic responses in the absence of such bonding or the formation of stable family units." On the other hand, Dixson states that "Gibbons, which are primarily monogamous, do not exhibit obvious signs of female orgasm."&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sex at Dawn |isbn=978-0062207944 |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2012 |page=263 |last=Ryan |first=Christopher |first2=Cacilda |last2=Jethá}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[female promiscuity]] explanation of female sexuality was echoed at least 12 years earlier by other evolutionary biologists, and there is increasing scientific awareness of the female [[proceptive phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Browne |first=Anthony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver |title=Women are promiscuous, naturally |department=UK News |date=2 September 2000 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304225027/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Dixson classifies humans as mildly polygynous in his survey of primate sexuality, he appears to have doubts, when he writes, "One might argue that ... the female's orgasm is rewarding, increases her willingness to copulate with a variety of males rather than one partner, and thus promotes sperm competition." Ryan and Jethá use this as evidence for their theory that [[partible paternity]] and promiscuity were common for early modern humans.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;

===Adaptive or vestigial===

The clitoris is [[homology (biology)|homologous]] to the penis; that is, they both develop from the same embryonic structure.&lt;ref name="Schünke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; While researchers such as [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]], [[Helen Fisher (anthropologist)|Helen Fisher]], [[Meredith Small]] and [[Sarah Blaffer Hrdy]] "have viewed the clitoral orgasm as a legitimate adaptation in its own right, with major implications for female sexual behavior and sexual evolution,"&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt; others, such as [[Donald Symons]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], have asserted that the clitoris is [[vestigiality|vestigial]] or nonadaptive, and that the female orgasm serves no particular evolutionary function.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt; However, Gould acknowledged that "most female orgasms emanate from a clitoral, rather than vaginal (or some other), site" and stated that his nonadaptive belief "has been widely misunderstood as a denial of either the adaptive value of female orgasm in general, or even as a claim that female orgasms lack significance in some broader sense". He explained that although he accepts that "clitoral orgasm plays a pleasurable and central role in female sexuality and its joys," "[a]ll these favorable attributes, however, emerge just as clearly and just as easily, whether the clitoral site of orgasm arose as a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] or an adaptation". He said that the "male biologists who fretted over [the adaptionist questions] simply assumed that a deeply vaginal site, nearer the region of fertilization, would offer greater selective benefit" due to their Darwinian, ''[[summum bonum]]'' beliefs about enhanced reproductive success.&lt;ref name="Gould"/&gt;

Proponents of the nonadaptive hypothesis, such as Elisabeth Lloyd, refer to the relative difficulty of achieving female orgasm through vaginal sex, the limited evidence for increased fertility after orgasm and the lack of statistical correlation between the capacity of a woman to orgasm and the likelihood that she will engage in intercourse.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chivers"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Meredith L. | last = Chivers | first2 = Michael W. | last2 = Wiedermana | title = A Narrow (But Thorough) Examination of the Evolutionary Significance of Female Orgasm | journal = [[Journal of Sex Research]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–105 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1080/00224490709336797 | deadurl = no | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Lloyd is by no means against evolutionary psychology. Quite the opposite; in her methods and in her writing, she advocates and demonstrates a commitment to the careful application of evolutionary theory to the study of human behavior," stated [[Meredith Chivers|Meredith L. Chivers]]. She added that Lloyd "meticulously considers the theoretical and empirical bases for each account and ultimately concludes that there is little evidence to support an adaptionist account of female orgasm" and that Lloyd instead "views female orgasm as an ontogenetic leftover; women have orgasms because the urogenital neurophysiology for orgasm is so strongly selected for in males that this developmental blueprint gets expressed in females without affecting fitness, just as males have nipples that serve no fitness-related function".&lt;ref name="Chivers"/&gt;

A 2005 [[twin study]] found that one in three women reported never or seldom achieving orgasm during sexual intercourse, and only one in ten always orgasmed. This variation in ability to orgasm, generally thought to be psychosocial, was found to be 34% to 45% genetic. The study, examining 4000 women, was published in ''[[Biology Letters]]'', a [[Royal Society]] journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4616899.stm |title=Female orgasm is 'down to genes{{'-}} |work=[[BBC]] |date=7 June 2005 |accessdate=28 May 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021184246/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4616899.stm |archivedate=October 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Kate M |last2=Cherkas |first2=Lynn F |last3=Spector |first3=Tim D |title=Genetic influences on variation in female orgasmic function: a twin study |journal=Biology Letters |type=Abstract |date=22 September 2005 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=260–263 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2005.0308|pmc=1617159 |pmid=17148182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth Lloyd has cited this as evidence for the notion that female orgasm is not adaptive.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lloyd2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mypage.iu.edu/%7Eealloyd/Reviews.html#IsntItObviousThat |title=Reviews |publisher=Mypage.iu.edu |accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller, Hrdy, Helen O'Connell and [[Natalie Angier]] have criticized the "female orgasm is vestigial" hypothesis as understating and devaluing the psychosocial value of the female orgasm.&lt;ref name="Geoffrey Miller"/&gt; Hrdy stated that the hypothesis smacks of [[sexism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Christopher Shea| title=Orgasmic science|work=The Boston Globe| date=24 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Connell said, "It boils down to rivalry between the sexes: the idea that one sex is sexual and the other reproductive. The truth is that both are sexual and both are reproductive."&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; O'Connell used [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] technology to define the true size and shape of the clitoris, suggesting that it extends into the anterior wall of the vagina ([[#In females|see above]]).

O'Connell describes typical textbook descriptions of the clitoris as lacking detail and including inaccuracies, saying that the work of [[Georg Ludwig Kobelt]] in the early 19th century provides a most comprehensive and accurate description of clitoral anatomy. She argues that the bulbs appear to be part of the clitoris and that the distal urethra and vagina are intimately related structures, although they are not erectile in character, forming a tissue cluster with the clitoris that appears to be the center of female sexual function and orgasm.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt; By contrast, Nancy Tuana, at the 2002 conference for ''Canadian Society of Women in Philosophy'', argues that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction, but that this is why it has been "historically ignored", mainly because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.&lt;ref name="Cairney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cairney|first=Richard|title=Exploring female sexuality|publisher=ExpressNews|date=21 October 2002|accessdate=21 December 2011|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=3201|archivedate=21 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221175533/http://www.archives.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article/2002/10/3201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other theories===
Brody Costa et al. suggest that women's vaginal orgasm consistency is associated with being told in childhood or adolescence that the vagina is the important zone for inducing female orgasm. Other proposed factors include how well women focus mentally on vaginal sensations during penile-vaginal intercourse, the greater duration of intercourse, and preference for above-average penis length.&lt;ref name="Brody, Weiss"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is associated with vaginal (not clitoral) sex education, focusing mental attention on vaginal sensations, intercourse duration, and a preference for a longer penis|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|pages=2774–81 |date=August 2010 |pmid=19732304 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01469.x |volume=7 |issue=8 |vauthors=Brody S, Weiss P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Costa theorizes that vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent [[tubercle of the upper lip]].&lt;ref name="Brody, Costa"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is more prevalent among women with a prominent tubercle of the upper lip|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|date=June 2011 |pmid=21676178 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02331.x |volume=8 |issue=10 |pages=2793–9 |vauthors=Brody S, Costa RM }}&lt;/ref&gt; His research indicates that "[a] prominent and sharply raised lip tubercle has been associated with greater odds (odds ratio = 12.3) of ever having a vaginal orgasm, and also with greater past month vaginal orgasm consistency (an effect driven by the women who never had a vaginal orgasm), than less prominent lip tubercle categories." However, lip tubercle was not associated with social desirability responding, or with orgasm triggered by masturbation during penile-vaginal sex, solitary or partner clitoral or vaginal masturbation, vibrator, or cunnilingus.&lt;ref name="Brody, Costa"/&gt;

An empirical study carried out in 2008 provides evidence for Freud's implied link between inability to have a vaginal orgasm and psychosexual [[Defence mechanisms|immaturity]]. In the study, women reported their past month frequency of different sexual behaviors and corresponding orgasm rates and completed the Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), which is associated with various [[Psychopathology|psychopathologies]]. The study concluded that a "vaginal orgasm was associated with less somatization, dissociation, displacement, autistic fantasy, devaluation, and isolation of affect." Moreover, "vaginally anorgasmic women had immature defenses scores comparable to those of established (depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) outpatient psychiatric groups." In the study, a vaginal orgasm (as opposed to a clitoral orgasm) was defined as being triggered solely by penile–vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vaginal orgasm is associated with less use of immature psychological defense mechanisms|journal=[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]|pages=1167–1176 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2008.00786.x |pmid=18331263|author1=Brody S |author2=Costa R.M. |volume=5|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Wilhelm Reich]], the lack of women's capacity to have a vaginal orgasm is due to a lack of [[orgastic potency]], which he believed to be the result of culture's suppression of genital sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Reich, Wilhelm (1984) Children of the Future: On the Prevention of Sexual Pathology. New York: Farrar Straus and Giroux, footnote on p. 142: "1949: The statement that the girl's clitoral masturbation is normal is also due to the then prevalent psychoanalytic concept that the little girl had no vaginal genatility. The lack of vaginal genatility was later shown by sex-economy to be an artifact of our culture, which suppresses genitality completely and instills castration anxiety not only in the boy but also in the girl. This creates a true secondary drive in the form of penis envy and predominance of clitoral genitality. Psychoanalytic theory mistook these artificial secondary drives for primary, natural functions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involuntary orgasm ==
Medical research shows that the genital reflex is part of the spinal cord, and not necessarily under conscious control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cKjnCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT44&amp;ots=hIEz0UlK0O&amp;dq=genital%20reflex&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q=genital%20reflex&amp;f=false "Nervous System: A Tutorial Study Guide" Author Nicoladie Tam 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=I2n5hTAxdTYC&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;ots=izwjpSjtWd&amp;dq=genital%20reflex&amp;pg=PA431#v=onepage&amp;q=genital%20reflex&amp;f=false "Spinal Cord Medicine, Second Edition: Principles &amp; Practice."

Orgasms may thus occur as the result of [[sexual assault]] or [[rape]]. An involuntary orgasm from forced sexual contact often results in feelings of [[shame]] caused by internalization of [[Victim blaming|victim-blaming]] attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anugraha.info/Traningdownload.php?file=20111213044253Trauma.pdf&amp;arg3=resource&amp;op=center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227055826/http://www.anugraha.info/Traningdownload.php?file=20111213044253Trauma.pdf&amp;arg3=resource&amp;op=center |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 December 2013 |accessdate=26 December 2013|title=Trauma Counseling }} D.

Unwanted orgasms may arise as a result of [[persistent genital arousal disorder]].

Lack of control over orgasms may be used as part of consensual [[BDSM]] play; this practice is known as [[forced orgasm]].

==Tantric sex==
[[Tantric sex]], which is not the same as [[Vajrayana|Buddhist tantra (Vajrayana)]], is the ancient Indian spiritual tradition of sexual practices. It attributes a different value to orgasm than traditional cultural approaches to sexuality. Some practitioners of [[Tantra|tantric]] sex aim to eliminate orgasm from sexual intercourse by remaining for a long time in the pre-orgasmic and non-emission state. Advocates of this, such as [[Rajneesh]], claim that it eventually causes orgasmic feelings to spread out to all of one's conscious experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = Rajneesh, Bhagwan Shree | title = Tantra, Spirituality, and Sex | year= 1983 | isbn = 978-0-88050-696-0 | publisher = Rajneesh Foundation Internat. | location = Rajneeshpuram, Or.}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Chia, Mantak  |author2=Abrams, Douglas  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Multi-Orgasmic Man | publisher = Harper San Francisco | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-0-06-251336-6}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of tantric and neotantric sex who claim that Western culture focuses too much on the goal of climactic orgasm, which reduces the ability to have intense pleasure during other moments of the sexual experience, suggest that eliminating this enables a richer, fuller and more intense connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Douglas, N  |author2=Slinger, P  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Sexual Secrets: The Alchemy of Ecstasy | publisher = Destiny Books | year= 1979 | isbn = 978-0-89281-266-0}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
[[File:Carracci - Jupiter et Junon.jpeg|thumb|''[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]'', by [[Annibale Carracci]].]]
Orgasm has been widely described in literature over the centuries. In antiquity, [[Latin literature]] addressed the subject as much as [[Greek literature]]: Book III of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' retells a discussion between [[Jove]] and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], in which the former states: "The sense of pleasure in the male is far / More dull and dead, than what you females share."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses|Met]].'' III, 320-21 (translated by Sir Samuel Garth, [[John Dryden]], et al, 1717). In the original in [[Latin]], Ovid writes: ''maior vestra profecto est, / quam quae contingit maribus.''&lt;/ref&gt; Juno rejects this thought; they agree to ask the opinion of [[Tiresias]] ("who had known [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]/Love in both ways," having lived seven years as a female).&lt;ref&gt;''Met''. III, 323 (translated by [[A. S. Kline]], 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Tiresias offends Juno by agreeing with Jove, and she strikes him blind on the spot (Jove lessens the blow by giving Tiresias the gift of foresight, and a long life).&lt;ref&gt;''Met.'' III, 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, in the ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', Ovid states that he abhors sexual intercourse that fails to complete both partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} ''Jornal de Letras, Artes e Ideias'', Ano XXV/Number 930. 24 May to 6 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of orgasm survived during [[Romanticism]] and is incorporated in many [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] works. In ''FRAGMENT: Supposed to be an Epithalamium of Francis Ravaillac and Charlotte Cordé'', [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] (1792–1822), "a translator of extraordinary range and versatility",&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 1976, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the phrase "No life can equal such a death." That phrase has been seen as a [[metaphor]] for orgasm,&lt;ref name="Lauritsen"&gt;"[http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/HHREV3.HTM Hellenism and Homoeroticism in Shelley and his Circle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708193419/http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/HHREV3.HTM |date=July 8, 2008 }}", by John Lauritsen (2008). Consulted on 10 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was preceded by the rhythmic urgency of the previous lines "Suck on, suck on, I glow, I glow!", which has been seen as alluding to [[fellatio]].&lt;ref name="Lauritsen" /&gt; For Shelley, orgasm was "the almost involuntary consequences of a state of abandonment in the society of a person of surpassing attractions".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Ellerker Williams]], the last love of Shelley's life, was remembered by the poet in "The Boat on the Serchio", which has been considered as possibly "the grandest portrayal of orgasm in literature":&lt;ref name="Lauritsen" /&gt;

Shelley, in this poem, associates orgasm with death when he writes "the death which lovers love".&lt;ref name="Lauritsen" /&gt; In [[French literature]], the term ''[[la petite mort]]'' (the little death) is a famous [[euphemism]] for orgasm;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Georgiadis J, Kortekaas R, Kuipers R, Nieuwenburg A, Pruim J, Reinders A, Holstege G |title=Regional cerebral blood flow changes associated with clitorally induced orgasm in healthy women |journal=Eur J Neurosci |volume=24 |issue=11 |pages=3305–16 |year=2006 |pmid=17156391 |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the representation of man who forgets himself and the world during orgasm. [[Jorge Luis Borges]], in the same vision, wrote in one of the several [[footnote]]s of "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]" that one of the churches of [[Tlön]] claims [[Platonism|Platonic]]ally that "All men, in the vertiginous moment of coitus, are the same man. All men who repeat a line from [[Shakespeare]] ''are'' William Shakespeare."&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''Ficciones'', p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Shakespeare himself was knowledgeable of this idea: lines "I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried in thy eyes" and "I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom", said respectively by [[Benedick]] in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and by King Lear in [[King Lear|the play of that ilk]],&lt;ref&gt;''MUCH ADO'', v ii 99–101. &amp; ''Lear'', iv vi 201.&lt;/ref&gt; are interpreted as "to die in a woman's lap" = "to experience a sexual orgasm".&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, 2001, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] with his [[psychoanalytic]] projects, in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923), speculates that sexual satisfaction by orgasm make [[Eros]] ("life instinct") exhausted and leaves the field open to [[Thanatos]] ("death instinct"), in other words, with orgasm Eros fulfills its mission and gives way to Thanatos.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sigmund Freud|Freud, Sigmund]]. ''The Ego and the Id''. The Hogarth Press Ltd. London, 1949. Quoted by ''Vida Íntima: Enciclopédia do Amor e do Sexo'', Abril Cultural, Vol. 1, 1981, [[São Paulo]], Brazil, p. 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Other modern authors have chosen to represent the orgasm without metaphors. In the novel ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'' (1928), by [[D. H. Lawrence]], we can find an explicit narrative of a sexual act between a couple: "As he began to move, in the sudden helpless orgasm there awoke in her strange thrills rippling inside her..."&lt;ref&gt;[[D. H. Lawrence]], New York: Grove Press, 1969, cited by BANKER-RISHKIN; GRANDINETTI, 1997, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17656">'''Personal boundaries''' are guidelines, rules or limits that a person creates to identify reasonable, safe and permissible ways for other people to behave towards them and how they will respond when someone passes those limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guidetopsychology.com/boundaries.htm|title=Boundaries : Psychological Boundaries - Healthy Boundaries|author=|date=|website=www.guidetopsychology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are built out of a mix of conclusions, [[beliefs]], opinions, attitudes, past experiences and [[Observational learning|social learning]].&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|ISBN=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Rogers, ''Working with Young Men'' (2010) pp. 80, 161&lt;/ref&gt; This concept or [[life skill]] has been widely referenced in self-help books and used in the counseling profession since the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=R. Skip|title=Setting Boundaries and Setting Limits|publisher=[[BPDFamily.com]]|url=http://bpdfamily.com/content/setting-boundaries|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some counselors, personal boundaries help to define an individual by outlining likes and dislikes, and setting the distances one allows others to approach.&lt;ref&gt;G. B. and J. S. Lundberg, ''I Don't Have to Make Everything All Better'' (2000) p. 13.  {{ISBN|978-0-670-88485-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include physical, mental, psychological and spiritual boundaries, involving beliefs, emotions, intuitions and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Porter-O'Grady, Kathy Malloch, ''Quantum Leadership'' (2003) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] considered such boundaries to be layered in a hierarchy, reflecting "all the successive envelopes of the biological and social status of the person".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits'' (1997) pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Personal boundaries operate in two directions, affecting both the incoming and outgoing interactions between people.&lt;ref name=anne&gt;Katherine, Anne Where to Draw the Line: How to Set Healthy Boundaries Every Day (2000), pp. 16–25&lt;/ref&gt; These are sometimes referred to as the "protection" and "containment" functions.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;

==Scope==
The three most commonly mentioned categories of values and boundaries are:
* '''Physical''' – [[Personal space]] and [[Haptic communication|touch]] considerations&lt;ref name=Whitfield&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Charles Whitfield|Charles L. Whitfield, M.D]]|title=Boundaries and Relationships: Knowing, Protecting and Enjoying the Self|date=2010|publisher=HCI Books|isbn=978-1558742598|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kath&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katherine|first1=Anne|title=Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin|date=1994|publisher=Hazelden|isbn=978-1568380308|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cloud&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[John Townsend (author)|John Townsend, PhD]]|last2=[[Henry Cloud|Henry Cloud PhD]]|title=Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No to Take Control of Your Life|pages=245|date=1 November 1992|publisher=HarperCollins Christian Publishing|location=Nashville|isbn=9780310585909}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mental''' –  Thoughts and opinions&lt;ref name=Whitfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=kath/&gt;&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt;
* '''Emotional''' – Feelings

Some authors have expanded this list with additional or specialized categories such as "spirituality",&lt;ref name=Whitfield/&gt;&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt; "truth",&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt; and "time/punctuality".&lt;ref name=anne/&gt;

==Types==
Nina Brown proposed four boundary types:&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nina W., ''Coping With Infuriating, Mean, Critical People – The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern''  (2006). {{ISBN|978-0-275-98984-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Soft''' – A person with soft boundaries merges with other people's boundaries. Someone with a soft boundary is easily a victim of [[psychological manipulation]].
* '''Spongy''' – A person with spongy boundaries is like a combination of having soft and rigid boundaries. They permit less [[emotional contagion]] than soft boundaries but more than those with rigid. People with spongy boundaries are unsure of what to let in and what to keep out.
* '''Rigid''' – A person with rigid boundaries is closed or walled off so nobody can get close either physically or emotionally. This is often the case if someone has been the victim of [[physical abuse|physical]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], or [[sexual abuse]]. Rigid boundaries can be '''selective''' which depend on time, place or circumstances and are usually based on a bad previous experience in a similar situation.
* '''Flexible''' – Similar to spongy rigid boundaries but the person exercises more control. The person decides what to let in and what to keep out, is resistant to [[emotional contagion]] and [[psychological manipulation]], and is difficult to exploit.

==Application==
The personal boundaries concept is particularly pertinent in environments with controlling people or people not taking responsibility for their own life.&lt;ref name=cloud/&gt;

[[Co-Dependents Anonymous]] recommends setting limits on what members will do to and for people and on what members will allow people to do to and for them, as part of their efforts to establish autonomy from being controlled by other people’s thoughts, feelings and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Setting Boundaries: Meditations for Codependents (Moment to Reflect)|date=August 1995|publisher=Harpercollins|isbn=9780062554017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] tells its members that establishing and maintaining values and boundaries will improve the sense of security, stability, predictability and order, in a family even when some members of the family resist. NAMI contends that boundaries encourage a more relaxed, nonjudgmental atmosphere and that the presence of boundaries need not conflict with the need for maintaining an understanding atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bayes|first1=Kathy|title=Setting Boundaries In A Marriage Complicated By Mental Illness|url=http://www2.nami.org/Content/Microsites138/NAMI_Fort_Wayne_Indiana/Home128/Information_for_Spouses_and_Partners1/Boundaries.doc|website=National Alliance on Mental Illness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of reestablishing==
In ''[[Families and How to Survive Them]]'', [[Robin Skynner]] MD explains methods for how family therapists can effectively help family members to develop clearer values and boundaries by when treating them, drawing lines, and treating different generations in different compartments&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Skynner]]/[[John Cleese]], ''[[Families and How to Survive Them]]'' (London 1993) pp. 93, 213&lt;/ref&gt; – something especially pertinent in families where unhealthy [[enmeshment]] overrides normal personal values.&lt;ref name=Weinhold&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weinhold|first1=Barry|last2=Weinhold|first2=Janae|title=Breaking Free of the Co-Dependency Trap|date=28 January 2008|publisher=[[New World Library]]|location=Novato|isbn=978-1577316145|pages=192, 198|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the establishment of personal values and boundaries in such instances may produce a negative fall-out,&lt;ref name=Weinhold/&gt; if the pathological state of enmeshment had been a central attraction or element of the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Richard G. Abell, ''Own Your Own Life'' (1977) pp. 119–122&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true if the establishment of healthy boundaries results in unilateral limit setting which did not occur previously. It is important to distinguish between unilateral limits and collaborative solutions in these settings.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;

==Anger==
[[Anger]] is a normal [[emotion]] that involves a strong uncomfortable and emotional response to a perceived provocation. Often, it indicates when one's personal boundaries are violated. Anger may be utilized effectively by setting boundaries or escaping from dangerous situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing|edition=3rd|last=Videbeck|first=Sheila L.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complicating factors==

===Addictions===
Addicts often believe that being in control of others is how to achieve success and happiness in life. People who follow this rule use it as a survival skill, having usually learned it in childhood. As long as they make the rules, no one can back them into a corner with their feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Fenley, Jr., James L. ''Finding a Purpose in the Pain'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental illness===
People with certain mental conditions are predisposed to [[controlling behavior]] including those with [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[paranoid personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Goldberg, MD|first=Joseph|title=Paranoid Personality Disorder |url=http://webmd.com/mental-health/paranoid-personality-disorder|date=23 May 2014|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Braiker, Harriet B., ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[narcissistic personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Nina|title=Children of the Self-Absorbed: A Grown-Up's Guide to Getting Over Narcissistic Parents|date=1 April 2008|publisher=[[New Harbinger Publications]]|isbn=978-1572245617|page=35|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[attention deficit disorder]],&lt;ref name="cermak"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cermak M.D.|first1=Timmen L.|title=Diagnostic Criteria for Codependency|journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs|date=1986|volume=18|issue=1|pages=15–20|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02791072.1986.10524475#preview|doi=10.1080/02791072.1986.10524475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manic state of [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name="cermak"/&gt;

* '''Borderline personality disorder (BPD):''' There is a tendency for loved ones of people with BPD to slip into caretaker roles, giving priority and focus to problems in the life of the person with BPD rather than to issues in their own lives. Too often in these relationships, the codependent will gain a sense of worth by being "the sane one" or "the responsible one".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Danielle|first1=Alicia|title=Codependency and Borderline Personality Disorder: How to Spot It|url=http://www.borderlinepersonalitytreatment.com/codependency-and-borderline-personality-disorder-how-to-spot-it.html|publisher=Clearview Women's Center|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;Often, this shows up prominently in families with strong Asian cultures because of beliefs tied to the cultures. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Soo Jung|date=2017-05-25|title=Gendered Cultural Identities: The Influences of Family and Privacy Boundaries, Subjective Norms, and Stigma Beliefs on Family Health History Communication|url=http://dx.doi.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/10.1080/10410236.2017.1322480|journal=Health Communication|volume=33|issue=8|pages=927–938|doi=10.1080/10410236.2017.1322480|issn=1041-0236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD):''' For those involved with a person with NPD, values and boundaries are often challenged as narcissists have a poor sense of [[self]] and often do not recognize that others are fully separate and not extensions of themselves. Those who meet their needs and those who provide gratification may be treated as if they are part of the narcissist and expected to live up to their expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hotchkiss, LCSW|first1=Sandra|title=Why Is It Always About You? (Chapter 7)|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=9780743214285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Codependency===
[[Codependency]] often involves placing a lower priority on one's own needs, while being excessively preoccupied with the needs of others. Codependency can occur in any type of relationship, including family, work, friendship, and also romantic, peer or community relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patterns and Characteristics of Codependence|url=http://coda.org/index.cfm/meeting-materials1/patterns-and-characteristics-2011/|website=coda.org|publisher=Co-Dependents Anonymous|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a healthy relationship depends on the emotional space provided by personal boundaries,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; codependent personalities have difficulties in setting such limits, so that defining and protecting boundaries efficiently may be for them a vital part of regaining mental health.&lt;ref name=Weinhold/&gt;

In a codependent relationship, the codependent's sense of purpose is based on making extreme sacrifices to satisfy their partner's needs. Codependent relationships signify a degree of unhealthy clinginess, where one person doesn't have self-sufficiency or autonomy. One or both parties depend on the other for fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wetzler, PhD|first1=Scott|title=Psychology division chief at Albert Einstein College of Medicine|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/signs-of-a-codependent-relationship|publisher=WebMD|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is usually an unconscious reason for continuing to put another person's life first, often for the mistaken notion that self-worth comes from other people.

===Dysfunctional family===
* '''Demanding parent:''' In the [[dysfunctional family]] the child learns to become attuned to the parent's needs and feelings instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lancer|first1=Darlene|title=Conquering Shame and Codependency: 8 Steps to Freeing the True You|date=2014|publisher=Hazelden|location=Minnesota|isbn=978-1-61649-533-6|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Demanding child:''' Parenting is a role that requires a certain amount of self-sacrifice and giving a child's needs a high priority. A parent can, nevertheless, be codependent towards a child if the caretaking or parental sacrifice reaches unhealthy or destructive levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm Codependents Anonymous: Patterns and Characteristics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075736/http://www.coda.org/tools4recovery/Patterns2-2011.htm |date=2013-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communal influences===
[[Freud]] described the loss of conscious boundaries that may occur when an individual is in a unified, fast-moving crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, 'Le Bon's Description of the Group Mind', in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (PFL 12) pp. 98–109&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a century later, [[Steven Pinker]] took up the theme of the loss of personal boundaries in a communal experience, noting that such occurrences could be triggered by intense shared ordeals like hunger, fear or pain, and that such methods were traditionally used to create [[Liminality|liminal]] conditions in [[initiation rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Pinker, ''The Stuff of Thought'' (2007) p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jung]] had described this as the absorption of identity into the [[collective unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jung|first1=Carl Gustav|title=Man and His Symbols|date=15 August 1968|publisher=Dell|isbn=978-0440351832|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rave culture]] has also been said to involve a dissolution of personal boundaries, and a merger into a binding sense of communality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Carole|title=Disappearing Men: Gender Disorientation in Scottish Fiction 1979-1999 (Scroll: Scottish Cultural Review of Language and Literature) (Book 12)|date=10 September 2009|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-9042026988|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unequal power relations===
Also unequal relations of [[Power (social and political)|political and social power]] influence the possibilities for marking cultural boundaries and more generally the quality of life of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Colin P.T. Baillie|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/totem/vol20/iss1/12/|title=Power Relations and its Influence in the Sphere of Globalization since World War II|journal=Journal of Anthropology|publisher=The University of Western Ontario|volume=20|issue=1|date=2012|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal power in personal relationships, including [[Abusive power and control|abusive relationships]], can make it difficult for individuals to mark boundaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12498">The '''role of chance, or''' "'''[[luck]]'''", '''in science''' comprises all ways in which unexpected discoveries are made.

Many domains, especially psychology, are concerned with the way science interacts with chance — particularly "[[serendipity]]" (accidents that, through sagacity, are transformed into opportunity). Psychologist Kevin Dunbar and colleagues estimate that between 30% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental in some sense (see [[#Serendipitous discoveries|examples below]]).&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister says a scientist must be "sagacious" (attentive and clever) to benefit from an accident.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt; Dunbar quotes [[Louis Pasteur]]'s saying that "Chance favors only the prepared mind".&lt;ref&gt;Oersted vit tout à coup (par hasard, direz-vous peut-être, mais souvenez-vous que, dans les champs de l'observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprits préparés), il vit tout à coup l'aiguille se mouvoir et prendre une position très différente de celle que lui assigne le magnétisme terrestre.&lt;/ref&gt; The prepared mind, Dunbar suggests, is one trained for observational rigor. Dunbar adds that there is a great deal of writing about the role that serendipity ("happy accidents") plays in the scientific method.&lt;ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck&gt;Dunbar, K., &amp; Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M. E. Gorman, R. D. Tweney, D. Gooding &amp; A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technological Thinking (pp. 57–79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darden, L. (1997). Strategies for discovering mechanisms: Schema instantiation, modular subassembly, forward chaining/backtracking. Proceedings of the 1997 Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thagard, P. (1999). How Scientists Explain Disease. Princeton, NJ; Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kulkarni, D., &amp; Simon, H. (1988). The processes of scientific discovery: The strategy of experimentation. Cognitive Science, 12, 139–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that scientists are taught various [[heuristics]] and practices that allow their investigations to benefit, and not suffer, from accidents.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"&gt;Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York:NY, Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; First, careful [[scientific control|control conditions]] allow scientists to properly identify something as "unexpected". Once a finding is recognized as legitimately unexpected and in need of explaining, researchers can attempt to explain it: They work across various disciplines, with various colleagues, trying various analogies in order to understand the first curious finding.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

==Preparing to make discoveries==
[[File:DunbarFugelsangLuckInScience.png|thumb|left|A model based on the work of Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang. The two say that the first step is to realize a result is unexpected and unexplained.]]
Accidental discoveries have been a topic of discussion especially from the 20th century onwards. Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang say that somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are unexpected. This helps explain why scientists often call their discoveries "lucky", and yet scientists themselves may not be able to detail exactly what role luck played (see also [[introspection illusion]]). Dunbar and Fugelsang believe scientific discoveries are the result of carefully prepared experiments, but also "prepared minds".&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

The author [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls science "anti-fragile". That is, science can actually use — and benefit from — the chaos of the real world. While some methods of investigation are fragile in the face of human error and randomness, the scientific method relies on randomness in many ways. Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.&lt;ref name=Taleb&gt;Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility,http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Taleb/&gt;&lt;ref name=TalebBook&gt;Taleb, N. N. (2010). The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: "On Robustness and Fragility". NY: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; According to  M. K. Stoskopf, it is in this way that serendipity is often the "foundation for important intellectual leaps of understanding" in science.&lt;ref name=Stoskopf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16179740&amp;query_hl=2&amp;itool=pubmed_DocSum|title=Observation and cogitation: how serendipity provides the building blocks of scientific discovery |last=Stosskopf |first= M. K |publisher=American College of Zoological Medicine, Wildlife and Aquatic Medicine and Environmental and Molecular Toxicology |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "[[Serendipity]]" is frequently understood as simply "a happy accident", but [[Horace Walpole]] used the word 'serendipity' to refer to a certain kind of happy accident: the kind that can only be exploited by a "sagacious" or clever person.&lt;ref name=Stoskopf/&gt;&lt;ref name=MertonBarber&gt;{{Cite book|first=Robert K. |last=Merton |first2=Elinor |last2=Barber |title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity: A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=2004 |isbn=0691117543 }} (Manuscript written 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dunbar and Fugelsang talk about, not just luck or chance in science, but specifically "serendipity" in science.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;

Dunbar and Fugelsang suggest that the process of discovery often starts when a researcher finds bugs in their experiment. These unexpected results lead a researcher to self-doubt, and to try and fix what they ''think'' is an error in their own  methodology. The first recourse is to explain the error using local hypotheses (e.g. analogies typical of the discipline). This process is also local in the sense that the scientist is relatively independent or else working with one partner. Eventually, the researcher decides that the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. Self-doubt is complete, and so the methods shift to become more broad: The researcher begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, sometimes seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise. The highly controlled, cautious, curious and even social aspects of the scientific method are what make it well suited for identifying persistent systematic errors (anomalies).&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/&gt;

[[Albert Hofmann]], the Swiss chemist who discovered [[LSD]]'s [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties when he tried ingesting it at his lab, wrote
{{quotation|It is true that my discovery of LSD was a chance discovery, but it was the outcome of planned experiments and these experiments took place in the framework of systematic pharmaceutical, chemical research. It could better be described as serendipity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maps.org/news-letters/v11n2/11222gro.pdf Maps Organization. (2001). "Stanislav Grof interviews Dr. Albert Hofmann, 1984". Esalen Institute. Big Sur. Volume 11. Number 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dunbar and colleagues cite the discoveries of Hofmann and others as having involved serendipity. In contrast, the mind can be "prepared" in ways that obstruct serendipity — making new knowledge difficult or impossible to take in. Psychologist Alan A. Baumeister describes at least one such instance: Researcher Roy Heath failed to recognize evidence of "pleasure brain circuits" (in the [[septal nuclei]]). When Heath stimulated the brains of his schizophrenic patients, some of them reported feeling pleasure — a finding that Heath could have explored. Heath, however, was "prepared" (based on prior beliefs) for patients to report alertness, and when other patients did, it was on the reports of alertness that Heath focused his investigations. Heath failed to realize he had seen something unexpected and unexplained.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Retrieve&amp;dopt=AbstractPlus&amp;list_uids=16608738&amp;query_hl=4&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum|title=Serendipity and the cerebral localization of pleasure |last=Baumeister |first= A.A|publisher=Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The brain===
Fugelsang and Dunbar observe scientists while they work together in labs or analyze data, but they also use experimental settings and even [[neuroimaging]].&lt;ref name=DunbarFugelsangLuck/&gt; [[Functional MRI|fMRI]] investigation found that unexpected findings were associated with particular brain activity. Unexpected findings were found to activate the [[prefrontal cortex]] as well as the [[left hemisphere]] in general. This suggests that unexpected findings provoke more attention, and the brain applies more linguistic, conscious systems to help explain those findings. This supports the idea that scientists are using particular abilities that exist to some extent in all humans.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gazzaniga, M. (2000). Cerebral specialization and interhemispheric communication: does the corpus callosum enable the human condition? ''Brain'', 123, 1293–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|align=right|width=40%|quote  =  Absent sagacity, a chance observation of an important phenomenon will have no impact, and the observer may be denied historical attribution for the discovery.|source = Alfred A Baumeister &lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt;}} 
On the other hand, Dunbar and Fugelsang say that an ingenious experimental design (and control conditions) may not be enough for the researcher to properly appreciate when a finding is "unexpected". Serendipitous discoveries often requires certain mental conditions in the investigator beyond rigor. For example, a scientist must know all about what is expected before they can be surprised, and this requires experience in the field.&lt;ref name="DunbarFugelsangLuck"/&gt; Researchers also require the sagacity to know to invest in the most curious findings.&lt;ref name=AABaumeister/&gt;

==Serendipitous discoveries==
{{Main| List of discoveries influenced by chance circumstances}}

Royston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on.&lt;ref name=Roberts&gt;Roberts, Royston M. (1989). Serendipity: Accidental Discoveries in Science. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Gaughan writes that accidental discoveries result from the convergence of preparation, opportunity, and desire.&lt;ref name=Gaughan&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Gaughan |title=Accidental Genius: The World's Greatest By-Chance Discoveries |publisher=Metro Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4351-2557-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of luck in science is when drugs under investigation become known for different, unexpected uses. This was the case for [[minoxidil]] (an [[antihypertensive]] [[vasodilator]] that was subsequently found to also slow [[alopecia|hair loss]] and promote hair regrowth in some people) and for [[sildenafil]] (a medicine for [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]], now familiar as "[[Viagra]]", used to treat [[erectile dysfunction]]). 

The hallucinogenic effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) were discovered by [[Albert Hofmann]], who was originally working with the substance to try and treat [[migraines]] and bleeding after childbirth. Hofmann experienced mental distortions and suspected it may have been the effects of LSD. He decided to test this hypothesis on himself by taking what he thought was "an extremely small quantity": 250&amp;nbsp;micrograms. Hofmann's description of what he experienced as a result of taking so much LSD is regarded by Royston Roberts as "one of the most frightening accounts in recorded medical history".&lt;ref name=Roberts/&gt;

'''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' (English: ''The Gregorian School of Prague'') is an ''[[a cappella]]'' [[male voice choir]] from the [[Czech Republic]], founded in 1987 by '''David Eben'''. Their core repertoire consists of [[Gregorian chant]], [[Bohemia]]n [[plainchant]], and early [[polyphony]], but they also perform modern works including some composed for them.

==Description==

===Schola Gregoriana Pragensis===
The '''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis''' is an award winning choir from the Czech republic with primary focus on Gregorian chant and Bohemian plainchant.  The choir formed in 1987 under the direction of David Eben and was restricted in its repertoire to only [[liturgical]] music for the first two years.  Since the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, the choir has extended its repertoire to include a variety of sacred music, with particular focus on Gregorian chant ([[monophonic]] Latin liturgical music) and early polyphony.

The choir has won several awards, including the Choc du monde de le musique, 10 de Repertoire and [[Golden Harmony (Zlatá Harmonie)]].&lt;ref name="supraphon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supraphon.com/en/artists/?item=47 |website=[[Supraphon]] |title=Schola Gregoriana Pragensis |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inception they have toured a variety of countries.

Of particular importance is the choir's work in researching and performing Bohemian [[plainchant]] and early polyphony.{{citation needed|reason="Of particular importance" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}

The choir has between six and nine members with a repertoire of various sacred music.  They have toured many countries, including Japan, Israel, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland.&lt;ref name="supraphon" /&gt;

Their work in the interpretation of medieval music, with particular focus on Bohemian plainsong, is particularly significant with a focus on the symbolism of [[neumatic]] notation from the 10th and 11th centuries.{{citation needed|reason="particularly significant" needs to be backed up by a reliable source|date=April 2016}}  Performances feature the original [[Bohemian]] plainchant tradition, including the earliest examples of polyphony.  In addition they have performed music from 14th and 15th century and more modern compositions, including some written specifically for the group.

They have produced numerous recordings under the [[Supraphon]] and other labels.

The choir has participated in early music festivals, including the Festival Early Music at Utrecht in 2014.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musica-dei-donum.org/concert_reviews/FOMU2014.html|title= Concert review from Festival Early Music Utrecht 2014|publisher= Musica Dei Donum|quote=With the concert of the Schola Gregoriana Pragensis we moved forward almost two centuries. This ensemble focuses on early plainchant and polyphony from Bohemia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of David Eban and the choir has featured in Czech academic publications related to musicology.&lt;ref name="JournalArticleKucirkova"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kučírková | first = Kristýna | date = 2007 | title = Schola Gregoriana Pragensis versus Svatomichalská gregoriánská schola aneb Dva způsoby poučené interpretace | url = http://www.muni.cz/research/publications/743334 | journal = Teoretické reflexe hudební výchovy | publisher = [[Masarykova univerzita]] | location = [[Brno]] | language = Czech | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | issn = 1803-1331 | access-date= 5 March 2016 }} Title in English: ''Schola Gregoriana Pragensis versus Svatomichalská gregoriánská schola, two ways of interpretation''&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science and Engineering Challenge''' [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|(SEC)]] is a non-profit, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] outreach program run throughout the schools year in [[Australia]]. The goal of the program is to challenge student’s perception of science and engineering and experience aspects of those fields that they normally would not encounter in a school environment.&lt;ref name="Challenge Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-engineering-and-built-environment/science-and-engineering-challenge|title=About Us|date=19 November 2014|website=Newcastle.edu.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] focuses on inspiring students in year 10 to consider a future career in science and engineering by choosing to study science and mathematics in years 11 and 12. The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] also includes other events such as Discovery Days and the [https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-information-technology/community-outreach/smart S.M.A.R.T] outreach program.

==History==
The SEC began at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] as an initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and Information Technology. Initially, information nights were conducted aimed at giving students and parents from rural areas the opportunity to find out about careers in science and engineering.  Based on the success of these information nights, the first SEC event was held on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] in the year 2000, as an activity for [[National Science Week]]. Throughout 2001, events were held around the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] area and other parts of [[NSW]].

2002 saw the first Challenge Days held outside of [[NSW]], this took place in [[Canberra]]. Over the next three years, Challenge Days were conducted in [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In 2005 the winners from each state competed at the first National Final.

In 2017 there were 110 SMART events, 49 Discovery Days for primary-aged students, and 99 Challenge Days for year 9-10 students. Overall more than 50,000 people were involved in one or more SEC programs. Almost 2,100 teachers and 3,600 other volunteers were also involved.
Since 1998 over half a million people have taken part in a SEC event.

== Discovery Days ==

In 2005 the Challenge expanded yet again to include events for primary school students, called Discovery Days. These are largely the same as regular challenge events; however, the actives are simplified and typical run for a shorter period of time.

== Programs ==

#The Little Scientists program: Train preschool teachers to incorporate STEM into their lessons
#SMART program of science shows and workshops: Infants and Primary-aged students
#Discovery Days: Mini-Challenge Days for students in years 5-6
#Build a Future Days: A fascinating on-campus experience for year 7-8 students
#Challenge Days (our premier event): National STEM competition for year 9-10 students
#Casual work and Internships with the SEC Team
#Teacher Professional Development: For School Teachers

A '''slide chart''' is a hand-held device, usually of paper, cardboard, or plastic, for conducting simple calculations or looking up information.
A circular slide chart is sometimes referred to as a wheel chart or [[volvelle]].

Unlike other hand-held mechanical calculating devices such as [[slide rules]] and [[addiator]]s, which have been replaced by electronic calculators and computer software, wheel charts and slide charts have survived to the present time. There are a number of companies who design and manufacture these devices.

Unlike the general-purpose mechanical calculators, slide charts are usually devoted to carrying out a particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process. For example, the "CurveEasy" wheel chart displays information related to spherical geometry calculations and the Prestolog calculator is used for cost/profit calculations.  Another example of a wheel chart is the [[planisphere]], which shows the location of stars in the sky for a given location, date, and time.

Slide charts are often associated with particular sports, political campaigns or commercial companies. For example, a pharmaceutical company may create wheel charts printed with their company name and product information for distribution to medical practitioners.

Slide charts are common collectables.

\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f    \relative c'' {
        a4( b c d e f g a)
    }

}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=220|caption=An A-minor natural scale under a slur}}

A '''slur''' is a symbol in Western [[musical notation]] indicating that the [[note (music)|notes]] it embraces are to be played without separation (that is, with [[legato]] [[articulation (music)|articulation]]). A slur is denoted with a [[curve]]d [[line (geometry)|line]] generally placed over the notes if the [[stem (music)|stems]] point downward, and under them if the stems point upwards.

The example below shows two measures in {{music|time|6|8}} with a slur for each measures:

:&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt;

\relative c'' {

  \set Staff.midiInstrument = #"violin"

  \key e \minor \time 6/8 
  e16( dis e fis g b, c d e gis, a b) 
  c( e, f g! a c, d e f g a b)
}&lt;/score&gt;

== Performance ==
Slurs mean different things for different instruments:

*For [[bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]]s, the notes should be played in one [[bow stroke]].
* For [[guitar]]s, the notes should be played without plucking the individual strings ([[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s).
* For [[wind instrument]]s, the notes should be played without re-articulating each note ([[tonguing]]), except in [[trombone]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
* For [[vocal music]], slurs are usually used to mark notes which are [[singing|sung]] to a single [[syllable]] ([[melisma]]).

A slur can be extended over many notes, sometimes encompassing several [[bar (music)|bars]]. In extreme cases, composers are known to write slurs which are near-impossible to achieve; in that case the composer wishes to emphasise that the notes should be performed with as much legato as possible.
A curved line is also often used to show the beginning and end points of a musical phrase that is intended to be performed as a single musical thought. Within such a phrase, individual notes can be marked with smaller curved lines to indicate a true slur, or a tie. Within a phrase, various notes can be articulated differently to achieve the desired effect, but all of the notes within the phrase should be played in a manner to maintain continuity of the musical thought.

'''Sociology of leisure''' or '''leisure sociology''' is the study of how humans organize their [[leisure|free time]]. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as [[sport]], [[tourism]], and the playing of [[game]]s. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the [[sociology of work]], as each explores a different side of the work-leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work-leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and [[culture]].

Studies of leisure have determined that observable patterns cannot be easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. The type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's situation (presence or lack of family, age, and other factors).

==Theory==
Sociology of leisure is a fairly recent [[subfields of sociology|subfield of sociology]], compared to more traditional subfields such as [[sociology of work]], [[sociology of the family]], and [[sociology of education]]: it saw most of its development in the second half of the 20th century.{{Ref label|a|a|none}}&lt;ref name=parker&gt;Stanley Parker, "The Sociology of Leisure: Progress and Problems," ''The British Journal of Sociology'', vol. 26, no. 1, March 1975, pp. 91-101.

[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-leisuresociologicalstudsf.html Online]. Last accessed on 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, leisure had often been seen as a relatively unimportant, minor feature of [[society]].&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Leisure is now recognized as a major [[social institution]], deserving of serious sociological inquiry, particularly in Western societies.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Frey, David R. Dickens, "Leisure as a Primary Institution," ''Sociological Inquiry.'' vol. 60, no. 3, 1990, pp. 264-73, ON: 1475-682X, {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-682X.1990.tb00144.x}}. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-682X.1990.tb00144.x]&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[John Wilson (sociologist)|John Wilson]] and others have noted, it is difficult to define [[leisure]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;John Wilson, "The Sociology of Leisure," ''Annual Review of Sociology'', vol. 6, August 1980, pp. 21-40. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.so.06.080180.000321 Online], [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2946003 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Its definitions are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; [[Joffre Dumazedier]] distinguished four distinct definitions of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to [[self-fulfillment]]. Dumazedier's four definitions are not exhaustive.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; Incompatible definitions and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

There are some unresolved questions concerning the definition of work: in particular, whether unpaid endeavors, such as volunteering or studying, are work.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; Non-work time should not be equated with free time, as it comprises not only free time, dedicated to leisure, but also time dedicated to certain obligatory activities, such as [[Homemaking|housework]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Dividing activities into free and dedicated time is not easy. For example, brushing one's teeth is neither work nor leisure; scholars differ in their classifications of activities such as eating a meal, shopping, repairing a car, attending a religious ceremony, or showering (various individuals may or may not classify such activities as leisure).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The relation between work and leisure can also be unclear: research indicates that some individuals find skills that they have acquired at work useful to their hobbies (and vice versa), and some individuals have used leisure activities to advance their work careers.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Sociologists also disagree as to whether political or spiritual activities should be included in studies of leisure.&lt;ref name=parker2&gt;S.R. Parker, "Sociology of Leisure," ''Sociology'', 10 (1), 1976, Oxford (0038-0385), p. 166. [http://soc.sagepub.com+166.pdf Online]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, among some [[occupational community|occupational communities]], such as police officers or miners, it is common for work colleagues to be off-time friends and to share similar, work-based leisure activities.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Apart from a definition of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, the study of the sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]], as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history.&lt;ref name=parker/&gt; The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied in the last few decades by recurring national [[tatistical survey|surveys]] such as the [[General Household Survey]] in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on [[qualitative research|qualitative methods]] of research ([[interviews]]).&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

Over time, emphasis in studies of leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; [[Marshall Gordon]] noted that there are two approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The formal approach focuses on [[empirical]] questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the [[sociology of sport]]).&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and [[social change]], often from [[structural functionalist|structural-functionalist]] and [[neo-Marxist]] perspectives.&lt;ref name=Gordon/&gt; [[Sheila Scraton]] provided a different analysis, comparing [[North America]]n and [[Great Britain|British]] studies.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt; The British approaches focus on input from [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]], [[critical Marxism]], and [[feminism]]; the American approaches concentrate on the [[social psychology|social-psychological]] tradition.&lt;ref name=scraton/&gt;

==Findings==
Many sociologists have assumed that a given type of leisure activity is most easily explained by [[socioeconomic]] variables such as [[income]], [[Employment|occupation]] or [[education]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and "[[country club|country-club]]" activities such as golf or sailing are significantly [[correlation|correlated]]—but so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost).&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Education is correlated with having a wide range of leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; As Kelly noted, "Predicting a person's leisure behavior on the basis of his socioeconomic position is all but impossible."&lt;ref&gt;J. Kelly, "Socialization toward Leisure: a Developmental Approach," ''Journal of Leisure Research'', vol. 6, 1974, pp. 181-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, type of leisure activity is substantially influenced by the individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, whether there are recreational facilities nearby, and age.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]].&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

Specific findings in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by [[John Robinson (sociologist)|John Robinson]]'s late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have four hours of leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;John Robinson, ''How Americans Use Their Time: A Social-Psychological Analysis of Everyday Behavior'', New York, Praeger, 1977, pp. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt; During the second half of the twentieth century, watching [[television]] became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television.&lt;ref name=robinson&gt;J. Robinson and P. Converse, "Social Change Reflected in the Use of Time," in A. Campbell and P. Converse, eds., ''The Human Meaning of Social Change'', New York, Russell Sage, 1972, pp. 17-86.&lt;/ref&gt; Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6871">'''Sustainable land management''' (SLM&lt;ref name=worldbank/&gt;) refers to practices and technologies that aim to integrate the [[land management|management of land]], [[water management|water]], [[biodiversity]], and other [[Environmental resource management|environmental resource]]s to meet human needs while ensuring the long-term [[sustainability]] of [[ecosystem]] services and livelihoods. The term sustainable land management is used, for example, in [[regional planning]] and [[soil]] or [[environmental protection]], as well as in property and estate management.

== Examples ==

The [[World Bank]] defines sustainable land management as a process in a charged environment between [[environmental protection]] and the guarantee claim of [[ecosystem services]] on the one hand. On the other hand, it is about productivity of [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] with respect to [[demographic growth]] and increasing pressure in [[land consumption|land use]].

{{quote|SLM is defined as a knowledge-based procedure that helps integrate land, water, biodiversity, and environmental management (including input and output externalities) to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods. SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growing
population. Improper land management can lead to [[land degradation]] and a significant reduction in the productive and service (biodiversity niches, [[hydrology]], [[carbon sequestration]]) functions of watersheds and landscapes."&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;[https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/7132/366540PAPER0Su11PUBLIC0as0of0July71.txt?sequence=2 The World Bank (2006): Sustainable Land Management. Challenges, Opportunities, and Trade-offs. Washington, DC]&lt;/ref&gt;|The World Bank}}
  
The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) applies the term in a much wider context. Besides agriculture and forestry they include the mineral extraction sector, property and estate management.

{{quote|Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect. It covers all activities concerned with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can include farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|title=Land Administration Guideline. With Special Reference to Countries in Transition|publisher=UN Economic Commission for Europe, Geneva, ECE/HBP/96|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/documents/Publications/land.administration.guidelines.e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the course of national politics and programmes, few [[Europe]]an states use the terminology "sustainable land management". Here [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are to be mentioned, as both countries have agreed on sustainable land management with respect to climate change as part of their government programmes.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Australian Government – Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European context, the definition of the European Network for Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities (LUMASEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://urbact.eu/en/projects/metropolitan-governance/lumasec/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; may be used as a reference. It emphasizes the inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation on sustainable land management:  

{{quote|As management is the human activity meaning the action of people working together in the aim to accomplish desired goals, land use management is a process of managing use and development of land, in which spatial, sector-oriented and temporary aspects of urban policy are coordinated. Resources of land are used for different purposes, which may produce conflicts and competitions, and land use management has to see those purposes in an integrated way. Therefore, land management covers the debate about norms and visions driving the policy-making, sector-based planning both in the strategic and more operative time spans, spatial integration of sectoral issues, decision-making, budgeting, implementation of plans and decisions and the monitoring of results and evaluation of impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Vancutsem (LEAD Expert): 2008 Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Research examples==

Since 2010, the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) funds an international research program on "sustainable land management".&lt;ref&gt;Weith, T., Schulz, K., Gaasch, N., Seppelt, R., Werntze, A., Eppink, F. (2010): Towards Integration: Sustainable Land Management. A new German Research Funding Measure&lt;/ref&gt; Module A of the program investigates interactions between land management, [[climate change]], and ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Seppelt, R., Dormann, C., Eppink, F. V., Lautenbach, S., Schmidt, S. (2011): A quantitative review of ecosystem studies: Approaches, shortcomings and the road ahead, Journal of Applied Ecology&lt;/ref&gt; It includes projects operating in [[South America]], [[Africa]], Europe, [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]]. Module B seeks "innovative system solutions" in 13 projects with a Central European focus.

Furthermore, [[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative | the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative]] seeks to establish a cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management highlighting its economic benefits. This economic analysis will enable decision makers to take appropriate measures combat [[land degradation]] globally. Additionally, the Initiative supports regional case studies focusing on [[Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].

'''The Ghost Shirt''' is believed to have been worn by a [[Sioux]] warrior killed in the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. The shirt is plain cotton, has raven, owl, and eagle feathers hanging from the neck, and is pierced in several places with bullet holes. There are slight brown stains of blood, but it cannot be confirmed that the shirt originated from the massacre. [[Ghost Dance]] shirts are said to be objects of power to the wearer, and sacred to [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]]. The Lakota Sioux were the only tribe to believe that the ghost shirt clothing would protect them from the bullets of the white man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/title/Ghost%2520Shirt Everything 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 the shirt was brought to [[Glasgow]], and sold to [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum|Kelvingrove Museum]] by George C. Crager, a member of [[Buffalo Bill]] Cody's [[Wild West Traveling Show]]. The shirt was displayed at the museum from 1892 until 1999.

A four-year campaign led by Marcella Le Beau, secretary of The Wounded Knee Association and great-granddaughter of one of the survivors of Wounded Knee, sought the shirt's return to the [[Lakota people]]. In November 1998 [[Glasgow City Council]] voted to return it after the city residents supported the move. In a gesture of good will, the Ghost Dance Shirt was replaced by another made in 1998 by Marcella Le Beau herself. She said, "This will bring about a sense of closure to a sad and horrible event. Now healing can begin." The Lakota leaders said that the shirt will be displayed at one of the Reservations once a new museum is built.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmcumeds/371/0051808.htm Memo from Glasgow City Council]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/217816.stm BBC News Nov 30, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/409876.stm BBC News Aug 2, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sioux-to-be-given-ghost-shirt-1186048.html The Independent Nov 20, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluecloud.org/ghostshirt.html from [[South Dakota Magazine]] Sept.1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511200804/http://www.bluecloud.org/ghostshirt.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4466945.html Chicago Sun-Times Nov 18, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MountEcclesia 002entr.jpg|270px|right|thumb|[[Mount Ecclesia|The Ecclesia]]'s facade at The [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]]: the school founded by [[Max Heindel]] around the time ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' was written.]]
'''''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception or Mystic Christianity''''' (also known as '''''Western Wisdom Teachings''''') is a [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] text by [[Max Heindel]], first published in 1909.

== Publication history ==
The first edition was printed in November 1909. The order of publication was placed by Max Heindel on the [[New Moon]]&lt;ref&gt;Note: The ''new moon'' is important in [[astrology]], as is the ''full moon''.&lt;/ref&gt; of November 1909 and the book was published a couple of weeks later by the [[Full Moon]], some 5 short weeks before the end of the first decade of the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Galzain. Online [RF Friends] announcement of the 100-year centenary of the ''Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' and celebration events at [[Mount Ecclesia]] on the weekend of November 13–14-15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It has little changed since then and it is considered to be Max Heindel's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. It is a reference work in the [[Christian mysticism]] practice and in the [[Occult]] study literature, containing the fundamentals of [[Esoteric Christianity]] from a Rosicrucian perspective. The ''Cosmo'' contains a comprehensive outline of the evolutionary process of man and the [[universe]], correlating science with religion. It is, till current days, the basic book for the philosophy courses of the school, the [[Rosicrucian Fellowship]], founded by the author on August 8, 1909.

=== The first dedicatory ===
The first edition of this work, containing more than 700 pages of in depth teachings into the major themes of the ''occult science'', was dedicated to a knowledgeable lecturer of the occult field called [[Rudolf Steiner]], to whom Max Heindel felt greatly indebted. It had the subtitle "Occult Science" instead of "Mystic Christianity" and just above the message and mission ("A Sane Mind, a Soft Heart and a Sound Body", "Service") there was a quotation from [[Paul of Tarsus]]: "PROVE ALL THINGS".
In the subsequent edition, Heindel removed the initial dedication and changed the mentioned elements. The first dedication became a controversial issue among some students of both teachers down to the present. However, as both Heindel and Steiner appear to have been influenced by the same Elder Brother of the [[Rose Cross]], to some extent and at some stage of their lives, it becomes an accessory issue that may only be unveiled through the discernment of the student along her/his path of [[spirituality|spiritual]] unfoldment.

== Contents overview ==
The author talks about the true man and his journey through [[Involution (esoterism)|involution]], [[spiritual evolution]] and epigenesis, presenting practical methods to help the development of latent potentials in each one of us and how to transmute our latency into dynamic powers in order to achieve, according to the author, direct knowledge and conscientious work in the [[Plane (cosmology)|inner planes]].

It deals with many esoteric topics and also [[metaphysics]], [[physiology]] and [[cosmology]] (the visible and invisible worlds, human evolution, [[reincarnation|death and rebirth]], nutrition, esoteric training, ...). It contains a history of the evolution of the human spirit and related bodies (from before awareness, through various incarnations of our planet on various planes, and into the future development) and of animal, vegetable and mineral life waves (the myriad life forms and types of consciousness on this physical plane, experiencing their own points in evolution). It also presents an [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric interpretation]] about the mission of Christ and an [[occult]] analysis of [[Bible|Biblical]] texts which include the fall of man, the [[Karma|Law of Cause and Consequence]] and Bible and rebirth, and many other themes which were further developed in the subsequent books, lectures and lessons given by the author at the time (1910s) in the United States.

=== Main themes ===
''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' is divided in three parts:&lt;br/&gt;
Part I: the Visible and the Invisible Worlds, Man and the Method of Evolution, Rebirth and the Law of Cause and Effect; &lt;br/&gt;
Part II: the scheme of Evolution in general and the Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth in particular; &lt;br/&gt;
Part III: Christ and His Mission, Future Development of Man and Initiation, Esoteric Training and a Safe Method of Acquiring Firsthand Knowledge.

== The Rosicrucian conception of God and the scheme of evolution ==
According to the ''Western Wisdom Teachings'', in the beginning of a ''Day of Manifestation'' a certain collective Great Being, God, limits Himself to a certain portion of space, in which He elects to create a [[Solar System]] for the evolution of added [[self (philosophy)|self]]-[[consciousness]].
[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|right|thumb|210px|''[[The Ancient of Days]]'', illustrated by [[William Blake]] (1794)]]
&lt;!---"Both poet and artist, Blake illustrated his own poetic work. He also labored to create his own cosmology and mythology, based upon his readings of the Bible, the teachings of Swedenborg, and his own besetting visions. This illustration suggests a gnostic approach to the Creator as a lesser, fallible God, though the visual suggestion of compasses, which Blake associated with materialism and a constricted, Newtonian view of reality."---&gt;
In God there are contained hosts of glorious Hierarchies and lesser beings of every grade of intelligence and stage of [[consciousness]], from [[omniscience]] to an [[unconsciousness]] deeper than that of the deepest [[altered state of consciousness|trance condition]].
During the current period of manifestation these various grades of beings are working to acquire more experience than they possessed at the beginning of this period of existence. Those who, in previous manifestations, have attained the highest degree of development work on those who have not yet evolved any consciousness.

The period of time devoted to the attainment of self-consciousness and to the building of the [[Subtle body|vehicles]] through which the spirit in man manifests, is called "[[Involution (esoterism)|Involution]]". The succeeding period of existence, during which the individual human being develops ''[[self-consciousness]]'' into ''[[divinity|divine]] [[omniscience]]'', is called "[[Spiritual evolution|Evolution]]". Every evolving being has within him a "force" which makes evolution not to be a mere enfoldment of latent germinal possibilities but a process where each individual differ from that of every other. This force, called "Epigenesis", provides the element of [[originality]] and gives scope to the creative ability which the evolving being is to cultivate that he may become a God.

''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception'' describes that in the [[Solar system]], God's Habitation, there are [[Rosicrucian Fellowship#The Seven Worlds .26 the Seven Cosmic Planes|seven Worlds]] differentiated by God, within Himself, one after another.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception''; Diagram 2: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen002.gif The Seven Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt; These Worlds have each a different "measure" and rate of [[oscillation|vibration]] and are not separated by [[space]] or [[distance]], as is the earth from the other planets. They are states of [[matter]], of varying [[density]] and [[vibration]] (as are the solids, liquids and gases of the physical [[Earth]]). These Worlds are not instantaneously created at the beginning of a day of Manifestation, nor do they last until the end. The evolutionary scheme is carried through five of these Worlds in seven great Periods of manifestation, during which the evolving virgin [[spirit]] becomes first human and then a God.
The highest Worlds are created first, and as involution is to slowly carry the life into denser and denser matter for the building of forms, the finer Worlds gradually [[condense]] and new Worlds are differentiated within God to furnish the necessary links between Himself and the Worlds which have consolidated. In due time the point of greatest density, the [[nadir]] of materiality, is reached. From that point the life begins to ascend into higher Worlds, as [[Spiritual evolution|evolution]] proceeds. That leaves the denser Worlds depopulated, one by one. When the purpose has been served for which a particular World was created, God ends its existence, which has become superfluous, by ceasing within Himself the particular activity which brought into being and sustained that World.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''Idem''; Diagram 8: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen008.gif The 7 7 7 Incarnations]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{God|by religion}}
The Rosicrucians teach that the above referred seven Worlds belong to the lowest of the seven "Cosmic Planes". The Worlds and Cosmic Planes are not one above another in space, but the seven Cosmic Planes inter-penetrate each other and all the seven Worlds. They are states of [[spirit]]-[[matter]], permeating one another, so that God and the other great Beings pervade every part of their own realms and realms of greater density than their own, including our world: "''in Him we live and move and have our being''". Proceeding from the [[physical plane|physical world]] to the [[Plane (cosmology)|inner worlds]], '''God''' - the "Architect of the Solar System", the Source and goal of human existence&amp;nbsp;– is found in the highest division of the seventh Cosmic Plane: this is His World. In order to trace the origin of the Architect of the Solar System, one must pass to the highest of the seven Cosmic Planes: the "Realm of the '''Supreme Being'''", Who emanated from "The Absolute". '''The Absolute''' is beyond comprehension and, as [[wikt:manifestation|manifestation]] implies limitation, He may be best described as "Boundless Being": the "Root of Existence".

From [[The Absolute]] proceeds the [[Supreme Being]], at the dawn of manifestation: this is ''The One'', the "[[Great Architect of the Universe]]". The first aspect of the Supreme Being may be characterized as ''Power'', from this proceeds the second aspect, ''the Word'', and from both of these proceeds the third, aspect, ''Motion''. From the threefold Supreme Being proceed the "seven Great [[Logos|Logoi]]". They contain within Themselves all the great Hierarchies which differentiate more and more as they diffuse through the various Cosmic Planes.&lt;ref&gt;Heindel, Max, ''Idem''; Diagram 6: [http://www.rosicrucian.com/images/rccen006.gif The Supreme Being, the Cosmic Planes and God]&lt;/ref&gt; In the Highest World of the seventh Cosmic Plane dwells the God of the [[Planetary system|Solar Systems]] in the [[Universe]]. These great Beings are also threefold in manifestation, like the Supreme Being. Their three aspects are ''Will'', ''Wisdom'' and ''Activity''.

== Comments about the ''Cosmo'' ==

=== The author's perspective ===

By Max Heindel in ''A Word to the Wise'':

*''If the book is "weighed and found wanting," the writer will have no complaint. He only fears a hasty judgment based upon lack of knowledge of the system he advocates—a hearing wherein the judgment is "wanting" in consequence of having been denied an impartial "weighing." He would further submit, that the only opinion worthy of the one who expresses '''it must be based upon knowledge.'''''
*''Yet he is convinced that The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is far from being the last word on the subject.''
*''The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception is not dogmatic, neither does it appeal to any other authority than the reason of the student.''
*''The Rosicrucian Brotherhood has the most far-reaching, the most logical conception of the World-Mystery (...)''
*''It is emphatically stated that '''this work embodies only the writer's understanding of the Rosicrucian teachings''' concerning the World-Mystery (...)''
*''What is said in this work is to be accepted or rejected by the reader according to his own discretion.''
---
*Now, perhaps you will understand my attitude towards the Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception. I admire and marvel at its wonderful teaching more than anyone else, and can do so without violating proper modesty for the book is not mine—it belongs to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;The Rosicrucian Fellowship. ''[http://www.rosicrucian.com/our_work.htm Our Work in the World]''. Accessed in July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A critical essay ===

By Charles Weber in ''The Mystic and Occult in Max Heindel's Writings'':&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Charles. ''[http://www.fraternidaderosacruz.org/rc_cw_maoimht.htm The Mystic and Occult in Max Heindel's Writings]''. Accessed in February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Cosmo’s author has "an unswerving desire, a burning thirst for knowledge", which is "the first and central requisite the aspirant to occult knowledge must possess", but with this qualification, that "the supreme motive for seeking this occult knowledge must be an ardent desire to benefit humanity" (22). "Another prerequisite to this first-hand knowledge, however, is the study of occultism second-hand" (23). It is the purpose of the Cosmo to make that second-hand study of occultism possible. Occult science is the science of what occurs occultly insofar as it is not perceived in external nature, but in that region toward which the soul turns when it directs its inner being toward the spirit.
*Heindel emphasizes the facticity of the Cosmo’s contents and the rigor and objectivity of his sources by using the term occult scientist(s) thirty times and occult science twenty-five times. The occultist (used twenty times) "knows" and "sees" what he is reporting on. "The occult scientist uses concentration in preference to prayer because the former is accomplished by the aid of the mind, which is cold and unfeeling, whereas prayer is usually dictated by emotion" (463). That is, concentration is more impersonal, and therefore more reliable. However, when emotion is replaced by a mystic’s "pure unselfish devotion to high ideals, prayer is much higher than cold concentration" (ibid).

=== Modern perspective ===

The first edition was printed in 1909 and has changed little since then.

'''The curse of expertise''' is a psychological concept&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To|author= Sian beilock |isbn=978-1416596189|date=2011-09-09|publisher=Atria Publishing Group/Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/choke/201103/the-curse-expertise The curse of Expertise]&lt;/ref&gt; where the intervention of experts may be counterproductive for [[Learning|learners]] acquiring new skills.

This is important because the predictions  of  experts can  influence  [[educational equity]] and [[training]]  as well as the  [[personal development]] of [[young people]], not to mention the allocation  of  time and  resources  to scientific research and crucial design decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=Journal  of Experimental &amp; applied Psychology,1999,  Vol. 5, No. 2,205-221|title=The Curse of Expertise: The Effects  of Expertise and Debiasing Methods on Predictions of Novice Performance|author=Pamela J. Hinds, Stanford  University|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A [[curse]] (from the Latin ''cursos'') in this case means a [[habit]] formed by practices that were once successful [[tactic (method)|tactic]]s that have become [[Social intuitionism|socially intuitive]] in reality are [[counterproductive norms]].

Effective teachers must predict the issues and misconceptions that people will face when [[learning]] a complex new [[skill]] or understanding an unfamiliar [[concept]]. This should also encompass the teachers’ recognizing their own or each other's [[bias blind spot]]s.

==History==
The difficulty experienced people may encounter is exemplified fictionally by [[Dr Watson]] in discourses with the [[insight]]ful detective [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160107-what-sherlock-holmes-tells-us-about-the-mind BBC Future:What Sherlock Holmes can teach us about the mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedy==
[[Steven Pinker]] a Canadian-born American cognitive scientist, psychologist,speaking at [[Harvard University]] tried to identify exactly what was wrong with so much academic English:&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/11/exorcising-the-curse-of-knowledge/ Harvard Gazette, 2012-11-08 Exorcising the curse of knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Abstract and concrete|abstract language]] unrelated to reality;
* [[Transitions (linguistics)|clumsy transitions]] between related topics;
* [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|inept interpretations]] of external sources;
* Using [[cliché]]s and [[catchphrase]]s whose true meaning is obscure;
* creating "[[Nominalization|zombie nouns]]", from verbs or adjectives (e.g. “verb+ization”);
* compulsive "[[Hedge (linguistics)|hedging]]" by use of expressions such as "somewhat", "comparatively", and "to a certain degree".

==Prevention==
[[Quality assurance]] (QA) is a way of circumventing the curse of experience by applying comprehensive [[quality management]] techniques.
===Professionals===
[[Professional]]s by definition get paid for technically well defined work so that [[quality control]] procedures may be required which encompass the processes employed, the training of the expert and the [[Action (philosophy)|ethos]] of the trade or profession of the expert. Some experts (lawyers, medical practitioners etc.) require a licence which may include a requirement to undertake ongoing [[professional development]] (i.e. obtain OPD credits issued by [[collegiate university|collegiate universities]] or [[professional association]]s – see also ''[[Safety#Normative_safety|normative safety]].''
===Academics===
[[Faculty (academic staff)|Academics]] are usually employed in [[research and development ]] activities that are less well understood than those of professionals, and therefore submit themselves to [[peer review]] assessment by other appropriately qualified individuals. See also ''[[Safety#Perceived_safety|perceived safety.]]''
===Amateurs===
Amateurs work for love of their craft and therefore the [[safety]] and reliability of an amateur intervention lacks any external reference and must therefore rely on the individual’s [[moral responsibility]].
* '''[[Bodging|Bodgers]]''' are very often either [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] or former professionals who are competent to [[Improvisation|improvise]] or  [[Innovation|innovate]] in a way that is ''[[Safety#Substantive_safety|substantially safe.]]''
*'''[[:Wikt:botch#Verb|Botshers]]''' or '''[[:Wikt:blunder|blunder]]ers''' are persons who are '''''not yet competent''''' and whose interventions may therefore  be [[hazard]]ous. Often people driven by economic reasons to try to copy professionals but who lack the essential technical understanding. For example a great many [[structure fire]]s are caused by [[electrical wiring]] modified [[Competence (human resources)|incompetently]] by [[household]]ers who are not trained [[electrician]]s.

'''Women in musicology''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women professors, scholars and researchers]] in [[postsecondary education]] [[musicology]] departments at [[postsecondary education]] institutions, including [[university|universities]], [[college]]s and [[Music conservatory|music conservatories]]. Traditionally, the vast majority of major [[musicology|musicologists]] and music historians have been men. Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reached the top ranks of the profession. [[Carolyn Abbate]] (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at [[Princeton University]]. She  has been described by the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' as "one of the world's most accomplished and admired music historians".&lt;ref name=HG&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/11/abbate-named-university-professor/ "Abbate named University Professor"], ''Harvard Gazette'', 20 November 2013. Accessed 10 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan McClary]] (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with the "[[New Musicology]]" who incorporates [[feminism|feminist]] music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from [[Harvard University]]. One of her best known works is ''Feminine Endings'' (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians. In the book, McClary suggests that the [[sonata form]] (used in symphonies and string quartets) may be a [[sexist]] or [[misogynist]]ic procedure that constructs of [[gender]] and sexual identity. McClary's ''Conventional Wisdom'' (2000) argues that the traditional musicological assumption of the existence of "purely musical" elements, divorced from culture and meaning, the social and the body, is a conceit used to veil the social and political imperatives of the worldview that produces the [[classical canon]] most prized by supposedly objective musicologists.

American musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is music composed by women so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"&gt;Citron, Marcia J. Gender and the Musical Canon. CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name="Citron, Marcia J 1993"/&gt;

==Ethnomusicologists==
[[File:Frances Densmore.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Frances Densmore]] (1867&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 1957) was an [[United States|American]] [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[ethnography|ethnographer]]  known for her studies of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[music]] and [[culture]].]]

[[Ethnomusicology|Ethnomusicologists]] study the many musics around the world that emphasize their cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire.
Ethnomusicology –&amp;nbsp;a term coined by [[Jaap Kunst]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ἔθνος (''ethnos'', "nation") and μουσική (''mousike'', "music")&amp;nbsp;– is often described as the [[anthropology]] or [[ethnography]] of music. Initially, ethnomusicology was almost exclusively oriented toward non-[[Western world|Western]] music, but now includes the study of Western music from anthropological, sociological and intercultural perspectives.

Notable ethnomusicologists include:

*[[Judith Becker]]
*[[Frances Densmore]]
*[[Ida Halpern]]
*[[Maud Karpeles]]

'''Young People's Trust for the Environment''' ('''YPTE''') is a British charity founded in 1982, to encourage young people's understanding of the environment. The charity's main goal is to give young people a real awareness of environmental issues&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robwilsonmp.com/news/rob-joins-dermot-o%E2%80%99leary-support-young-people%E2%80%99s-trust-environment Rob Wilson MP]&lt;/ref&gt; such as climate change, pollution, deforestation and endangered flora &amp; fauna. It also aims to provide views to take into account the realities of the modern world. Sustainable development and industry with less impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ypte.org.uk/content/free-school-talks/ YPTE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity==
YPTE offers free learning resources via their website to assist teachers in educating young people about the environment and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.populationmatters.org/resources/materials-schools/ Population Matters: School materials]&lt;/ref&gt;

YPTE provide free school talks to schools on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standrewsyetminster.org.uk/classes/activities/16.htm St Andrew's Church of England Primary School: What a fantastic 4th EcoDay]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trust has given various Parliamentary Receptions at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in London, providing the opportunity for [[Members of Parliament]] to meet young people involved in the trust's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://robflello.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/rob-joins-dermot-oleary-at-young-peoples-trust-for-the-environment-event/ Rob Flello MP: Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevemccabe-mp.org.uk/node/183 Steve McCabe MP: Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the trust launched the ‘Roots to Green Living’ campaign. The scheme provided eight schools in the Bristol/Bath and NE Somerset area with regular support from a YPTE Education Officer, who worked with them over the course of three years to develop environmental education opportunities within the school grounds and help to embed environmental learning into the schools’ curricula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidamess.co.uk/news/david-amess-mp-helps-launch-new-campaign-young-peoples-trust-environment David Amess MP: News (1 November, 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The YPTE run various awards&lt;ref&gt;[http://ypte.org.uk/content/awards YPTE: Awards]&lt;/ref&gt; for schools to enter and compete for prizes.
