Abjjad recommends a variety of 10 books each week and a weekly article written by one of the members.&lt;ref name="test4" /&gt; It also allows members to follow each other, or follow authors or books to receive notifications once a new review has been added about the books or new information was added in the writer page.&lt;ref name="test3" /&gt;

Abjjad is linked to [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] which provides Abjjad with an extensive database of English books making it easy for members to find English books. In addition, it includes more than 30 thousand Arabic books.

Members of Abjjad call themselves "Abjjadyeen" which created a brand for the website and helped in spreading it around the Middle East. The website is featured with the "Abjadyya" where members can use to filter what to appear on their timelines from members' status, book reviews or book ratings. The "Abjadyya" is a status a member can write and share with his followers where they can like and comment on it. Members of the website tend to use the word "Abjadyya" to refer to other members statuses.

'''Achilles on Skyros''' is an episode in the myth of [[Achilles]], a Greek hero of the [[Trojan War]]. Not existing in [[Homer]]'s [[epic poem]] ''[[Iliad]]'', the episode is written down in detail in some later versions of the story, particularly the ''[[Achilleid]]'' by the Roman poet [[Statius]]. The story of how Achilles disguised himself as a girl at the court of the king of [[Skyros]], fell in love with one of the princesses, and married her before leaving for Troy, became a popular topic in arts and literature from [[Classical antiquity|Classical times]] until the middle of the 20th century. The carnavalesque disguises and gender transpositions at the heart of the story were particularly popular in opera, with over 30 different operas on the theme between 1641 and 1857.

==Story==
[[File:Hanbury Hall staircase - finding of Achilles.JPG|left|thumb|[[Odysseus]] finds [[Achilles]] among the daughters of Lycomedes. This [[mural]] painting by [[James Thornhill]] commands the main staircase at Hanbury Hall, Worcestershire.]]

The core myth of Achilles on Skyros as presented in ancient sources was thus. Rather than allow her son Achilles to die at Troy as prophesied, the nymph [[Thetis]] sent him to live at the court of [[Lycomedes]], king of [[Skyros]], disguised as another daughter of the king or as a lady-in-waiting, under the name Pyrrha "the red-haired", Issa, or Kerkysera. There Achilles had an affair with [[Deidamia (mythology)|Deidamia]], one of the daughters of Lycomedes, and they had one or two sons, [[Neoptolemus]] and Oneiros.&lt;ref&gt;Oneiros is only mentioned by [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] (New History Book 3, summarized in [[Photius]], ''Bibliotheca'', 190); generally, all sources speak of one son, Neoptolemus&lt;/ref&gt; Since another prophecy suggested that the Trojan War would not be won without Achilles, [[Odysseus]] and several other [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaean]] leaders went to Skyros to find him. Odysseus discovered Achilles by offering gifts, adornments and musical instruments as well as weapons, to the king's daughters, and then having his companions imitate the noises of an enemy's attack on the island (most notably, making a blast of a trumpet heard), which prompted Achilles to reveal himself by picking a weapon to fight back, and together they departed for the Trojan War. In some versions, Deidamia dressed as a man followed him.&lt;ref name=Hagedorn&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagedorn|first=Suzanne C.|title=Abandoned Women: Rewriting the Classics in Dante, Boccaccio, and Chaucer|year=2003|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472113491|pages=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaMd1aVMRG4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp; |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Armas&gt;{{cite book|last=De Armas|first=Frederick Alfred|title=A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia|year=1998|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838753767|pages=247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0r6nQYoPCOQC&amp;pg=PA116&amp; |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most detailed and elaborate version is that found in the Roman poem ''Achilleid''.&lt;ref&gt;Book 1, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; In the poem, Thetis resolves to hide Achilles away at the court of Lycomedes. Achilles is quite reluctant, but eventually consents, attracted by the beauty of the king's most fair daughter, Deidamia. Thetis has him dressed up as a maiden and introduces him to Lycomedes as her daughter who would have had an [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like upbringing and now needed to learn feminine ways by living among ordinary girls of her age, so as to prepare for a normal marriage in the future; Lycomedes agrees to take care of the "girl" and his unsuspecting daughters accept Achilles into their company as another fellow maiden. After some time he develops a particularly close friendship with Deidamia and it becomes increasingly difficult for him to hide his romantic and sexual interest in her. Eventually, at a nighttime festival in honor of [[Dionysus]] where men are normally not allowed, Achilles gives way to his manly desires and forces Deidamia to have sex with him. Afterwards, trying to console her, he discloses his true name and origin; despite being scared by what has happened, Deidamia doesn't want Achilles to suffer punishment from her father and resolves to keep the incident and his identity, as well as the fact that she has conceived a child, a secret. When Odysseus and his comrades arrive at Scyros, Achilles, long annoyed by his female disguise, is about to reveal himself but Deidamia holds him back. Odysseus then performs the trick with the gifts and the trumpet and thereby reveals the secret. Achilles hears Deidamia cry and confesses to Lycomedes that they have become lovers and have had a child together. As the Achaeans are about to sail off to the war, Deidamia is heartbroken over the impending loss of Achilles and asks if she could go with him, but that seems impossible; she then implores him to keep their son in his thoughts, and to never have children with other women. Achilles swears to one day return to Deidamia, but the readers are apparently supposed to be aware that he is going to die at Troy.

This part of the Trojan War myths has been the subject of many works of art throughout the centuries. Taken from the point of view of Achilles, Deidamia, or a neutral observer, a number of themes have received attention in the later artwork and stories, ranging from the comical aspects of crossdressing and the misunderstandings it involves, over gender differences, heroism, homosexual and heterosexual love, and initiation rites, to rape, incest, and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Armas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Callen King|first=Catherine|title=Subversive Subjects: Reading Marguerite Yourcenar|year=2004|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838639924|pages=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXjn7Yz756EC&amp;pg=PA39 |accessdate=9 October 2012|chapter=Achilles on the Field of Sexual Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most later versions go essentially back to the 1st century CE version of [[Statius]], the story of Achilles on Skyros was known earlier than this. There are references to artworks by [[Polygnotus]] and [[Athenion of Maroneia]], and a now lost 5th century BCE play by [[Euripides]].&lt;ref name=Shecktor&gt;{{cite book|last=Shecktor|first=Nina Maria|title=The Achillean Hero in the Plays of Tirso De Molina|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820433103|pages=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C61PS1YuTtIC&amp;pg=PA42 |accessdate=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest and best studied [[Renaissance]] versions of the story was [[Tirso de Molina]]'s 1612 play ''El Aquiles''.&lt;ref name=Armas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shecktor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Puccio&gt;{{cite book|last=DiPuccio|first=Denise M.|title=Communicating Myths of the Golden Age Comedia|year=1998|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838753729|pages=236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=34TXDx6cBTIC&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=10 October 2012|chapter=''El Aquiles'' and the Making of a Hero}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a number of other Spanish plays on the same topic. One of its foci was the change in Achilles from fleeing war to being a war hero. This was emphasized by the many changes and transformations used in the play. But the more typical themes of gender confusion and homosexual love are also apparent, and strengthened by the indication that the role of Achilles should be played by a woman.&lt;ref name=Puccio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stroud|first=Matthew D.|title=Plot Twists and Critical Turns: Queer Approaches to Early Modern Spanish Theater|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|isbn=9780838756690|pages=267|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_fLVbXfmZwC&amp;pg=PA117 |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has often been used as the theme for an opera or ballet, with the libretto by [[Metastasio]] as the most popular. The first opera based on this story seems to have been ''[[La finta pazza]]'' by [[Francesco Sacrati]], with a libretto by [[Giulio Strozzi]]. It was the first and probably the most popular opera of the seventeenth century. It was first performed at the inauguration in 1641 of the [[Teatro Novissimo]] in [[Venice]], the first time ever a building was created specifically to perform operas. [[Anna Renzi]] was the main singer. The production then was performed many times all over Italy and abroad, including a 1645 performance in Paris, which was the second time ever that an opera was staged in France.&lt;ref name=Transvestite/&gt;

The Metastasio libretto was first used for an opera in 1736 by [[Antonio Caldara]], at the occasion of the marriage of [[Maria Theresa]] with the future Holy Roman Emperor, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]. Due to the short notice given for the marriage, the libretto was finished after only 18 days, compared to the three months Metastasio usually needed. Despite this, it enjoyed a reasonable success and was used for decades, set to music by at least 29 composers. Further version include the [[Achille in Sciro|1737 opera]] by [[Domenico Sarro]], used for the inauguration of the [[Teatro di San Carlo]], the opera house of [[Naples]], and starring [[Vittoria Tesi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Menchelli-Buttini|first=Francesca|title=Italian Opera in Central Europe, Volume 1|year=2006|publisher=BWV Verlag|isbn=9783830503811|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZhO1sJX9EgC&amp;pg=PA252 |editor=Melania Bucciarelli, Norbert Dubowy and Reinhard Strohm|accessdate=4 October 2012|pages=253–274|chapter=Achille in Sciro: Drama and Ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1dCAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22+Achille+in+Sciro%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6towQ86-fk&amp;sig=wLVM4MbsHxRewnzoQFCYashBQGw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZDttUISiGMvK0AXGkYDoDw&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA Metastasio's libretto] for a 1774 performance, on Google Books&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the theme was due to a number of factors, but a major part was the aspect of disguises and crossdressing, with Achilles dressed as a girl and his role often performed by women. Some librettists, especially the earlier ones like [[Giulio Strozzi]], [[Carlo Capece]] and [[Ippolito Bentivoglio]] approached this from a [[carnivalesque]] point of view, emphasizing the comedy, the masquerade and the (homo-)erotic aspects of it. Others like Metastasio or [[Paolo Rolli]] more focused on the failed struggle to conceal the masculinity of the archetypical hero Achilles, and how the inherent nature of the person is stronger than the [[Nature versus nurture|nurture]] he receives.&lt;ref name=Transvestite&gt;{{cite book|last=Heslin|first=P.

Well known composers writing an opera on this theme include [[Domenico Scarlatti]] with his 1712 ''Tetide in Sciro'', [[John Gay]]'s 1733 ''Achilles'', and [[Georg Friedrich Händel]] in 1741 with ''[[Deidamia (opera)|Deidamia]].&lt;ref name=Transvestite/&gt;

'''American Impressionism''' was a style of painting related to European [[Impressionism]] and practiced by American artists in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. American Impressionism is a style of painting characterized by loose brushwork and vivid colors. The style often depicted landscapes mixed with scenes of upper-class domestic life.

==An emerging artistic style from Paris==
[[File:Theodore Robinson - Low Tide, Riverside Yacht Club (1894).jpg|thumb|left|[[Theodore Robinson]], ''Low Tide [[Riverside Yacht Club]],'' (1894), Collection of Margaret and Raymond Horowitz]]
[[Impressionism]] emerged as an artistic style in [[France]] in the 1860s. Major exhibitions of French impressionist works in Boston and New York in the 1880s introduced the style to the American public. Some of the first American artists to paint in an impressionistic mode, such as [[Theodore Robinson]] and [[Mary Cassatt]], did so in the late 1880s after visiting France and meeting with artists such as [[Claude Monet]]. Others, such as [[Childe Hassam]], took notice of the increasing numbers of French impressionist works at American exhibitions.

==Impressionism in The Industrial Age==
As railroads, automobiles, and other new technology emerged, American impressionists often painted vast landscapes and small towns in an effort to return to nature. Before the invention of collapsible paint tubes artists were often confined to using subjects in their studios or painting from memory. With the invention of paint tubes in 1841, artists could transport their paint and easily paint in nature.

==Trailblazers from the turn of the 20th century==
From the 1890s through the 1910s, American impressionism flourished in [[art colony|art colonies]]—loosely affiliated groups of artists who lived and worked together and shared a common aesthetic vision. Art colonies tended to form in small towns that provided affordable living, abundant scenery for painting, and relatively easy access to large cities where artists could sell their work. Some of the most important American impressionist artists gathered at [[Cos Cob Art Colony|Cos Cob]] and [[Old Lyme, Connecticut]], both on [[Long Island Sound]]; [[New Hope, Pennsylvania]], on the Delaware River; and [[Brown County, Indiana]]. American impressionist artists also thrived in California at [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] and [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]]; in New York on eastern [[Long Island]] at Shinnecock, largely due to the influence of [[William Merritt Chase]]; and in Boston where [[Edmund Charles Tarbell]] and [[Frank Weston Benson]] became important practitioners of the impressionist style.

==Jazz Age decline==
Some American art colonies remained vibrant centers of impressionist art into the 1920s. However, impressionism in America lost its cutting-edge status in 1913 when a historic exhibition of modern art took place at the 69th Regiment Armory building in New York City. The “[[Armory Show]]”, as it came to be called, heralded a new painting style regarded as more in touch with the increasingly fast-paced and chaotic world, especially with the outbreak of [[World War I]], The [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]].

==Characteristics of American Impressionism==
Unlike early Renaissance painters, American Impressionists favored asymmetrical composition, cropped figures, and plunging perspectives in their works in order to create a more "impressionist" version of the subject. In addition, American impressionists used pure color straight from the tubes to make the works more vibrant, used broken brushstrokes, and practiced "impasto"- a style of painting characterized by thick raised strokes. 
European impressionists painted tranquil scenes of landscapes or the lower and middle classes. American impressionists focused on landscapes like the European impressionists, but unlike their European counterparts, American impressionists painted scenes that depicted the upper class in an effort to show off America's economic prowess.

The '''Arts District''' is an area containing many of [[Oklahoma City]]'s best attractions and venues. Many of the buildings in the district are known for urban art deco architecture and charm.

Located at the near western portion of downtown OKC just outside the [[skyscrapers]] of the Central Business District, the Arts District includes World Class attractions such as the [[Myriad Botanical Gardens|Myriad Gardens]], the [[Civic Center Music Hall]], [[Stage Centre for the Performing Arts]], the [[Ronald J. Norick Downtown Library]], the [[Oklahoma City Municipal Building]], the [[Oklahoma City Museum of Art]], and the [[Oklahoma City National Memorial]].

The district is currently experiencing a building boom (along with the rest of downtown), as announcements for new housing and retail projects frequent the Oklahoma City media circles.

Due west of the Arts District is the [[Film Exchange District]] and [[Westown Oklahoma City|WesTown]], soon to experience a boom of their own as the renaissance of downtown [[Oklahoma City]] continues to move west.

'''''Bug-a-Booo''''' ("Turma do Penadinho") is a Brazilian comic strip, created in 1963 and part of the [[Monica's Gang]] series. All of the characters are [[monsters]] or other [[supernatural]] creatures, none of them being a human being. The main location for their stories is a [[cemetery]]. However, their stories are not intended to be [[Horror fiction|scary]], actually they are sometimes classified as “Terrir”, which is a [[Portmanteau]]&lt;ref name="new terror"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Histórias de Terror|date=October 2012|publisher=[[Editora Panini]]|location=São Paulo|pages=133–143|language=Portuguese|type=Comics|chapter=Terror Moderninho}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] words "Terror" ''([[Horror fiction|horror]])'' and "Rir" ''(to laugh)''. On some of their stories, they have to deal with the fact that vampires, ghosts, zombies and mummies are no longer appreciated as characters of horror films. People instead are opting for assassins, psychopaths, serial killers, etc.&lt;ref name="new terror"/&gt;

== Characters ==
* '''''Bug-a-Booo''''' (''Penadinho'') – Bug-a-Booo is the main character, a short ghost. He is actually invisible, but wears a white sheet so he can be seen. In one strip, it is stated that he was engaged to a woman named Ernestina and was about to open a factory of disposable socks for people suffering from [[foot odor]] before he died.&lt;ref name="Bug's past"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Almanacão da Turma da Mônica|year=2003|publisher=[[Editora Globo]]|location=São Paulo|language=Portuguese|chapter=Que pena do Penadinho!}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unnamed friend of his reveals while regretting Bug's death in his [[death anniversary]] at his grave that he ended up both marrying Ernestina and opening the factory, though the factory closed three months later and Ernestina became obese.&lt;ref name="Bug's past"/&gt;
* '''''Lady MacDeath''''' (''Dona Morte'') – Lady MacDeath is a [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], the personification of Death who is responsible of going after all people whose time to die has come, although unlike a typical Grim Reaper, sometimes her body is not pictured as made of bones. She uses her [[sickle]] to kill people, by hitting them in the head, and then she takes their souls to the [[purgatory]], for them to be judged and sent whether to [[hell]] or [[heaven]] (sometimes after much bureaucracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Cebolinha|year=2002|publisher=[[Editora Globo]]|location=São Paulo|pages=36–43|language=Portuguese|chapter=Antes da Hora}}&lt;/ref&gt;). She always carries a list with the name of the people she must kill on the day. Most of her stories feature a pursuit, sometimes punctuated with struggles faced every day by normal people. Maurico says that the purpose of creating her is "taking death less seriously, while it doesn't come to us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monica.com.br/mauricio/cronicas/cron285.htm|title=Como a Morte Nasceu|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|date=9 November 2004|publisher=Monica's Gang official website|language=Portuguese|accessdate=27 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107001122/http://www.monica.com.br/mauricio/cronicas/cron285.htm|archivedate=7 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Vic Vampire''''' (''Zé Vampir'', full name '''José Morcego (''Bat'') Vampiro'''&lt;ref name="vic's past"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Histórias de Terror|date=October 2012|publisher=[[Editora Panini]]|location=São Paulo|pages=46–50|language=Portuguese|type=Comics|chapter=Entrevista com o Vampiro}}&lt;/ref&gt;) – Vic is a yellow-skinned [[vampire]], and therefore, he is able to turn himself into a [[bat]]. He feeds on [[blood]] and fears [[Christian cross|crosses]] (even though he lives in a cemetery full of them), [[sunlight]], [[garlic]] and [[holy water]]. In one strip, it is revealed that he was born 300 years ago in the fictional city of Transilvânia do Sul (South Transylvania), near [[Varginha]]&lt;ref name="vic's past"/&gt; and turned into a vampire at infancy after one of them bit his dog, which in turn bit him and his parents.&lt;ref name="vic's past"/&gt; Vic has the power to turn other people vampires with a bite on their necks.&lt;ref name="vic's past"/&gt;
* '''''Moe the Mummy''''' (''Muminho'') – Moe is a mummy of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] ancestry. When the swabs which cover his bodies are taken out, Moe appears either invisible, as if the swabs were covering nothing,&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Mônica - Romance|year=2008|publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=São Paulo|pages=132–135|edition=6th|language=Portuguese|chapter=Namoro Seguro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARN"&gt;{{cite book|last=de Sousa|first=Mauricio|title=Mônica - Festas|year=2005|publisher=[[Editora Globo]]|location=São Paulo|pages=38–40|edition=47th|language=Portuguese|chapter=A Roupa Nova}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a dry corpse.
* '''''Frank''''' – A reference to [[Frankenstein]], Frank is a green construct with a very weak brain, so that the virtue he least holds is intelligence.
* '''''Wolfgang''''' (''Lobi'') – A charming [[werewolf]]. While being able to talk, think and walk by two feet, he must live side-to-side with his [[canidae]] instincts, like chasing cats, urinating on lamp posts and trees, and howling to the moon. He hasn't an "official" human from, thus this form may change its personality dramatically from story to story. He has fangs, claws and yellow eyes.
* '''''Skully''''' (''Cranicola'') – Skully is single [[human skull|skull]], which rests all day on top of a stone. He cannot walk nor move (although in some stories he is seen jumping around), but on the other hand, he provides fine conversations to whoever speaks to him.
* '''''Al Ashmore''''' (''Zé Cremadinho'') – Al Ashmore is nothing but the remains of someone who's been [[Cremation|cremated]]. However, he is still able to talk, and jumps around just like Skully does sometimes. In most of his appearances, he is confused with dust and is attacked by [[broomsticks]] and [[vacuum cleaners]].
* '''''Sid Skully''''' (''Zé Caveirinha'') – A full [[skeleton]]. He is clumsy and is always losing his bones.
* '''''Sally Soul''''' (''Alminha'') – Sally is Bug's girlfriend, although they are constantly seen having arguments with each other. Like Bug, she is actually an invisible ghost who wears a white sheet.
* '''''Little Boy Boo''''' (''Pixuquinha'') - The Bug's nephew. He is a child ghost.
* '''''Espírito de Porco''''' - In [[Brazil]], pranksters are sometimes called "espíritos de porco" (lit. "pig spirit"). Espírito de Porco is thus a pig-nosed ghost who likes pulling irritating pranks on the other residents of the cemetery.

'''''Captain Lord George Graham in his Cabin''''' is a 1745 [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting by the English artist [[William Hogarth]]. A conversational picture, it shows Captain [[Lord George Graham]], of the [[Royal Navy]], in the cabin of his ship with several people.

The painting was probably commissioned by Graham to commemorate a naval battle he had fought recently. While commanding a 24-gun [[sixth rate]], he had been one of three British ships to attack a squadron of three powerful French [[privateer]]s and their [[prize warfare|prizes]]. The British were successful in their engagement, capturing all of the prizes, and all but one of the privateers. Lauded for his achievements, Graham was given another, larger, ship to command. The painting is probably set aboard this new command, the 60-gun {{HMS|Nottingham|1703|6}}, and shows Graham relaxing in the [[cabin (ship)|great cabin]] before a meal, smoking a pipe. With him are the ship's chaplain and clerk, who sing and listen to music played by a black servant. A steward brings a roast duck to the table. Two dogs are also present in the scene, one joins in the singing, the other wears a wig and reads a sheet of music.

The scene contains elements of satire and symbolism, in common with Hogarth's other works. The relaxed scene contrasts the tension of the naval battle it commemorates, with elements of humour including the officious pose and behaviour of one of the dogs, who apes Graham's official position. The steward looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, while obliviously tipping gravy down the chaplain's back. The positioning and depiction of Graham and the black servant invite comparisons, with Hogarth's presentation of black subjects in paintings being studied by later academics. Hogarth drew from his own experience in group portraits, and was probably influenced by an earlier cabin work by [[Bartolomeo Nazari]]. Graham's enjoyment of the painting was short-lived, he died in 1747. His family kept the portrait in their collections until 1932, when it was sold to [[Sir James Caird, 1st Baronet|Sir James Caird]], who subsequently donated it to the [[National Maritime Museum]], where it remains.

==Background==
Lord George Graham was a younger son of [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose]], and had entered the [[Royal Navy]] at a young age.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Laughton|chapter=Graham, James (d.1742)|chapterurl=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Graham,_James_%28d.1742%29_%28DNB00%29|title=Dictionary of National Biography|page=323|volume=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Sedgwick|chapter=Graham, Lord George (1715–47)|title=The History of Parliament|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/graham-lord-george-1715-47}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served with some distinction during the wars of the early eighteenth century, and also entered politics, sitting as member of parliament through his father's interest. He was appointed to command the 24-gun {{HMS|Bridgewater|1744|6}} in 1745 and cruised in the [[English Channel]].&lt;ref name="Winfield245"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winfield |title=[[British Warships in the Age of Sail]]|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cruising in the Channel off [[Ostend]] on 2 July, in company with the 24-gun {{HMS|Sheerness|1743|6}} under Captain William Gordon, and the armed vessel ''Ursula'' under Lieutenant Fergusson, Graham came across three large [[privateer]]s from [[Dunkirk]], sailing in company with their captured [[prize warfare|prize vessels]].&lt;ref name="BN24"/&gt; The French privateers were the 28-gun ''Royal'', 26-gun ''Duchesse de Penthierre'', and a 12-gun [[dogger (boat)|dogger]].&lt;ref name="Winfield245"/&gt; They had captured seven prizes, and were taking them into Dunkirk. The British force attacked them early in the morning of 3 July. After a fierce fight lasting until 4.am, four of the prizes surrendered to the ''Sheerness'', the ''Royal'' and ''Duchesse de Penthierre'' [[striking the colors|struck their colours]] to the ''Bridgewater'', and the ''Ursula'' captured the remaining three prizes. The dogger managed to escape.&lt;ref name="BN24"&gt;{{cite book |last=Charnock|title=Biographia Navalis|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin - detail.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The subject of the portrait, Captain [[Lord George Graham]], leans against the table, holding a pipe]]
For his success in the engagement, Graham was commended to the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford]], and was given command of a larger ship, the 60-gun {{HMS|Nottingham|1703|6}}.&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BN24"/&gt; He probably commissioned a portrait from Hogarth at about this time, and the resulting painting is believed to be set aboard Graham's new command, which in late 1745 was on [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]] station.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt;

==Positioning==
[[File:William Hogarth 006.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A 1745 self-portrait by Hogarth, including his pug dog [[Trump (dog)|Trump]], who represents his master in the portrait]]
Graham is seated to the right of the picture, on the left of the table that divides the picture. He is seen in full length, facing forwards though looking to the side, while smoking a long pipe. Standing to Graham's right, his lower half obscured by the table cloth, a man holds a sheet of music and is in the act of singing. The third member of the dining party is seated on the left of the painting, and like Graham is visible in full length. [[Ronald Paulson]] identifies them as the ship's clerk and chaplain.&lt;ref name="HA176"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paulson|title=Hogarth: High Art and Low 1732–1750|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music the men are listening or singing along to is provided by a black manservant, standing on the right of the painting and playing a [[pipe and tabor]]. A steward stands opposite him on the left of the painting, framing the composition. The steward holds a plate of roast duck, but looks out of the painting towards the viewer with a smile, while gravy drips from the plate down the back of the chaplain's coat.&lt;ref name="HA177"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paulson|title=Hogarth: High Art and Low 1732–1750|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining members of the portrait are two dogs. One is Graham's own, sitting at the chaplain's feet and apparently joining in the singing. The other, sat on his haunches on a chair on the right of the painting, is Hogarth's own [[pug]], [[Trump (dog)|Trump]]. Trump, his tongue lolling out and wearing Graham's wig, holds a scroll and appears to read from his own sheet of music, balanced against a wine glass in front of him.&lt;ref name="HA177"/&gt;

==Clothing==
The men are well dressed, Graham smokes a pipe while wearing a fur-lined red velvet cape and a red velvet cap which is slightly askew.&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HA177"/&gt; The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings and slippers.&lt;ref name="nmm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/14194.html|title=Captain Lord George Graham, 1715–47, in his Cabin|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaplain wears a black coat with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt; The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt; The colours of the painting are mostly of cool greys, blues and reds, with the brown of some of the clothes and the wooden [[pilaster]] panelling, and the lighter blue through the window on the left of the painting.&lt;ref name="HA177"/&gt;

==Imagery and symbolism==
[[File:Captain Lord George Graham, 1715-47, in his Cabin - servant.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The black servant on the right of the painting plays a [[pipe and tabor]]. Below, Hogarth's pug dog [[Trump (dog)|Trump]]balances on a chair while wearing Graham's wig.]]
Hogarth included numerous elements in the painting. The scene is probably the great cabin of Graham's latest command, and the sails of ships are visible through the line of windows on the left of the painting.&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt; The furniture and objects are luxurious and the room is richly panelled and decorated.&lt;ref name="NGE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans|title=Windsor-Chair Making in America|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chaplain holds a ledger and at his feet is a large [[Chinese ceramics|famille-rose]] [[punch bowl]], the punch bowl being an invitation to the viewer to join the levity at the table.&lt;ref name="EF"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gollannek|title=Empire Follows Art|pages=161–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is separated from Graham across the table by a salt-cellar, possibly symbolising their social difference.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt; His presence at the captain's table for this informal occasion nevertheless indicates that he is a privileged member of Graham's entourage.&lt;ref name="Blake"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blake|title=Evangelicals in the Royal Navy, 1775–1815|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clerk, standing in the centre of the portrait and uniting the two-halves, holds the music he is singing from, possibly entitled 'Farewell my Judy'. Jeremy Barlow speculates that this might be a sentimental love song.&lt;ref name="JB135"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barlow|title=The Enraged Musician|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two servants frame the picture, the black servant playing a [[pipe and tabor]]. The combination of these musical instruments had a popular accompaniment to dancing for several centuries, but was in decline in England by the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name="JB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barlow|title=The Enraged Musician|pages=242–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow considers Hogarth's representation of the tabor pipe a poor one, arguing that it is too short and has too many holes to be the usual three-holed tabor pipe, the boy holds it too far up its length and does not cover all the holes. Barlow points out that Hogarth may have intended the instrument to be a [[flabiol]] instead.&lt;ref name="JB"/&gt; He also notes that the lively music the instruments would have produced would be unlikely to complement a sentimental ballad that the clerk appears to be singing, and instead suggests the painting combines and conflates a number of typical activities in the cabin into one scene.&lt;ref name="JB35"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barlow|title=The Enraged Musician|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dogs join the people, their inclusion with the servants in the portrait invites commentary on Graham's circle. Trump's officious pose and lolling tongue, while wearing Graham's wig and brandishing the scroll of paper, makes light of the formality of Graham's position. Trump represents Hogarth in the painting, while his pose with the scroll, as used by musical conductors of the time, suggest that he may be the humorous conductor for the music and singing taking place.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JB135"/&gt; The steward stands at the left of the painting under a hanging crown compass, and carelessly drips gravy down the chaplain's neck, adding a final element of farce to the setting. In the relaxed and informal setting of the cabin, adding touches of humour and foolishness, Hogarth provides a contrast with the dangers of the pitched battle that the painting commemorates.&lt;ref name="EF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HA177"/&gt;

The black servant in the painting reveals Hogarth's careful study of black and white forms. His positioning, clothes and stance echoes Graham's with his pipe, but they face different directions so as to present different profiles.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DD"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dabydeen|title=Hogarth's Blacks|pages=44–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red of Graham's cape connects with the colour of the servant's neckcloth, while their similar caps, coats and waistcoats heighten the sense of connection, with the servant given equally colourful and variegated clothing.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt; The facial features and textures are similar, showing off their youthfulness, while Graham's fair skin and the servant's dark skin complements and contrasts each other. Hogarth has also varied the appearance of the dark skin to show that the colour is not uniform, but changes in the light.&lt;ref name="DD"/&gt; Art historian David Bindman argued that Hogarth's representation of the servant avoided the traditional stereotypes of black people in art.&lt;ref name="HO"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner|chapter=Hogarth and the Other|pages=34–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:Gustavus Hamilton, 1710-46, 2nd Viscount Boyne, and Friends in a Ship's Cabin.jpg|thumb|right|''Gustavus Hamilton, 2nd Viscount Boyne, and Friends in a Ship's Cabin'', 1731-2, by [[Bartolomeo Nazari]]. [[Gustavus Hamilton, 2nd Viscount Boyne|Lord Boyne]] is depicted on board a ship while making a [[Grand Tour]], accompanied by [[Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer|Sir Francis Dashwood]], [[Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle]] and [[Charles Sackville, 2nd Duke of Dorset|Lord Middlesex]]. The piece probably influenced Hogarth's work.]]
It is unknown whether the idea for the setting came from Graham or Hogarth, though Hogarth had already produced a similarly composed conversational piece for [[John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey]], entitled ''Lord Hervey and His Friends''.&lt;ref name="HA177"/&gt; Hogarth reworked the concept for a naval setting, though he probably also drew inspiration from a 1732 painting by [[Bartolomeo Nazari]]. Nazari produced a similar cabin scene showing [[Gustavus Hamilton, 2nd Viscount Boyne|Lord Boyne]] and his companions during a voyage to [[Lisbon]] from [[Venice]]. A number of elements, such as the hanging compass, punch bowl, and the presence of animals, were included in Hogarth's work. Nazari's work had been popular, resulting in a large number of copies, and Hogarth knew Boyne, having painted his portrait.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt;

==Ownership==
Graham did not enjoy his portrait for long, dying on 2 January 1747.&lt;ref name="HP"/&gt; The painting remained in the collections of the [[Duke of Montrose|Dukes of Montrose]] and was exhibited on a number of occasions; at [[Glasgow]] in 1888, the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in 1891 and at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manson, Leighton and Lowe|title=Hogarth|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased by [[Sir James Caird, 1st Baronet|Sir James Caird]] in 1932, and was a particular favourite of his.&lt;ref name="SS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Littlewood and Butler|title=Of Ships and Stars|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later presented to the [[National Maritime Museum]], where it remains today.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt; Cabin scenes are rare in oil painting, and the museum considers this to be the most famous example in British art.&lt;ref name="nmm"/&gt;

'''Cleanth Brooks''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|iː|æ|n|θ}} {{respell|KLEE|anth}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sos.mo.gov/wolfner/SayHow/?id=b Wolfner Library]&lt;/ref&gt; October 16, 1906 – May 10, 1994) was an American literary critic and professor. He is best known for his contributions to [[New Criticism]] in the mid-20th century and for revolutionizing the teaching of poetry in American higher education. His best-known works, ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry]]'' (1947) and ''Modern Poetry and the Tradition'' (1939), argue for the centrality of [[ambiguity]] and [[paradox]] as a way of understanding poetry. With his writing, Brooks helped to formulate [[formalism (literature)|formalist criticism]], emphasizing "the interior life of a poem" (Leitch 2001) and codifying the principles of close reading.

Brooks was also the preeminent critic of [[Southern literature]], writing classic texts on [[William Faulkner]], and co-founder of the influential journal ''[[The Southern Review]]'' (Leitch 2001) with [[Robert Penn Warren]].

==Biographical information==

===The early years===
On October 16, 1906, in [[Murray, Kentucky]], Brooks was born to a [[Methodist]] minister, the [[Reverend]] Cleanth Brooks, Sr., and Bessie Lee Witherspoon Brooks (Leitch 2001). He was one of three children: Cleanth and William, natural born sons, and Murray Brooks, actually born Hewitt Witherspoon, whom Bessie Lee Witherspoon kidnapped from her brother Forrest Bedford Witherspoon as a young baby after the natural mother had died. She later was able to change his name to Murray Brooks and continued to raise him as her own, causing quite a rift in her own family and alienating herself from Cleanth and William. Cleanth mentioned on more than one occasion that she so doted on Murray (Hewitt) that she no longer had a relationship with Cleanth and William. Attending McTyeire School, a private academy, he received a classical education and went on to study at [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1928 (Leitch 2001). In 1928, Brooks received his [[M.A.]] from [[Tulane University]] and went on to study at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], as a [[Rhodes Scholar]]. He received his B.A. (first class) in 1931 and his [[B.Litt.]] the following year. Brooks then returned to the United States and from 1932 to 1947 was a professor of English at [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]] (Singh 1991). In 1934, he married Edith Amy Blanchord.

===The Vanderbilt years===
During his studies at Vanderbilt, he met literary critics and future collaborators [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Andrew Nelson Lytle|Andrew Lytle]], and [[Donald Davidson (poet)|Donald Davidson]] (Singh 1991). Studying with Ransom and Warren, Brooks became involved in two significant literary movements: the [[Southern Agrarians]] and the [[Fugitives (poets)|Fugitives]] (Singh 1991). Brooks admitted to reading the Southern Agrarian [[manifesto]], ''I'll Take My Stand'' (1930) "over and over" (qtd. in Leitch 2001). While he never argued for the movement's conservative Southern traditions, he "learned a great deal" (qtd. in Leitch 2001) and found the Agrarian position valuable and "unobjectionable" (qtd. in Leitch 2001): "They asked that we consider what the good life is or ought to be" (qtd. in Leitch 2001).

The Fugitive Movement similarly influenced Brooks' approach to criticism. The Fugitives, a group of Southern poets consisting of such influential writers as [[John Crowe Ransom]], [[Allen Tate]], Donald Davidson, and [[Robert Penn Warren]], met Saturday evenings to read and discuss poetry written by members of the group (Singh 1991). The discussion was based on intensive readings and included considerations of a poem's form, structure, meter, rhyme scheme, and imagery (Singh 1991). This close reading formed the foundation on which the New Critical movement was based and helped shape Brooks' approach to criticism (Singh 1991).

===Academic life and work===
While attending the [[Oxford University|University of Oxford]], Brooks continued his friendship with fellow Vanderbilt graduate and Rhodes Scholar, Robert Penn Warren (Leitch 2001). In 1934, Warren joined the English department at Louisiana State, leading Brooks and Warren to collaborate on many works of criticism and [[pedagogy]]. In 1935, Brooks and Warren founded ''The Southern Review''. Until 1942, they co-edited the journal, publishing works by many influential authors, including [[Eudora Welty]], [[Kenneth Burke]], and [[Ford Madox Ford]]. The journal was known for its criticism and creative writing, marking it as one of the leading journals of the time (Leitch 2001).

In addition, Brooks's and Warren's collaboration led to innovations in the teaching of poetry and literature. At [[Louisiana State University]], prompted by their students' inability to interpret poetry, the two put together a booklet that modeled close reading through examples (Leitch 2001). The booklet was a success and laid the foundation for a number of best-selling textbooks: ''An Approach to Literature'' (1936), ''[[Understanding Poetry]]'' (1938), ''Understanding Fiction'' (1943), ''Modern Rhetoric'' (1949), and, in collaboration with Robert Heilman, ''Understanding Drama'' (1945). Brooks' two most influential works also came out of the success of the booklet: ''Modern Poetry and the Tradition'' (1939) and ''[[The Well Wrought Urn: Studies in the Structure of Poetry]]'' (1947) (Leitch 2001).

From 1941 to 1975, Brooks held many academic positions and received a number of distinguished fellowships and honorary doctorates. In 1941, he worked as a visiting professor at the [[University of Texas, Austin]]. From 1947 to 1975, he was an English professor at [[Yale University]], where he held the position of Gray Professor of Rhetoric and Gray Professor of Rhetoric Emeritus from 1960 until his retirement, except 1964 to 1966 (Singh 1991). His [[tenure]] at Yale was marked by ongoing research into Southern literature, which resulted in the publication of Brooks' studies of William Faulkner's [[Yoknapatawpha County]] (1963, 1978) (Leitch 2001).&lt;ref&gt;A lifelong student of Faulkner and an expert on his texts, Brooks met Faulkner once. In a conversation lasting several hours, Brooks and Faulkner spent most of their time discussing dogs and coon hunting.&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale, he accepted honorary membership in [[Manuscript Society]]. In 1948, he was a fellow of the Kenyon School of English. From 1951 to 1953, he was a fellow of the [[Library of Congress]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During this time, he received the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and held it again in 1960. From 1963 to 1972, he was awarded honorary doctorates of literature from [[Upsala College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], the [[University of Exeter]], [[Washington and Lee University]], [[Saint Louis University]], [[Tulane University]], and [[Centenary College of New Jersey|Centenary College NJ]] and [[Oglethorpe University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Degrees Awarded by Oglethorpe University |publisher=Oglethorpe University |url=http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |accessdate=2015-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319104000/http://www.oglethorpe.edu/about_us/history/honorary_degrees.asp |archivedate=2015-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Singh 1991).

Brooks' other positions included working as a cultural [[attaché]] for the American [[embassy]] in [[London]] from 1964 to 1966. Further, he held memberships in the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]] (Singh 1991).

The [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Brooks for the 1985 [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name="jefflect"&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website (retrieved January 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  He delivered the lecture both in Washington and at Tulane University in [[New Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E5D71438F936A35751C1A962948260 "Cleanth Brooks Named a Jefferson Lecturer,"] ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 5, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/timeline.html Timeline] at NEH website.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was subsequently included as "Literature in a Technological Age" in a collection of his essays.&lt;ref&gt;Cleanth Brooks, "Literature in a Technological Age" in ''Community, Religion, and Literature: Essays'' (University of Missouri Press, 1995), {{ISBN|0-8262-0993-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8262-0993-1}}, pp.259-274.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brooks and New Criticism==

Brooks was the central figure of New Criticism, a movement that emphasized structural and textual analysis—close reading—over historical or biographical analysis. Brooks advocates close reading because, as he states in ''The Well Wrought Urn'', "by making the closest examination of what the poem says as a poem" (qtd. in Leitch 2001), a critic can effectively interpret and [[explicate]] the text. For him, the crux of New Criticism is that literary study be "concerned primarily with the work itself" (qtd. in Leitch 2001). In "The Formalist Critics," Brooks offers "some articles of faith" (qtd. in Leitch 2001) to which he subscribes. These articles exemplify the tenets of New Criticism:

*That the primary concern of criticism is with the problem of unity—the kind of whole which the literary work forms or fails to form, and the relation of the various parts to each other in building up this whole.
*That in a successful work, format and content cannot be separated.
*That form is meaning.
*That literature is ultimately metaphorical and symbolic.
*That the general and the universal are not seized upon by abstraction, but got at through the concrete and the particular.
*That literature is not a surrogate for religion.
*That, as Allen Tate says, "specific moral problems" are the subject matter of literature, but that the purpose of literature is not to point a moral.
*That the principles of criticism define the area relevant to literary criticism; they do not constitute a method for carrying out the criticism (qtd. in Leitch 2001).

New Criticism involves examining a poem's "technical elements, textual patterns, and incongruities" (Leitch 2001) with a kind of scientific rigor and precision. From [[I. A. Richards]]' ''The Principles of Literary Criticism'' and ''Practical Criticism'', Brooks formulated guidelines for interpreting poetry (Leitch 2001). Brooks formulated these guidelines in reaction to ornamentalist theories of poetry, to the common practice of critics going outside the poem (to historical or biographical contexts), and his and Warren's frustration with trying to teach college students to analyze poetry and literature (Leitch 2001).

Brooks and Warren were teaching using textbooks "full of biographical facts and impressionistic criticism" (Singh 1991). The textbooks failed to show how poetic language differed from the language of an editorial or a work of non-fiction. From this frustration, Brooks and Warren published ''Understanding Poetry''. In the book, the authors assert poetry should be taught as poetry, and the critic should resist reducing a poem to a simple paraphrase, explicating it through biographical or historical contexts, and interpreting it didactically (Singh 1991). For Brooks and Warren, paraphrase and biographical and historical background information is useful as a means of clarifying interpretation, but it should be used as means to an end (Singh 1991).

Brooks took this notion of paraphrase and developed it further in his classic ''The Well Wrought Urn''. The book is a [[polemic]] against the tendency for critics to reduce a poem to a single narrative or [[didactic]] message. He describes summative, reductionist reading of poetry with a phrase still popular today: "[[The Heresy of Paraphrase]]" (Leitch 2001). In fact, he argued poetry serves no didactic purpose because producing some kind of statement would be counter to a poem's purpose. Brooks argues "through irony, paradox, ambiguity and other rhetorical and poetic devices of his or her art, the poet works constantly to resist any reduction of the poem to a paraphrasable core, favoring the presentation of conflicting facets of theme and patterns of resolved stresses" (Leitch 2001).

In addition to arguing against historical, biographical, and didactic readings of a poem, Brooks believed that a poem should not be criticized on the basis of its effect on the reader. In an essay called "The Formalist Critics," he says that "the formalist critic assumes an ideal reader: that is, instead of focusing on the varying spectrum of possible readings, he attempts to find a central point of reference from which he can focus upon the structure of the poem or novel" (qtd. in Rivkin, 24). While he admits that it is problematic to assume such a reference point, he sees it as the only viable option. Since the other options would be either to give any reading equal status with any other reading, or to establish a group of "'qualified' readers" and use those as a range of standard interpretations. In the first case, a correct or "standard" reading would become impossible; in the second case, an ideal reader has still been assumed under the guise of multiple ideal readers (Rivkin 24). Thus, Brooks does not accept the idea of considering critics' emotional responses to works of literature as a legitimate approach to criticism. He says that "a detailed description of my emotional state on reading certain works has little to do with indicating to an interested reader what the work is and how the parts of it are related" (Rivkin 24). For Brooks, nearly everything a critic evaluates must come from within the text itself. This opinion is similar to that expressed by [[W. K. Wimsatt]] and Monroe C. Beardsley in their famous essay "The Affective Fallacy," in which they argue that a critic is "a teacher or explicator of meanings," not a reporter of "physiological experience" in the reader (qtd. in Adams, 1029, 1027).

==Reaction to New Criticism==

Because New Criticism isolated the text and excluded historical and biographical contexts, critics argued as early as 1942 that Brooks' approach to criticism was flawed for being overly narrow and for "disabl[ing] any and all attempts to relate literary study to political, social, and cultural issues and debates" (1350). His reputation suffered in the 1970s and 1980s when criticism of New Criticism increased. Brooks rebuffed the accusations that New Criticism has an "antihistorical thrust" (Leitch 2001) and a "neglect of context" (Leitch 2001). He insisted he was not excluding context because a poem possesses [[organic unity]], and it is possible to derive a historical and biographical context from the language the poet uses (Singh 1991). He argues "A poem by [[John Donne|Donne]] or [[Andrew Marvell|Marvell]] does not depend for its success on outside knowledge that we bring to it; it is richly ambiguous yet harmoniously orchestrated, coherent in its own special aesthetic terms" (Leitch 2001).

New Criticism was accused by critics of having a contradictory nature. Brooks writes, on the one hand, "the resistance which any good poem sets up against all attempts to paraphrase it" (qtd. in Leitch 2001) is the result of the poet manipulating and warping language to create new meaning. On the other hand, he admonishes the unity and harmony in a poem's [[aesthetics]]. These seemingly contradictory forces in a poem create tension and paradoxical irony according to Brooks, but critics questioned whether irony leads to a poem's unity or undermines it (Leitch 2001). [[Post-structuralism|Poststructuralists]] in particular saw a poem's resistance and warped language as competing with its harmony and balance that Brooks celebrates (Leitch 2001).

[[Ronald Crane]] was particularly hostile to the views of Brooks and the other New Critics. In "The Critical Monism of Cleanth Brooks," Crane writes that under Brooks's view of a poem's unity being achieved through the irony and paradox of the opposing forces it contains, the world's most perfect example of such an ironic poem would be Albert Einstein's equation E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which equates matter and energy at a constant rate (Searle).

In his later years, Brooks criticized the poststructuralists for inviting subjectivity and relativism into their analysis, asserting "each critic played with the text's language unmindful of aesthetic relevance and formal design" (Leitch 2001). This approach to criticism, Brooks argued, "denied the authority of the work" (Leitch 2001).

==Influence==

''[[Understanding Poetry]]'' was an unparalleled success and remains "a classic manual for the intellectual and imaginative skills required for the understanding of poetry" (Singh 1991). Further, critics praise Brooks and Warren for "introducing New Criticism with commendable clarity" (Singh 1991) and for teaching students how to read and interpret poetry. [[Arthur Mizener]] commended Brooks and Warren for offering a new way of teaching poetry:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For us the real revolution in critical theory...was heralded by the publication, in 1938, of ''Understanding Poetry''...for many of us who were preparing ourselves to teach English is those years....this book...came as a kind of revelation. It made sense because it opened up for us a way of talking about an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In an obituary for Brooks, John W. Stevenson of [[Converse College]] notes Brooks "redirect[ed] and revolutionize[d] the teaching of literature in American colleges and universities" (1994). Further, Stevenson admits Brooks was "the person who brought excitement and passion to the study of literature" (1994) and "whose work...became the model for a whole profession" (1994).

Along with New Criticism, Brooks' studies of Faulkner, Southern literature, and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (appearing in ''Modern Poetry and the Tradition'') remain classic texts. [[Mark Royden Winchell]] calls Brooks' text on Faulkner "the best book yet on the works of William Faulkner" (1996). Eliot himself commended Brooks in a letter for Brooks' critique of "The Waste Land" (Singh 1991). Further, Winchell praises Brooks for "help[ing] invent the modern literary quarterly" (1996) through the success of ''The Southern Review''.

As testament to Brooks' influence, fellow critic and former teacher John Crowe Ransom calls Brooks "the most forceful and influential critic of poetry that we have" (qtd. in Singh 1991). Elsewhere, Ransom has even gone so far as to describe Brooks as a "spell binder" (qtd. in Singh 1991).

[[image:sch_ewf_6.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of a color wash in multiple hues]]
A '''color wash''' is a popular technique in [[faux painting]] using [[paint]] thinned out with [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] to create a subtle wash of color over walls or other surfaces.  

Color washing is an easy and forgiving form of faux finishing often used by beginners, but perfected by professional finishers.  It was historically created with oil-based products because of the long drying time, but today's environmental and health conscious companies are producing user-friendly water based glazes.  Color washing can be done in any color of paint and is generally applied with brushes over a solid paint color, using long sweeping strokes to meld the glaze colors together.

'''''Communion: A True Story''''' is a book by [[United States|American]] [[ufologist]] and [[Horror fiction|horror]] author [[Whitley Strieber]] that was first published in February 1987. The book is based on the experiences of Whitley Strieber, who experiences "lost time" and terrifying [[flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]], which hypnosis undertaken by [[Budd Hopkins]] later links to an alleged encounter with aliens.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Groves in ''Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal'', ed [[Donald Laycock]], [[David Vernon (writer)|David Vernon]], [[Colin Groves]], [[Simon Brown (author)|Simon Brown]], Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, {{ISBN|0-7316-5794-2}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was later made into [[Communion (1989 film)|a film]] directed by [[Philippe Mora]] and starring [[Christopher Walken]] as Strieber and [[Lindsay Crouse]] as his wife, [[Anne Strieber|Anne]].  A 2008 trade paperback edition presents a new preface by the author.

Strieber compares the "familiar" being he sees, whom he describes as female, to the [[Sumerian religion|Sumerian]] goddess [[Ishtar]].

==Cover art==
The cover painting of an alien was rendered by [[Ted Seth Jacobs]]. The painting is considered one of the most widely recognized popular culture images of alleged "[[Grey alien|grey]]" aliens. "The ''Communion'' cover," Jacobs recounts,
:"was painted in my small apartment on East 83rd St, in New York City. Whitley sat with me first for a drawing of the Alien. As I sketched, he would indicate how to change the portrait so that it would more match what he saw. It was, I believe, the process used by police sketch artists. Every last detail was corrected according to his instructions. At one point, he said the image corresponded exactly to what he had seen. With Whitley beside me for the subsequent session, I began to paint the image on a wooden prepared panel, going through the same process as for the drawing, until Whitley finally said the image was exact. ... As to the gender of the Alien image, to tell the truth, the subject didn't come up. I don't even know if the 'greys' have gender as we understand it. Whitley corrected the developing image to have a certain fragility, a vulnerability. I suppose we Earthlings usually associate these qualities with femininity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beyondcommunion.com/communion/9910tsjacobs.html Bueche, W., "Ted Seth Jacobs: An interview with the artist"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042337/http://www.beyondcommunion.com/communion/9910tsjacobs.html |date=2008-08-21 }} URL accessed Aug 18, 2008(1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defensive design''' is the practice of planning for [[Contingency plan|contingencies]] in the [[design]] stage of a project or undertaking. Essentially, it is the practice of anticipating all possible ways that an end-user could misuse a device, and designing the device so as to make such misuse impossible, or to minimize the negative consequences. For example, if it is important that a plug is inserted into a socket in a particular orientation, the socket and plug should be designed so that it is physically impossible to insert the plug incorrectly. Power sockets are often keyed in such a manner, to prevent the transposition of live and neutral.

Defensive design in [[software engineering]] is called [[defensive programming]]. [[Murphy's law]] is a well-known statement of the need for defensive design. It is considered the opposite approach to [[design by contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.wikipedia.org | title = Design by contract | date = 2017-05-17 | publisher = Wikipedia | location = Internet | language = English | format = HTML | archiveurl = https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Design_by_contract&amp;oldid=780850256 | archivedate = 2017-05-17 | accessdate = 2017-07-25 | quote = The DbC approach assumes all client components that invoke an operation on a server component will meet the preconditions specified as required for that operation.

[[File:T&amp;M.jpg|thumb|Original manuscript of "Death and the Maiden"]]

"'''{{Lang|de|Der Tod und das Mädchen|italic=no}}'''" ({{IPA-de|deːɐ̯ ˈtoːt ʊnt das ˈmɛːtçən|lang}}, "Death and the Maiden"), {{D.}} 531; [[Opus number|Op.]] 7, No. 3, is a [[lied]] composed by [[Franz Schubert]] in February [[1817 in music|1817]]. It was published by Cappi {{Lang|de|und|italic=no}} [[Anton Diabelli|Diabelli]] in Vienna in November 1821. The text is derived from a poem written by German poet [[Matthias Claudius]]. The song is set for [[vocal music|voice]] and [[piano]].

==Composition==

The piece begins with an introduction in [[D minor]]; the first eight [[bar (music)|bars]] in the [[time signature]] 2/2. Both hands play [[Chord (music)|chords]]. The section is quiet ([[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and slow (''mäßig''), and presents the musical [[theme (music)|theme]] of [[Death (personification)|Death]].

The Maiden enters in the ninth bar on an [[anacrusis]]. This section is more agitated than the first; it is marked [[dynamics (music)|piano]] and "somewhat faster" (''etwas geschwinder''). The melody gradually increases in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[chromatic]]ally at points. The piano accompaniment is [[syncopated]], playing chords of [[quaver]]s alternating in the left and right hand. A [[diminished triad|diminished chord]] in the first bar of the third line (''ich bin noch jung'') creates an eerie mood. In the eighth bar of the maiden's song, on the word ''rühre'' ("touch"), the quavers stop and the rhythm of the opening section returns. Then an [[imperfect cadence]] leads to a [[rest (music)|rest]] with [[fermata]]. This brings the second section to a total of 13 bars in length.

The third and final section is Death's song.  The music returns to the [[tempo]] and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] of the introduction. Death's melody has a narrow pitch range (save for the very last note where the singer has the option of dropping to D below the melody line). The [[key (music)|key]] [[Modulation (music)|modulates]] to [[F major]], the relative major of D minor. With the last syllable of Death's song, the key changes into [[D major]]. The coda is almost a repeat of the introduction, except it is shortened by one bar and is now in the [[major key]].

{{InfoMaps}}
A '''design rationale''' is an explicit documentation of the [[reason]]s behind [[Decision making|decisions]] made when [[design]]ing a [[system]] or [[Artifact (software development)|artifact]]. As initially developed by W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]], design rationale seeks to provide [[argumentation]]-based structure to the political, collaborative process of addressing [[wicked problems]].&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"/&gt;

== Overview ==
A design rationale is the explicit listing of [[Decision making|decisions]] made during a [[design process]], and the reasons why those decisions were made.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"&gt;Jarczyk, Alex P.; Löffler, Peter; Shipman III, Frank M. (1992), "Design Rationale for Software Engineering: A Survey", ''25th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences'', 2, pp. 577-586&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal is to support [[designer]]s by providing a means to [[document|record]] and [[communicate]] the argumentation and reasoning behind the design process.&lt;ref name="HoAt06"&gt;Horner, J.; Atwood, M.E. (2006), "Effective Design Rationale: Understanding the Barriers", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., Rationale Management in Software Engineering, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 73-90&lt;/ref&gt; 
It should therefore include:&lt;ref name="Lee97"&gt;Lee, J. (1997). "Design Rationale Systems: Understanding the Issues". ''IEEE Expert'' 12 (3): 78–85&lt;/ref&gt;
* the reasons behind a design decision,
* the justification for it,
* the other alternatives considered, 
* the trade offs evaluated, and 
* the argumentation that led to the decision.

Several science areas are involved in the study of design rationales, such as [[computer science]]&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586"/&gt;  [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name="HoAt06" /&gt; [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="BuBr00"&gt;Burge, J.E.; Brown, D.C. (2000), "Reasoning with Design Rationale", in Gero, J., ''Artificial Intelligence in Design '00'', Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Publ., pp. 611–629&lt;/ref&gt; and [[knowledge management]].&lt;ref&gt;Xin, W.; Guangleng, X. (2001), "Design Rationale as Part of Corporate Technical Memory", ''Systems, Man and Cybernetics'', pp. 1904 - 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; For supporting design rationale, various frameworks have been proposed, such as QOC, DRCS, [[Issue-Based Information System|IBIS]], and DRL.

== History ==
While argumentation formats can be traced back to [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s work in the 1950s&lt;ref name="Toul50"&gt;[[Stephen Toulmin]] (1958). ''The Uses of Argument''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; datums, claims, warrants, backings and rebuttals, the origin of design rationale can be traced back to W.R. Kunz and [[Horst Rittel]]'s&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970"&gt;Kunz, W.; Rittel, H. (1970), ''Issues as elements of information systems''. Working Paper 131, Center for Urban and Regional Development, University of California Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt; development of the [[Issue-Based Information System]] (IBIS) notation in 1970. Several variants on IBIS have since been proposed.

* The first was Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI), first described in Ray McCall's PhD Dissertation&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R. (1978), ''On the structure and use of issue systems in design'', Doctoral Dissertation, University of California, Berkeley, University Microfilms&lt;/ref&gt; although not named at the time.
* IBIS was also modified, in this case to support Software Engineering, by Potts &amp; Bruns.&lt;ref name="PoBu88"&gt;Potts, C.; Burns, G. (1988), "Recording the reasons for design decisions", ''10th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '1988), pp. 418-427&lt;/ref&gt; The Potts &amp; Bruns approach was then extended by the Decision Representation Language (DRL).&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '13)'', IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was extended by RATSpeak.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt;
* Questions Options and Criteria (QOC), also known as Design Space Analysis&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Moran, T. (1989), "Design rationale: the argument behind the artifact", ''SIGCHI Bull''. 20, pp. 247-252114-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates'', pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative representation for argumentation-based rationale, as are Win-Win&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]], Ross, R (1989). "Theory-W software project management: principles and examples.". ''IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering'' 18 (7): 902-916.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decision Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM).&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221"&gt;Pena-Mora, F.; Sriram, D.; Logcher, R. (1993), "SHARED-DRIMS: SHARED Design Recommendation-Intent Management System", ''Proceedings Enabling Technologies Infrastructure for Collaborative Enterprise'', IEEE Press, Morgantown, WV, pp. 213-221&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Rationale Management System (RMS) was PROTOCOL, which supported PHI, which was followed by other PHI-based systems MIKROPOLIS and PHIDIAS. The first system providing IBIS support was [[:de:Hans Dehlinger|Hans Dehlinger]]'s STIEC.&lt;ref&gt;Dehlinger, H. (1978), Project STIEC: Systems Analysis of the Generation and Dissemination of Scientific and Technological Information in the European Community" ''Report No. 26: Report on a Batch - Version of STIEC'', Heidelberg/Stuttgart&lt;/ref&gt; Rittel developed a small system in 1983 (also not published) and the better known [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS) was developed in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; YakemBegemanovic, M. (1988). "gIBIS: A hypertext tool for exploratory policy discussion". ''ACM Transactions on Office Information Systems'' 6 (4): 303-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all successful DR approaches involve structured argumentation. For example, Carroll and Rosson's Scenario-Claims Analysis approach&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, JM; Rosson, M (1992). "Getting around the task-artifact cycle: how to make claims and design by scenario". ''ACM Trans. Inf. Syst''. 10 (2): 181-212&lt;/ref&gt; captures rationale in scenarios that describe how the system is used and how well the system features support the user goals. Carroll and Rosson's approach to design rationale is intended to help designers of computer software and hardware identify underlying design tradeoffs and make inferences about the impact of potential design interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, J. M., &amp; Rosson, M. B. (2003). Design rationale as theory. HCI models, theories, and frameworks: toward a multidisciplinary science, 431-461.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts in design rationale ==
There are a number of ways to characterize DR approaches. Some key distinguishing features are how it is captured, how it is represented, and how it can be used.

=== Rationale capture ===
''Rationale capture'' is the process of acquiring rationale information to a rationale management

; Capture methods
* A method called "Reconstruction"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; captures rationales in a raw form such as video, and then reconstruct them into a more structured form.&lt;ref name="BuBr98"&gt;Burge, J.; Brown, D.C. (1998), [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html ''Design Rationale: Types and Tools, Technical Report''], [http://web.cs.wpi.edu/Research/aidg/DR-Rpt98.html Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept.], retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of Reconstruction method is that rationales can be carefully captured and capturing process won't disrupt the designer. But this method might result in high cost and biases of the person producing the rationales 
* The "Record-and-replay"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method simply captures rationales as they unfold. Rationales are synchronously captured in a [[video conference]] or asynchronously captured via [[bulletin board]] or email-based discussion. If the system has informal and semi-formal representation, the method will be helpful.
* The "Methodological byproduct"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales during the process of design following a schema. But it's hard to design such a schema. The advantage of this method is its low cost.
* With a rich knowledge base (KB) created in advance, the "Apprentice"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method captures rationales by asking questions when confusing or disagreeing with the designer's action. This method benefits not only the user but the system.
* In "Automatic Generation"&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; method, design rationales are automatically generated from an execution history at low cost. It has the ability in maintaining consistent and up-to-date rationales. But the cost of compiling the execution history is high due to the complexity and difficulty of some machine-learning problems.
* The "Historian"&lt;ref&gt;Chen, A.; McGinnis, B.; Ullman, D.; Dietterich, T. (1990), "Design History Knowledge Representation and Its Basic Computer Implementation", The 2nd International Conference on Design Theory and Methodology, Chicago, IL, pp. 175-185&lt;/ref&gt; method let a person or computer program watches all designer's actions but does not make suggestions. Rationales are captured during the design process.&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt;

=== Rationale representation ===
The choice of design rationale representation is very important to make sure that the rationales we capture is what we desire and we can use efficiently. According to the degree of formality, the approaches that are used to represent design rationale can be divided into three main categories: informal, semiformal, or formal.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; In the informal representation, rationales can be recorded and captured by just using our traditionally accepted methods and media, such as word processors, audio and video records or even hand writings. However, these descriptions make it hard for automatic interpretation or other computer-based supports. In the formal representation, the rationale must be collected under a strict format so that the rationale can be interpreted and understood by computers. However, due to the strict format of rationale defined by formal representations, the contents can hardly be understood by human being and the process of capturing design rationale will require more efforts to finish, and therefore becomes more intrusive.

Semiformal representations try to combine the advantages of informal and formal representations. On one hand, the information captured should be able to be processed by computers so that more computer based support can be provided. On the other hand, the procedure and method used to capture information of design rationale should not be very intrusive. In the system with a semiformal representation, the information expected is suggested and the users can capture rationale by following the instructions to either fill out the attributes according to some templates or just type into natural language descriptions.&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt;

=== Argumentation-based models ===
; The Toulmin model : One commonly accepted way for semiformal design rationale representation is structuring design rationale as argumentation.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; The earliest argumentation-based model used by many design rationale systems is the Toulmin model.&lt;ref name="Toul50" /&gt; The [[Stephen Toulmin#The Toulmin Model of Argument|Toulmin model]] defines the rules of design rationale argumentation with six steps:&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Chris (2000), [http://www.concentric.net/~Creyn266/COMM335/Toulmin.htm ''What is the Toulmin Model?''] Paper at concentric.net.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:# Claim is made; 
:# Supporting data are provided; 
:# Warrant provides evidence to the existing relations; 
:# Warrant can be supported by a backing; 
:# Model qualifiers (some, many, most, etc.) are provided; 
:# Possible rebuttals are also considered. 
:One advantage of Toulmin model is that it uses words and concepts which can be easily understood by most people.

; Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) : Another important approach to argumentation of design rationale is Rittel and Kunz's IBIS ([[Issue-Based Information System]]),&lt;ref name="Kunz, W. 1970" /&gt; which is actually not a software system but an argumentative notation. It has been implemented in software form by [[gIBIS]] (graphical IBIS), itIBIS (test-based IBIS), [[Compendium (software)|Compendium]], and other software.&lt;ref&gt;Conklin, J.; Yakemovic, K. (1991). "A Process-Oriented Approach to Design Rationale". ''Human-Computer Interaction'' 6 (3 &amp; 4): 357–391.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Rittel |first1=Horst W. J. |authorlink1=Horst Rittel |last2=Noble |first2=Douglas |date=January 1989 |title=Issue-based information systems for design |number=492 |location=Berkeley, CA |institution=Institute of Urban and Regional Development, [[University of California]] |oclc=20155825 |url=http://cumincad.architexturez.net/system/files/pdf/ca71.content.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBIS uses some rationale elements (denoted as nodes) such as issues, positions, arguments, resolutions and several relationships such as more general than, logical successor to, temporal successor to, replaces and similar to, to link the issue discussions.

; Procedural Hierarchy of Issues (PHI) : PHI (Procedural Hierarchy of Issues)&lt;ref&gt;McCall, R.J. (1991). "PHI: A Conceptual Foundation for Design Hypermedia". ''Design Studies'' 12 (1): 30–41.&lt;/ref&gt; extended IBIS to noncontroversial issues and redefined the relationships. PHI adds the subissue relationship which means one issue's resolution depends on the resolution of another issue.

; Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) : QOC (Questions, Options, and Criteria)&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, A.; Young, RM.; Bellotti, VME.; Moran, T. (1996), "Questions, Options, and Criteria: Elements of Design Space Analysis", in Moran, T.; Carroll, J., ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp. 53-106&lt;/ref&gt; is used for design space analysis. Similar to IBIS, QOC identifies the key design problems as questions and possible answers to questions as options. In addition, QOC uses criteria to explicitly describe the methods to evaluate the options, such as the requirements to be satisfied or the properties desired. The options are linked with criteria positively or negatively and these links are defined as assessments.

; Decision Representation Language (DRL) : DRL (Decision Representation Language)&lt;ref name="Lee91"&gt;Lee, J. (1991), "Extending the Potts and Bruns model for recording design rationale", ''Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Software Engineering'' (ICSE '13), IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA, pp. 114-125&lt;/ref&gt; extends the Potts and Bruns model of DR&lt;ref name="PoBu88" /&gt; and defines the primary elements as decision problems, alternatives, goals, claims and groups. Lee (1991) has argued that DRL is more expressive than other languages.&lt;ref name="Lee91" /&gt; DRL focuses more on the representation of decision making and its rationale instead of on design rationale.

; RATSpeak : Based on DRL, RATSpeak is developed and used as the representation language in SEURAT (Software Engineering Using RATionale).&lt;ref&gt;Burge, J. (2005), [http://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/ETD/Available/etd-050205-085625/ ''Software Engineering Using design RATionale''], Worchester Polytechnic Institute, Computer Science Dept&lt;/ref&gt; RATSpeak takes into account requirements (functional and non-functional) as part of the arguments for alternatives to the decision problems. SEURAT also includes an Argument Ontology which is a hierarchy of argument types and includes the types of claims used in the system.

; WinWin Spiral Model :  The WinWin Spiral Model, which is used in the WinWin approach,&lt;ref name="BoKi06"&gt;[[Barry Boehm]]; Kitapci, H. (2006), "The WinWin Approach: Using a Requirement Negotiation Tool for Rationale Capture and Use", in Dutoit, A.H.; McCall, R.; Mistrík, I. et al., ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer Berlin Heidelberg, pp. 173-190&lt;/ref&gt; adds the WinWin negotiation activities, including identifying key stakeholders of the systems, and identifying the win conditions of each stakeholder and negotiation, into the front of each cycle of the [[Spiral model|spiral software development model]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Barry Boehm]] (1998). [http://www.cs.usu.edu/~supratik/CS%205370/r5061.pdf "A spiral model of software development and enhancement"]. ''Computer'' 21 (5): 61–72&lt;/ref&gt; in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory (winwin) agreement for all stakeholders of the project.

: In the WinWin Spiral Model, the goals of each stakeholder are defined as Win conditions. Once there is a conflict between win conditions, it is captured as an Issue. Then the stakeholders invent Options and explore trade-offs to resolve the issue. When the issue is solved, an Agreement which satisfies the win conditions of stakeholders and captures the agreed option is achieved. Design rationale behind the decisions is captured during the process of the WinWin model and will be used by stakeholders and the designers to improve their later decision making.&lt;ref name="BoKi06" /&gt; The WinWin Spiral model reduces the overheads of the capture of design rationale by providing stakeholders a well-defined process to negotiate. In&lt;ref&gt;Bose, P. (1995). "A Model for Decision Maintenance in the WinWin Collaboration Framework". ''Knowledge Based Software Engineering '' (KBSE '95).&lt;/ref&gt; an ontology of decision rationale is defined and their model utilizes the ontology to address the problem of supporting decision maintenance in the WinWin collaboration framework.

; Design Recommendation and Intent Model (DRIM) : DRIM (Design Recommendation and Intent Model) is used in SHARED-DRIM.&lt;ref name="Pena-Mora, F. 1993 pp. 213-221" /&gt; The main structure of DRIM is a proposal which consists of the intents of each designer, the recommendations that satisfy the intents and the justifications of the recommendations. Negotiations are also needed when conflicts exist between the intents of different designers. The recommendation accepted becomes a design decision, and the rationale of the unaccepted but proposed recommendations are also recorded during this process, which can be useful during the iterative design and/or system maintenance.

== Applications ==
Design rationale has the potential to be used in many different ways. One set of uses, defined by Burge and Brown (1998),&lt;ref name="BuBr98" /&gt; are:
* Design verification — The design rationale can be used to verify if the design decisions and the product itself are the reflection of what the designers and the users actually wanted.
* Design evaluation — The design rationale is used to evaluate the various design alternatives discussed during the design process.
* Design maintenance — The design rationale helps to determine the changes that are necessary to modify the design.
* Design reuse — The design rationale is used to determine how the existing design could be reused for a new requirement with or without any changes in it. If there is a need to modify the design, then the DR also suggests what needs to be modified in the design.
* Design teaching — The design rationale could be used as a resource to teach people who are unfamiliar with the design and the system.
* Design communication — The design rationale facilitates better communication among people who are involved in the design process and thus helps to come up with a better design.
* Design assistance — The design rationale could be used to verify the design decisions made during the design process.
* Design documentation — The design rationale is used to document the entire design process which involves the meeting room deliberations, alternatives discussed, reasons behind the design decisions and the product overview.

DR is used by research communities in software engineering, mechanical design, artificial intelligence, civil engineering, and human-computer interaction research. In software engineering, it could be used to support the designers ideas during requirement analysis, capturing and documenting design meetings and predicting possible issues due to new design approach.&lt;ref name="DMM06"&gt;Dutoit, A.; McCall, B.; Mistrik et al., eds. (2006), ''Rationale Management in Software Engineering'', Springer pp.1-48.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[software architecture]] and outcourcing solution design, it can justify the outcome of [[architectural decision]]s and serve as a design guide.&lt;ref&gt;O. Zimmermann, C. Miksovic, J. Küster, [http://soadecisions.org/download/SDA-JSS-SpecialIssueWICSA2011v16FinalAuthorsVersion.pdf Reference Architecture, Metamodel and Modeling Principles for Architectural Knowledge Management in Information Technology Services]. Journal of Systems and Software, Elsevier. Vol. 85, Issue 9, Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
In civil engineering, it helps to coordinate the variety of work that the designers do at the same time in different areas of a construction project. It also help the designers to understand and respect each other's ideas and resolve any possible issues.&lt;ref&gt;Whelton, Michael; Ballard, Glenn; Tommelein, Iris (2007) [http://www.leanconstruction.org/pdf/DesignRationaleSystemsandProjectDefinitionIGLC9.pdf ''Application Of Design Rationale Systems To Project Definition – Establishing A Research Project''.] Retrieved on 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The DR can also be used by the project managers to maintain their project plan and the project status up to date. Also, the project team members who missed a design meeting can refer back the DR to learn what was discussed on a particular topic. The unresolved issues captured in DR could be used to organize further meetings on those topics.&lt;ref name="DMM06" /&gt;
 
Design rationale helps the designers to avoid the same mistakes made in the previous design. This can also be helpful to avoid duplication of work.&lt;ref name="BuBr00" /&gt; In some cases DR could save time and money when a software system is upgraded from its previous versions.&lt;ref name="Jarczyk, Alex P. 1992 pp. 577-586" /&gt;

There are several books and articles that provide excellent surveys of rationale approaches applied to HCI,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T.; Carroll, J., eds. (1996), ''Design Rationale Concepts, Techniques, and Use'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates,&lt;/ref&gt; Engineering Design&lt;ref name="Lee97" /&gt; and Software Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Dutoit, Rationale Management in Software Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2017-06-07 Documenta 14 Kassel by Olaf Kosinsky-29.jpg|thumb|Fridericianum]] 

'''documenta 14''' is the fourteenth edition of the art exhibition [[documenta]] and took place in 2017 in both [[Kassel]], [[Germany]], its traditional home, and [[Athens]], [[Greece]]. It is being held first in Athens from 8 April till 16 July,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.documenta14.de/en/ |title= documenta 14 |publisher= South Magazine |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Kassel from 10 June till 17 September 2017. As part of the concept of the artistic director [[Adam Szymczyk]], the exhibition is proceeding in both countries.

The documenta is a series of [[contemporary art]] exhibitions. It takes place every five years (originally every four years) and lasts 100 days each; It is therefore also referred to as a museum of 100 days. The first documenta was organized in 1955 and went back to the initiative of [[Arnold Bode]]. The location of the Documenta is normally [[Kassel]].

'''Empik''' (stylised as '''empík''') is a [[Poland|Polish]] commercial chain selling [[book]]s, international [[Print media|press]] and media products (including film, music, and software). The chain also owns a photo company, Empik Foto, as well as a foreign language school, Empik School.

==History ==
EMPiK chain began during Poland's communist period as KMPiK ({{lang-pl|Klub Międzynarodowej Prasy i Książki}}, the International Press and Book Club) owned by the [[Prasa-Książka-Ruch]] monopoly which financed the [[PZPR]] Party from its revenue. In 1991 it was acquired by businessmen Jacek Dębski, Janusz Romanowski (a former reserve police officer) and [[Yaron Bruckner]], and given its current name. While initially it was partially owned by the Polish state,  in 1994 it was sold completely by the [[State Treasury]] to Bruckner's [[Eastbridge N.V.]]. In May 2009 EMPiK had 134 stores in Poland and 23 stores in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;From Polish Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14682">A '''fixed book price agreement''' (FBPA) is a form of [[resale price maintenance]] applied to books. It commonly takes the form of an agreement between [[publisher]]s and [[bookseller]]s which set the prices at which [[book]]s were to be sold to the public. An example of an FBPA was the former [[Net Book Agreement]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. 

The key idea of an FBPA is to promote [[non-price competition]] between booksellers in order to promote the sale of little-known, difficult or otherwise culturally interesting books rather than catering only to [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] readers. To do so, an FBPA is deemed to ensure that the booksellers that provide the corresponding [[presale services]] are able to recoup their higher costs with a guaranteed margin on blockbusters.

A related case is the existence of a fixed book price law (FBPL), where the book prices are kept fixed by law. An example of an FBPL is the current [[Lang Law]] in [[France]]. 

An FBPA/FBPL, with various provisos, has existed in some developed countries since the beginning of the twentieth century. It remains in force in roughly half the countries of the [[European Union]] as well as in some other countries.

== Principle ==

The core idea of the FBP (either by agreement or law) is that a dense network of well-stocked, high quality bookshops is a necessary condition for the publication of a large variety of books, large variety itself deemed desirable for the cultural life of a country {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=742}}. Such bookshops have additional costs that are not borne by discounters, who just stock their shelves with the current blockbusters. Since the latter represent a large proportion of book sales, price competition between high-quality bookshops and discounters reduces bookshops' profitability. 

The FBP allows the publisher to mitigate this competition and thereby guarantees a sufficient margin for high-quality bookshops to operate.

Historically, most countries with a significant book industry have known an FBPA since the 19th century. The development of [[competition policy]] in the 1970s led to a wave of repeals of those agreements (Australia 1972, Sweden 1974, UK 1995) at a time when any form of [[resale price maintenance]] was seen with much suspicion. Conversely, other countries (Spain 1975, Greece 1997, Italy 2005) enacted laws making the FBP mandatory.

The following table gives an overview of the prevalence of FBP in rich countries (sources: European Booksellers Federation&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20090713220757/http://www.ebf-eu.org/papers/Book%20Trade%20in%20Europe%20updated010206.doc&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=749}}).

== Assessment ==

The assessment of the FBP is a controversial one. On the one hand, most economists ({{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|}} for an overview, {{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} for a specific discussion) are skeptical of the cultural merits of the FBP and underline its distorting effect. On the other hand, other economists ({{Harv|Rouet|2007}} on the French case, {{Harv|Backhaus|Hansen|2003}} on the German case) and the book industry{{who?|date=December 2012}} argue that the FBP is the only tool that allows difficult, high-brow, and culturally significant books{{clarification needed|date=December 2012}} to be published. Therefore, they say, the distortion should account for the much larger cultural [[externality|externalities]] of meaningful cultural works. As {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|p=743}} put it,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultural merits ascribed to such agreements have almost reached mythical proportions. No public debate in Europe on the cultural value of books is complete without a discussion of the FBP.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===

Several [[industrial organization]] frameworks can be applied to assess the consequences of the FBP. 

The most commonly cited result is {{Harv|Telser|1960}}. This paper states that when two retailer can engage on [[tangible presale services]], that is can undertake an unobservable costly effort that increases the demand for both of them (advertisement, sessions with authors, thematic weeks), each one has an incentive to [[Free rider problem|free-ride]] on the other retailer's effort by setting its price slightly below his competitor (which cannot correspondingly cut his price, since he supports the cost of a higher level of effort). This leads to a suboptimal (too low, from the publisher's point of view) level of aggregate effort. By cancelling the possibility of price competition, a FBP makes impossible this kind of opportunistic behaviour and induces both retailers to compete in services.

According to {{Harv|Canoy|van Ours|van der Ploeg|2006|}}, the main idea of FBP (keeping best seller prices high in order to subsidize the sale of less popular books) is unconvincing for several reasons: 

* the market subsidizes new books per se, in order to get a best seller
* there is no guarantee that the subsidy will occur anyway. In fact, the authors suggest that both publishers and booksellers have an incentive not to carry it out
* if less popular books are less price elastic than popular books, monopoly profits in them are higher
* even if the subsidy works, there is no accounting for what or how it's done
* even if the subsidy works, it's not clear that it's worth the price distortion

=== Empirical assessment ===

{{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} and {{Harv|Fishwick|2005}} provide empirical assessments of FBP comparing countries with and without a FBP (Nordic countries for the former, France and the UK for the latter). According to these authors, the two main effects of a repeal of a FBP is a displacement of small [[independent bookstore]]s by larger chain outlets and a decrease in the price of bestsellers, compensated by an increase of the price of all other books.

{{Harv|Ringstad|2004}} notices that the level of book prices and the number of published titles evolves in a similar manner in all Nordic countries (Norway, Sweden, Finland) although only Norway has a FBP and Finland belongs to a different linguistic group. In Denmark (FBP since 2000), however, book prices have increased one-third quicker than general inflation since 1985 and the number of books sold has fallen by two-thirds, a sharp contrast with Sweden and Norway, which belong to the same linguistic group. His conclusion, supported by elements from {{Harv|Fjeldstad|2001}}, is that the effects of a FBP are less than both proponents and critics make them, and that other institutional agreements (e.g. only pure bookshops can carry textbooks in Norway) better explain the evolution of the book markets in those countries. 

According to {{Harv|Fishwick|2005}}, the ending of the FBPA in the UK (1995) did not lead to a sharp decrease of the number of bookshops, rather to a displacement of small, independent bookshops by big-chain outlets. He notices however that the former stayed in place where a quality-sensitive demand existed, and that competition between bookshops spurred a reduction of operational costs thanks to better logistics and collection management (an argument also found in {{Harv|Ringstad|2004}}). In a counterfactual manner, {{Harv|Rouet|2007}} shows that in France, the FBP helped to maintain a dense network of independent bookshops, reined in the deployment of chain bookstores and spurred supermarkets to boost their offer of books. Fishwick also shows that while the number of published titles increases as fast as in France, there is no sign of an overall increase of book prices. He shows however that this stability hides a strong distributive effect. Comparison with France show that the FBP leads to an increase of the price of bestsellers relative to non-FBP markets and a decrease of low-selling or long-selling books. He argues that the assessment of this effect is difficult, since the relation between the (un)popularity of a book and its cultural value is unclear, whereas consumers of low-selling books are, on average, wealthier than consumers of bestsellers (making a FBP a subsidy of wealthier people by poorer people).

{{nihongo|'''''Grotesque'''''|グロテスク|Gurotesuku}} is a 2009 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[Splatter film|splatter]] [[Horror film|horror]] and [[exploitation film]] written and directed by [[Kōji Shiraishi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1352369/synopsis?ref_=ttpl_pl_syn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A young couple Aki and Kazuo are snatched off the street while having their first date as a romantic couple after a few years working in the same office. They wake up shackled in a basement that has plastic-covered walls. With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. He punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, drives nails into his scrotum, then sexually assaults the girl, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes, he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way, he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm. 

As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's "services". The couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds. It gradually becomes apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, taste for classical music and good wines and dresses in expensive clothes when he is not in surgeon dress. He even mentions he is a wealthy man, which suggests he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme way to obtain satisfaction in his lonely life. The couple also notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance. 

After several days healing, the "doctor" simply tells the couple they will be free to go, he will turn himself to authorities and, as apology for all the suffering he inflicted to the couple, he will give them all his fortune which seems to be very large, as compensation. After all the horror, in a moment alone in the hospital room, Aki and Kazuo promise to support each other once they leave and become a couple. It is unclear if the madman is playing with the couple's hopes to survive; immediately after telling them they will be released, the couple is taken back to the basement. After being drugged, they are shackled again, exactly as they were the first time.
 
The "doctor" announces they must participate in one final test of love. He pulls out some of Kazuo's intestines and attaches them to a hook. If Kazuo is able to cross the room to the other side (pulling his entire intestine out of his body in the process), take scissors and cut Aki's ropes to release her, both will be freed. However, Kazuo fails due to blood loss (it is also revealed that the ropes restraining Aki have a metal wire running through them, rendering them impossible to cut with scissors; the task was therefore impossible). 

Aki begins to insult the doctor and says that despite his classy appearance, he has a skunk odor. Angered, the doctor cuts off Aki's head. The head lands on the doctor's neck; she bites him with her final breath. Kazuo, not dead yet, stabs him in the foot with the scissors as a supreme last action. The couple then dies facing each other. In the epilogue, the madman is revealed to have survived, although he cannot walk properly. He is in a quiet forest where he respectfully buries the couple next to each other in a traditional Japanese way, leaving the scissors on their tombs as a symbol. The next scene shows him in the same car he used to kidnap the couple, covering himself with lots of perfume to hide his skunk stench. A girl walks by, and the screen cuts to black as he goes after his next victim.

* Hiroaki Kawatsure as Kazuo
* Shigeo Ōsako as the unnamed doctor

==Release==
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] has refused to issue an 18 certificate to the unrated version of the film, banning its release in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Japanese-Horror-Film-Grotesque-Banned-By-British-Censors-For-Extreme-Torture-With-Little-Narrative/Article/200908315365324?lpos=Showbiz_News_Top_Stories_Header_4&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15365324_Japanese_Horror_Film_Grotesque_Banned_By_British_Censors_For_Extreme_Torture_With_Little_Narrative|title=Grotesque! UK Bans 'Extreme Torture' Film |date=August 19, 2009|publisher=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBFC director David Cook explained "Unlike other recent 'torture' themed horror works, such as the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' series, ''Grotesque'' features minimal narrative or character development and presents the audience with little more than an unrelenting and escalating scenario of humiliation, brutality and sadism. In spite of a vestigial attempt to 'explain' the killer's motivations at the very end of the film, the chief pleasure on offer is not related to understanding the motivations of any of the central characters. Rather, the chief pleasure on offer seems to be wallowing in the spectacle of sadism (including sexual sadism) for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/news/press/20090819.html|title=BBFC rejects sexually violent Japanese horror DVD|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's director and screenwriter, [[Koji Shiraishi]], responded that he was "delighted and flattered by this most expected reaction from the faraway country, since the film is an honest conscientious work, made sure to upset the so-called moralists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20090820_grotesque_movie|title=Japanese Horror Flick "Grotesque" Banned in Britain - What the Director Has to Say?|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=Gigazine|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The reception in Japan was initially less controversial, but after the notoriety of the UK ban, [[Amazon.com|Amazon Japan]] decided to remove the DVD of ''Grotesque'' from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/features/feature/bathed-in-blood/|title=Bathed in Blood: Director Koji Shiraishi’s torture-porn flick Grotesque gets banned in Britain—and ignites a debate about Japan’s splatter-film boom|date=September 24, 2009|publisher=Metropolis Magazine|accessdate=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, CDJapan, the international version of the Japanese retailer Neowing, does not sell the DVD since the controversy; although it is still readily available to Japanese residents via Neowing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The film was released on DVD in Austria and the Netherlands on July 31.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The DVD is a special edition limited to 1,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The DVD only contains German and Japanese language tracks and is only available in online stores related to the genre.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
 
The film was released on a [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in the United States by [[Media Blasters]] on October 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Grotesque-Blu-ray-Combo-Tsugumi-Nagasawa/dp/B003VL3UP2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322511296&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' had a lukewarm response to ''Grotesque'', offering kudos to aspects such as the acting and the production values, while criticizing others such as the inconsistent special effects, and opining that the "ridiculous" finale "blows any built-up tension and generates chuckles more than anything else".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/grotesque-1200478044/|title = Review: ''Grotesque''|last = Elley|first = Derek|publisher = ''Variety''|date = 1 December 2009|website = variety.com|accessdate = 11 June 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Horror News praised the film, opening its review with, "''Grotesque'' is really a mix of emotions. Brilliant, disgusting, well written, sadistic and painful to your senses beyond belief" and concluding that it was "a solid effort" that deserves "an A for a great and outrageous ending".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/7316/film-review-grotesque-aka-gurotesuku-2009-cat-iii/|title = Film Review: ''Grotesque'' (aka ''Gurotesuku'') (2009) – CAT III|last = |first = |publisher = Horror News|date = 26 August 2010|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 11 June 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual and characteristic feature of the szopka is the use of historical buildings of [[Kraków]] as backdrop for the [[Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="culture.pl"&gt;[http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/artykuly/wy_wy_szopki_krakow_2003 Kraków Szopka] on culture.pl&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, it was inscribed on the list of [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/nativity-scene-szopka-tradition-in-krakow-01362 |title=Nativity scene (szopka) tradition in Krakow |access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Nativity scenes, common in [[Christian culture]]s, originated with [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] in the 13th century and quickly spread to [[Poland]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] a specific type of nativity-based play, referred to as ''[[Jasełka]]'', developed in Poland.&lt;ref name="christmasarchives.com"&gt;[http://www.christmasarchives.com/wpoland.html CHRISTMAS IN POLAND] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528024916/http://www.christmasarchives.com/wpoland.html |date=2007-05-28 }} at Christmas Archives.com(scroll down for Szopka section)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polamjournal.com"&gt;[http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/Holidays/xmasindex/xmas-creche/xmas-creche.html "Szopka"] at Polish-American Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Some performers displayed their szopkas together with [[puppets]] in a form of a [[street theatre]]. In some, movable puppets were replaced with immobile wooden figurines. At times subject-specific puppets or figurines were and are being added to illustrate elements of Polish culture, ranging from historical figures like [[winged hussar]]s and [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], through the legendary sorcerer [[Pan Twardowski]] and [[Smok Wawelski|Dragon of Wawel]], to contemporary politicians or artists. In the 18th century the spread of such non-religious content led to a ban on more extravagant nativity scenes in some Polish churches; following the ban, the performances evolved into a true expression of [[folk art]].

The szopka tradition dates back to the 19th century, when Kraków's craftsmen – masons, woodworkers – begun to make them as a seasonal decoration in order to earn extra income during Christmas. The custom grew in popularity, with people willing to pay to watch szopka collections – often carried by door-to-door [[Christmas carol|carollers]] – or to own them. Among the notable early patrons of the custom was the [[magnate]] family of [[Potoccy]].

After Poland regained independence in 1918, szopkas started to be made and sold as souvenirs of Kraków. The city's municipal authorities decided to support this tradition by announcing the first competition in December 1937. Since then, except for the duration of the [[Second World War]], the szopka presentation and tournament takes place every year on the first Thursday of each December, at the [[Main Market Square, Kraków]], next to the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Kraków|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]]. The best szopkas are then displayed in the [[Historical Museum of Kraków]] in [[Krzysztofory Palace]].

==Design==
The ornate structures can be up to two metres high and three metres wide. The edifice most often used as an inspiration for szopka models is the [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków]] with its easily recognisable [[spire]]s. Other popular choices include [[Wawel Castle]], [[Sukiennice]] trade hall and the [[Barbican of Kraków]].

The [[Bethlehem]] is often shown on the second floor, as the first one is used for a display of historical figurines.

By 1921, Shuster, Ellis, Mruk, Bakos, and Nash had all moved to Santa Fe, and the five formed their [[artist collective]] in 1921. At the time, the five painters were all in their 20s and new to Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Edna|title=Los Cinco Pintores|year=1975|publisher=Museum of New Mexico Press|location=Santa Fe|isbn=0-89013-080-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stated goal was to "take art to the people" by exhibiting in places such as schools, hospitals, factories, and even the [[New Mexico Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hold Art in a Penitentiary|journal=American Art News|date=January 7, 1922|volume=20|issue=13|page=4|jstor=25589890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[modern art|modernist]] painters were inspired by [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] people and landscapes for their subject matter.

=== Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium ===
[[File:Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts – painting, sculpture and drawing – from the 15th to the 21st centuries. They preserve the works of the [[Flemish primitives|Flemish Primitives]], of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jacques Jordaens]], [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[James Ensor]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[René Magritte]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Jan Fabre]] and many others. This jewel among Belgium's cultural institutions comprises several entities: the [[Oldmasters Museum|Musée Old Masters Museum]], the Musée Modern Museum, the [[Wiertz Museum|Musée Wiertz Museum]] and the [[Constantin Meunier|Musée Meunier Museum]], the [[Magritte Museum|Musée Magritte Museum]] and the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum]].

Michel Draguet repositioned the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] nationally as well as internationally through a redeployment of the collection focused on the specificity of Belgian creation as well as on the particularity of Belgian reception of European creation.

In 2009, he created the [[Magritte Museum]] with, for the first time in Belgium, a private-public partnership (with [[Engie|GDF-Suez]]) on competencies. The selection of works exhibited in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is constantly expanding with a changing selection of external loans. With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/ripostes/brandir-l-importance-economique-de-la-culture-pour-la-defendre-544aa05a3570fe7cfbf80d01|title=Brandir l'importance économique de la culture pour la défendre ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-05-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magritte Museum]] has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Fin-de-siècle Museum]] as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like [[Constantin Meunier]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Léon Spilliaert]] and [[George Minne|Georges Minne]] testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry ([[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Émile Verhaeren|Emile Verhaeren]], [[Octave Maus]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], [[Maurice Kufferath]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and others). [[Art Nouveau]] architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esthétique'' made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], the [[La Monnaie|Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], [[Cinematek]], the [[Bibliotheca Wittockiana]], the [[King Baudouin Foundation]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]] for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum]], which was applauded internationally when it opened,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/belgique-bruxelles-s-offre-un-musee-fin-de-siecle-06-12-2013-1765553_3.php&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year.

Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate “Museum on measure”: a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors .

Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as “Art Nouveau Bing”, “Rubens in Brussels”, “CoBrA”, “Alechinsky”, “Leon Spilliaert” “Jordaens and Antiquity”, “The Flemish Primitives in  Brussels”, “Andres Serrano”, “Marc Chagall”, “Kandinsky and Europe”, “Symbolism in Belgium” and “Stanley Kubrick Photographer”. Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists Pierre Lahaut, [[Jules Schmalzigaug]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the [[Oldmasters Museum|OldMasters]] department like [[David Altmejd]] or [[Jan Fabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-collection|title=The collection – Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|website=www.fine-arts-museum.be|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/michel-draguet-reconduit-la-direction-des-musees-royaux-des-beaux-arts-de-belgique-132655|title=Michel Draguet reconduit à la direction des Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique - 28 avril 2017 - lejournaldesarts.fr|website=Le Journal Des Arts|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online and digital outreach of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] († Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right.

Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel’s works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist’s world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel’s works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master’s craft. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] launched this project jointly with the [[Google Cultural Institute]] in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era.

The ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]’s interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the [[Google Cultural Institute]] platform.

=== Royal Museums of Art and History ===
[[File:Park of the Cinquantenaire - Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, 2010 (HDR 1).jpg|thumb|339x339px|Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium]]
From 1st August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director-General of the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This entity includes the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, [[Halle Gate]], and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].

He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities – the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] and [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]].

Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the [[Louvre]] and [[British Museum]], and that of the latter would offer a more “national” foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another.

Together the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] and [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Art and History]] welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]]. Plus a few heritage assets – the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and [[Halle Gate]] – which contribute to the attractiveness of the city.

His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of [[BELSPO|Belspo]] [http://plus.wikimonde.com/wiki/Philippe_Mettens Philippe Mettens], Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.dekamer.be|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19081">'''Modular music''' is [[music]] that originates from the combination and overlapping of different compositions one over the other. The compositions —also called [[modules]]— are written by one or many different composers in different moments. New modules can be added or removed to create a totally new work, a new composition, different from the original one.
A modular composition can be expanded and extended in time, space and size.

==Origins==
In the high Medieval times, French monks discovered that superimposing two melodies and playing them contemporaneously would generate interesting acoustics. They really witnessed innovative acoustic combinations: the [[counterpoint]]; at first applied exclusively to voices, it came to fruition in Renaissance. The term originates from the Latin ''punctus contra punctum'', meaning "point against point".

==Modular method in music==
By combining compositions rather than melodies, one obtains a '''modular project'''. The term “project” is more appropriate than “composition” because the shape of the work is not fixed and it will change when a new composition (module) is added or removed.
The concept of a musical work seen as something closed, limited and immobile evolves into a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. A modular project is a work in progress. Once a composition is completed, anyone can join in and take part to it, by adding new modules or even by removing modules that are considered unsuitable. The original module attracts new artists and stimulate them to create new works or compositions to be combined with the pre-existing modules. Each module, in turn, may become an original piece, a new starting point for other artists to join in and start a new process of aggregation.
There are no limits; each composer or artist is free to manage his or her material, add or remove modules in any way or form, without changing the original works created by another modular composers. The only rule of the modular method is that none is allowed to modify a module: composers can choose a combination of modules, can add his/her own works but cannot absolutely modify a pre-existing module.

In music history, however, there are examples of famous composers using the modular method unaware: [[Charles Gounod]] (1818–1893) composed his famous ''Ave Maria'' by adding a melody to the I Prelude in C major from [[Das Wohltemperierte Klavier]] by [[J. S. Bach]] (1685–1750). Neither one of the two composers willingly adopted the modular method of composition for their respective works; however, these are examples of modular music.

Furthermore, the term '''Modular''' and/or '''Modular Music''' is often applied nowadays to [[Electronic Music]] especially: examples can be found in the [[Serge synthesizer]], [[Modular synthesizer]], in the work of composer and performer [[Scot Gresham-Lancaster]], one of the early pioneers of "computer network" music which uses the behavior of interconnected music machines to create innovative ways for performers and computers to interact. Electronic music composer [[André Stordeur]] who composes exclusively on Serge synthesizer and in 2009 appeared on a version of [[Giacinto Scelsi]]'s ''Tre Canti Popolari'', published by the [[Sub Rosa (label)]], where he played electronic distortion of live instruments. The music of [[Disc Jockey]] can be as well considered a modern example of modular music, where different and independent modules are mixed rather than overlapped, played simultaneously and the third modules represented by the Dj him/herself who interacts with the two ongoing modules (tracks).

==Technique==

“In the initial approach, the artist may choose any stile, instrument and musical form, with no limits for the composer’s creativity“, whatsoever.
“Once the first musical work is completed, which will be defined as Module A or original module, it becomes an opportunity for new composers to develop it by extending its dimension, fully respecting its integrity.
Modular composers, stimulated by the original work may in turn add their own creations, again expanding the original piece. This creates a hierarchy of modules. The first composition, '''the original module''', becomes module A, the second or additional work added by another modular composer, becomes module B, and so on“.&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 9, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuous aggregations===
“Once located the original module (A), the composer of successive modules will aggregate with module B anticipating performance of his composition to be executed with the original module.
The following solutions therefore: A, or A+B.
Upon the superimposition of ulterior modules (C, D, E …), the composition is well into the process of extension. The execution or performance of the individual pieces B and C as autonomous compositions is not expected.
Not to be excluded the possibility of accepting modules B or C as original in terms of developing and expanding the creation replacing module A. 
In fact nothing is to prevent further development by a third composer ignoring modules B or C and creating a new B module which will inaugurate a new expansionary orientation. This is referred to as '''Parallel Aggregations'''“.&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 10-11, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent aggregations===
“When it is possible to perform the various modules according to a random selection, it becomes an independent aggregation. The original module A may be performed alone or in combination with the modules B and C. The same can be said for each module A,B and C.
The letters associated with each module are chronological references as to when the works were composed.
Any combination is therefore possible: A, A+B, B, B+C, A+C, C, A+B+C“.&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 11, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed aggregations===
“Modular scores may be developed on various planes (continuous aggregations and independent aggregations) each following their developmental criteria and rules of combination.

The aggregation to a modular project may in turn be constructed following the modular method described; that, which is valid for the macro-structure, is applicable to the internal development of individual modules, thus creating further sub module aggregations limited, however, in the level of intervention therefore establishing:

===Negative aggregations===
One exception to the rule which prohibits modifications to existing modules retained valid, is a  particular case of aggregation: '''negative aggregation''' or of silences.
Although there are no changes to the fundamental score in existence, the application of silences suppresses and eliminates some precise moments. Silences obscure, not because of disapproval but for added stimulation not as a result of what it did not do but a conquest of making an algebraic negative sign resulting in a spectacular motion of opposing an aggregation already occurred.“&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Editors, Stefano Vagnini ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp. 11-12, Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composers==

===Theorist===
The modular method in music has been theorized in 1998 by an Italian composer and arts theoretician, [[Stefano Vagnini]],&lt;ref&gt;Rai Italian Television, Giorgia Ragni Interview on Stefano Vagnini's ModulArt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brCx3wWr0I&lt;/ref&gt; who developed his theory of open-source composition based on modular aggregation.
Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modular music of Vagnini's compositions as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”.&lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano: SalmodieSubliminali, Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;
Greek history university professor Umberto Bultrighini describes "Vagnini '''Modular Music’s''' ability to satisfy old needs and combine them with modern technology. ModulArt as the key answer to the need of defining the artist's work, finding the right balance between art, audience and copyrights".&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Bultrighini, Vagnini, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, pp 57, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Composers===
Since 2000 the modular methodology has been spread involving worldwide composers through many modular projects. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe and in the United States. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]]&lt;ref&gt;University of West Georgia official website page: “Italian artists bring a new view of Art, Music and Literature to UWGhttp://www.westga.edu/ucmassets/news/2575.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA, at the “G. D’Annunzio” University of Chieti–Pescara Italy, and at the [[University of Strathclyde]] in Glasgow, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;University of Strathclyde official website page: “Glasgow University International Organ Project 2012: The Facebach Project http://www.gla.ac.uk/events/?action=details&amp;id=6117&lt;/ref&gt; 
Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ''ROAI III'' for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.
The composer [[Andy DiGelsomina]] has featured variations on the modular approach in his recent "Lyraka Symphony no. 1", which he elaborates on (with musical examples) in his personal blog. &lt;ref&gt;http://andydigelsomina.blogspot.com/2017/04/lyraka-symphony-no-1-mvt-5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modularity and other art languages==

=== Visual art===
Modularity can be applied to every language of art in many different ways.

[[Marcel Duchamp]]'s intervention on Leonardo’s Monna Lisa: the moustache is, in all ways, a modular effect.
Greek-born conceptual artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[ModulArt]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.
American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale.
Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture, a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books.
The Gruppo 1, made up of Biggi, Frascà, Pace, Santoro, Uncini and Carrino, in the  1960s elaborated a conception of sculpture being a collective project with works developed by assembling basic elements—modules, in the true sense of the word—which could be modified in any moment, sometimes with the intervention of the public.
The term ''modular'' applied to visual arts was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts"&lt;ref&gt;Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
''SalmodieSubliminali'' (Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007) is a book of modular poems&lt;ref&gt;Campanotto Ed. ''Salmodie Subliminali'', Udine, Italy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in which Stefano Vagnini connects words so that new meanings comes out from the sentence. Every line can be extended with new words, always connected.

===Polimediality===
When different languages coexist, multimediality becomes a natural opening for the modular work. The artist's desire to experiment is combined with the necessity to adapt to codes and communicative languages in constant evolution.  Using at the same time different languages is not just the research of innovative aesthetic solutions, superficial strategy used to capture who enjoys with distraction; multimediality becomes, by  modular art, a natural answer to the artist that wants to join the project.
In Modular Music, the term ''polimediality'' is preferred, because a multimedia work is usually already conceived as a multi-art language work. In a modular project, the opportunity to add modules using different languages depends on the artist who decides to join the work.

===Coexistence of cultures===
In a modular project, many different cultures can coexist in the project without having to use a hybrid language. Coexistence so that people can enjoy the taste of the combination of different cultural expressions and traditions.
Modular art must be considered an alternative to that phenomenon called contamination.

=== Via Crucis===
[[Stefano Vagnini]]'s 2002 modular oratorio depicting the fourteen [[Stations of the Cross]], ''Via Crucis'',&lt;ref&gt;Falcon Valley Music Ed., Stefano Vagnini, ''Via Crucis'', Rome, Italy, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; composition for organ, computer, choir, string orchestra and brass quartet. ''Via Crucis'' represents Stefano Vagnini’s first intuition of the process of aggregations and the demonstration of the potential of the method. It is an [[oratorio]] made by ''continuous modules'' composed by the same musician in different moments.
* ''Originary Module - A: organ (two manuals and pedalboard)'' is the first module; it is divided into 14 movements, one for each station.
Being the original module, it may be presented to the public solo, for a total length of 50 minutes.
* ''Module - B: computer'' is to be overlapped to the stations I, II, IV, VIII, IX, XII and XIV with synchronism.
* ''Module - C:  4 voice choir'' is a four mixed voices choir for each station except the 5th.
The text is in latin from the Vulgata.
Even the internal module D structure is modular: the soprano part can be performed without the choir. The choir parts in the stations no. 3, 7 and 9 are overlapped in the 12th.
* ''Module - D: strings orchestra'' – The percussion (included in the score) is optional and can be considered a submodule of module E.
* ''Module E: brass quartet (two trumpets, horn and trombone)'' is the last module composed up to now and it can be added to the stations IV, V, VI, X, XI, XIII, XIV. 
* ''Module – F : video'' is a video by the photographer-producer Paolo del Bianco, not synchronized to the music.

===Zoo world modular project===
Zoo is a modular project made by independent modules created by worldwide composers over eight piano works by Stefano Vagnini. A typical characteristic of the project's performances is the lack of a stage and seating arrangements for the audience, who walk freely through the performance space (e.g. a garden, square, or shopping mall), while the musicians are stationed throughout the space and acoustically isolated such that their individual performances cannot all be heard at once. This means each audience member's experience of the performance is unique, depending on the path they take through the space and the precise moments they happen to be in proximity to each individual musician.
The Zoo world modular project currently comprises the following composers: Martin Vitous (Czech Rep.), George Christophy (Cypro), Anthony Green (U.S.A), Johannes Holik (Austria), Erik Schwartz (U.S.A), Heinz Chur  (Germany), [[Philip Wilcher]] (Australia), Ichinose Kyo (Japan), Julian Yu (China), John Sharply (Singapore), Slava Vinokur (Israel), Paul Gordon Manners (England), Giorgia Ragni (Italy).
The Zoo project has been performed since 2000:

===FaceBach===
The FaceBach project, organized by Strathclyde University Choir Director Alan Tavener,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strathchamber.org/?page_id=165&lt;/ref&gt; was performed on 15 June 2012, at the Barony Hall Glasgow as closing workshop on Modular Music featuring the Strathclyde Barony Hall organ students and AiDADUO (Stefano Vagnini and Giorgia Ragni).
Some J. S. Bach organ music selection has been combined with contemporary music by [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Cathy Berberian]], [[John Cage]], [[Stefano Vagnini]] and Omega Zero.

In [[classical antiquity]], the '''muscle cuirass (Latin: lorica musculata)'''&lt;ref&gt;Also found as "muscled cuirass" or "lorica musculata". The [[contemporary Latin]] phrase ''lorica musculata'' appears not to be used among scholars, but will be found at [[Classical reenactment|reenactment]] [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22lorica+musculata%22&amp;hl=en&amp;num=10&amp;lr=&amp;ft=i&amp;cr=&amp;safe=images websites.] The word ''musculatus'' (nor any verb from which it might derive) does not exist in [[Classical Latin]], according to the ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]'', nor in [[late antiquity]], according to the ''Latin Dictionary'' of Lewis and Short, which includes [[patristic]] writers of the [[early Christian]] era.&lt;/ref&gt;, '''anatomical cuirass''' or '''heroic cuirass''' is a type of [[cuirass]] made to fit the wearer's torso and designed to mimic an idealized human physique. It first appears in late [[Archaic Greece]] and became widespread throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BC.&lt;ref&gt;M. Treister, "The Theme of Amazonomachy in Late Classical Toreutics: On the Phalerae from Bolshaya Bliznitsa," in ''Pontus and the Outside World: Studies in Black Sea History, Historiography, and Archaeology'' (Brill, 2004), p. 205; Charlotte R. Long, ''The Twelve Gods of Greece and Rome'' (Brill, 1987), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally made from hammered [[bronze]] plate, [[boiled leather]] also came to be used. It is commonly depicted in [[ancient Greek art|Greek]] and [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]], where it is worn by generals, emperors, and deities during periods when soldiers used other types. 

In [[Roman sculpture]], the muscle cuirass is often highly ornamented with [[Greek mythology|mythological scenes]]. Archaeological finds of relatively unadorned cuirasses, as well as their depiction by artists in military scenes, indicate that simpler versions were worn in combat situations. The anatomy of muscle cuirasses intended for use might be either [[Realism (art)|realistic]] or reduced to an abstract design; the fantastically illustrated cuirasses worn by gods and emperors in Roman statues usually incorporate realistic [[nipple]]s and the [[navel]] within the scene depicted.

The cuirasses were cast in two pieces, the front and the back, then hammered. They were a development from the early Archaic bell-shaped cuirass, weighing about 25 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Y. Treister, ''Hammering Techniques in Greek and Roman Jewellery and Toreutics'' (Brill, 2001), pp. 115–118; Richard A. Gabriel and Karen S. Metz, ''From Sumer to Rome: The Military Capabilities of Ancient Armies'' (Greenwood, 1991), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples from the 5th century BC have been found in the tombs of [[Thracians]], whose [[Thracian cavalry|cavalrymen]] wore them.&lt;ref&gt;Treister, ''Hammering Techniques'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest surviving depiction in Greek sculpture seems to be an example on a sculptural warrior's torso found on the [[acropolis of Athens]] and dating around 470 – 460 BC. The muscle cuirass is also depicted on [[Attic red-figure pottery]], which dates from around 530 BC and into the late 3rd century BC.

From around 475 to 450 BC, the muscle cuirass is shorter, covering less of the abdomen, and more nipped at the waist than in later examples. It was worn over a ''[[Chiton (costume)#Chitoniskos|chitoniskos]]''. In [[Neo-Attic|neo-Attic art]], the muscle cuirass was worn over a longer [[Chiton (costume)|chiton]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Long, ''The Twelve Gods'', p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vergina#Archaeological finds|Tomb II at Vergina]] contained an iron muscle cuirass that was decorated with embossed gold.&lt;ref&gt;Treister, ''Hammering Techniques'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italian]] muscle cuirass lacked the shoulder-guards found on Greek examples.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Sekunda, ''Republican Roman Army 200–104 BC'' (Osprey Publishing, 1996), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples among the [[Samnites]] and [[Oscans]] sketch a blockier torso more roughly than the anatomically realistic Greek pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Nic Fields, ''Roman Battle Tactics 390–110 BC'' (Osprey Publishing, 2010), p. 7 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YJAd-soQyF8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=roman+%22muscle+cuirass%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m6LeTKzyG4nJnAefnfmaDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=roman%20%22muscle%20cuirass%22&amp;f=false with images.]&lt;/ref&gt; Many examples come from graves in [[Campania]],&lt;ref&gt;Sekunda, ''Republican Roman Army 200–104 BC'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Etruria]], and elsewhere in southern Italy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Polybius]] omits the muscle cuirass in his description of the types of armor worn by the Roman army, but archaeological finds and artistic depictions suggest that it was worn in combat. The monument of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] at [[Delphi]] shows two Roman infantrymen wearing [[Lorica hamata|mail shirts]] alongside three who wear muscle cuirasses.&lt;ref&gt;Sekunda, ''Republican Roman Army 200–104 BC'', pp. 8 and 46.&lt;/ref&gt; They were worn mostly by officers, and may have been molded leather as well as metal, with fringed leather ''([[Pteruges|Pteryges]])'' at the armholes and lower edge.&lt;ref&gt;Pat Southern, ''The Roman Army: A Social and Institutional History'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; The muscle cuirass is one of the elements that distinguished a senior officer's "uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Elton, "Military Forces," in ''The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Warfare'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doriphorus02 pushkin.jpg|thumb|125px|The ''Doryphoros'' of Polykleitos]]

=== ''Cuirasse esthétique'' ===
The sculptural replicating of the human body in the muscle cuirass may be inspired by the concept of [[heroic nudity]], and the development of the muscle cuirass has been linked to the idealized portraiture of the male body in Greek art.&lt;ref&gt;Jason König, ''Athletics and Literature in the Roman Empire'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 103, providing further references in note 27.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kenneth Clark]] attributes the development of an idealized standard musculature, varied from the facts of nature, to [[Polykleitos]]:
{{quote|Polykleitos set himself to perfect the internal structure of the torso.  He recognized that it allowed for the creation of a sculptural unit in which the position of humps and hollows evokes some memory and yet can be made harmonious by variation and emphasis.  There is the beginning of such a system in [[:File:Torso Miletus Louvre Ma2792.jpg|the torso from Miletos]] and that of the [[Kritios Boy|Kritios youth]]; but Polykleitos' control of muscle architecture was evidently far more rigorous, and from him derives that standard schematization of the torso known in French as the ''cuirasse esthétique'', a disposition of muscles so formalized that it was in fact used in the design of armor and became for the heroic body like the masks of the antique stage.  The ''cuirasse esthétique'', which so greatly delighted the artists of the Renaissance, is one of the features of antique art that have done most to alienate modern taste.... But... we can see from certain replicas that this was originally a construction of great power.  Such is the copy of the ''[[Doryphoros]]'' in the Uffizi.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Clark, ''The Nude'', Ch. 2, "Apollo."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Decoration ===
[[File:Athena Parthenos Louvre Ma91 n2.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Gorgoneion on an Athena Parthenos]]
[[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic rulers]] added divine emblems, such as thunderbolts, to the [[pteruges]].

Another conventional decoration is the [[gorgoneion]], or Medusa's head, on the upper chest, and often vegetative motifs on the pectorals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elfriede Knauer|Elfriede R. Knauer]], "''Knemides'' in the East? Some Observations on the Impact of Greek Body Armor on 'Barbarian' Tribes," in ''Nomodeiktes: Greek Studies in Honor of Martin Ostwald'' (University of Michigan Press, 1993), pp. 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the elements of iconography that identify the Greek [[Athena]] and the Roman [[Minerva]], goddesses who embodied the strategic side of warfare, was a [[breastplate]] bearing a gorgoneion (see [[Aegis]]). Other deities, particularly the [[war gods]] [[Ares]] and [[Mars (god)|Mars]], could be portrayed with muscle cuirasses.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Roman emperors ===
[[File:Augusto_di_Prima_Porta,_inv._2290,_03.jpg|thumb|150px|Muscle cuirass from the [[Augustus of Prima Porta]]]]

Among freestanding sculptures portraying [[Roman emperor]]s, a common type shows the emperor wearing a highly ornamented muscle cuirass, often with a scene from [[Roman mythology|mythology]]. Figures such as [[Nike (mythology)|winged victories]], enemies in defeat, and [[Roman virtues|virtues personified]] represent the emperor as master of the world. Symbolic arrangements this elaborate never appear on Greek cuirasses.&lt;ref&gt;Knauer in ''Nomodeiktes'' p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cuirass on the famous ''[[Augustus of Prima Porta]]'' is particularly ornate. In the center, a Roman officer is about to receive a Roman military standard ''([[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]])'' from a bearded "barbarian" who appears to be a [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]. The Roman, who has a [[hound]] at his side, is most often identified as a young [[Tiberius]], and the scene is usually read as the return in 20 BC of the standards lost at the [[Battle of Carrhae]] in 53 BC. The anatomically realistic navel (Greek ''[[omphalos]]'', Latin ''[[wikt:umbilicus|umbilicus]]'') is placed between the two central figures, slightly below ground level in relation to the feet and centered above the [[personification]] of Earth, positioned over the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Keppie, ''The Making of the Roman Army: From Republic to Empire'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1984), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reclining position, [[cornucopia]], and the presence of suckling babies is common to other goddesses in Augustan art who represent peace and prosperity. Other figures include a lyre-playing [[Apollo]] riding a [[griffin]], [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] on the back of a [[red deer|hind]], and the [[quadriga]] of the Sun at the top.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zanker, ''The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus'' (University of Michigan Press, 1988, 1990), pp. 175, 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans, The Nativity at Night, c 1490.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''Nativity at Night'', [[National Gallery, London]] by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]].]]
&lt;!-- NO infobox please! --&gt;
The '''''Nativity at Night''''' or '''''Night Nativity''''' is an [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of about 1490 by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]] in the [[National Gallery, London]] (NG 4081).&lt;ref name="NatGal"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/geertgen-tot-sint-jans-the-nativity-at-night |work=National Gallery |accessdate=22 October 2018 |title=The Nativity at Night}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[panel painting]] in [[oil painting|oil]] on [[oak]], measuring 34 × 25.3&amp;nbsp;cm.,&lt;ref name="NatGal"/&gt; though it has been cut down in size on all four sides.  The painting shows the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]], attended by angels, and with the [[Annunciation to the shepherds]] on the hillside behind seen through the window in the centre of the painting.&lt;ref name="NatGal"/&gt; It is a small painting presumably made for private devotional use, and Geertgen's version, with significant changes, of a lost work by [[Hugo van der Goes]] of about 1470.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 232 &amp; 238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Like many paintings of the ''Nativity'', the depiction is influenced by the visions of [[Saint Bridget of Sweden]] (1303–1373), a very popular mystic.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 232; Schiller, 78–81 on Bridget's influence and 84 on this work.&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the virgin knelt down with great veneration in an attitude of prayer, and her back was turned to the manger&amp;nbsp;... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in a moment she gave birth to her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle&amp;nbsp;... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. Then I heard also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;Schiller,78, including quotation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
[[File:Michel Sittow 003.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Sittow]]'s version of Hugo van der Goes' original, c. 1510–20, keeping the original orientation.]]

Many depictions reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect, and the Nativity remained very commonly treated with [[chiaroscuro]] through to the [[Baroque]]. Here the sources of light are the infant Jesus himself, in accordance with Bridget's vision, who is the sole source of illumination for the main scene inside the stable, the shepherds' fire on the hill behind, and the angel who appears to them.  In fact this effect now goes beyond what was intended by the artist, as the painting was damaged in a fire in 1904, when it was in a private collection in [[Berlin]]. The different shades of blue given the upper and lower parts of the Virgin's clothing and the sky outside now appear as murky dark browns or blacks, and the painting is generally darker.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 232&lt;/ref&gt; The painting had been cut down by 1901.  There is a copy of the painting in the Diocesan Museum in [[Barcelona]], which suggests that the original size was about 45 × 31&amp;nbsp;cm.  In this the rays emanating from the Christ-Child are more evident, and the animals behind less so.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 236&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geertgen painting reverses (makes a mirror-image of) the main figures of the earlier work presumed to have been by van der Goes, which is now lost but known from several versions. Only the main figures are reversed, and not the background of the building and the shepherds' scene outside.
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans Nativity Detail1.jpg|333px|thumb|Detail, Geertgen]]
Apart from the reversal, there were other differences: in the van der Goes four angels knelt round the manger, and a larger group hovered near the top of the picture-space; the window had a sill higher than the Virgin's head; and [[Saint Joseph]] held a lighted candle in his hands.  The composition showed a view generally pulled back, without the intimate close-up effect of Geertgen's version, which has the figures pushed closely together.  The closest to the original is thought to be a version in the church in [[Annaberg-Buchholz|Annaberg]] in [[Saxony]] (illustrated in Campbell), which the version by [[Michael Sittow]] in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]] (illustrated) resembles closely, apart from the shaping of the top edge.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 237–8. The Vienna painting was formerly attributed to [[Gerard David]] (see Châtelet, 221 for example)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the architectural details vary, both the Annaberg and Sittow paintings show rather grander buildings, in a better state of repair, than Geertgen, whose building has a sloping timber roof.  In Early Netherlandish painting the usual simple shed of the Nativity, little changed from Late Antiquity, often developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 49–50. For further details see [[Nativity of Jesus in art#Western image]]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Composition=== 
[[File:Geertgen tot Sint Jans Nativity Detail4.jpg|left|388px|thumb|Detail, Geertgen]]
Geertgen has simplified van der Goes' composition to a "bold design based on grid-like patterns", which the effects of the fire on the colour values has further simplified.  The van der Goes original "was a more complex, more ambitious and more solemn, but perhaps a less touching, picture."&lt;ref name="c238"&gt;Campbell, 238&lt;/ref&gt;  The Geertgen is a famous painting, that has received much critical attention, not all of which has taken into account the earlier van der Goes work and the effects of the fire and cutting-down.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 238, Snyder 178&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement by [[Erwin Panofsky]] that the Geertgen was "the earliest nocturne in the optically strict sense of the word" is described in the National Gallery catalogue as a "rash claim".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 238 (both quotes). Panofsky's claim was from p.325 of his ''Early Netherlandish Painting'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;  Quite apart from the van der Goes, night scenes had essentially been developed in [[illuminated manuscript]]s before moving to panel paintings, and the realistic [[night vision]] effect of very muted colour values and "simplification of volumes" owes as much to the later fire as the artist's intention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 238; Châtelet, 114 (quotation)&lt;/ref&gt; James Snyder, perhaps unaware the painting had been cut down, compares the "fractional figures" on the sides of the painting to those in Geertgen's ''[[Man of Sorrows (Geertgen tot Sint Jans)|Man of Sorrows]]'', and says they "bring the viewer into the picture, allowing him to look over their shoulders".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 178&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Barcelona version the figure of the extreme left-hand  angel is still cut off by the frame.

Geertgen worked in [[Haarlem]], and was the leading Netherlandish painter of his day who both came from and worked in the Northern Netherlands (approximately the modern [[Netherlands]]), rather than [[Flanders]] (mostly now in [[Belgium]]).  Various attempts have been made to relate his style, in this and other works, to much later [[Dutch art|Dutch painting]], for example by [[Max Jakob Friedländer]],&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; but "nationalistic allegations that Geertgen was quintessentially 'Dutch'" are rejected by Lorne Campbell.&lt;ref name="c238" /&gt;

'''Nielsen BookScan''' has been a [[data]] provider for the [[book]] [[publishing]] industry, owned by the [[Nielsen Company]] up to 2016, though it is still in use via the [[NPD Group]]. BookScan compiles [[point of sale]] data for book sales.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;[[Daniel Gross]]. "[http://www.slate.com/id/2142810/ Why writers never reveal how many books their buddies have sold]."

Retrieved on January 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the success of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] which tracked [[point of sale]] figures for music, the [[Nielsen Company]] decided to launch a similar service for book sales. Nielsen BookScan was launched in January 2001.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt; Previously, tracking of book sales, such as by the [[New York Times Best Seller list]], was done without raw numbers. ''The New York Times'' would survey hundreds of outlets to estimate which books were selling the most copies, and would publish rankings but not figures. Only the publisher of a book tracked how many copies had been sold, but rarely shared this data.

==Methodology==
Nielsen BookScan relies on point of sale data from a number of major book sellers. In 2009 Nielsen BookScan's US Consumer Market Panel covered 75% of retail sales.

==Use of BookScan==
BookScan was initially greeted with skepticism, but is now widely used by both the publishing industry and the media.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt; Publishers use the numbers to track the success of their rivals. The media uses the figures as a reference to gauge a title's success. [[Daniel Gross]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' has noted the increase of pundits using the figures to disparage each other.&lt;ref name=Slate/&gt;

BookScan also provided previously unavailable metrics on books published by multiple publishers, such as classic novels in the [[public domain]] which may be published by many different houses. Previously, no single entity had figures for the sales of these books; publishers and bookstores only knew their own sales. ''Slate'' noted that [[Jane Austen]]'s ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' was available from Amazon in 130 different editions; prior to BookScan there was no way to tabulate total sales. By summing BookScan data, however, ''Pride and Prejudice'' was reported to command sales of 110,000 a year, nearly 200 years after being published.&lt;ref name=Slate2/&gt;

BookScan records cash register sales of books by tracking ISBNs when a clerk scans the barcode. BookScan only tracks print book sales, thus excluding ebook sales from major e-tailers such as [[Amazon Kindle]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]] [[Nook]], [[Kobo eReader|Kobo]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Google Play]]. BookScan likewise does not include non-retail sales through channels such as libraries, nor specialty retailers who do not report to the service.&lt;ref&gt;https://electricliterature.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-book-sales-but-were-afraid-to-ask-1fe6bc00aa2d#.jssavzqjs&lt;/ref&gt;

BookScan and other services, as Pubtrack Digital, PubTrack Higher Education, PubTrack Christian, Books &amp; Consumers, PubEasy und PubNet belong to [[The NPD Group]] since January, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bookweb.org/news/nielsen-sells-bookscan-other-us-book-industry-services-npd-group-35494|title=Nielsen Sells BookScan, Other U.S. Book Industry Services to NPD Group|date=2017-01-20|work=American Booksellers Association|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; NPD has acquired these services from Nielsen’s '''U.S.''' market information and research services for the book industry. These services will be part of NPD Book, a new U.S. practice area.

Nielsen will offer these services furthermore in 9 countries outside U.S., named "Nielsen Book".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boersenblatt.net/artikel-marktdaten_in_den_usa.1279371.html Börsenblatt für den deutschen Buchhandel], january 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-Referential Architecture''' is the architecture of the 21st century. It is distinct of the [[architecture]] of [[postmodernity]] in as much as Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a non-referential world. Non-Referential Architecture is liberated of a vocabulary of fixed semantic images, symbols, and historical connotations. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are based upon themselves – they are based on architecture-inherent qualities such as architectural space and form and the experience of space they cause in the inhabitants and visitors. Buildings of Non-Referential Architecture are distinctly different from their precursors of modernism and postmodernism because they are not the outcome of extra-architectural concepts and ideas, such as importations and thematizations, for example, taken from the realms of the economic, the ecological, or the political. 

In the book Non-Referential Architecture, Swiss [[architect]] [[Valerio Olgiati]] and USA-based Swiss [[architectural theoretician]] [[Markus Breitschmid]] write: "Non-referential architecture is not an architecture that subsists as a referential vessel or as a symbol of something outside itself. Non-referential buildings are entities that are themselves meaningful and sense-making and, as such, no less the embodiment of society than buildings were in the past when they were the bearers of common social ideals."&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati. Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-Referential Architecture is a response to a contemporary societal current that increasingly rejects ideologies of any kind, political and otherwise. While ideologies were the innovation of [[modernity]] and [[postmodernity]], the non-referential world is increasingly devoid of ideologies or it rejects to order the world in ideological ways. Valerio Olgiati has worked on the possibilities of a Non-Referential Architecture for years. The first documented use of the term Non-Referential in architecture appears in a reprint of an interview between Olgiati and Breitschmid in the Italian architecture journal Domus.&lt;ref&gt;Valerio Olgiati [in an interview with Markus Breitschmid], “Sulla non referezialita” in: Domus No. 974, Milano: 13/2013, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Breitschmid publishes a rebuttal titled "Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab" (Architecture is Derived from Architecture) in the Swiss journal Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, thereby responding to an architectural claim made by others that attempts to imbue meaning into architecture from the extra-architectural, such as the economic, ecological, political. &lt;ref&gt;Markus Breitschmid. “Architektur leitet sich von Architektur ab” in: Werk, Bauen + Wohnen, Zurich: 9/2014, 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Architect [[Christian Kerez]] investigated the limits of referentiality and speaks of "non-referential space" as a quality of his contribution for the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.archdaily.com/867558/columbia-gsapp-conversations-4-wonder-structure-christian-kerez-contemporary-swiss-architecture&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, architect [[Peter Eisenman]] points out that architecture has been moving toward a “non-referential ‘objectivity’” for some time, in as much as architectural form is increasingly reduced “to a pure reality.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pantagruelista.com/blogeng/architecture-fiction-eisenman&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2018, Olgiati and Breitschmid published the architectural treatise Non-Referential Architecture, a book that has been in the making since 2013. It analyses the societal currents of the early 21st century and argues that those currents are radically different from the epoch of postmodernity.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The book proposes a new framework for architecture and defines the seven underlying principles for Non-Referential Architecture:&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
1) Experience of Space; 
2) Oneness; 
3) Newness; 
4) Construction; 
5) Contradiction; 
6) Order; 
7) Sensemaking.

One of the hallmarks of Non-Referential Architecture is that each building exists for itself. Each building is governed by an architectural idea – and that idea has to be form-generative and sense-making.&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, pp. 13-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Referential Architecture states: "Non-referential architecture denotes but it refuses to explain or narrate, and it leaves behind any vestiges of a theatrical mode of persuasion and propagation."&lt;ref&gt;Non-Referential Architecture. Ideated by Valerio Olgiati; Written by Markus Breitschmid. Basel: Simonett &amp; Baer, 2018, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the intent of the exhibition ‘Inscriptions: Architecture before Speech’, held at [[Harvard University]]’s [[Graduate School of Design]] in 2018, [[K. Michael Hays]] argues that today’s architecture presupposes “not a particular meaning, but a specific kind of potentiality — a non-semantic materiality, a non-referential construct that can be developed into an actual architectural project.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.designboom.com/architecture/harvard-gsd-inscriptions-exhibition-03-01-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nouvelles de la république des lettres''''' (''News from the [[Republic of Letters]]'')&lt;ref&gt;ISSN 1873-0019&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[periodical]] devoted to reviews of current publications, edited and in large part written by [[Pierre Bayle]]. It began publication in 1684, and is the first known [[book review]] journal.

Bayle edited it from  March 1684  through February 1687; it was continued by [[Daniel de Larroque]], [[Jean Barrin]] and [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]] through April 1689. Publication was suspended from then until January 1699 when it was resumed under the editorship of  [[Jacques Bernard (theologian)|Jacques Bernard]]. He continued it through December 1710; it was then suspended until January 1716, when he resumed and continued until the final issue in June 1718.&lt;ref name=BNF1&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/NoticeBib?allerA=7&amp;noPage=6&amp;idNoeud=1.2.1.1.1.1.1&amp;host=catalogue Bibliotheque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WC1&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/nouvelles-de-la-republique-des-lettres-mois-de-mars-1864-maijuin-1718-non-summum-ex-fulgore-sed-ex-fumo-dare-lucem-c/oclc/367386300&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although written in French, it was  published in [[Amsterdam]] to escape French censorship. The initial publisher was [[Henri Desbordes]] from 1684 through 1689 and 1699 through May 1708, and subsequently by [[Pierre Mortier]] from June 1708 through December 1710, and [[David Mortier]] from January 1716 through June 1718.&lt;ref name=BNF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WC1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bost, Hubert.

Amsterdam: APA-Holland University Press, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Publication was monthly from the beginning through 1710; after that, it was published bi-monthly.&lt;ref name=BNF1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WC1 /&gt;

A reproduction was published in Geneva by Slatkine in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb35291969z/PUBLIC Bibliothèque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale known as "'''The Poison Dress'''", or "'''Embalmed Alive'''"&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt; features a [[dress]] that has in some way been [[poison]]ed. This is a recurring theme throughout legends and folk tales of various cultures, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Mughal India]], and the [[United States]]. Although lacking evidence suggesting that some American [[urban legend]]s are directly linked to the classical tales, they share several common [[motif (narrative)|motifs]].&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book |title=Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend |first=Gillian |last=Bennett |isbn=1-57806-789-8 |year=2005 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek mythology==
{{main|Medea|Shirt of Nessus}}

The poison dress motif is similar to the [[Shirt of Flame]]. In [[Greek mythology]], when [[Jason]] left the sorceress [[Medea]] to marry Glauce, King [[Creon]]'s daughter, Medea took her revenge by sending Glauce a poison dress and a golden [[coronet]], also dipped in poison. This resulted in the death of the princess and, subsequently, the king, when he tried to save her.

The Shirt of Nessus is smeared with the poisoned blood of the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]], which was given to [[Hercules]] by Hercules' wife, [[Deianira]]. Deianira had been tricked by Nessus and made to believe that the blood would ensure Hercules's [[faithfulness]]. According to [[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''[[Women of Trachis|The Women of Trachis]]'', Hercules began to perspire when he put on the shirt, which soon clung to his flesh, corroding it. He eventually threw himself onto a pyre on [[Mount Oeta]] in extreme agony and burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women of Trachis | url = http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/soph_trach.shtml | author = Sophocles | authorlink = Sophocles | others=Robert M. Torrance (trans.) | year = 1966 | accessdate = 2008-10-21 | publisher = Temple University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian folklore==
[[File:Aurangazeb.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Aurangzeb]] (reign 1658-1707), considered by his subjects a [[fakir]] or wizard,&lt;ref name=Khilats/&gt; was credited with using poison khilats to eliminate some of his perceived enemies.]]

Numerous tales of poison [[khilat]]s (robes of honour) have been recorded in historical, folkloric, and medical texts of British Indianists.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khilats&gt;{{cite news | first= Adrienne | last= Mayor | authorlink= Adrienne Mayor |author2=Michelle Maskiell | year= 2001 | title= Killer Khilats, Part 2: Imperial Collecting of Poison Dress Legends in India | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_112/ai_79548470/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 | accessdate = 2008-10-21 | work=Folklore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts of clothing were common in major life-cycle rituals in pre-industrial India, and these stories revolve around fears of betrayal, inspired by ancient custom of giving khilats to friends and enemies as demonstrations of a social relationship or a political alliance.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; 

In 1870, [[Norman Chevers]], M.D., a Surgeon-Major to the Bengal Medical Service, authored ''Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India'', describing unusual crimes involving poisons native to India. The book included three cases of poison khilat death, attributing the cause of one of the deaths to lethal [[vesicant]]s impregnating the fabric of the robe and entering the victim's [[sweat pore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chevers | first =  Norman | title = A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India | location = London | publisher = Thacker | year = 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American urban legends==
The theme of the poison dress appears in several American [[urban legend]]s, which were recorded in folklore collections and journal articles in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=Brunvand&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Urban Legends | first = Jan Harold | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | pages = 322 | isbn = 0-393-32358-7 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Folklorist]] [[Stith Thompson]] noted the classical prototype in these stories, "[[Shirt of Nessus]]", and assigned Motif D1402.5, "Magic shirt burns wearer up". [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] provides the summary of one of the stories:
{{cquote|Girl wears new formal gown to dance. Several times during the evening she feels faint, has escort take her outside for fresh air. Finally she becomes really ill, dies in the restroom. Investigation reveals that the dress has been the cause of her death. It had been used as the funeral dress for a young girl; it had been removed from the corpse before burial and returned to the store. The [[formaldehyde]] which the dress has absorbed from the corpse enters the pores of the dancing girl.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt;}}

Folklorist Ernest Baughman speculated that the story might have been used as adverse publicity to discredit a well-known store, since several variants of the story specifically mention the name of the store at which the dress was supposedly purchased.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt; The legend continued to be told long after its initial popularity, with "embalming fluid" sometimes replacing the formaldehyde mentioned in the earlier version.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt;  This urban legend was dramatized in the episode "[['Til Death Do We Part (CSI: NY episode)|'Til Death Do We Part]]," from the crime-scene drama, ''[[CSI: NY]]''.

Also contributing to the poison-dress theme is the prevalence of [[Smallpox blankets|smallpox-contaminated blankets]], which were given to [[Native Americans in the United States|native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/541734 |first=Adrienne |last=Mayor |authorlink=Adrienne Mayor |year=1995 |title=The Nessus Shirt in the New World: Smallpox Blankets in History and Legend |jstor=541734 |journal=Journal of American Folklore |volume=108 |issue=427 |pages=54–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Well documented examples include the [[Siege of Fort Pitt#Biological warfare involving smallpox|tainted blankets gifted to Indians at Fort Pitt]] in 1763.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

'''Poo-Chi''' (or Poochi, Poochie), one of the first generations of robopet toys, is a [[robot dog]] designed by Samuel James Lloyd and Matt Lucas, manufactured by Sega Toys, and distributed by [[Tiger Toys]].&lt;ref name="elecpets" /&gt;  Poo-Chi was released in 2000 and discontinued in 2002.

== History ==
Sega Toys' Poo-Chi hit markets on 1 April 2000, with [[Hasbro]]'s [[Tiger Electronics]] distributing the toy in all countries other than [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. Retailing at a price of 3,980 yen (then the equivalent of $38 USD) in Japan and $24.99 in the [[United States]], the toy offered significantly cheaper competition to the [[Sony AIBO|AIBO]]'s prices of up to 250,000 yen (then $2,400 USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Puppy love | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=19 January 2000 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | author=Inouye, Itsuo | pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/679642.stm | title=Robofish splash down in Tokyo | work=[[BBC News]] | date=16 March 2000 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leadsalespr"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.mimitchi.com/html/furbn147.htm | title=Poo-Chi Leads the Pack in Holiday Toy Sales | publisher=Business Wire | date=12 December 2000 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Hasbro's sales in their leading [[Furby]] line were slowing since its initial release in 1998 and sales of [[Star Wars]] branded merchandise was in decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Slow sales cause Hasbro second-quarter earnings to fall 80 percent | work=Associated Press | date=20 July 2000 | location=Pawtucket, RI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poo-Chi's release was a success, selling over 10 million units worldwide over the span of 8 months since its initial debut.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt;

Special editions of the Poo-Chi soon sprouted, such as the ''[[102 Dalmatians]]'' holiday release of three Poo-Chis resembling the characters Domino, Little Dipper, and Oddball.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cdn.media.ir.thewaltdisneycompany.com/2000/annual/ar_2000.pdf | title=The Walt Disney Company Annual Report 2000 | publisher=[[Walt Disney Company]] | accessdate=15 November 2013 | pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to special editions, an upgraded version, the Super Poo-Chi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sony hopes for success with new robotic pet | work=Bangor Daily News | date=13 October 2000 | agency=Associated Press | author=Kageyama, Yuri | pages=A9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and differing [[Dog breed|breed]]s of the Poo-Chi were released (all of which could communicate together), along with spin-offs such as the Meow-Chi and the Chirpy-Chi.&lt;ref name="leadsalespr" /&gt; Miniature versions were featured as toys in the [[McDonald's]] [[Happy Meal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.promoduck.com/PressRelease/html/press_con01a038.htm | title=Tiger Robo-Chi Pets™ Arrive at McDonald's February 23 Happy Meal Event to Feature Newest Cyber-Pal, Chirpy-Chi | date=20 February 2001 | accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poo-Chi stopped selling in 2002, having been replaced by [[FurReal Friends]].

==Description==
The original Poo-Chi had a gray body with ears, tail, and leg joints of either purple, blue, pink or green colour. With four legs allowing the toy to stand up or lie down, it utilized a red [[LED]] display as eyes to show [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.robotsandcomputers.com/robots/manuals/Poo-Chi.pdf | title=Poo-Chi Instruction Manual | publisher=Tiger Electronics | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldrobots"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theoldrobots.com/smallbot34.html | title=Pio-Chi Robot Dog by Tiger Electronics Ltd - The Old Robots Web Site | publisher=The Old Robots Web Site | accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Editions===
The Christmas Special Edition Poo-Chi was offered for a limited time, coloured red and white with snowflake designs throughout the body, ears, with an interactive bone included in its seasonal box. The toy had its list of songs updated to include Christmas music. The Christmas Special Edition was only available in a handful of countries and retailed for 2–3 months, making it the rarest and most collectible of the genre with collectors realizing in excess of $300 USD for boxed Christmas Poo-Chi units.

===Speech===
Poo-Chi spoke using prerecorded sounds such as barks, whines, and growls. Due to limitations of the toy's technology, most of the sounds were rendered as beeps rather than a realistic sound effect. Poo-Chi could also "bark" songs, which could be prompted by pressing the button on the top of its head.

===Spin-offs===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Multiple spin-offs of the Poo-Chi were produced. All were based on different animals, other than the Super Poo-Chi, a larger version of the original toy.

* Meow-Chi - a robotic [[cat]].
* Super Poo-Chi - a larger version of the original toy.
* Dino-Chi - a robotic [[dinosaur]], with two types produced: the Dino-Chi [[Tyrannosaurus|T. Rex]] and the Dino-Chi [[Pterodactylus|Pterodactyl]].
* Chirpy-Chi - a robotic [[bird]].
* Petal-Chi - a robotic [[flower]] or [[plant]].
* Baby-chi - a robotic [[baby]].
* Botster - a regular robot.

===Songs===
The Poo-Chi could "sing" one of 6 songs when following the light sensor in its nose being activated, the touch sensor on its head was pressed. The toy would then emit a series of high-pitched beeps. The user could afterwards press the touch sensor, the number of times the sensor having been pressed corresponding to a different tune. The different songs the Poo-Chi could play are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Number of sensor presses
! Song title
|-
| 1
| [[Wedding March (Mendelssohn)|The Wedding March]]
|-
| 2
| Camptown Races
|-
| 3
| Bingo
|-
| 4
| I've Been Working on the Railroad/Home On the Range
|-
| 5
| Beethoven No.9                              
|-
| 6
| When the Saints Come Marching In
|}

Poo-Chi would often sing "[[Ode to Joy]]" by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] when happy, and if another Poo-Chi or Robo-Chi pet was nearby (such as a Meow-Chi), that other Robo-Chi would begin to sing "Ode to Joy" as well, though the playback would not be synchronized.

==Defining the original print==
Early in its history, the Print Council of America was focused on advocacy and raising the visibility of [[printmaking]] as a [[fine art]] medium. The 1961 publication ''What is an Original Print?: Principles Recommended by the Print Council of America'' offered guidelines to the complex topic of originality and printmaking during that era. Initially, these efforts at a standard definition were controversial among some print experts,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Current activities and services==
Currently, the Print Council of America serves as a professional organization for print [[curator]]s and has been active in the publication of books and research aids to encourage and professionalize the study and care of prints. Their primary vehicle is the ''Search Index to Print Catalogues Raisonnes'', a free service which directs scholars and students to the oeuvre catalogues of thousands of artists.This search index has been called "a very useful source for identifying print catalogues raisonnés".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

'''''Puddle''''' is a [[woodcut]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in February 1952.

Since 1936, Escher’s work had become primarily focused on [[Paradox|paradoxes]], [[tessellation]] and other abstract visual concepts. This print, however, is a realistic depiction of a simple image that portrays two perspectives at once. It depicts an unpaved road with a large pool of water in the middle of it at twilight. Turning the print upside-down and focusing strictly on the reflection in the water, it becomes a depiction of a forest with a full moon overhead. The road is soft and muddy and in it there are two distinctly different sets of tire tracks, two sets of footprints going in opposite directions and two bicycle tracks. Escher has thus captured three elements: the water, sky and earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9725">[[Image:Lascaux painting.jpg|thumb|Rock art paintings of [[aurochs]] at the Upper Palaeolithic cave site of [[Lascaux]] in southwestern France.]]
[[Rock art]] has been produced in Europe since the Upper Palaeolithic era through to recent centuries. It is found in all of the major regions of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-Palaeolithic period, during later prehistory, regional variants grew up across the continent, being produced by settled, agricultural communities. 

Scholarly interest in European rock art began in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The defining characteristic of rock art is the fact that it is placed on natural rock surfaces; in this way it is distinct from artworks placed on constructed walls or free-standing sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, rock art is a form of landscape art, and includes designs that have been placed on boulder and cliff faces, cave walls and ceilings, and on the ground surface.&lt;ref name="Whitley 3"&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art is a global phenomenon, being found in many different regions of the world.&lt;ref name="Whitley 1"&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various different forms of rock art. This includes ''[[pictographs]]'', which were painted or drawn onto the ''panel'' (rock surface), ''[[petroglyphs]]'', which were carved or engraved onto the panel, and ''[[earth figures]]'' such as earthforms, intaglios and geoglyphs. Some archaeologists also consider pits and grooves in the rock, known as ''cups'', ''rings'' or ''cupules'', as a form of rock art.&lt;ref name="Whitley 3"/&gt;

Although there are some exceptions, the majority of rock art whose creation was ethnographically recorded had been produced during rituals.&lt;ref name="Whitley 3"/&gt; As such, the study of rock art is a component of the archaeology of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whi05|Whitley 2005]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic field of [[rock art studies]], a form of [[archaeology]], investigates instances of past rock art to learn about the societies that produced it.

==Upper Palaeolithic rock art==
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

==Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age rock art==
===Atlantic European rock art===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
Various different forms of late prehistoric rock art have been found in [[Atlantic Europe]], the coastal region that extends from the [[Straight of Gibraltar]] up to the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra98|Bradley 1998]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. pp. 493&amp;ndash;494.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neolithic and Bronze Age rock art in the British Isles]] comprises primarily of [[cup and ring marks]].

During the Early Bronze Age, which lasted from ''circa'' 2300 through to ''c''.1500 BCE, various depictions of weaponry were engraved onto rock surfaces across Atlantic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra98|Bradley 1998]]. p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern European rock art===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}
There are hundres of rock art sites that represent variations of figures, traditions and chronological differences in Northern Europe. Cave paintings, rock paintings and especially open air sites are found on the continent, the british isles and all over the Scandinavian peninsula as well as in Finland and Russia. Perhaps the most famous site is the [[Rock carvings at Alta]] in the north of Norway with the largest collection of hunter gatherer rock art in northern Europe.

===Alpine rock art===
[[File:Scena di caccia al cervo - Seradina R 12 - Capo di Ponte (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Engraved deer-hunting scene at [[Valcamonica]].]]
Rock art engraved on open surfaces, rather than inside shelters or caves, was also produced in the mountainous [[Alps|Alpine region]] during later prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; Found predominantly in the southern part of the Alps, in modern-day Italy and France, few examples of rock art have been identified from the northern slopes of the region, in what is now Switzerland and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; Many engravings have been found in the region, along with a few rock paintings (as at Abri Faravel&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wal16|Walsh et al. 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and as such, scholars in rock art studies have divided the known collection into between 20 and 30 "regions" of Alpine rock art, the number depending upon how neighbouring occurrences are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; These petroglyphs were usually carved with a fine-line technique which meant that they are only a few millimetres thick, and were typically produced on metamorphic rocks, sandstones and schists which are found sporadically across the Alpine chain, rather than on the more common calcareous rocks from which the mountains are geologically formed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Like with most rock art across the world, there are no physical-science methods yet available with which to accurately date the Alpine images, and instead archaeologists have relied on a relative chronology by comparing the pictures with artefacts that have been more securely dated.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two most prominent concentrations of rock art in the Alps are found at [[Mont Bégo]] in France and the valleys of Valcamonica and Valtellina in Italy, both of which far outnumber other areas for the amount of art that they contain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arc04|Arca 2004]]. p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; At Mount Bego, in southwest France, near the Italian border, over 30,000 illustrated figures have been discovered in the valleys and outliers surrounding the mountain, situated on the high-altitude slopes far above the agricultural land. Archaeologists have dated to the images to the Copper and Bronze Ages, between 2500 and 1700 BCE, because many of the figures are depicted holding daggers and halberds which are stylistically consistent with this period. Similarly, many of the images depict oxen and ploughshares, meaning that they must have been produced following the adoption of agriculture during the Neolithic. It is believed that they all date from the same period, because they are all stylistically consistent and are in a similar state of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. pp. 504&amp;ndash;505, 507&amp;ndash;510.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Valcamonica and Valtellina, two lengthy neighbouring valleys in the south-centre of the Alps, archaeologists have estimated the existence of around 300,000 figures, with depictions or humans and other animals, footprints, steep-roofed buildings, wheeled carts, boats and a large number of geometric shapes, lines, spirals and crosses. Although a few of the images found in Valtellina have been tentatively suggested to be post-glacial in date due to the Palaeolithic animal style they depict, the overwhelming majority of artworks are considered to be late prehistoric. Some of the motifs, such as those of humans in an ''orant'' posture with arms upraised in prayer or adoration, have been considered Neolithic, with others being attributed to the Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages, the latter being the most numerous. Some of the illustrations have been dated to the historic period, having been produced by the local [[Camuni]] people who lived within the [[Roman Empire]], and subsequently also from the Medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bra01|Bradley, Chippindale and Helskog 2001]]. pp. 504&amp;ndash;505, 510&amp;ndash;513.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Sasaki was founded in 1953 by acclaimed landscape architect, [[Hideo Sasaki]] in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], while he served as a professor and landscape architecture department chair at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/25/arts/hideo-sasaki-80-influential-landscape-architect-dies.html|title=Hideo Sasaki, 80, Influential Landscape Architect, Dies|last=Raver|first=Anne|date=2000-09-25|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sasaki partnered with Peter Walker in 1957 the firm became Sasaki, Walker and Associates. In 1959, Walker opened up a new branch of the firm in San Francisco, and in 1964 the Watertown location was renamed Sasaki, Dawnson &amp; DeMay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sasaki, Dawson &amp; DeMay {{!}} The Cultural Landscape Foundation| accessdate = 2018-01-06| url = https://tclf.org/pioneer/sasaki-dawson-demay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasaki, Dawson and DeMay redesigned [[Copley Square]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = A Unique Job: Expanding a Famed Architect's Legacy| work = The Boston Globe (Boston, MA)| accessdate = 2018-01-06| date = 2017-10-24| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P4-1954151614.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Sasaki| first = Dawson| title = Copley Square| accessdate = 2018-01-06| date = 1858| url = http://dome.mit.edu/handle/1721.3/28767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm's work includes Christopher Columbus Park (also called the Waterfront Park) and the plaza at the [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist|First Church of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = MUM'S THE WORD AT SMITH - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA) {{!}} HighBeam Research| accessdate = 2018-01-06| url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8575742.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sasaki won an international design competition for the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]] Green. The design included over 1,700 acres of woods and wetlands.

The '''Symphony No.&amp;nbsp;1''' (originally titled: '''''Sinfonia'''''), [[Opus number|Op]].&amp;nbsp;24, is an orchestral composition by the Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]], who began writing the piece in 1970 when the [[Helsinki|City of Helsinki]] announced a composers' competition to mark the inauguration of [[Finlandia Hall]]. Completing the symphony in 1971, Sallinen was awarded First Prize in the contest; the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] and its music director, [[Jorma Panula]], premiered the work at Finlandia Hall during the 2&amp;nbsp;December inaugural festivities.

The textiles of [[Sumba]] (an island in eastern [[Indonesia]]) represents the means by which the present generation passes on its messages to future generations. The pieces are deeply personal, follow distinct systematic form but show the individuality of the weaver and the village from which they are produced. Internationally, Sumba's textiles are collected as examples of the highest quality textile design and are found in the major museums of the world as well as the homes of collectors. One hundred years ago the Dutch were already exporting '''textiles''' from the island '''of [[Sumba]]'''. Today great numbers are still produced by a relatively small number of women, mainly on the eastern coastal districts of the island. These cloths are made not only for export out of Sumba, but also for trade with people from the interior for ritual use, where by custom the process of ''[[ikat]]'' was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger. M. 1979 Splendid Symbols, Textiles and Tradition in Indonesia.The Textile Museum, Washington DC. Library of Congress No 79-50373. p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance and symbolism of the textiles in Sumba==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ceremoniële schouder- of heupdoek voor mannen TMnr 5977-43.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hinggi.]]

Since textiles are the products of Sumba women, they are understood as the tangible representations of the female element of the bipartite universe. On Sumba this male-female complementarity is encapsulated in the notion of the Highest Being who is the Father Sun-Mother Moon and the Creator/Weaver of human life. The [[Sumba people|Sumbanese]] believe a person is able to acquire the special powers and qualities of certain creatures when textiles displaying such motifs are worn.&lt;ref&gt;Adams M.J., System and Meaning in East Sumba Textile Design: A Study in Traditional Indonesian Art, New Haven, Southeast Asian Cultural report Series 16, Yale University.  1969:29&lt;/ref&gt; Although different cloths are appropriate apparel for men and women, textiles are seen collectively as a female component of their cosmos. Cloth is a symbol of the woman's family, the wife givers, who are ritually superior on ceremonial occasions. In ritual exchanges textiles are a prominent part of reciprocal gift for male objects such as metal, buffalo and ivory from the man's family, whose burden in gift giving is heavier because of the inferior status of the wife taker to that of the wife giver. is &lt;ref&gt;Maxwell R. (1990), ''Textiles of Southeast Asia; Tradition, Trade and Transformation''. Oxford University Press Australia. {{ISBN|0195531868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textiles on Sumba are both clothing and the currency of traditional ceremonial exchange: Many fine folded cloths must be presented at each marriage as
part of a counter-payment for a bride wealth paid in horses, buffalo, and gold, and at each funeral as a sign of mourning and later also a counter-payment for
animals contributed to the slaughter. Cloth is also given to show that a contract is binding ("you sign your name when you accept the cloth"), as a kind of
"interest payment" to ask for more time to discharge a debt, and as a gesture of thanks for a kindness extended long ago and never reciprocated. Cloth in this
sense is counted; its value is estimated on the basis of its materials, workmanship, and design, and its relative worth in relation to the livestock traded for
it. These estimations place indigo dyed cloths at higher rank than those made with commercial dyes, place hand-spun thread ahead of store-bought threads,and overall value labor-intensive techniques of supplementary we! and ikat dyeing over simpler and faster designs.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Janet. In the Realm of the Indigo Queen Dyeing, Exchange Magic, and the Elusive Tourist Dollar on Sumba. Chapt 4 in What's the Use of Art? Asian Visual and Material Culture in Context. Honolulu, Hawaii: University of Hawaii pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weaving and dying techniques==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Ikat techniek in Lewa Kambera Oost Soemba en vrouw met haarkam (hai kara jangga) TMnr 10014278.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Young woman from Kambera with a cloth tied and ready for dying, 1931.]]
The dominant weaving technique for the ''hinggi'' is  [[ikat]] of the warp although supplementary weave of both the warp and weft are sometimes used in these cloths. The ends of the more important cloths are finished with a [[tapestry]] weave. The process of dying pattern of a particular cloth involves first setting the warp up on a frame which gives us the length of the cloth. In most cases one end mirrors the other and the left side of a panel mirrors the right. Two identical panels are dyed, woven and then joined. The technique is very labour-intensive and so the designer, usually the weaver, double up on the setting out and dying so that two cloths are constructed at the same time.

The women's skirts, the  ''lau'', are a plain weave with a variety of decorative techniques added. Embroidery, applique of shells and beads, supplementary weave of the weft and occasionally ikat.

==Images used within the textiles==
[[File:Detail from Sumba hinggi 2.JPG|left|thumb|Hinggi detail of a gecko.]]
The identifiable creatures that appear on royal Sumba textiles include cocks or chickens (animals of ritual sacrifice), deer with their spreading horns. Shrimps and lobsters symbolize rebirth—the shrimps because they shed and replace their shells, the lobsters because they can regenerate their limbs in a process of renewal are symbolic of a ruler's powers.&lt;ref&gt;Adams M.J., System and Meaning in East Sumba Textile Design: A Study in Traditional Indonesian Art, New Haven, Southeast Asian Cultural report Series 16, Yale University.  1969&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinggi==
[[File:Ikat cloth from Sumba, detail.JPG|thumb|right|Geometrically patterned Ikat woman's dress of thick cotton. Sumba, mid 20th century.]]
''Hinggi'' are large blankets decorated with  warp [[ikat]] used for ''adat'' exchanges and as a man's clothing. They are usually made in pairs, one cloth is wrapped around the hips and the other thrown over the shoulder. When destined for the nobility the cloths are usually larger and are dyed with red and indigo. The color and motif combine to indicate the status of the wearer as well as the giver. In the past only the nobility had the right to the use and wear such cloth. They were seen only at great festivals, where they were worn by nobles, their family and retainers as a sign of their power and wealth, which was concomitant with the wealth of the total society.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, M.J. Syst 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the designs refer to local objects such as horses, roosters, deer snakes fish and prawn. Other specifically [[Sumba people|Sumbanese]] images include the skull tree and the ''[[mamuli]]'', a gold ornament which is also a rank indicator. As well as these, foreign symbols such as dragons taken from Chinese ceramics and the rampant lions of the Dutch coat of arms are sometimes incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger. M. 1979 Splendid Symbols, Textiles and Tradition in Indonesia.The Textile Museum, Washington DC. Library of Congress No 79-50373. p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lau==
[[File:Indonesian woman's ceremonial skirt.jpg|thumb|right|Lau Hada from about 1900, Indianapolis Museum of Art No 33.682.]]
'''''Lau''''' are the tubular skirts worn by women. The same motifs that appear on a man's hinggi reappear on the women's skirts, but the range of techniques used are greater than ikat alone. It includes designs worked by a [[supplementary weave]] warp, embroidery, application of beads and shells and occasionally tufting with supplementary yarns. These figures appear in light yarns on the plain background cloth of dark blue, red, brown or black.

'''''Lau pahudu''''' is the name for a skirt worked with the supplementary warp. '''''Lau hada''''' is the name for the skirt worked with beads and shells. They are also known as ''pakiri mbola'' which means "at the bottom of the basket" and refers to the way they are carried when bought as part of marriage gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Gittinger.

'''Third party standing''' is a term of the [[law]] of [[civil procedure]] that describes when one party may file a [[lawsuit]] or assert a defense in which the rights of third parties are asserted. In the [[United States]], this is generally prohibited, as a party can only assert his or her own rights and cannot raise the claims of right of a third party who is not before the court.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''Kowalski v. Tesmer'', 543 U.S. 125, 129 (2004) ("We have adhered to the rule that a party ‘generally must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.’ ”).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several exceptions to this doctrine.

For example, a third party may sue where he has interchangeable economic interests with the injured party, as in the case of a bookseller suing to enforce the rights of his patrons to purchase a particular book from his store.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A third party may assert the rights of another person in order to vindicate them when the other person is unable to do so. For example, the [[US Supreme Court]] has held that a white person bound by a restrictive covenant not to sell realty to a black person may assert the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment rights of black persons not before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2966847168977034831&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr ''Barrows v. Jackson''], 346 U.S. 249 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

A party that represents a class in a certified [[class action]] suit may continue to represent the class even where their own stake in the suit has dissipated. A woman seeking to challenge the constitutionality of a law that prevents divorcees from remarrying within a year may continue to represent the class of similarly situated persons, even if the year passes and she is able to remarry before the case has been decided.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==General rule==

Ordinarily, one may not claim standing in a court to vindicate the constitutional rights of some third party.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Comm. v. McGrath'', 341 U.S. 123, 149-154 (1951) (concurring opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; The requirement of standing is often used to describe the constitutional limitation on the jurisdiction of federal courts to "cases" and "controversies."&lt;ref&gt;See ''Coleman v. Miller'', 307 U.S. 433, 464 (1939)(concurring opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the jurisdictional requirement, the [[US Supreme Court]] has developed a complementary rule. one of self-restraint for its own governance. which ordinarily precludes a person from challenging the constitutionality of state action by invoking the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ashwander v. TVA''36, 297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936) (concurring opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; The common thread underlying both requirements is that a person cannot challenge the constitutionality of a statute unless he shows that he himself is injured by its operation.&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows v. Jackson'', 346 U.S. 249 (1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of application of this rule are:

* ''Frothingham v. Mellon'', 262 U. S. 447, 486-489 (1923): federal taxpayer sought to challenge a federal statute in the enforcement of which federal revenues were applied,
* ''Doremus v. Board of Ed.'', 342 U.S. 429, 434 (1952): state taxpayer unable to show that there was "a measurable appropriation or disbursement of .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. funds occasioned solely by the [state] activities complained of."
* ''Tileston v. Ullman'', 318 U.S. 44 (1943): doctor sought a declaratory judgment that a state statute would deprive certain of his patients of their lives without due process of law),
* ''Tyler v. Judges of Court of Registration'', 179 U.S. 405, 410 (1900): landowner sought to challenge the notice provisions for a land registration proceeding in which he had not made himself a party, although he had notice of the proceedings, and even though "his interest in the land would remain unaffected" if the act were subsequently declared unconstitutional.
* ''Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes'', 302 U.S. 464, 478-480 (1938): "John Doe, let us suppose, is engaged in operating a grocery store. Richard Roe, desiring to open a rival and competing establishment, seeks a loan from a manufacturing concern which, under its charter, is without authority to make the loan. The loan, if made, will be ''ultra vires''." John Doe has no standing to sue to enjoin the loan.

==Vicarious standing==

There are recognized exceptions to the general rule in cases where the party whose rights are being invoked is not in a position to assert those right effectively. At times, "it would be difficult if not impossible for the persons whose rights are asserted to present their grievance before any court."&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows'' at 257.&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases the courts often allow third parties vicariously to vindicate the rights of a non-litigant rights possessor.

In ''Pierce v. Society of Sisters'',&lt;ref&gt;268 U. S. 510 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt; a state statute required all parents to send their children to public schools. A private and a parochial school brought suit to enjoin enforcement of the act on the ground that it violated the constitutional rights of parents and guardians. No parent or guardian to whom the act applied was a party or before the Court. The Court nonetheless held that the statute was unconstitutional because it "unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control."&lt;ref&gt;''Pierce'' at 534-535.&lt;/ref&gt; The schools were thus permitted to assert in defense of their property rights the constitutional rights of the parents and guardians.

In ''Barrows v. Jackson'', Jackson owned a house in Los Angeles the deed to which contained a covenant against selling to Negroes. Jackson breached the covenant by selling to a Negro and Barrows sued. The courts ruled against enforcement despite Barrows's argument that Jackson was asserting the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights of persons not before the court. The Court said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relation between the coercion exerted on respondent [Jackson] and her possible pecuniary loss thereby is so close to the purpose of the restrictive covenant, to violate the constitutional rights of those discriminated against, that respondent is the only effective adversary of the unworthy covenant in its last stand. She will be permitted to protect herself and, by so doing, close the gap to the use of this covenant, so universally condemned by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows'' at 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''NAACP v. Alabama'',&lt;ref&gt;357 U.S. 449 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; the state had obtained a court order requiring the NAACP to produce membership lists. Upon its refusal to comply, the NAACP was held in contempt. The Supreme Court reversed, permitting the NAACP to assert the rights of its members and holding that the state court order violated their First Amendment right of freedom of association. The Court noted that because litigation by individual NAACP members would require disclosure of their identity and thus destroy the freedom of association threatened by the court order, the NAACP was a proper party to act on the members' behalf to assert their constitutional rights.

In ''Griswold v. Connecticut,''&lt;ref&gt;381 U.S. 479 (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; a doctor and  a birth control official who had distributed contraceptives were prosecuted under an aiding and abetting statute as accessories to the crime of using birth control devices. The Court permitted the defendants to assert the privacy rights of the third-party contraceptives recipients because of the professional relationship between the defendants and the third parties, and because the recipients' rights would be diluted were the defendants not allowed to assert them.

In ''Craig v. Boren'',&lt;ref&gt;429 U.S. 190 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; a liquor vendor and a young man challenged the constitutionality of an Oklahoma statute that prohibited the sale of 3.2% beer to males under 21 years of age and females under 18 years of age. The Court held that the liquor vendor, subject to sanctions and loss of license for violation of the statute, was a proper party in interest to object to the enforcement of the allegedly discriminatory law, because obedience to the law would cause loss of sales and disobedience risked sanctions from the state. "Accordingly," the Court explained, "vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function."&lt;ref&gt;''Craig'' at 194.&lt;/ref&gt; It is crucial to the vendor's standing that its failure to prevail in the litigation "will materially impair the ability of males 18-20 years of age to purchase 3.2% beer despite their classification by an overt gender-based criterion."&lt;ref&gt;''Craig'' at 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, these cases require the person asserting a third party's rights to be injured in some way by the rights violation. In ''Barrows'', it was being required to pay damages for violating the racial covenant; in ''NAACP'', contempt; in ''Griswold'', criminal prosecution as an aider and abettor. In cases where no such injury is threatened, the courts tend to deny standing.

In ''Kowalski v. Tesmer'',&lt;ref&gt;543 U.S. 125 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court denied standing to Michigan attorneys who sued to challenge state law that restricted appointment of appellate counsel for indigent defendants who had pleaded guilty. The attorneys asserted that the indigent defendants' constitutional rights were being denied. The Court said that its cases had held that a party seeking third-party standing must make two showings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;First, we have asked whether the party asserting the right has a "close" relationship with the person who possesses the right. Second, we have considered whether there is a "hindrance" to the [rights] possessor's ability to protect his own interests.&lt;ref&gt;''Kowalski'' at 130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The attorneys in this case invoked the potential attorney-client relationship to demonstrate the requisite closeness"

&lt;blockquote&gt;Specifically, they rely on a future attorney-client relationship with as yet unascertained Michigan criminal defendants "who will request, but be denied, the appointment of appellate counsel, based on the operation" of the statute. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The attorneys before us do not have a "close relationship" with their alleged "clients"; indeed, they have no relationship at all.&lt;ref&gt;''Kowalski'' at 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court also ruled that it perceived no hindrance to the indigent defendants' asserting their constitutional rights for themselves. The attorneys argued that, without counsel, unsophisticated, ''pro se'' criminal defendants could not "coherently advance the substance of their constitutional claim." The Court rejected that claim. It said that "we do not think that the lack of an attorney here is the type of hindrance necessary to allow another to assert the indigent defendants' rights."&lt;ref&gt;''Kowalski'' at 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] concurred in the judgment but filed an opinion protesting what he considered to be past excesses of the Court in allowing third-party assertions of constitutional rights:

*  "that beer vendors have standing to raise the rights of their prospective young male customers"&lt;ref&gt;''Craig v. Boren'', 429 U.S. 190, 192-197 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that criminal defendants have standing to raise the rights of jurors excluded from service"&lt;ref&gt;''Powers v. Ohio'', 499 U.S. 400, 410-416 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that sellers of mail-order contraceptives have standing to assert the rights of potential customers"&lt;ref&gt;''Carey v. Population Services Int'l'', 431 U.S. 678, 682-684 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;
* "that distributors of contraceptives to unmarried persons have standing to litigate the rights of the potential recipients"&lt;ref&gt;''Eisenstadt v. Baird'', 405 U.S. 438, 443-446 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; and 
* "that white sellers of land have standing to litigate the constitutional rights of potential black purchasers"&lt;ref&gt;''Barrows v. Jackson''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], with whom Justices [[John Paul Stevens]] and [[David Souter]] joined, dissented. They argued that only "prudential considerations" rather than constitutional ones prevented allowing the attorneys to assert the prisoners' rights. They said the attorneys had an economic interest in the issue because they "would earn less for representation of indigent appellants than they earned in years prior to the cutback on state-funded appeals." They also asserted that the distinction between existing and prospecting clients was unwarranted since in many cases prospective sellers (such as the beer vendor in ''Craig'', the schools in ''Pierce'', etc.) were allowed to assert the rights of hypothetical customers. As for the hindrance issue, they took issue with the majority's assertion that indigent, uneducated defendants would not face serious obstacles to acting ''pro se''.

==Organizational standing==

Many organizations, such as [[trade union]]s, can also assert third party standing to represent their members. In ''Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the interests it seeks to protect are germane to their organization's purpose and neither the claim asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.

There are exceptions to the Third Party Standing rule, such as overbreadth&lt;ref&gt;" Ordinarily, challengers to a law are not permitted to raise the rights of third parties and can only assert their own interests," but so-called "overbreadth is an exception to the usual rules of standing." See generally Monaghan, ''Third Party Standing'', 84 {{smallcaps|Colum. L. Rev.}} 277 (1984); Note, ''Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii'', 88 {{smallcaps|Harv. L. Rev}}. 423 (1974). But see Monaghan, ''Overbreadth,'' 1981 {{smallcaps|Sup. Ct. Rev}}. 1 (arguing that overbreadth involves first-party, not third-party standing, because the litigant's own conduct may only be regulated by a valid rule of law).&lt;/ref&gt; and vagueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|K. M. Sullivan and G. Gunther, Constitutional Law}} 1335 (15th Ed. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party standing in intellectual property law==

In patent and copyright cases, courts have at times allowed third-party standing to would-be sellers of goods or services to possessors of rights under patent or copyright law who were not situated in a way to assert the rights themselves.

For example, the owner of patented equipment (such as part of a car) has a right to repair it to keep it in good order. The US Supreme Court has held that a vendor of parts needed for this purpose may assert that right in defense against an infringement claim by the holder of patent rights on the equipment.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.]]'', 365 U.S. 336 (1961); see also ''Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.'', 377 U.S. 476 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus. US patent law permits a third party to assert the repair rights of the non-party owner of those rights.

In the UK, where such parts may be protected by a copyright on the drawings for the parts, the House of Lords has held that the [[Doctrine of non-derogation from grants|doctrine against derogation from grants]] may be invoked by a seller of spare parts (such as a tailpipe for a car).&lt;ref&gt;''[[British Leyland Motor Corp. v. Armstrong Patents Co.]]'', [1986] 1 All ER 850, [1986] AC 577 (H.L.). Lord Bridge observed in his speech in that case, “What the owner needs, if his right to repair is to be of value to him, is the freedom to acquire a previously manufactured replacement exhaust system in an unrestricted market.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in cases of unlawful patent tying the courts allow interloping would-be suppliers of the tied article to assert the rights of purchasers of the product subjected to the tie in order to aid them to escape from the tying.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co''., 314 U.S. 488, 494 (1942). The Supreme Court said in that case that the reason for allowing interloping suppliers to assert the illegality of a tie-in as a bar to recovery of infringement damages against them when the patentee imposing the tie sues them for patent infringement is this: "It is the adverse effect upon the public interest of a successful infringement suit in conjunction with the patentee’s course of conduct which disqualifies him to maintain the suit."&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in [[Exhaustion doctrine under U.S. law#Standing or right to assert exhaustion|''Helferich Patent Licensing, LLC v. New York Times Co.'']],&lt;ref&gt;778 F.3d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Federal Circuit]] denied standing to assert the [[exhaustion doctrine]] to a seller of services (Internet news stories) to purchasers of patented equipment (smartphones) on two principal grounds:

First, the defendant seller was not itself a purchaser from the plaintiff patentee. The court ruled that the exhaustion doctrine may be asserted only by an "authorized acquirer" — one who purchases the patented article from the patentee or its authorized seller. Thus, this court opined that third-party standing did not exist.

Second, the defendant did not show that the claims it was accused of infringing were licensed to and used by the purchasers of patented equipment. The patent claims in that case had been drafted so that one set of claims covered sending Internet stories to smartphones and a different set covered receiving stories.&lt;ref&gt;The Federal Circuit remarked that Helferich’s counsel's drafting efforts "reflect[s] painstaking efforts to distinguish the conduct of handset makers and possessors from the conduct of others, such as content providers, and to distinguish claims practiced by the former from claims practiced by the latter." 778 F.3d at 1297.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant was accused of infringing the first set, but the smartphone purchasers and the licensed smartphone manufacturers who sold to them used the second set. The court said that the defendant had not shown that the licensed claims embodied substantially the same invention as the patent claims under which the defendant was sued, so that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply. This is a ruling that the exhaustion doctrine does not apply in these circumstances rather than a ruling on standing.

The '''University of Chicago Press''' is the largest and one of the oldest [[university press]]es in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-29487771_ITM|title=The University of Chicago Press Selects Rightslink(R) For Online Copyright Permissions|date=February 5, 2007|publisher=Business Wire|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated by the [[University of Chicago]] and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', numerous academic journals, and advanced monographs in the academic fields.

One of its quasi-independent projects is the [[BiblioVault]], a digital repository for scholarly books.

The Press building is located just south of the [[Midway Plaisance]] on the University of Chicago campus.

==History==
[[File:University of Chicago, Harper Library.jpg|thumb|University of Chicago, [[University of Chicago Library|Harper Library]]]]
The University of Chicago Press was founded in 1891, making it one of the oldest continuously operating university presses in the United States. Its first published book was Robert F. Harper's ''Assyrian and Babylonian Letters Belonging to the Kouyunjik Collections of the British Museum''. The book sold five copies during its first two years, but by 1900 the University of Chicago Press had published 127 books and pamphlets and 11 scholarly journals, including the current ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'', ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'', and  ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]''.

For its first three years, the Press was an entity discrete from the university; it was operated by the Boston publishing house [[D. C. Heath and Company|D. C. Heath]] in conjunction with the Chicago printer [[RR Donnelley|R. R. Donnelley]]. This arrangement proved unworkable, however, and in 1894 the university officially assumed responsibility for the Press.

In 1902, as part of the university, the Press started working on the ''Decennial Publications''. Composed of articles and monographs by scholars and administrators on the state of the university and its faculty's research, the ''Decennial Publications'' was a radical reorganization of the Press. This allowed the Press, by 1905, to begin publishing books by scholars not of the University of Chicago. A manuscript editing and proofreading department was added to the existing staff of printers and typesetters, leading, in 1906, to the first edition of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''.

By 1931, the Press was an established, leading academic publisher. Leading books of that era include [[Edgar J. Goodspeed|Dr. Edgar J. Goodspeed's]] ''The New Testament: An American Translation'' (the Press's first nationally successful title) and its successor, Goodspeed and J. M. Povis Smith's ''The Complete Bible: An American Translation''; [[William Craigie|Sir William Alexander Craigie's]] [[Dictionary of American English|''A Dictionary of American English on Historical Principles'']], published in four volumes in 1943; John Manly and Edith Rickert's ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', published in 1940; and  [[Kate Turabian|Kate Turabian's]] ''[[A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations]]''.

In 1956, the Press first published paperback-bound books (including the Phoenix Books series)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishinghistory.com/phoenix-books-university-of-chicago-press.html Phoenix Books (University of Chicago Press) - Book Series List] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022142804/http://www.publishinghistory.com/phoenix-books-university-of-chicago-press.html |date=2017-10-22 }}, publishinghistory.com. Retrieved 22 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; under its imprint. Of the Press's best-known  books, most date from the 1950s, including translations of the ''Complete Greek Tragedies'' and [[Richmond Lattimore|Richmond Lattimore's]] [[Iliad|''The Iliad of Homer'']]. That decade also saw the first edition of ''A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature'', which has since been used by students of [[Koine Greek|Biblical Greek]] worldwide.

In 1966, [[Morris Philipson]] began his thirty-four-year tenure as director of the University of Chicago Press. He committed time and resources to lengthening the backlist, becoming known for assuming ambitious scholarly projects, among the largest of which was ''[[Lisle Letters|The Lisle Letters]]'' — a vast collection of 16th-century correspondence by [[Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle]], a wealth of information about every aspect of sixteenth-century life.

As the Press's scholarly volume expanded, the Press also advanced as a trade publisher. In 1992, [[Norman Maclean]]'s books ''[[A River Runs Through It (novel)|A River Runs Through It]]'' and ''[[Young Men and Fire]]'' were national best sellers, and ''A River Runs Through It'' was made into a [[A River Runs Through It (film)|film]] directed by and starring [[Robert Redford]].

In 1982, Philipson was the first director of an academic press to win the ''Publisher Citation'', one of [[International PEN|PEN's]] most prestigious awards. Shortly before he retired in June 2000, Philipson received the [[Association of American Publishers|Association of American Publishers']] ''Curtis Benjamin Award for Creative Publishing'', awarded to the person whose "creativity and leadership have left a lasting mark on American publishing."

[[Paula Barker Duffy]] served as director of the Press from 2000 to 2007. Under her administration, the Press expanded its distribution operations and created the Chicago Digital Distribution Center and [[BiblioVault]]. Editorial depth in reference and regional books increased with titles such as ''[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'', Timothy J. Gilfoyle's ''Millennium Park'', and new editions of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the [[A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations|Turabian Manual]], and ''The University of Chicago Spanish Dictionary.'' The Press also launched an electronic reference work, The Chicago Manual of Style Online.

In 2014, the Press received the ''The International Academic and Professional Publisher Award'' for excellence at the [[London Book Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/awards-and-prizes/article/61786-london-book-fair-2014-excellence-award-winners-revealed.html |title=London Book Fair 2014: Excellence Award Winners Revealed |website=PublishersWeekly.com |language=en |access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Garrett P. Kiely]] became the 15th director of the University of Chicago Press on September 1, 2007. He heads one of academic publishing's largest operations, employing more than 300 people across three divisions—books, journals, and distribution—and publishing 72 journal titles and approximately 280 new books and 70 paperback reprints each year.

The Press publishes over 50 new trade titles per year, across many subject areas. It also publishes regional titles, such as ''[[The Encyclopedia of Chicago]]'' (2004), edited by James R. Grossman, Ann Durkin Keating, and Janice Reiff;&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo3617598.html Grossman, Keating, and Reiff, eds.

The Press has recently expanded its digital offerings to include most newly published books as well as key backlist titles. In 2013, Chicago Journals began offering e-book editions of each new issue of each journal, for use on e-reader devices such as [[smartphone]]s, [[iPad]], and [[Amazon Kindle]]. The contents of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' are available online to paid subscribers. The Chicago Distribution Center is recognized as a leading distributor of scholarly works, with over 100 client presses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.uchicago.edu/press/about.html "About the Press," ''University of Chicago Press'', accessed April 23, 2015.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415050133/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/press/about.html |date=April 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''unjuried''' art exhibition or festival is one where all submissions are accepted.

Within theater, it is often referred to as a [[fringe theatre|fringe festival]], following the unjuried [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

== History ==
Traditionally gatherings have had varying degrees of inclusiveness and exclusiveness, hence broadly speaking, the notion of a "[[Juried (competition)|juried]]" or "unjuried" gathering dates to prehistory. More narrowly, the notion of an unjuried exhibition arose in response to the [[Paris Salon]], which began in 1725 and was juried from 1748 onwards.
The Salon was very influential in the western world during the period 1748–1890 as an arbiter of taste, and the revolt against its strictures was a key conflict in the development of western art.
An exhibitions of works refused from the official Salon was referred to as a [[Salon des Refusés]], which became particularly prominent from 1863 onwards, when the French government under Emperor [[Napoléon III]] funded a Salon des Refusés for the large number of rejected artworks in that year.
1884 saw the formation of the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants]] (Society of Independent Artists), whose device was ''Sans jury ni récompense'' (Without jury nor awards), and which has run unjuried art exhibits from 1884 to the present day, under the title of ''Salon des Indépendants'' (Independents Salon).
The development of these rejected or unjuried exhibits was key in the development of the [[avant-garde]] in painting, particularly the [[Ecole de Paris]] (Paris School), with the SAI being particularly prominent during the [[Gilded Age]], until [[World War I]].

In theater, unjuried festivals rose to prominence in the second half of the twentieth century, most prominently in the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

== Criteria ==
Despite declaring no criteria for inclusion, some unjuried exhibits or festivals have constraints on genre. Thus, while they may accept any work of art, they may reject an object as "not art". Notoriously, [[Marcel Duchamp|Marcel Duchamp's]] ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' was rejected from an unjuried art exhibition in 1917 as "not being art" – this being a stunt staged by Duchamp to challenge the conventional (even within the avant-garde) definition of "art".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">'''Vladimir Bodiansky''' (March 25, 1894 - December 10, 1966) was a French engineer with origins in Russia and a specialty in [[modern architecture]].

==Early life and education==
Vladamir Bodiansky began his education in 1910 at the Moscow Highway Institute.  After spending four years there, Bodianksy left with a [[civil engineering]] degree in 1914, and began building railways for the Russian Protectorate of [[Bokhara]].  Because he was enrolled as a volunteer member of the Russian Cavalry, he was sent off to fight in [[World War I]] in 1915.  He fought in Russia until three months after the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Revolution]], receiving his first degree in aviation in November 1917 from the Aviation School of Tiflis. He arrived in France in January 1918, and three months later Bodiansky joined the [[French Foreign Legion]].  As a member of the Foreign Legion, Bodiansky had many different roles in the aviation division, including as a military aviator pilot, a hydroplane pilot, a seaplane pilot, and a civil aviation pilot.  He demobilised from the French Legion on November 27, 1919, however he remained in France.  He decided to attend the [[Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology|College of Aeronautics Mechanical Construction]], receiving a diploma in 1920.  He elected to apply for [[Naturalization]] on April 11, 1927 and was naturalized on June 26, 1929.  After a three-year stint in the Congo building highways, Bodianski returned to France in 1923, where he started working with design offices and aircraft companies, specifically one owned by the [[Caudron|Caudron brothers]].  From 1925 to 1930, Bondiansky worked as a project manager for the aviation studios of [[Francois Villiers]] in [[Meudon]], where he was able to take out three patents with Villier himself.  Following Villier's death, Bodiansky started designing prototypes for a two-seater fighter plane for the French Army.

==Change in career==
Due to his work in the field of aviation, Bodiansky was able to meet Marcel Lods, an architect who shared his interest in the field.  This encounter marked a change in Bodiansky's career, as he took on the role of an engineer in the field of [[architecture]].  Through Lods, Bodiansky met Eugene Mopin, an accomplished contractor who was working on making concrete for a housing complex in [[Drancy]].  Because this was the first time that Mopin was using his experimental method of construction and Bodiansky's name was associated with it, this furthered Bodiansky's role in the field of architecture.  This continued when Bodiansky began working as the head of design in Mopin's office starting in March 1933.  He worked there until July 1937, when he was hired by Lods' agency to be a salaried engineer, where he worked until July 1940.  This marked another shift in Bodiansky's career, as he then began his career as a freelance engineer.&lt;ref name=Frapier &gt;{{cite web |last=Frapier |first=Christel |title=The career of engineer Vladimir Bodiansky |journal=Proceedings of the ICE-Engineering History and Heritage |volume=165 |issue=2 |year=2012 |pages=113-121 |accessdate= 2 November 2017|doi=10.1680/ehah.8.00017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maison du Peuple==
In 1935, a contest was held to see which architect could most efficiently design a rooftop for the open air market in Rue de Lorraine.  The contest, organized by the Mayor of [[Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine|Clichy]], gave Bodiansky the opportunity to work closely with Lods again.  The two of them, along with architect Eugène Beaudouin and metal fabricator [[Jean Prouvé]], designed a market with both a ground and upper floor, along with a 1000-seat auditorium that was capable of being transformed into a movie theatre, that came to be known as the [[Maison du Peuple]].  Both the floor and the roof were retractable.  Because this idea was innovative at the time, this helped Bodiansky solidify himself as both an engineer and an architect, as his design made the market more versatile (by providing both food and entertainment).  The Maison du Peuple is now known as one of the biggest open air markets in France.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Jimmy.

==ATBAT==
[[File:Unitè d'habitation Marseille.jpg|thumb|alt=Unitè d'habitation image|Facade of Unitè d'habitation, Marseille]]
Bodiansky met [[Le Corbusier]] during the Second World War, and together they organized a team of architects and engineers to engage in the postwar reconstruction.&lt;ref name="Emanuel2016"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Emanuel|editor-first=Muriel|last=Candilis|first=Georges|title=Contemporary Architects|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n8VyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-1-349-04184-8|pages=102–103|chapter=Bodiansky, Vladimir}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the Atelier des Bâtisseurs (ATBAT, builders' workshop), an interdisciplinary research group, in 1945.&lt;ref name="FCorbu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Associations professionnelles|url=http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/zcomp/pages/AtelAtba.htm|publisher=Fondation Le Corbusier|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, Bodiansky accompanied Le Corbusier on a trip to the United States, where he was impressed with the interdisciplinary approach of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority|TVA]] projects. On their return to France Bodiansky took the leadership of ATBAT and reorganized it as a collaborative research center.&lt;ref name="Swenarton2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swenarton|first1=Mark|last2=Avermaete|first2=Tom|last3=Heuvel|first3=Dirk van den|title=Architecture and the Welfare State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UT-DBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT329|date=15 September 2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-66189-4|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the next few years, Bodiansky as head of ATBAT collaborated with Le Corbusier on the realization of some of his best-known buildings, including the [[Unité d'habitation]] in Marseille and the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Emanuel2016"/&gt;

==North African housing problem==
In the late 1940s, Bodiansky oversaw the construction of houses in [[Morocco]], an area that had been plagued with too much internal migration from nearby rural areas, leading to a shortage of houses.  Bodiansky, acting on behalf of Le Corbusier, teamed up with young architects such as [[Georges Candilis]], [[Shadrach Woods]], and Henri Pilot, and created ATBAT-Afrique, a firm designed to fix the housing problems throughout Northern Africa.  The goal of the firm was to efficiently construct projects and bring engineers and architects closer together, as well as strengthen and contribute to the reconstruction effort following [[World War II]].  Bodiansky's team was able to come up with quick and innovative housing solutions, and solved the housing problem within two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Alsaden |first=Amin |title='Casbahism' in Europe: the Journey of an Architectural Idea|website=ARCC Conference Repository|date= 2013 |accessdate=30 August 2015|url=http://www.arcc-journal.org/index.php/repository/article/view/115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Architecture Festival''' (WAF) is an annual festival and awards ceremony, one of the most important events dedicated to the architecture and development industry. The first four events were held in [[Barcelona]], from 2008 to 2011, at which point the festival moved to [[Singapore]] for four years. Since 2016, host cities have included [[Berlin]] and [[Amsterdam]]. At the festival around 200 shortlisted projects compete for awards in 31 categories.

== History ==
The World Architecture Festival was first held in 2008 as a "festival and live awards competition dedicated to celebrating and sharing architectural excellence from across the globe." The first four festivals were held in Barcelona; since 2012 the annual events have been hosted by [[Singapore]], [[Berlin]], and [[Amsterdam]]. Several hundred projects are entered in the competition for the awards and more than 200 of these are shortlisted for live presentation at the festival. All the presentations of the entries are collected in the World Buildings Directory. The architects pay a submission fee to enter a project for a WAF Award and travel to where the festival is arranged to present the project live if it is shortlisted. The entries are voluntary and the festival does not control who submits projects. In 2011 the Inside Festival (for interior architecture and design) was added in the same venue and arranged at the same time as WAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Kilde www|forfatter=John Hill|tittel=Talking WAF - Interview with Paul Finch (Email interview)|url=http://www.world-architectsXX.com/pages/waf-interview-paul-finch|utgiver=world-architects, eMagazine|dato=04.08.2013#sthash.NrKVjdbX.dpuf|besøksdato=2013-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3246">[[File:U-sin-china-painting.jpg|thumb|Example of Wu Xing Painting]]
Wǔ Xíng is a synthesis of traditional [[painting]] with its namesake philosophic tradition [[Wu Xing|Wǔ Xíng]]&amp;nbsp;– or, more specifically, the use of Chinese Xie Yi painting techniques and the metaphysics of the five Wǔ Xíng elements. Wǔ Xíng painting also inherited some traits from several [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] and [[Qi Gong]] schools. The closest in style is [[Xingyiquan]], whose 5 primary movements are balanced with the 5 elements of Wǔ Xíng. Because Wǔ Xíng painting techniques are associated foremost with [[consciousness]] and overcoming corporeal restraints, it is common to speak of the manifest [[art therapy]] influence of this method.

Because the philosophical,&lt;ref&gt;A. Scherbakov. How Wǔ Xíng Philosophical Principles are Incorporated in Wǔ Xíng Painting. "[http://usinart.ru/an-overview-of-wu-xing-painting-%e2%80%93-an-interview-with-andrey-scherbakov/]"&lt;/ref&gt; and technical components of this type of painting have been taken from [[Chinese culture]], it is common to hear it referred to as “Chinese Wǔ Xíng painting”.

Wǔ Xíng painting has a total of five brush strokes, five movements, and five types of composition, corresponding to the elements “Wood”, “Fire”, “Earth”, “Metal”, and “Water”.

Wǔ Xíng painting is [[metaphysics]]. Through Wǔ Xíng painting one can create a picture identical in its external appearance to any example of traditional [[Chinese painting]]. In this regard there is no difference between Wǔ Xíng painting and Chinese painting. Still, if one compares Wǔ Xíng painting and Guo Hua there are a number of differences in technique:
Traditional Guo Hua painting is divided into several genres: mountains and water, birds and branches, grass and insects, etc. and does not usually extend beyond these genres. Wǔ Xíng painting is not tied to any genres. Using the five brush strokes the artist can paint everything that he wants.
Traditional Chinese Guo Hua painting inherited an attachment to [[rice paper]] and [[silk]] as well as to a certain type of paint, while Wǔ Xíng has no such limitations.

The single most important thing for the artist who practices Wǔ Xíng painting is an attractive image harmoniously constructed using the Wǔ Xíng system. Everything else is secondary, including the type of artistic materials, the genre, and so on.
