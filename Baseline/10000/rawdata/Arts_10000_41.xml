      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''Access to Knowledge''' ('''A2K''') movement is a loose collection of [[civil society]] groups, [[government]]s, and individuals converging on the idea that access to [[knowledge]] should be linked to fundamental principles of [[justice]], [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], and [[economic development]].

==History ==

The [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] from 2003 is a major declaration reflecting the goals of the movement pertaining to academic publishing.

In October 2004, the [[Geneva declaration on the future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]] emerged from a call from [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] for a development agenda for the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and was supported by hundreds organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters included the [[Free Software Foundation]], with a statement ''Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation": Supporting the Geneva Declaration.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfe.org/activities/wipo/wiwo.en.html|title=FSFE - Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the proposals of the declaration was to a «call for a Treaty on Access to Knowledge and Technology. The Standing Committee on Patents and the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights should solicit views from member countries and the public on elements of such a treaty».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/futureofwipodeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared discussion platform on A2K issues is the [[mailing list]] of that name, which was initiated around discussion of the Geneva declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Formerly at https://web.archive.org/web/20090213032523/http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/, now at http://lists.keionline.org/mailman/listinfo/a2k_lists.keionline.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
A draft "A2K treaty" was later produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/a2k_treaty_may9.pdf |title=Treaty on Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed treaty is intended to ease the transfer of knowledge to developing nations, and to secure the viability of open innovation systems all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=19&amp;res=1280_ff&amp;print=0 |title=Experts Debate Access To Knowledge &amp;#124; Intellectual Property Watch |publisher=Ip-watch.org |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights debate===
Access to knowledge and science is protected by Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The article balances the right of access with a right to protection of moral and material interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 27
Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A2K academics argue that “material interests” are not simply equivalent to current intellectual property provisions, not least because these rights are saleable and transferable, and therefore not “inalienable”. The right to access is ultimately the more important part of the right. Current levels of IP protection seem out of balance with Article 27, according to A2K theorists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... in a very real sense, rights delayed are rights denied. Had access to oral rehydration therapy and second-generation vaccine technologies been delayed for twenty years ... three million children would have died. Even for less life- and-death technologies, a twenty-year delay works an immense limitation on enjoyment of the right. For cultural works, the situation is even worse; protection lasts longer than a human lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn= 1354788 |title=The Right to Science and Culture |first=Lea |last=Shaver|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1354788 |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |date=2010 |volume=1 |pages=121–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supporters==

=== Knowledge Ecology International ===
[[CP Tech]] (now [[Knowledge Ecology International]]) say: "the A2K (Access to Knowledge) movement takes concerns with copyright law and other regulations that affect knowledge and places them within an understandable social need and policy platform: access to knowledge goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ |title=Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers International===
Many different groups refer to the A2K movement. [[Consumers International]] is particularly prominent, running a dedicated domain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://a2knetwork.org/ |title=A global advocacy network for consumers in the digital age |publisher=A2Knetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030152718/http://a2knetwork.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defines the movement as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the umbrella term for a movement that aims to create more equitable public access to the products of human culture and learning. The ultimate objective of the movement is to create a world in which educational and cultural works are accessible to all, and in which consumers and creators alike participate in a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;
These goals are of interest to a broad coalition of consumer groups, NGOs, activists, Internet users and others. For many of them, coming to grips with the issues involved in the A2K movement can be daunting. These issues, including copyright and patent law reform, open content licensing, and communications rights, often involve legal and technological concepts that even specialists find difficult.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11203">'''Anson Chi''' was born in [[New York City]]. He attended Plano Senior High School at Plano, Texas, and graduated in 1996. Chi was arrested for theft in 1998 in [[San Angelo, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Shon Gables &amp; Steve Stoler, "Plano man behind explosives probe shared mistrust of government," June 22, 2012, WFAA-TV Dallas-Fort Worth, at {{cite web|url=http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625005312/http://www.wfaa.com/news/local/Plano-man-behind-explosive-probe--160054255.html |archivedate=2012-06-25 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Chi allegedly expressed support for [[Tax protester (United States)|tax protesters]] [[Edward and Elaine Brown]]. He posted a [[YouTube]] video stating that he would not file federal income tax returns or pay [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, June 22, 2012, "Officials say Texas man tried to blow up natural gas pipeline in suburban Dallas neighborhood," as published in the ''Washington Post'', at [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/officials-say-texas-man-tried-to-blow-up-natural-gas-pipeline-in-suburban-dallas-neighborhood/2012/06/22/gJQAbLVjvV_story.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, he was sentenced to three years probation in [[Orange County, California]] on a weapons charge. According to the [[Associated Press]], his three-year probation was revoked in 2009.

'''Arnór Hannibalsson''' (1934&amp;ndash;2012) was an Icelandic philosopher, historian, and translator and former professor of philosophy at the [[University of Iceland]]. He completed a master's degree in philosophy at the [[University of Moscow]] and a doctorate in philosophy at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in Scotland.

He was predominantly concerned with aesthetics, philosophy, history, [[epistemology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uni-corvinus.hu/gt/1998_1-2_en/2-04.htm |title=SOCIETY AND ECONOMY:EPISTEMOLOGY AND PRACTICE |publisher=Corvinus |accessdate=16 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and science. In 1975 he translated [[Roman Ingarden]]'s ''On the Motives which led Husserl to Transcendental Idealism'' from Polish.&lt;ref name="Loscerbo1981"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loscerbo|first=John|title=Being and Technology: A Study in the Philosophy of Martin Heidegger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWspXHZoABcC&amp;pg=PA285|accessdate=16 July 2012|date=31 July 1981|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-247-2411-6|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to journals with articles such as "Icelandic Historical Science in the Postwar Period, 1944-1957".&lt;ref name="(U.S.)Societies1958"&gt;{{cite book|title=Current digest of the Soviet press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cyUJAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=16 July 2012|year=1958|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnór had strong anti-Communist views and was said to have been "extremely critical of the Icelandic Socialists" in his 1999/2000 book ''Moskvulínan: Kommúnistaflokkur Íslands og Komintern, Halldór Laxness og Sovétríkin''.&lt;ref name="Olesen2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olesen|first=Thorsten B.|title=The Cold War and the Nordic countries: historiography at a crossroads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pClnAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=16 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=University Press of Southern Denmark|isbn=978-87-7838-857-5|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''As Nasty As They Wanna Be''''' is the third album by [[Miami bass]] group [[2 Live Crew]]. It was released on February 7, 1989 and became the group's largest seller, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1990, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] ruled that the album was legally obscene;&lt;ref&gt;''Skyywalker Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 739 F.Supp. 578 (S.D. Fla. 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; this ruling was later overturned by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luke Records, Inc. v. Navarro'', 960 F.2d 134 (11th Cir. 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first album in history to be deemed legally obscene.&lt;ref&gt;Deflem, Mathieu. 1993. [http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html "Rap, Rock, and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice."] Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Law and Society Association, Chicago, May 27–30, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

It would also be the final album to be released under the Skyywalker Records label. Following a successful lawsuit against Luther Campbell and Skyywalker Records by ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and director [[George Lucas]], the company was forced to change its name to [[Luke Records]].

The album is broken down track-by-track by [[Luther Campbell|Luke]] and Mr. Mixx in Brian Coleman's book ''[[Check the Technique]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Brian, 2007, ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies'', Villard/Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the album cover and imagery of the record were used in the music video of the song "The Rabbit" by Swedish band [[Miike Snow]].

== Obscenity trial ==
Federal district judge Jose Gonzalez ruled that the album was obscene, making it illegal in certain counties of Florida. Subsequently, on June 9, 1990, three band members were arrested, and their album seized, when they performed some tracks at a local sex club, in [[Broward County, Florida]]. In the "media circus"&lt;ref&gt;MacInnes 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; attendant on these events, only the Washington ''[[Washington City Paper|City Paper]]'', [[Tipper Gore]]'s [[Parents Music Resource Center]] and ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine published the offending lyrics. [[Christopher Hitchens]], in a column on the last of these, citing the admonition on the cover of the album—"If you don't like the record, you can kiss our mother fuckin' ass"—commented,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Precisely. It's obvious to this reviewer that the Crew should be left alone, and that their foulmouthed attitude toward the gentler sex is a good-sounding excuse for a youth-hating and surreptitiously bigoted prosecution. I don't know the private thoughts of Sheriff Nick Navarro of Broward County, but I doubt they are worth a rat's behind and see no reason why he should sublimate his own vagina-dreading disorders in this expensive and undemocratic fashion. The same applies to the preposterous Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr., who in ruling on Sheriff Navarro's raid opined that the music appeals to "the loins, not to the intellect." In fact, I think they are a pair of racist shitheads who should be told to fuck right off.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An obscenity trial followed, in which [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], addressed the court on behalf of the defendants, all of whom were eventually acquitted.

==Trivia==

'''''As Clean As They Wanna Be''''' is the clean version of [[2 Live Crew]]'s third album. The album contains a disclaimer that '"This album does not contain explicit lyrics."  The album had notably worse sales than the explicit version. However, it does contain "Pretty Woman", which is not on the explicit version. The song – a parody of the [[Roy Orbison]] hit "[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]" – resulted in a Supreme Court case, ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.]]'', which established that a commercial [[parody]] can qualify as [[fair use]]. Despite the sticker on the album cover claiming "This album does not contain explicit lyrics", the song "Break It on Down" appears in its original, explicit form. Additionally, the song "City of Boom" (which is exclusive to the clean version) contains several explicit lyrics.

'''{{lang|it|Cantastoria}}''' ({{IPA-it|ˌkantaˈstɔːrja|pron}}; also spelled '''{{lang|it|cantastorie}}''' {{IPA-it|ˌkantaˈstɔːrje|}}, '''{{lang|it|canta storia}}''' or '''{{lang|it|canta historia}}''') comes from [[Italian language|Italian]] for "story-singer" and is known by many other names around the world. It is a [[theatrical]] form where a performer tells or sings a story while gesturing to a series of images. These images can be painted, printed or drawn on any sort of material.

==Picture stories in Asia==
[[File:Wayang Beber Opened.jpg|thumb|400px|right|{{lang|id|[[Wayang beber]]}}, a Javanese {{lang|it|cantastoria}} art thought to be extinct but was rediscovered in the 1960s.]]

In 6th-century [[India]], religious tales called {{lang|sa-Latn|saubhika}}s were performed by traveling storytellers who carried banners painted with images of gods from house to house. Another form called {{lang|sa-Latn|yamapapaka}} featured vertical cloth scrolls accompanied by sung stories of the afterlife. Nowadays, this Indian traditional art is still performed by [[Chitrakar]] women of [[West Bengal]]. In [[Tibet]] this was known as {{lang|bo-Latn|ma-ni-pa}} and in [[China]] this was known as {{lang|zh-Latn|pien}}. In [[Indonesia]] the scroll was made horizontal and became the ''{{lang|ms|[[wayang]] beber}}'' and employed four performers: a man who sings the story, two men who operate the rolling of the scroll, and a woman who holds a lamp to illuminate particular pictures featured in the story. Other Indonesian theater forms such as ''{{lang|id|[[wayang]] kulit}}'', a [[shadow play]], and ''{{lang|id|[[wayang]] golek}}'', rod [[puppet]]ry, developed around the same time and are still performed today.

In [[Japan]], {{lang|it|cantastoria}} appears as {{lang|ja-Latn|[[etoki]]}} ({{lang|ja|絵解}}) or {{lang|ja-Latn|[[emaki]]}} ({{lang|ja|絵巻}}) in the form of hanging scrolls divided into separate panels, foreshadowing the immensely popular [[manga]], or Japanese [[comics]]. {{lang|ja-Latn|Etoki}} sometimes took the shape of little booklets, or even displays of [[doll]]s posed on the roadside with backgrounds behind them. In the 20th century, Japanese candymen would bicycle around with serial shows called {{lang|ja-Latn|[[kamishibai]]}} ({{lang|ja|紙芝居}}) where the story was told to a series of changing pictures that slid in and out of an open-framed box. Some {{lang|ja-Latn|kamishibai}} shows had a [[peep show]] element to them, where a viewer could pay extra to peer through a hole and see a supposed [[cultural artifact|artifact]] from the story.

==Picture stories in Europe and the Middle East==
{{Redirect|Moritat|the comic creator|Moritat (comics)|the popular song|Mack the Knife}}
[[Image:Moritatenerzähler.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a Dutch ''{{lang|nl|liedjeszanger}}'' ("song-singer") and his ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' from the 17th or 18th century]]

In 16th-century [[Italy]], prayers would often be sung in the presence of illuminated scrolls while secular society produced the ''{{lang|it|cantambanco}}'' or "singing bench" where a person would stand on a bench point to pictures with a stick.

In [[Spain]] up to the 19th century there were blind men with a young "helper" who would make a living by going from town to town where they would display illustrations and the blind man would recite/sing the story, often about truculent crimes, while his helper pointed at the illustration relevant at that point. These were called "[[:es:Romances de ciego|romances de ciego]]" (blind man stories).

The singing bench migrated northward to Central and Northern Europe where it served as sensationalist quasi-news about murder, fires, death, affairs, sex scandals and the like. Performers of such controversial bench songs were seen as vagrants and troublemakers and were often arrested, exiled, or ostracised for their activities.

In [[Persia]], {{lang|fa-Latn|parda-dari}} (compare India's {{lang|hi-Latn|paradari}}) banner artists had the foresight to paint a handsome police officer in the corner as a fail-safe against the wrath of police harassment—the narrator would be relating the tale of a hero's exploits and when a cop would appear in the crowd the narrator would point to the cop on the banner and shower the character with flattery in the context of the story.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In [[Czechoslovakia]] banner shows were called ''{{lang|cs|kramářská píseň}}''. Most of them fell into an oblivion, with the notable exception of a parody song ''[[Cannoneer Jabůrek|Cannoneer {{lang|cs|Jabůrek|nocat=y}}]]''.

In [[Hungary]] the term is ''{{lang|hu|képmutogatás}}''.

In [[Germany]] [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] [[ballad]]eers performed ''{{lang|de|Moritat}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' (bench song) banner shows for four centuries until the [[Nazi]]s banned the practice in the 1940s.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The German ''{{lang|de|Bänkelsang}}'' survives in {{lang|de|[[Bertolt Brecht]]}}'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' ({{lang-de|Die Dreigroschenoper}}) and in the performance work of {{lang|de|[[Peter Schumann]]}}.

==Picture stories elsewhere in the world==

In [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] [[Australia]] storytellers paint story sequences on tree bark and also on themselves for the purposes of performing the tale.

In the 19th century, giant scrolling [[moving panorama]] performances were performed throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]]. The 20th century has seen cantastoria employed by the radical art, theater and puppetry movements to tell stories from perspectives outside of the mainstream media, especially by the [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]. Elements of picture storytelling can also be seen in the portable [[mural]]-[[posters]] of the [[Beehive Collective]].

'''Caribbean art''' refers to the [[visual arts|visual]] (including [[painting]], [[photography]], and [[printmaking]]) as well as [[plastic arts]] (such as [[sculpture]]) originating from the islands of the Caribbean (for mainland-Caribbean see ''[[Caribbean South America]]''). Art in the Caribbean reflects thousands of years of habitation by [[Arawak people|Arawak]], [[Kalinago]], and other people of the Caribbean followed by waves of immigration, which included artists of European origins and subsequently by artists with heritage from countries all around the world (including countries in the African continent). The nature of Caribbean art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their [[personal life | lives]] in the Caribbean.

The governments of the Caribbean have at times played a central role in the development of Caribbean culture. However, some scholars and artists challenge this governmental role. Historically and in later times artists have combined British, French, Spanish, Dutch and African artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles and at other times working to promote [[Caribbean nationalism|nationalism]] by developing distinctly Caribbean styles. Caribbean art remains the combination of these various influences.

==Early influences==
[[Image:Arawak jug stvincent.png|thumb|x130px|left|''Arawak ceremonial jug (St. Vincent ca.500)'']]
The first immigrants (said to be originally from the [[Orinoco|Orinoco basin]]) to the Caribbean region were the ''"Indians"'' or Taíno (those found throughout much of the Greater and Lesser Antilles), and the Arawak (those found in South America and part of Trinidad). These early Caribbean's are supposed to have occupied the region since 2000BC. In Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, the Taíno-Arawak art has been found in stone carvings, figurines (which are essentially curvilinear) and pottery dating from the period before European contact and are said to be as old as twenty-four hundred years. These few discovered artifacts, preserved in museum collections, have contributed new culturally hybrid art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=JBMHS|first=.|title=Arawak Art and Artifacts|journal=Journal of Barbados Museum Historical Society|publisher=Barbados: Museum Historical Society|date=1960–1965|volume=27,30,32,36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until the 1950s and 1960s did a small number of Caribbean artists began to renew and in some cases re-invent indigenous art forms. Currently there are no indigenous artists practicing in any media in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Art in the colonial period (from 1496)==
[[Image:Theodor De Bry - Central America 1594.jpg|thumb|170px|right|super|Caribbean - [[Theodor de Bry|T. de Bry]] - 1594]]
The settlement in the Caribbean islands began by the Spanish on the island of Hispaniola as early as 1496. They then settled on Puerto Rico followed by Cuba. They did not colonise Trinidad until 1592. It is extremely unlikely that the Taíno-Arawak people had any input to the spaniade artistic developments since it has been estimated that their population was quickly depleted from 200,000 to as little as 500.

[[Image:Samuel de Champlain Carte geographique de la Nouvelle France.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain in 1612.]]
French settlers arrived in the Caribbean in the 1625 and established trading ports on the islands of St. Kitts, Tortuga (in 1628, now a British Virgin Island) in [[Saint-Domingue]] (later [[Haiti]]), [[Martinique]], and [[Guadeloupe]] (both in 1635). Near the end of the 17th century, the population of the [[French Caribbean]] was growing steadily but the territory was increasingly isolated from France because in 1674 the French trading company finally failed, and few artists had arrived from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Arthur P.|title=The European Nations in the West Indies, 1493&amp;ndash;1688|publisher=London: |year=1933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently little or no research has been done to highlight the early French influenced art forms originating in the Caribbean, nor to list artists who might fit within this category.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Although Trinidad was never governed by the French, the islands original settlers, the Spanish, allowed planters from the French islands to settle and develop the country from about 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moron|first=G.|title=A History of Venezuela|publisher=London: Allen and Unwin|year=1964|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of French occupation can be seen in the names of places and to a smaller extent in the laws of the country - so it is highly possible that art also may have early French influences. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

[[Image:Imported Photos 00010.JPG|thumb|''Turgoart (Haiti), Another Call From Africa, 2009'']]
According to [[Jamaica]]n art historian Petrine Archer, "there is sparse evidence of local art production in any of the islands prior to the 20th century" other than from the occasional visiting European.&lt;ref name="petrinearcher"&gt;{{cite web|last=Archer|first=Petrine|title=Caribbean Art Archives|url=http://www.petrinearcher.com/afro-caribbean-art-1914-present|publisher=PetrineArcher.com|year=1998|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haiti]] was a lone exception.

==Contemporary trends in Caribbean art==
Art made in the Caribbean by living Caribbean artists refers to a range of visual, media, performance, and other practices that are critically acclaimed. There has been much debate over whether a national style, philosophical outlook, or unified and cohesive culture exists or ever has existed within the Caribbean. Geographically it is large, with many distinct regions, and its population are diverse and made up of varying national and ethnic backgrounds. Also distinctions between "high art" and "popular" art seem to be becoming less clear, making the task of locating common characteristics of Caribbean art or culture increasingly difficult.

Tumelo Mosaka, curator at the Brooklyn Museum (NY) suggests:
{{quote|"''Today, consistent throughout most islands is the division between mainstream artist movements more closely related to European stylistic trends and often rooted in national development, and self-taught artists whose art works reflect ritual preoccupations related to spiritual movements such as [[Revivalism]], [[Santería]] and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] and less exposure to art movements abroad. More recently, contemporary artists influenced by post-modernism's concerns with identity have found ways to fuse both forms resulting in art  that appear peculiarly unique to their Caribbean experience''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosaka (curator)|first=Tumelo|title=Infinite Island (exh. cat.)|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/infinite_island/|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|date=17 Sep 2007|accessdate=10 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Mosaka, T.]]|''Brooklyn Museum (NY)''}}

There are, however, a few notable moments when Caribbean contemporary artists — as individuals or groups — have distinguished themselves through commonality, international recognition, collaboration, or "the spirit of the times".

Modern art in the Caribbean reflects an engagement with the region's cultural past. Archer describes recent trends as "a self-conscious and satirical embracing of cultural memory styled in unconventional settings, installations and off-the-wall works that straddle African traditions and European post-modern ideas of 'primitive' creativity." It is an imagery and history which is yet to be resolved.&lt;ref name="petrinearcher" /&gt;

'''Native American pottery''' is an art form with at least a 7500-year history in [[the Americas]].{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=365}} Pottery is fired ceramics with clay as a component. Ceramics are used for utilitarian cooking vessels, serving and storage vessels, pipes, funerary urns, [[censer]]s, musical instruments, ceremonial items, masks, toys, sculptures, and a myriad of other art forms.

Due to their resilience, ceramics have been key to learning more about [[Pre-Columbian cultures|Precolumbian indigenous cultures]].

==Materials and techniques==
[[File:Tile, late 19th-early 20th century, X1047.7.jpg|thumbnail|alt=Hopi Pueblo ceramic tile from the late 19th-early 20th century, in the Brooklyn Museum|Tile, Hopi Pueblo (Native American), late 19th-early 20th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The [[List of pottery terms#Clay body|clay body]] is a necessary component of pottery. Clay must be mined and purified in an often laborious process, and certain tribes have ceremonial protocols to gathering clay. Different tribes have different processes for processing clay, which can include drying in the sun, soaking in water for days, and repeatedly running through a screen or sieve. [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]] and other Pueblo pottery traditionally pound dry clay into a powder and then remove impurities by hand, then running the dry powder through a screen, mixing it with a dry temper, and then mixing water to create a plastic paste.&lt;ref name=holmes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/southwestpottery/pueblopottery.html|title=Through the Eyes of a Pot: How is Pueblo Pottery Made?|work=Lowell D. Holmes Museum of Anthropology|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209012627/http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/southwestpottery/pueblopottery.html|archivedate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparing the clay, potters spend hours wedging it to remove air pockets and humidity that could easily cause it to explode during firing. The clay then needs to "cure" over time.&lt;ref name="BerloPhillips1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berlo|first1=Janet Catherine|authorlink1=Janet Catherine Berlo|last2=Phillips|first2=Ruth Bliss|title=Native North American Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sltpV3pvZjoC|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284218-3|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Coiling (pottery)|Coiling]] is the most common means of shaping ceramics in the Americas. In coiling, the clay is rolled into a long, thin strands that are coiled upon each other to build up the shape of the pottery. While the potter builds the coils up, she also blends them together until there was no trace of the ropes of clay entwined to form the pot, no deviation in the thickness of the walls, and therefore no weaknesses. [[Potter's wheel]]s were not used prior to European contact and are only used today by a limited number of [[Native American art]]ists. [[Pinch pot]]s and other small clay objects could be formed directly by hand. [[Hohokam]] potters and their descendents in the [[American Southwest]] employed the [[paddle-and-anvil]] technique, in which the interior clay wall of a pot was supported by an anvil, while the exterior was beaten with a paddle, smoothing the surface.{{sfn|Cooper|2000|p=186}} In precontact South America, ceramics were mass-produced using molds.

[[Slip (ceramics)|Slip]] is a liquid clay suspension of mineral pigments applied to the ceramics before firing. Slips are typically red, buff, white, and black; however, [[Nazca culture]] ceramic artists in [[Peru]] perfected 13 distinct colors of slips. They also used a hand-rotated turntable that allowed all sides of a ceramic piece to be painted with ease. These were first used in 500 BCE and continue to be used today.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=69-70}} Slips can be applied overall in washes, creating large color fields, often with cloth, or they can be painted in fine detail with brushes. [[Yucca]] leaves, chewed slightly to loosen fibers, make excellent brushes that are still in use today in the American Southwest. [[Negative painting]] is a technique employed by precontact [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] potters in the [[Eastern Woodlands]], Mayan potters in Mesoamerica, and others, which involves covering the ceramic piece in beeswax or another resist, incised a design in the resist, then soaking the piece with a slip. In the firing process the resists melts away, leaving the colored design.

While still green, pottery can be incised with designs. Cords, textiles, baskets, and corncobs have been rolled over wet clay, both as a decoration and to improve heat dispersion in cooking pots. Carved wood or ceramic stamping paddles are used throughout the [[Southeastern Woodlands]] to create repeating designs. Clay can also be added to the main ceramic structure to build up designs.

Before firing, ceramics can be [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ed or polished to a fine sheen with a smooth instrument, usually a stone. [[Ceramic glaze|Glaze]]s are seldom used by indigenous American ceramic artists. Grease can be rubbed onto the pot as well.&lt;ref name=holmes/&gt;

Prior to contact, pottery was usually open-air fired or pit fired; precontact [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]] used kilns extensively. Today many Native American ceramic artists use [[kiln]]s. In pit-firing, the pot is placed in a shallow pit dug into the earth along with other unfired pottery, covered with wood and brush, or dung, then set on fire whereupon it can harden at temperatures of 1400 degrees or more. Finally, the ceramics surface is often polished with smooth stones.

===Tempers===
Tempers are non-plastic materials added to clay to prevent shrinkage and cracking during drying and firing of vessels made from the clay.&lt;ref name=MVAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceramics|url=http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/research/technologies.htm#Ceramics|work=Mississippi Valley Archaeology Center – Technologies|publisher=University of Wisconsin – La Crosse|accessdate=4 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927110643/http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/Research/technologies.htm#Ceramics|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tempers may include:

Not all Indigenous American pottery requires added tempers; some [[Hopi people|Hopi]] potters use pure [[kaolin clay]] that does not require tempering.&lt;ref name="BerloPhillips1998"/&gt; Some clays naturally contain enough temper that they do not required additional tempers. This includes mica or sand in clays used in some [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Picuris Pueblo]], and Hopi pottery,&lt;ref name=holmes/&gt; and sponge spicules in the clay used to produce the "chalky ware" of the [[St. Johns culture]].&lt;ref name=pelotes/&gt;

Ceramics are often used to identify [[archaeological culture]]s. The type of temper (or mix of tempers) used helps to distinguish the ceramics produced by different cultures during particular time periods. Grog, sand, and sandstone were all used by [[Ancestral Pueblo people]] and other Southwestern cultures.&lt;ref name="BerloPhillips1998"/&gt; Crushed bone was used as temper in at least some ceramics at a number of sites in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southeast Texas Archaeology|url=http://www.houstonarcheology.org/setexas/ceramics.html|publisher=Houston Archaeological Society|accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Southeastern United States]], the earliest ceramics were tempered with fiber such as [[Spanish moss]] and [[Serenoa|palmetto]] leaves. In Louisiana, fiber as tempering was replaced first by grog and later by shell. In peninsular Florida and coastal Georgia sand replaced fiber as tempering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF|last1=Lopez|first1=Adrienne|last2=Fullen|first2=Steve|title=Examining Pottery with Scope-On-A-Rope|url=http://appl027.lsu.edu/MNSEducation/Saturday/LA%20Indians%201.pdf|work=Adventures in Archaeology|publisher=Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science|accessdate=5 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415143643/http://appl027.lsu.edu/MNSEducation/Saturday/LA%20Indians%201.pdf|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Milanich|1994|pp=86, 94}} Still later, freshwater sponge spicules became an important temper in the "chalky ware" of the [[St. Johns culture]] in northeastern Florida.&lt;ref name=pelotes/&gt; Locally produced ceramics of the [[Lucayan people]] in the [[Bahamas]] were characterized by crushed [[conch]] shell tempering, as opposed to the quartz sand-tempered ware imported from [[Hispaniola]].&lt;ref name="Craton1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Craton|first=Michael|title=A History of the Bahamas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-jcYAAAAYAAJ|year=1986|publisher=San Salvador Press|isbn=978-0-9692568-0-9|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of temper used in ceramics was constrained by what was available, but changes in the choice of temper can provide clues to influence and trade relations between groups. Shell-tempered ware was produced sporadically in various places across the eastern United States, but in the late [[Woodland period|Woodland]] and early [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] periods it became the predominant temper used across much of the [[Mississippi Valley]] and middle [[Gulf Coast of the United States|gulf coast]], and a major defining characteristic of [[Mississippian culture pottery]].{{sfn|Weinstein|Dumas|2008|p=202}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.museumofnativeamericanartifacts.org/mississippian.html |title=Museum of Native American Artifacts-MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD 900 AD - 1450 AD|accessdate=2010-07-18}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and spread==
The earliest ceramics known from the Americas have been found in the lower [[Amazon Basin]]. Ceramics from the Caverna de Pedra Pintada, near [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém, Brazil]], have been dated to 7,500 to 5,000 [[Before Present|years ago]]. Ceramics from Taperinha, also near Santarém, have been dated to 7,000 to 6,000 years ago. Some of the [[potsherds|sherds]] at Taperinho were shell-tempered, which allowed the sherds themselves to be [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]]. These first ceramics-making cultures were fishers and shellfish-gatherers.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1996|pp=318-319}}

Ceramics appeared next across northern South America and then down the western side of South America and northward through [[Mesoamerica]]. Ceramics of the [[Alaka culture]] in [[Guyana]] have been dated to 6,000 to 4,500 years ago.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1996|pp=318-319}} Ceramics of the [[San Jacinto culture]] in [[Colombia]] have been dated to about 4530 [[Common Era|BCE]], and at [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]], also in Colombia, to about 3794 BCE. Ceramics appeared in the [[Valdivia culture]] in [[Ecuador]] around 3200 BCE, and in the [[Pandanche culture]] in [[Peru]] around 2460 BCE.{{sfn|Clark|Gosser|1995|pp=210-11}}

The spread of ceramics in Mesoamerica came later. Ceramics from [[Monagrillo (archaeological site)|Monagrillo]] in [[Panama]] been dated to around 2140 BCE, from Tronadora in [[Costa Rica]] to around 1890 BCE, and from Barra in [[Guatemala]] to around 1682 BCE. Ceramics of the Purrón tradition in southcentral [[Mexico]] have been dated to around 1805 BCE, and from the Chajil tradition of northcentral Mexico, to around 1600 BCE.{{sfn|Clark|Gosser|1995|pp=210-11}}

The appearance of ceramics in the [[Southeastern United States]] does not fit the above pattern. Ceramics from the middle [[Savannah River]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] (known as Stallings, Stallings Island, or St. Simons) have been dated to about 2888 BCE (4500 BP), and ceramics of the [[Orange culture|Orange]] and [[Norwood culture|Norwood]] cultures in northern [[Florida]] to around 2460 BCE (4300 BP) (all older than any other dated ceramics from north of Colombia). Ceramics appeared later elsewhere in North America. Ceramics reached southern Florida ([[Mount Elizabeth Archeological Site|Mount Elizabeth]]) by 4000 BP, [[Nebo Hill Archeological Site|Nebo Hill]] (in [[Missouri]]) by 3700 BP, and [[Poverty Point]] (in Louisiana) by 3400 BP.{{sfn|Clark|Gosser|1995|pp=210-11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=John E, Michelle Knoll|title=Gulf Coast Archaeology: The Southeastern United States and Mexico|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-2808-6|editor=Nancy Marie White|page=286|chapter=The American Formative Revisited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural regions==

===Arctic===
Several [[Inuit]] communities, such as the [[Netsilik]], [[Sadlermiut]], [[Utkuhiksalik]], and [[Qaernerimiut]] created utilitarian pottery in historic times,&lt;ref&gt;Savelle, James M. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=5403508 "Historic Inuit Pottery in the Eastern Canadian Arctic: Abstract."] ''[[Polar Record]].'' (1986), 23: pp. 319-322. (Retrieved 4 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; primarily to store food. In [[Rankin Inlet]], [[Nunavut, Canada]], when the mine that employed much of the community closed down, the national government created the Rankin Inlet Ceramics Project, whose wares were successfully exhibited in Toronto in 1967. The project foundered but a local gallery revived interest in Inuit ceramics in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nacaarts.com/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113&amp;Itemid=108 "Ceramics."] ''Nunavut Arts and Crafts Association.'' (Retrieved 4 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Woodlands===
*[[Hopewell pottery]] is the ceramic tradition of the various local cultures involved in the [[Hopewell tradition]] (ca. 200 BCE to 400 CE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=241&amp;term_type_id=3&amp;term_type_text=things&amp;letter=H|title=Hopewell (archaeology)|work=Wisconsin Historical Society|accessdate=19 July 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109143824/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&amp;term_id=241&amp;term_type_id=3&amp;term_type_text=things&amp;letter=H|archivedate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast.
*[[Mississippian culture pottery]] is the ceramic tradition of the [[Mississippian culture]] (800–1600 CE) found as [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast.

====Southeastern Woodlands====
Geological studies show that that certain areas of the southeastern portion of North America are rich in kaolins and ball clays (Hosterman, USGS),{{clarify|date=August 2018|unclear what source is being cited}} the types of plastic clays best suited for pottery. Clay beds which still produce ceramic clays are from primary and secondary deposits formed in the Late Paleocene and Early Miocene Epochs in formations that formed the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. According to all geological surveys the entire southeastern portion of the continent has abundant clay deposits, with the exception of all of south Florida and a portion of western central Florida (Calver) (Matson).{{clarify|date=August 2018|unclear what source is being cited}}

Fiber-tempered ceramics associated with [[shell midden]]s left by Late [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] hunter-fisher-gatherers appeared in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina starting in 2500 BC. The earliest attested pottery is in the [[Stallings Island|Stallings culture]] area, around the middle [[Savannah River]].{{refn|Fiber-tempered [[potsherd]]s found at Rabbit Mount near the lower Savannah River in South Carolina have been dated to 4465 ± 95 and 4450 ± 150 radiocarbon years before present.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Fiber-tempered pottery of the [[Orange culture]] in northeast Florida has been dated to 2000 BC or a bit earlier.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=78, 80, 82-83}}{{sfn|Milanich|1994|p=94}} Fiber-tempered pottery of very similar form spread along coasts and river valleys of the Southeastern United States from the Atlantic coast into Alabama, reaching northwestern Florida ([[Norwood culture]]) and the Gulf coast by 1300 BC, the interior Middle South by 1100, and [[Poverty Point]] by 1000 BC.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=80, 83, 87}}&lt;ref name="GibsonCarr2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Nancy Marie|editor1=Jon L.

Thoms Creek ceramics closely resembled Stallings ceramics, but used more sand and less fiber as temper than Stalling or Orange ware. Thoms Creek ceramics were largely contemporary with Stalling and Orange ceramics, although no Thoms Creek ceramics have been found that are as early as the earliest Stallings. Thoms Creek ceramics overlapped Stallings ceramics in northern Georgia and southern South Carolina, but were the dominant tradition north of the [[Santee River]] into North Carolina.&lt;ref name="SaundersHays2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saunders|first1=Rebecca|last2=Hays|first2=Christopher T.|title=Early Pottery: Technology, Function, Style, and Interaction in the Lower Southeast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtAyG_LQ6DsC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=19 November 2016|year=2004|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|isbn=978-0-8173-5127-4|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarities of the Stallings series ceramics to the earlier [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]] ceramics of Colombia, which were both associated with [[shell ring]]s, and the presence of winds and ocean currents favoring journeys from South America to the Southeastern United States, led [[James A. Ford]], among other archaeologists, to offer the hypothesis that the two areas had connections, and that the technology of fiber-tempered ceramics in the southeastern United States had been imported from Colombia. Other archaeologists have noted that there are no known archaeological sites between Colombia and Florida that are of a type or age consistent with such connections, and that the cultural traditions of the Southeastern United States show no significant changes associated with the appearance of ceramics, indicating that there was no migration or people, and no transfer of technology or other elements of culture, other than the appearance of ceramics.{{sfn|Walthall|1980|pp=82–83}}

Later significant developments in ceramics in the Southeastern Woodlands included [[Mississippian culture pottery]] in the Mississippi River valley, and [[Weedon Island culture|Weedon Island pottery]], a style of pottery used primarily in ceremonial contexts and high status burials, produced and traded along the Gulf of Mexico coast from southwestern Florida to the Florida panhandle.

===Great Basin===
[[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin]] based their pottery on [[basketry]]. The [[Fremont culture]] of central [[Utah]] (700–1300 CE) developed pottery after adopting agriculture. [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] and [[Washoe people]] in the western Great Basin developed plain, utilitarian ceramics separately, which was not burnished but occasionally featured red painted designs. The Owens Valley Brown Ware is an example of Paiute/Washoe ceramics, which was used for cooking, food storage, and water jugs. The jugs often featured clay handles that accommodated carrying straps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beckman|first=Tad|url=http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/basin/gb-matrl.htm|title=Great Basin Material Cultures|publisher=Harvey Mudd College|date=1996|accessdate=4 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007062753/http://www4.hmc.edu:8001/humanities/basin/gb-matrl.htm|archivedate=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circum-Caribbean===

====Antilles====
Ceramics first appeared in the [[Antilles]] as part of the [[Saladoid]] culture (named for the Saladero site in the [[Orinoco]] basin in [[Venezuela]]. Saladoid people appeared in [[Trinidad]] around 500 BC or a little later, and had reached [[Puerto Rico]] by about 250 BC. The [[Cedros, Trinidad and Tobago|Cedrosan]] variety of Saladoid ceramics appeared in Trinidad early on, although ceramics in the Antilles continued to closely resemble forms on the Venezuela coast into the [[Current Era]]. Cedrosan Saladoid vessels have a distinctive bell shape with "zone-incised cross-hatching". Many also have complex designs of white on red paint. Later examples were decorated with purple, black, yellow and orange paint. These ceramics are described as "technologically fine, delicate, and graceful."{{sfn|Wilson|1997|p=5}}{{sfn|Allaire|1997|pp=22-24}}

Other ceramics styles are also known from the Antilles during this time period. Barrancoid trade wares, of a style that had developed in the Orinoco River valley around 1000 BC, have been found in the southernmost Antilles; Trinidad, [[Tobago]], and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. A variant of Saladoid ceramics called Huecan has been found from the north coast of Venezuela to Puerto Rico.{{sfn|Righter|1997|pp=72-74}}

====Colombia and Venezuela====
Fiber-tempered ceramics associated with shell middens left by hunter-fisher-gatherers of the Early Northwest South American Literature appeared at sites such as [[Puerto Hormiga archaeological site|Puerto Hormiga]], Monsú, Puerto Chacho, and San Jacinto in [[Colombia]] by 3100 BCE. Fiber-tempered ceramics at Monsú have been dated to 5940 radiocarbon years [[Before Present|before present]]. The fiber-tempered pottery at Puerto Hormiga was "crude", formed from a single lump of clay. The fiber-tempered pottery at San Jaginto is described as "well-made".

[[Ráquira]], a town in the [[Boyacá Department]], Colombia, is a major ceramics center, where both indigenous techniques and those introduced by Europeans are employed to create primarily utilitarian pots based on [[Chibcha people|Chibcha]] designs. Ceramic mobiles, [[nativity scene]]s, and animal figurines are popular, especially ceramic horses, which have been the symbol of Colombian pottery.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=122}}

La Chamba in the [[Tolima Department]] is known for its blackware. The women potters here also create brown and red ware.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=123}}

In the Andes, ceramics appear during the Initial Period around 1800 BCE. They were needed for boiling agricultural foods{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=23}} [[Chavín culture|Chavín]] potters on the Peruvian coast create distinctive [[stirrup spout vessel]]s, both incised and highly burnished. These thin-walled effigy pots were fashioned to resemble stylized humans, plants, and animals. Two substyles of Chavín stirrup spout pots include the thicker-walls, glossy-on-matte blackware Cupisnique style and red and black Santa Ana style, both featuring fanged heads.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=45-6}} Subsequent Andean cultures revived these ancient ceramics styles and imagery.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=47}}

[[Paracas culture]], from Peru's desert south coast, created highly detailed ceramics, that were often painted after firing. Paints, made with an [[acacia]] resin binder, were commonly warm yellow, olive green, red-orange, white, and black in color. Paracas artists built upon Chavín styles and introduced the [[double spout-and-bridge vessel]] and distinctive masks portraying a supernatural "Oculate Being," that combines human, owl, and double-headed snake forms.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=48-51}}

[[Nasca culture]], another south coastal Peruvian culture, returned to the less fragile practice slip-painted their ceramics prior to firing. They created thirteen distinct colors, the larger palette found in Pre-Columbian ceramics in the Americas, which included rare pale purple, maroon, and bluish-grey. Nasca artists created ceremonial and utilitarian bowls and beakers, effigy jars, panpipes, and vessels of new designs, including the stepped-fret. These combined sculptural elements with surface painting, often with curvilinear designs emphasized by bold, black outlining. Painters used revolving turntables to paint all sides of a ceramic piece.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=64-73}}

Dominating Peru's north coast from 1–600 CE, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture excelled at the art of ceramics, which was characterized by symbolic, religious imagery. Moche artists produced some of the more [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalistic]], i.e. faithfully representational, artwork of the precolumbian Americas. [[Moche portrait vessel]] were so realistic that individuals portrayed at different stages of their life are identifiable. Their paintings on ceramics were narrative and action-packed. Ceramics produced by two-press molds were identical in shape but individualized through unique surface painting. Tens of thousands of Moche ceramics have survived today. The stirrup-spout vessel continued to be the most common form of clay vessel, but Moche artists also created bowls, dippers, jars with long necks, spout-and-handle vessels, and double-chambered vessels that whistled when liquid was poured. Vessels were often effigies portraying elaborate scenes. A fineline painting tradition emerged, which resembles Greek [[black-figure pottery]].{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=82-6}} A 29,000-square-foot Moche ceramics workshop with numerous kilns was discovered in at the mountain Mayal in the [[Chicama Valley]]. The workshop specialized in female figurines.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=106}}

The [[Tiwanaku]] and [[Wari culture]]s shared dominance of the Andes, roughly from 500 to 1000 BCE. The Tiwanaku civilizations originated in [[Lake Titicaca]] region of [[Bolivia]], and a staff-bearing deity figured largely in their artwork.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=118}} Tiwanaku artists continued the tradition of naturalistic, ceramic portrait vessels.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=136}} The ubiquitous Wari ceramics carried over imagery from their [[Andean textiles|textiles]] and metalwork, such as [[llama]] and [[alpaca]] imagery. [[Qunchupata, Ayacucho|Qunchupata]] in Peru was the epicenter of Wari ceramic production, featuring pit kilns and firing rooms. The stone floors of the firing rooms had rounded depressions for accommodating larger pots. Some Wari palaces had their own attached kilns. Broken potsherds were used as forms for building new pots and for scrapers. Evidence shows ceramics were often ritually destroyed.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=149-152}}

Four Andean civilizations flourished in Late Intermediate Period: the [[Chancay culture|Chancay]], [[Chimú culture|Chimú]], [[Lambayeque culture|Lambayeque]], and [[Ica culture|Ica]]. Luxury goods, including elaborate ceramics, were mass-produced in vast quantities for the middle class as well as nobles. Identical ceramics created in molds took sway over individualized works.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=153-4}} The Lambayeque culture of north coastal Peru created press-molded reliefs on blackware ceramics.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=161}} Chimú ceramics, also predominantly blackware, often featured zoomorphic appliqués, such as monkeys or sea birds. They excelled at the doubled-chambered whistling vessels.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=174}} Chancay ceramics, from the central coast, featured black-on-white designs on unique shapes, such as female effigies or elongated, oval jars. Their sand-tempered ceramics were hastily painted and left unpolished.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=175}} Ica culture ceramics, from the southern coasts, were the finest quality of their time. They were still handcrafted and had a wide range of [[polychrome]] slips, including black, maroon, orange, purple, red, white, and a glittery deep purple. Designs were abstract and geometric.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=179}}

The [[Inca Empire]] or [[Tawantinsuyo]] spanned 3500 miles and controlled the world's largest empire by 1500 CE. Artistically, they unified regional styles. Incan ceramics were geometric and understated, while color schemes remained regionally diverse.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|p=180}} Mass-produced pottery, conformed to standardized measurements, such as the [[urpu]], a long-necked jar with handles and a pointed bottom used to transport [[maize]] and [[chicha]], maize beer. ''[[Qiru]]s'' were Incan drinking vessels, made from wood or precious metals, as well as ceramics.{{sfn|Stone-Miller|2002|pp=184, 214-5}}

[[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] ceramics fall into two major categories: ''na'e'', or dishes, and ''yapepó'', pots, pans, and storage containers. These were both utilitarian and ceremonial. The precontact ceramic tradition of the Gran Chaco was dramatically transformed under European colonization, which created a demand for pitchers, cups, and other introduced pottery forms. Author [[Josefina Pla]] observed that women are typically potters, and animals associated with men are not represented in Guaraní pottery.&lt;ref name=escobar&gt;Escobar, Ticio.

[[Tobatí]], a city near [[Asunción]], Paraguay, is renowned for its ceramics, including tiles and female effigy jars, known as ''Las gorgas.'' A reddish-brown slip, known as ''tapyta'' in [[Guarani language|Guaraní]], is popular, with blackware being less common.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=127}} A local ceramic artist, Don [[Zenón Páez]] (b. 1927) became famous for his ceramic figures of saints.

[[Itá, Paraguay]] is another ceramic center, known for its whimsical, ceramic chickens.{{sfn|Davies|Fini|1995|p=143}} [[Rosa Brítez]] (b. 1941) is a famous ceramic artist from Itá and has been recognized by [[UNESCO]].

The [[Museo del Barro]], "Museum of Mud," in Asunción features pottery from the Gran Chaco, from Pre-Columbian Guaraní to contemporary [[mestizo]] ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canal5paravision.com/the-museo-del-barro-in-ansuncion-paraguay/ "The Museo del Barro In Ansuncion Paraguay."] ''Paraguay Travel Guide.''

The pottery tradition at [[Pedra Pintada]] in Brazil represents the oldest known ceramics in the Americas.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=365}} Dating back to 5630 BCE, this same tradition continued for 2500 years. Ceramics from the [[Taperinha]] site near [[Santarém, Pará|Santarém]], Brazil date back to 5130 BCE and include sand-tempered bowls and cooking vessels resembling gourds. Other ancient Amazonian ceramic traditions, Mina and Uruá-Tucumã featured shell- and sand-tempered pottery, that was occasionally painted red.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=207}} Around 1000 CE, dramatic new ceramic styles emerged throughout Amazonia. Amazonian ceramics are geometric and linear in decoration. Polychrome pottery typically features red and black on white slips. Additionally ceramics were decorated by sculpting, incision, excision, and grooving. In the upper and central Amazon, the bark of the [[caraipé]] tree, ''[[Licania octandra]]'', provided tempering material.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=368}}

In regions of [[terra preta]], or "black earth", of the [[Amazon rainforest]], an abundance of potsherds were used to develop the soil and build [[mound]]s, which protected buildings and cemeteries from seasonal flooding.&lt;ref name=marajo&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0GSZ_LJJjX4J:www.denverartmuseum.org/files/File/mm_marajo%2520info%2520sheet%25206-1-11%281%29.pdf+Amazonia+pottery+pubic+Brazil&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjzotgfDDix25KlXM1ERFKhzgkoZR-y5wBK5VRuCXDuKq5EJzbdMZtIJDI5ATKSD8hois_JNrPJLWnGRXhg8vCw-ID0YrjL-zVsnzQImp2Iwb9f6mWXha1Bij4kB1FBXskVk7LC&amp;sig=AHIEtbSxhBa1zr8DPT-1NXkzGBIDL6JVuQ "Marajó: Ancient Ceramics from the Mouth of the Amazon."] (retrieved 9 Nov 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marajó Island]], located at the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] was a major ceramic center, where the [[Marajoara Phase]] of polychrome ceramics last from around 400 to 1300 CE. In the central Amazon, the Mancapuru Phase, or Incised Rim Tradition, emerged in the 5th century CE.{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=366}} Marajoara ceramics, typically tempered with grog,{{sfn|Silverman|Isbell|2008|p=368}} were complex effigies of humans and animals, such as reptiles and birds.&lt;ref name=marajo/&gt; The dead were cremated and buried in elaborate ceramic urns. Ceramic artists are active in Marajó, using precontact styles for inspiration.

Women have traditionally been the ceramic artists in the Amazon. Female figures are common in anthropomorphic effigy vessels. [[Tanga (ceramic)|Tanga]]s are a unique Amazonian cultural item; they are triangular, concave ceramic pubic coverings held in place by strings, once worn by women of several Amazonian tribes. Today, they are still worn by girls during their puberty rites among [[Panoan languages|Panoan]]-speaking peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marajoara.com/gender.html "Archaeology."] ''Marajó''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10029">'''Community arts''', also sometimes known as "dialogical art", "community-engaged" or "community-based art," refers to artistic activity based in a [[community]] setting. Works from this genre can be of any media and is characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community. Often professional artists collaborate with people who may not otherwise normally actively engage in the arts. The term was defined in the late-1960s and spawned a movement which grew in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], and [[Australia]]. In [[Scandinavia]], the term "community art" means more often contemporary art project.

Often community art is based in economically deprived areas, with a community-oriented, grassroots approach. Members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process, sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors. These communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level.

In English-speaking countries, community art is often seen as the work of community [[arts centre]]. [[Visual arts]] ([[fine art]], video, [[new media art]]), music, and theater are common mediums in community art centers. Many arts companies in the UK do some community-based work, which typically involves developing participation by non-professional members of local communities.

== Community art and public art ==
The term "community art" refers also to the field of community, neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods. In the art world, community art signifies a particular art making practice, emphasizing community involvement and collaboration. Community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork/s with artists. This is a growing national, international, regional and local field. Recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface, including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level.

== Forms of Collaborative Practices ==
Models of community-engaged arts can vary with three forms of collaborative practices emerging from among the sets of common practices. In the artist-driven model, artists are seen as the catalysts for social change through the social commentary addressed in their works. A muralist whose work elicits and sustains political dialogue would be a practitioner of this model. In the second model, artists engage with community groups to facilitate specialized forms of art creation, often with the goal of presenting the work in a public forum to promote awareness and to further discourse within a larger community. In the process-driven or dialogic model, artists may engage with a group in order to facilitate an artistic process that addresses particular concerns specific to the group. The use of an artistic process (such as dance or [[Social Circus|social circus]]) for problem-solving, therapeutic, group-empowerment or strategic planning purposes may result in artistic works that are not intended for public presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icasc.ca/what-art-social-change|title=What is Art for Social Change? {{!}} Art for Social Change|website=icasc.ca|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second and third models, the individuals who collaborate on the artistic creation may not define themselves as artists but are considered practitioners of an art-making process that produces social change.

Due to its roots in social justice and collaborative, community-based nature, art for social change may be considered a form of cultural democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melucci|first=Alberto|last2=Avritzer|first2=Leonardo|date=2000-12-01|title=Complexity, cultural pluralism and democracy: collective action in the public space|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/39/4/507|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=507–527|doi=10.1177/053901800039004001|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often, the processes (or the works produced by these processes) intend to create or promote spaces for participatory public dialogue.

In Canada, the field of community-engaged arts has recently seen broader use of art for social change practices by non-arts change organizations. The resultant partnerships have enabled these collaborative communities to address systemic issues in health, education, as well as empowerment for indigenous, immigrant, LGBT and youth communities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf http://icasc.ca/sites/default/files/resource_attachments/stateoftheart_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar social innovation trend has appeared where business development associations have engaged with artists/artistic organizations to co-produce cultural festivals or events that address social concerns.

As the field diversifies and practices are adopted by various organizations from multiple disciplines, ethics and safety have become a concern to practitioners.[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10805-016-9257-7?wt_mc=internal.event.1.SEM.ArticleAuthorOnlineFirst] As a result, opportunities for cross-disciplinary training in art for social change practices have grown within the related field of [[Arts in education|arts education]].

== Online community art ==
A [[community]] can be seen in many ways, it can refer to different kind of groups. There are also [[virtual communities]] or online communities.  [[Internet art]] has many different forms, but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project.

==Community theatre==
[[Community theatre]] includes theatre made by, with, and for a community—it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help, or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists, or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community. Community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well-equipped facilities of their own. Many community theatres are successful, non-profit businesses with a large active membership and, often, a full-time professional staff. Community theatre is often [[devised theatre|devised]] and may draw on popular theatrical forms, such as [[carnival]], [[circus]], and [[parade]]s, as well as performance modes from commercial theatre. Community theatre is understood to contribute to the [[social capital]] of a community, insofar as it develops the skills, community spirit, and artistic sensibilities of those who participate, whether as producers or audience-members.

[[Image:Contemporary art gallery by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A gallery show opening in New York City]]

A '''contemporary art gallery''' is a place where [[contemporary art]] is shown for exhibition and/or for sale. The term "art gallery" is commonly used to mean [[art museum]] (especially in [[British English]]), the rooms displaying art in any [[museum]], or in the original sense, of any large or long room.

==Identity, function and locality==
A contemporary gallery is commercial or privately funded and usually has a second-tier status positioned between the first-tier status of a national, state-run or corporate museum, and the third-tier of minor galleries which include artist-run galleries, retail galleries, and artist's co-operatives.

Commercial galleries are for-profit, privately owned businesses dealing in artworks by contemporary artists. Galleries run for the [[public good]] by cities, churches,  art collectives, not-for-profit organizations, and local or national governments are usually termed Non-Profit Galleries. Many of these, such as the [[Tate Gallery]] have an aspect of [[Charitable organization|charity]] and can be arranged around a Trust or estate. Galleries run by artists are sometimes known as [[Artist Run Initiatives]], and may be temporary or otherwise different from the traditional gallery format.

Contemporary art galleries are often established together in urban centers such as the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] district of New York, widely considered to be the center of the American [[contemporary art]] world. Most large urban areas have several art galleries, and most towns will be home to at least one. However, they may also be found in small communities, and remote areas where artists congregate, e.g. the [[Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art]] ([[Montsoreau]]) in [[France]], the [[Chinati Foundation]] ([[Marfa, Texas|Marfa]]) in [[United States]] , the [[Taos art colony]] ([[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]]) in [[New Mexico]] and [[St Ives, Cornwall]]; ([[Hill End, New South Wales|Hill End]]), ([[Braidwood, New South Wales|Braidwood]]) and ([[Byron Bay]]) in [[New South Wales]] Contemporary art galleries are usually free and open to the public, however some are semi-private, more exclusive, and by appointment only.

==Exhibitions==
[[Curator]]s often create group shows that say something about contemporary issues or a certain theme, trend in art, or group of associated artists. Galleries often choose to represent artists exclusively, giving them the opportunity to show regularly. Some have a narrow focus while others are more eclectic.

Although primarily concerned with providing a space to show works of visual art, art galleries are sometimes used to host other artistic activities, such as music concerts, poetry readings, or performances, which are considered [[performance art]] and at other times [[theater]]. While many galleries exhibit painting and sculpture of all types and movements like [[Abstract expressionism]], [[Pop Art]], [[Photo realism]], [[Color Field]], [[Minimalism]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]], and [[Postminimalism]] etc. Conversely, some works of contemporary art are not shown in a gallery. [[Land art]], [[performance art]], [[internet art]], [[mail art]] and [[installation art]] and other emerging forms also often exist outside a gallery due to being site-specific. Documentation of these kinds of art such as photographic records, are often shown and sold in galleries however, as are preliminary or process drawings and collages (such as those generated by [[Christo]] as part of the proposal to governing bodies when applying to install land works). British artist [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] manages to combine his core intentions by linking the materials used in his land art, to make gallery art. [[Andy Goldsworthy]] does so as well.

==Business==
There are many operational models that galleries follow. The most common business model is that of the for-profit, privately owned gallery.  This is an extremely competitive market but one that may yield great profits. As a general rule, commercial galleries do not charge admission to the public, perhaps in a nod to the egalitarian philosophies of many artists and critics and to encourage attendance, or perhaps in the interests of just good business. Instead, they profit by taking a cut of the art's sales; the exact percentage varies.  Some galleries in cities like Tokyo and in New York charge the artists a flat rate per day or per week, though this is considered distasteful in some international art markets. Inevitably the business of contemporary art has in recent decades become increasingly internationalized and commercialized.

Commercial galleries often choose to represent artists exclusively, giving them the opportunity to have solo shows regularly. They usually promote the artist's shows by cultivating collectors, making press contacts, and trying to get critical reviews. Most reputable galleries absorb the cost of printing invitations to the opening, guidebooks, and other P.R. publications. Some galleries self-publish or help to arrange publishing for art books and monographs concerning their artists. They sometimes provide a stipend or otherwise ensure the artist has enough money to make ends meet. One idiosyncrasy of contemporary art galleries is their aversion to signing business contracts, although this is changing due to artists taking more control of their output and saleability through professional practice information provided by artists' associations.

Large commercial art fairs where galleries show their best artists and sell works over a period of a week or so have taken the art world by storm in recent years. The biggest of these is the Armory Show in New York (not to be confused with the famous show by the [[Armory Show|same name]] in 1913), which charges admission. These fairs have been criticized by artists as over-commercializing contemporary art.

There are also many not-for-profit, [[artist-run space]]s and art-collective galleries which follow different business models, as well as [[Vanity gallery|vanity galleries]] which prey on unsavvy artists.

==Art districts==

Galleries tend to cluster in certain neighborhoods within cosmopolitan cities for economic and practical reasons, mainly that it is possible for the buyers and general public to view more art if they can travel by foot. In the past galleries have tended to cluster in neighborhoods with affordable real-estate due to the unprofitable nature of the business.  However, in the 21st century art galleries are strongly associated with the process of [[gentrification]], and prime real estate for Chelsea galleries is not affordable for unprofitable galleries. Generally, cities that have less centralized art districts are faring poorly in terms of market share.

'''Defend Innovation''' is a [[patent]] reform project started by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) in June 2012. The project initially proposed seven changes to United States's patent system, including shortening the term for [[software patent]]s, requirement to provide the running software code along with patent application, and avoidance of liability of an infringer who independently arrives at the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EFF Launches New Patent Reform Project to Defend Innovation|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-launches-new-patent-reform-project-defend-innovation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposals|url=https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074452/https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Since June 2012, the project collected information about the patent system from lawyers, software engineers, court cases, and other sources. The information collected was combined with EFF's own expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents|url=https://www.eff.org/patent|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled in a whitepaper named ''How to Fix Our Broken Patent System'', which details the issues surrounding the patent system and proposes solutions that can be implemented by the Congress, Patent Office, and also the software companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defend Innovation|url=https://defendinnovation.org/|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whitepaper is available at the Defend Innovation website.

'''Die Neue Sammlung'''  is one of the leading design museums in the world, with the largest collection of industrial and product design.
Established around 100 years ago, Die Neue Sammlung is considered the world’s oldest design museum – regarded as such long before the word ''design'' acquired this meaning. 
Since then, Die Neue Sammlung has been making design history with its international acquisitions and stimulating exhibitions.

With over 100,000 catalogued items, Die Neue Sammlung is among the world’s largest design collections. It is very wide-ranging, with the collection covering over 20 different areas, embracing Product and Industrial Design or Furniture and Graphic Design as well as topics such as Mobility and IT Design. Ceramics and glass are focal areas, as are Jewelry and Appliances, not to mention selected objects in the field of crafted design. 


{{coord|48|08|49|N|11|34|20|E|region:DE-BY_type:landmark_source:dewiki|display=title}}

==History==
Founded in 1907 in line with the ideas of the [[German Werkbund]], it was inaugurated as an official state museum in 1925. From the very beginning it distinguished itself from the museums of arts and crafts of the day by committing firmly to espousing the Modernism of the times and thus contemporary design. To this day, the Neue Sammlung’s agenda pursue those initial objectives.


==Exhibitions (Selection) ==
A typical year will see more than a dozen different exhibitions being staged, covering all areas of the collection. Notable exhibitions of recent years have been:

* 2015: ''Munich | Konstantin Grcic: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly''  &lt;ref&gt;[http://dnstdm.de/en/konstantin-grcic/ Konstantin Grcic: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2013: ''Nuremberg | [[Patricia Urquiola]] and Rosenthal. Landscape
* 2011: ''Nuremberg | [[Alessandro Mendini]] – Wunderkammer Design'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnstdm.de/en/alessandro-mendini-wunderkammer-design/ Alessandro Mendini – Wunderkammer Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: ''Munich | [[Karim Rashid]] – I want to change the world'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dnstdm.de/en/karim-rashid-i-want-to-change-the-world/ Karim Rashid – I want to change the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''four arts''' ([[wiktionary:四|四]][[wiktionary:藝|藝]], ''siyi''), or the '''four arts of the Chinese scholar''', were the four main [[academic]] and artistic accomplishments required of the [[aristocratic]] [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]] [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-gentleman]]. They are ''qin'' (the [[guqin]], a stringed instrument. [[wiktionary:琴|琴]]), ''qi'' (the strategy game of [[Go (game)|Go]], [[wiktionary:棋|棋]]), ''shu'' ([[Chinese calligraphy]] [[wiktionary:書|書]]) and ''hua'' ([[Chinese painting]] [[wiktionary:畫|畫]]).

==Origin of the concept==
Although the individual elements of the concept have very long histories as activities befitting a learned person, the earliest written source putting the four together is [[Zhang Yanyuan]]'s ''Fashu Yaolu'' (Compendium of Calligraphy) from the [[Tang Dynasty]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Qin==
{{main|Guqin}}
[[Image:Lian Zhu Shi (landscape version).jpg|thumb|The guqin]]
'''Qin''' 琴 is the musical instrument of the literati, the guqin. Although it exclusively meant this instrument in ancient times, it has now come to mean all musical instruments, but essentially it refers to guqin only considering the context.

The guqin is a seven-stringed zither that owes its invention to the Chinese society of some 3,000 years ago. During the reign of the imperial China, a scholar was expected to play the guqin . Guqin was explored as an art-form as well as a science, and scholars strove to both play it well and to create texts on its manipulation. Gǔqín notation was invented some 1,500 years ago, and to this day it has not been drastically changed. Some books contain musical pieces written and mastered more than 500 years ago. Guqin is so influential that it even made its way into space: the spacecraft [[Voyager program|Voyager]] launched by the U.S. in 1977 contained a vinyl style record of a guqin piece named "Flowing Water". The fact that the guqin's name breaks down to ''gu'' (old) and ''qin'' (musical instrument) reveals the instrument's great antiquity.

==Qi==
{{main|Go (game)}}

'''Qi''' 棋 is a [[board game]] and [[art]] form which is now called [[weiqi]] (圍棋) in Chinese (''go'' in Japan and the West), literally meaning "surrounding game." Current definitions of ''qi'' cover a wide range of board games, and given that in [[classical Chinese]] qí could also refer to other games, some argue that the qí in the four arts could refer to [[xiangqi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-museum.com.cn/dmsa/live/living/64331.shtml |script-title=中国古代象棋棋具收藏与欣赏 |language=Chinese |title=Collection of ancient Chinese xiangqi pieces and their appreciation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319203048/http://www.e-museum.com.cn/dmsa/live/living/64331.shtml  |archivedate=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, xiangqi is often considered a popular "game of the people," whereas weiqi was a game with aristocratic connotations. 

Many theories exist regarding the [[History of Go|origin of weiqi]] in Chinese history. One of these holds that it was an ancient fortune-telling device used by Chinese [[Cosmology|cosmologists]] to simulate the universe's relationship to an individual. Another suggests that the legendary [[Emperor Yao]] invented it to enlighten his son. Certainly weiqi had begun to take hold around the 6th century BCE when [[Confucius]] mentioned wéiqí in his [[Analects]] 17:22.

Weiqi is a game in which two players take turns placing black and white [[Go equipment#Stones|stones]] on a [[Go equipment#Board|board]] consisting of a grid of 19x19 lines. Stones are placed on the intersections of the grid. Once placed on the board, stones may not be moved, but stones may be removed if a stone or group of stones is surrounded on four sides by stones of the opposing color occupying all [[orthogonal|orthogonally]]-adjacent points. The two players place stones alternately until they reach a point at which neither player wishes to make another move; the game has no set ending conditions beyond this. At the conclusion of the game, it is scored by counting the territory encircled by each side (empty space along with captured stones) and the number of stones remaining on the board to determine the winner. Games may also be won by resignation.

Ancient weiqi texts are prized among modern Chinese weiqi [[Go professional|professionals]], as seen below in the translation of an ancient strategy book:
{{quote|text=The most celebrated (though not the oldest) go manual is the Chinese ''Xuanxuan Qijing''. It was published in 1349 by Yan Defu and Yan Tianzhang. The former was a strong go player and the latter (no relation) a collector of old go books. They made a perfect team. The title of the book is literally ''The Classic of the Mystery of the Mysterious'', but it is an allusion to Chapter 1 of Lao Tzu's ''Tao Te Ching'' where the reference goes on to say that the mystery of the mysterious is 'the gateway to all marvels'. I prefer that as a title, especially as it is made clear in the preface that this latter phrase is meant to be called to mind, and is meant to imply that the book offers the way to mastering marvels in the form of go [[tesuji]]s.|source=Defu &amp; Tianzhang &amp; Fairbairn, 1}}

==Shu==
{{main|Chinese calligraphy}}
[[Image:SunXindeOAI.jpg|thumb|right|A Chinese calligrapher]]
'''Shu''' 書 refers to Chinese calligraphy, which dates to the origins of recorded Chinese history, in essence ever since written characters have existed. Chinese calligraphy is said to be an expression of a practitioner's [[poetic]] nature, as well as a significant test of [[manual dexterity]]. Chinese calligraphy has evolved for thousands of years, and its state of flux stopped only when Chinese characters were unified across the empire. Chinese calligraphy differs from western calligraphic script in the sense that it was done with a brush instead of metal implements or a quill. Calligraphy was the art by which a scholar could compose his thoughts to be immortalized. It was the scholar's means of creating expressive poetry and sharing his or her own learnedness.

Calligraphic process is also structured in the same way as weiqi. A minimalist set of rules conveys a system of incredible complexity and grandeur. Every character from the Chinese scripts is built into a uniform shape by means of assigning it a geometric area in which the character must occur. Only three basic forms are used in the creation of the character, those being square, triangle and circle. Each character has a set number of brushstrokes, none must be added or taken away from the character to enhance it visually, lest the meaning be lost. Finally, strict regularity is not required, meaning the strokes may be accentuated for dramatic effect or individual style. Calligraphy was the means by which scholars could mark their thoughts and teachings for immortality, and as such, represent some of the more precious treasures that can be found from ancient China.

{{Quote|text=The most valued of all art treasures in China have been examples of the writing of certain aristocrats from the fourth century CE, including casual notes exchanged between them. The process whereby this came about is a lengthy one. It had to do with religious developments in the third-seventh centuries. It was also connected intimately to the role of writing in upper class life, to notions of personality, and the visible expression of personality.[...] The notion of writing as an art form however probably does not appear until the early centuries of the common era. It is linked to the emergence of the idea of the artist as an individual whose personal qualities allow command of the technical resources to produce work of a higher quality and greater value [...] than that of the common run of writers.|source=Clunas, 135}}

==Hua==
{{main|Chinese painting}}
[[Image:Chao Yen 001.jpg|thumb|right|''Eight horsemen in Spring'', by Zhao Yan, 10th century, [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period.]]
'''Hua''' 畫 refers to Chinese painting.  Brush painting is the final of the arts that a scholar is expected to learn, and is arguably the greatest measure of individual creativity. Through painting a Chinese noble would demonstrate his mastery over the art of line. Often Chinese paintings would be produced on a sheet of plain white rice-paper or silk using nothing but black ink and a single brush. These paintings were made to demonstrate the power of a single line, and in them was reflected a skill that valued intentional and calculated strokes over instinctual erratic creation. In a Chinese painting was reflected the artist's ability to evaluate his own imagination and record it clearly and concisely. Chinese painting can be traced back even further than calligraphy. Some examples date back to the decorative paintings that were emblazoned on Neolithic pottery. To add tonal quality to paintings the artists would often paint portions of the subject then wash the cloth before continuing. This made for beautiful landscapes and depictions of ritual. Painting was the art by which a scholar could separate him or herself from the others and take a name.

{{quote|text=The growing complexity of society at the end of the sixteenth century was reflected in an enriched cultural life in which heterogeneous tastes supported a wide variety of artists and craftsmen: the presence of foreigners at court and increasing affluence, which made the merchants independent of the court and of the official class, were only two of the many factors which nurtured artistic diversity. Individuality also began to be considered an important quality in the painter; indeed, a small group of artists were even known as the "individualists".|source=Tregear, 168}}

Weise has released books both in paperback and ebooks: ''Earth Art'' (2017), ''Land Art'' (2018). Ludovic Gibsson wrote the introduction for Earth Art: “Earth Art, 70th Exhibition Celebration. This book is a celebration of the 70 exhibitions Weise has produced from 1982 to 2017, spanning 35 years in the international art world. It is a gateway to the understanding of the more difficult avenues of his art, through his own thoughts, analysis and influences. A witness to his style of Earth Art, which encompasses elements of Land Art, Installation Art, Environmental Art, Ephemeral Art and “In Situ”. The several layers of meaning that often bewildered critics, who were unable to fathom his application of the Alter-modern, his diaspora, while using physics and philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gerryjoeweise.com/earth-art-book.html/ Gerry Joe Weise, Earth Art book, official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6647">[[Image:Gold-Hut klein-cm.png|thumb|The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch]]
The '''Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch''' ({{lang-de|Goldblechkegel von Ezelsdorf Buch}}) is a [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artefact]] discovered in 1953 between the villages of [[Burgthann|Ezelsdorf]] ([[Middle Franconia]]) and [[Postbauer-Heng|Buch]] ([[Upper Palatinate]]) in [[Southern Germany]]. A tall (88&amp;nbsp;cm), cone-shaped object made of thin sheet gold, it is seen as belonging to a group of artifacts referred to as [[Bronze Age]] [[Golden hats]]. It was presumably worn by special functionaries on ceremonial occasions.

== Cultural Context and date ==
The Ezelsdorf-Buch cone is one of four such known items. Two of them were discovered in Southern Germany, one in the west of [[France]], and one is without provenance, believed to have been found in Switzerland or Germany. It dates to ''circa'' 1,000 to 900 BC.

Parallels have been drawn between the golden 'hats' and depictions found on the [[The King's Grave|Kivik slabs]] and on objects from the Stockhult hoard discovered in [[Scandinavia]].

The 'hat', like its counterparts, is assumed to have served as a religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun-cult common in Bronze Age Europe. The hats are also suggested to have served [[Golden hats#Calendars|calendrical functions]].

== Provenance and find history ==
The Ezelsdorf-Buch Cone was discovered accidentally during the removal of tree-stumps in 1953. However, it was not recognised as an [[archaeology|archaeological find]] immediately, and its top was torn and broken by digging tools, probably weakening or destroying the structure of the whole object. It is also possible that the object had been damaged previously or that it had fully or partially collapsed during burial. It was probably originally buried in an upright position, with its top relatively near ground level, as were its [[Berlin Gold Hat|Berlin]] and [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt]] counterparts. After recovery, the cone was mutilated and torn into small scraps of sheet gold. Although it could be mostly reconstructed at an early stage, it was only in the 1990s that the find was understood as belonging to the group of "[[golden hats]]".

== Description ==
[[Image:EzelsdorfBuch Golden Hat schematic.jpg|thumb|Schematic depiction of the Ezelsdorf Cone's decorative scheme]]
Including the part now missing, the 'hat' would have weighed about 330 g. Like its counterparts, it was hammered from a single piece of gold, decorated in the [[repoussé]] technique with bands and rows of symbols, had a somewhat convex, cap-like, lower portion and was originally equipped with a 'brim', which was probably lost during its recovery. Like the Berlin example, it was reinforced by one or several bronze rings near the bottom.

The cone is now (in reconstructed form) 88.3&amp;nbsp;cm high, but was probably somewhat shorter, at 72&amp;nbsp;cm or more.

Along its whole length, the object's surface is subdivided and decorated by horizontal bands or ribs and by rows of symbols. In total, there are 154 bands and symbol rows. The symbols are mostly circular bosses enclosed by up to seven concentric circles, as known from all other specimens. There are three sets of unusual special motifs: small horizontal ovals resembling eyes (row 92, also known from Schifferstadt and Berlin), small eight-spoked wheels (row 120) and miniature cones (rows 127 and 105). The latter are unique to the Ezesldorf-Buch cone and appear to represent the shape of a gold 'hat'. The tip of the cone is embellished with a ten-point star. The area where the cone joins the cap-like area is embellished with a 30&amp;nbsp;mm wide band of vertical grooving, as is the case on the Berlin example.

== Manufacture ==
The piece is hammered from a gold [[alloy]]; [[gold]] (88.3%), [[silver]] (11%), [[copper]] (0.59%) and [[tin]] (0.086%). Its average thickness is only 0.78&amp;nbsp;mm. The amount of gold used for making the object is equivalent to the size of a matchbox.

Twenty different decorative punches, a comb, and six stamp-wheels or cylindrical stamps were used to apply the patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the cone's manufacture, see [[Golden hats#Manufacture|here]].

== Present location ==
The Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch is on display in the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], [[Nuremberg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">{{more footnotes|date=September 2015}}'''Heterogram''' ([[classical compound]]: "[[wikt:hetero-#English|different]]" + "[[wikt:-gram#English|written]]") is a term used mostly in the [[philology|study of ancient texts]] for a special kind of a [[logogram]] consisting of the embedded written representation of a word in a foreign language, which does not have a spoken counterpart in the main (matrix) language of the text. In most cases, the matrix and embedded languages share the same script. While from the perspective of the embedded language the word may be written either phonetically (representing the sounds of the embedded language) or logographically, it is never a phonetic spelling from the point of view of the matrix language of the text, since there is no relationship between the symbols used and the underlying pronunciation of the word in the matrix language.

In English, the written abbreviations ''[[wikt:e.g.|e.g.]]'', ''[[wikt:i.e.|i.e.]]'', and ''[[wikt:viz.|viz.]]'' are often read respectively as "for example", "that is", and "namely".  When read this way, the abbreviations for the [[Latin]] words ''exempli gratia'', ''id est'', and ''videlicet'' are being used logographically to indicate unrelated English phrases.  Similarly, the [[ampersand]] ⟨&amp;⟩, originally a [[typographic ligature|ligature]] for the Latin word ''[[wikt:et#Latin|et]]'', in many European languages stands logographically for the local word for "and" regardless of pronunciation.  This can be contrasted with the older way of abbreviating ''[[et cetera]]''—''[[wikt:&amp;c.|&amp;c.]]''—where ⟨&amp;⟩ is used to represent ''et'' as a full [[loanword]], not a heterogram.

Heterograms are frequent in [[cuneiform script]]s, such as the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] cuneiform, which uses [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] heterograms, or the Anatolian cuneiform, which uses both [[Cuneiform script|Sumerian]] and [[Cuneiform script|Akkadian]] heterograms.&lt;ref&gt;Kudrinski M. and I.

''Altorientalische Forschungen'' 43(1-2): 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] scripts derived from the [[Aramaic]] scripts (such as the [[Pahlavi scripts]]), all logograms are heterograms coming from Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/huzwares Huswāreš].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such heterograms are referred to by terms identifying the source language such as "[[Sumerogram]]s" or "[[Aramaeogram]]s".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">An '''interpolation''', in relation to [[literature]] and especially ancient [[manuscript]]s, is an entry or passage in a text that was not written by the original author. As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.

Interpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, {{bracket|[[sic]]}}), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the [[Pseudo-Isidore]] are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to [[forgery]] of this kind.  In the 13th century a medieval romance, the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', inserted another prose romance, the [[Vulgate]] ''Queste del Saint Graal'', in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]] through the optics of the Tristan story.&lt;ref&gt;On the Medieval technique of manuscript ''[[interpolation]]'' and the ''Prose Tristan'', see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, "La préparation à la ''Queste del Saint Graal'' dans le ''Tristan'' en prose" in Norris Lacy, ed. ''Conjunctures'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, "L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits" ''Romania'' 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, "The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest" ''Tristania'' 15 (1994): 23-31.  Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance on [[Brunor]] in ''Prose Tristan''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a [[scribe]] made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).

Conscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.

Modern scholars have developed techniques{{Which|date=August 2010}} for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.

The [[Comma Johanneum]], for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as [[Christian interpolation]].

'''Jeannine Achón''' (born 1973) is a [[Cuba]]n [[abstract painter]].&lt;ref&gt;http://web.artprice.com/artist/481279/jeannine-achon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:Category:Cuban painters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Havana]], after secondary studies at LaLenin school, she completed a university degree in [[Industrial Design]] from the Instituto Superior de Diseño Industrial (ISDI) of Cuba, specializing in Housing (1996). After ISDI, she worked a couple of years at Decoro d'Arq,a design company, for hotel projects, including Hotel Nacional and Capri. Then she focuses on fine arts and paintings, first figurative and illustration, in the late 1990s.

She does scientific illustrations ("Mi Libro de Lagartijas" Alfonso Silva Lee, published by [[Editorial Gente Nueva]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9590802435}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as drawings for children's books, always with the same publisher.

Her painting in the late 1990s and early 2000s is still in large part figurative, but already contains the main technical basis and features for her future abstract works:  structure composed of multiple layers, the use of acrylic on paper or canvas, rather colorful approaches. This is the time of sales in the art markets of Habana Vieja or Vedado, where foreign tourists and young Cuban artists meet.

Jeannine had her first solo exhibition in 2005 on the Isle of Youth ("[[Isla de la Juventud]]"), at the gallery of the [[Hermanos Saiz]] Association. It bears the title "La Puerta Perdida", (The Lost Gate") from the title of one of the paintings, and is composed only of abstract paintings, acrylic on canvas, of average size (30 x 40 "). Since then, with few exceptions (orders), Jeannine Achón produces only abstract works , acrylic on canvas, in medium format ( 33") to large (50").

In 2008, she has a second solo exhibition of a dozen paintings in the lobby of [[Hotel Sevilla Habana]], one of the masterpieces of the colonial architecture of Cuba. The exhibition reflects one of the slogans of the official posters of the time: "No Mentir Jamás" ("Do not ever lie").&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cubaabsolutely.com/WhatsOnJun2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For the occasion, the paintings were hung through a facility with eight columns of the main hall of Sevilla. The curator of the exhibition was Toni Piñera, critic and columnist of Cuban art, long-time director of the art gallery "La Acacia" in [[Havana]].

Two years later, in late 2009, she organized an exhibition at the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists (UNEAC), entitled "Las Intermitencias del Color", a title inspired by Roland Petit's ballet "Proust, or Intermittences of the Heart" based on the eponymous work of [[Marcel Proust]], with fifteen new large-format paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uneac.org.cu/pdf/catalogo.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315110241/http://www.uneac.org.cu/pdf/catalogo.pdf |archivedate=2014-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toni Piñera is again curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.juventudrebelde.co.cu/culture/2010-01-13/jeannine-achon-and-intermittences-of-color |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130630180212/http://www.juventudrebelde.co.cu/culture/2010-01-13/jeannine-achon-and-intermittences-of-color |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-06-30 |title=Jeannine Achón and Intermittences of Color - Culture - Juventud Rebelde - The newspaper of Cuban Youth |publisher=Juventud Rebelde |date=2010-01-13 |accessdate=2013-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening day, the jazz pianist [[Harold Lopez Nussa]], friend of the painter, plays one of the songs from his album "Sobre el Atelier", composed in memory of his grandfather Leonel Lopez-Nussa, painter, writer and critic of Cuban art.

During the same period, from 2007 to 2009, Jeannine participated in group exhibitions in Spain (University of Madrid) and Cuba, during the [[Havana Biennial]].

From 2010, Jeannine Achón left Havana and moved to Zagreb, Croatia, where her husband, a French diplomat, was posted.Since 2015, she is based in Toulouse (France).

After two years of work, she produced a series of fifteen large paintings, grouped in a series called "Ashé". Here is what she said about it: "''The ashé is a deeply embedded concept in Cuban culture and spirituality; it is the primordial breath, the vital energy, the world's soul. It is a power made of pure energy.  I tried to get a little bit closer to this symbolic world and share it through this series of abstract paintings named by some [[orisha]]s, its deities. When I paint, I try to open doors and paths to the imagination. I don’t see it as a mirror, but as a passage, toward the others and our interiority.''"&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/fiches-ventes-aux-encheres-drouot.jsp?id=473646&amp;r=ACHON+Jeannine&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, her first presentation was done in [[Varaždin]], historic city in northern Croatia, at the [[Galerijski Centar Varaždin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evarazdin.hr/galerijski-centar-varazdin-izlozba-kubanske-slikarice-jeannine-achon/ |title=Galerijski centar Varaždin: Izložba kubanske slikarice Jeannine Achon &amp;#124; Elektronički Varaždin |publisher=eVarazdin.hr |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Mesek]] was the curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubaabsolutely.com/Culture/article_couch.php?id=Jeannine-Achon%27s-Ashe |title=Jeannine Achón's ‘Ashé’ &amp;#124; Guide to Cuba’s best contemporary artists, couch |publisher=Cuba Absolutely |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was then presented at the [[Galerija matice hrvatske]], in Zagreb, with Pf Vanja Babić as curator in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.matica.hr/zbivanja/galerija/1208/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=July 2013}}
This is a list of [[artist]]s who have contributed [[art]] to the [[game]] of ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''. While 25 artists contributed art to the original [[Alpha (Magic: The Gathering)|Alpha]] Magic set, 418 different artists illustrated ''Magic'' cards through ''[[Shards of Alara]]''. [[Ron Spencer]], [[Mark Tedin]], and [[Pete Venters]] were the final original artists from Alpha to be active (each had their most recent new piece in ''[[Magic 2011]]''). Spencer is also amongst the seven artists that have contributed more than 200 pieces for Magic, notable others being [[Greg Staples]], [[Pete Venters]], and [[Kev Walker]]. Walker is notable for having nearly 400 cards featuring his art (396 as of [[Kaladesh]]) and is currently the most-featured artist by a large margin.

The list refers to the earliest printing of a given piece of art.

Split cards with both sides by the same artist count as 2 separate pieces.

'''''Living on the Edge''''' (full title '''''Living on the Edge, the Poetic Works of Gérald Leblanc''''' also known by its [[French language]] title '''''L'extrême frontière, l'oeuvre poétique de Gérald Leblanc''''') is a 2005 [[documentary film]] by [[Canadians|Canadian]] director of [[Acadians|Acadian]] origin [[Rodrigue Jean]]. In this documentary, Rodrigue Jean pays tribute to his Acadian roots, focussing on the poetry of [[Gérald Leblanc]].&lt;ref name=Grugeau&gt;{{cite news|last=Grugeau|first=Gérard|title=ACADIE BLUES|url=http://www.revue24images.com/articles.php?article=101|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=[[24 images]]|date=27 April 2007|language=French|format=Film review|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302001308/http://www.revue24images.com/articles.php?article=101#|archive-date=2012-03-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tremblay&gt;{{cite news|last=Tremblay|first=Odile|title=Un touchant portrait|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/cinema/141209/un-touchant-portrait|accessdate=14 April 2012|newspaper=[[Le Devoir]]|date=28 April 2007|location=Montreal|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A child of the Beat Generation, Gérald Leblanc conjoined urban-ness and American-ness, wandering and belonging, far beyond the boundaries of taboo. In so doing, he helped propel Acadia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=55681 Description section on documentary by NFB site]&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Luristan bronzes''' (rarely "Lorestān", "Lorestāni" etc. in sources in English) are small [[casting|cast]] objects decorated with [[bronze sculpture]]s from the [[Early Iron Age]] which have been found in large numbers in [[Lorestān Province]] and [[Kermanshah]] in western [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;"Luristan" remains the usual spelling in art history for the bronzes, as for example in EI, Muscarella, Frankfort, and current museum practice&lt;/ref&gt; They include a great number of ornaments, tools, weapons, horse-fittings and a smaller number of vessels including [[Situla (vessel)|situla]]e,&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 112–113&lt;/ref&gt; and those found in recorded excavations are generally found in burials.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 115–116; EI I&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnicity of the people who created them remains unclear,&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 116–117; EI I&lt;/ref&gt; though they may well have been [[Persian people|Persian]], possibly related to the modern [[Lur people]] who have given their name to the area. They probably date to between about 1000 and 650 BC.&lt;ref&gt;EI, I&lt;/ref&gt;

The bronzes tend to be flat and use [[openwork]], like the related metalwork of [[Scythian art]].  They represent the art of a nomadic or [[transhumant]] people, for whom all possessions needed to be light and portable, and necessary objects such as weapons, finials (perhaps for tent-poles), horse-harness fittings, pins, cups and  small fittings are highly decorated over their small surface area.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 343-48; Muscarella, 117 is less confident that they were not settled.&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of animals are common, especially goats or sheep with large horns, and the forms and styles are distinctive and inventive. The "[[Master of Animals]]" motif, showing a human positioned between and grasping two [[confronted animals]] is common&lt;ref&gt;EI I&lt;/ref&gt; but typically highly stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 344-45&lt;/ref&gt; Some female "mistress of animals" are seen.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Luristan bronze objects came to the notice of the world art market from the late 1920s and were excavated in considerable quantities by local people, "wild tribesmen who did not encourage the competition of qualified excavators",&lt;ref&gt;Frankfort, 340&lt;/ref&gt; and taken through networks of dealers, latterly illegally, to Europe or America, without information about the contexts in which they were found.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 113; EI I; EI II&lt;/ref&gt; Previous sporadic examples reaching the West had been assigned to various places, including [[Armenia]] and [[Anatolia]].&lt;ref&gt;EI I; EI III&lt;/ref&gt; There is strong suspicion that the many thousands of pieces sourced from the art trade include some forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;EI III; Muscarella, 112–113; EI I; EI II;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L3suAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&amp;lpg=PA171 Wisseman], ''Ancient Technologies and Archaeological Material'', p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1938 several scientific excavations have been conducted by American, Danish, British, Belgian, and Iranian archaeologists on the cemeteries in areas including the northern Pish Kuh valleys and the southern Pusht Kuh of Lorestān; these are terms for the eastern "front" and western "back" slopes of the Kabīrkūh range of mountains, part of the larger [[Zagros Mountains]], which define the region where the bronzes seem to have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 114–117; EI I; EI II&lt;/ref&gt; How these cemeteries related to contemporary settlements remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat curiously, two very characteristic Luristan pieces have been excavated in the Greek world, on [[Samos]] and [[Crete]], but none in other parts of [[Iran]] or the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;EI I&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context, dating and stylistic development==
[[File:Chariot Rein Ring LACMA M.76.97.574.jpg|thumb|A predessor: early [[Elam]]ite horse trapping in cast bronze, c. 2600-2400 BC]]

The term "Luristan bronze" is not normally used for earlier bronze artifacts from Lorestān between the fourth millennium BC and the (Iranian) [[Bronze Age]] (c.&amp;nbsp;2900–1250 BC), although they are often quite similar.&lt;ref&gt;EI I; Muscarella, 117&lt;/ref&gt; These earlier bronze objects, including those from the [[Elamite Empire]], which included Lorestān, were broadly similar to those found in [[Mesopotamia]] and on the [[Iranian Plateau]], though as in the later pieces, animals are a very common subject in small bronze pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 223–237, especially 229–237&lt;/ref&gt;  From slightly before the period of the canonical bronzes, a number of daggers or short swords said to come from Luristan are inscribed with the names of Mesopotamian kings, perhaps reflecting patterns of military service.

The area had, before the period of the bronzes, been the original home of the [[Kassites]], who spoke a non-Iranian language, then under the control of the Iranian-speaking [[Medes]].&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 117&lt;/ref&gt; For most of the period of the bronzes it was, at least in theory, part of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 120, note 6&lt;/ref&gt; As a mountainous rural region, what the rise and fall of these empires meant for the region remains largely uncertain; a [[climate change]] before 1000&amp;nbsp;BC seems to have significantly affected the area.&lt;ref&gt;EI II; Muscarella, 120, note 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The few pieces attributed to Luristan that carry inscriptions are unrecorded pieces from the antiquities market.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 117, 120 note 6; EI I&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists divide the periods producing the bronzes in "Luristan Late Iron" (Age)&amp;nbsp;I to III. Luristan Late Iron&amp;nbsp;II was less productive, and remains less well understood.  Dates for these periods "remain fluid" but "it is possible to suggest that the material from Luristan Iron&amp;nbsp;I was manufactured in the years around 1000&amp;nbsp;B.C., that of Iron&amp;nbsp;II about 900/800–750, and that of Iron&amp;nbsp;III about 750/725–650."&lt;ref&gt;EI, I; Muscarella, 117–119; EI II suggests "ca. 1300/1250 to 700/650 BCE"&lt;/ref&gt;

The stylistic development of the pieces is now thought to be from naturalistic depictions of humans and animals towards stylization, though it is not yet clear if this was a consistent trend. This reverses the trend proposed by [[Michael Rostovtzeff]], one of the earliest writers on the bronzes.&lt;ref&gt;EI, I; Muscarella, 117–119, 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of objects==
Though there is a wide range of objects, certain types are especially common, distinctive, and hence "canonical".&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 114–115; EI I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal finials, standards and tubes===
Among the most characteristic are a range of objects with a hollow socket or open ring, designed to be fixed at the top of a pole or other vertical support, often using a separate intervening fitting. These may be described as finials, standards and tubes; Muscarella and other writers use all these terms, differentiating between them on the basis of the form of their decoration alone. Unlike some other types of objects, very few of this group have been found by the archaeological explorations. They may also have been used with perishable elements that have not survived, either as additional decoration or to hold the ensemble together. Many ideas for their function have been suggested, without any general consensus being reached; one persistent suggestion is that leafy or flowering branches were inserted to top them. The numbers surviving suggest that the objects were not rare, and may have been affordable by most families.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 136–140&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Standard Finial LACMA M.76.97.13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Master of Animals]] standard]]

Taking the groups in what is now generally considered to be their broad chronological sequence, the first are the "animal finials", with two rampant [[confronted animals]], generally a pair of large-horned ibex (or goats or [[mouflon]] sheep) or felines, facing each other with a central tube or open rings (formed at the junctions of their front and hind feet) between them.  The [[bezoar ibex]] (''capra aegagrus aegagrusis''), the local wild species of goat or ibex, was already domesticated millennia before;&lt;ref&gt;Melinda A. Zeder, Brian Hesse: ''The Initial Domestication of Goats (''Capra hircus'') in the Zagros Mountains 10,000 Years Ago''. Science 24 March 2000: Vol. 287. no. 5461, pp. 2254–2257 [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/287/5461/2254 online abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; it has large curved horns with knobbly ribs. Compared to later types, the animals are more naturalistic, especially the ibex group, though not so much that their precise species can be very confidently determined.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 136, 142–146&lt;/ref&gt; In some examples the figures are "demons", with human features except for their large horns.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 143&lt;/ref&gt;

The next group is a less common type, often called the "idol standard". Here the feline "animal finial" type has in addition a detached human head in between the two heads of the animals, held by their front paws. The designs have become openwork, with enclosed spaces formed by the human head and the head and neck of each feline, and others by their hind legs.  The meaning, if any, of this group is unclear, but they seem if anything to reverse the meaning of the next, much more common group, called the "master of animals standards".&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 146–147&lt;/ref&gt;

These have a fuller figure, now seen down to the waist with an essentially human shape (including what may be divine and "demonic" figures) in between the two animals, grasping them to form the [[Master of Animals]] motif, already over 2000 years old at this point, and a mainstay of [[iconography]] in the [[art of Mesopotamia]]. Now the arms of the human usually extend to grasp the necks of the animals. All the figures are highly stylized, and often the whole composition is repeated underneath, facing in the opposite direction. The bodies of all three figures tend to merge at the middle into the central tube, before diverging again at the lower limbs. The "zoomorphic juncture", where the body of one animal turns into another, is very often seen, with a further human head and pair of animal heads appearing at the waist level of the top set of figures. This second human head often also has a body, and two further animal heads, these typically of cocks, project from it lower down.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 147–150;  Frankfort, 344-45&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final group, called the "anthromorphic tubes", this lower figure with projecting cock's heads is all that is left, or just the human figure, of which only the head may be at all recognisable. Thus the simplest types are just a tube with a human face near the top, sometimes a [[Janus]] face with two heads back to back, and perhaps some simple mouldings on the tube. Whether these groups actually represent a chronological development with one type succeeding another is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 151–153&lt;/ref&gt; Other tubes are comparable, but use animal rather than human features.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horse cheekpieces===
[[File:Cheekpieces from a Horse Bit LACMA 64.12.40 (2 of 2).jpg|thumb|Some horse cheekpieces have the animal "body" reduced to a rectangle.]]
Another common class of bronzes is pairs of horse cheekpieces from [[Bit (horse)|bits]]; when complete these come with a bar between them that goes in the horse's mouth. There are often rings in the upper or rear parts of the plates, for securing straps to tie round the horse's head.  These are flat openwork plates, with a reinforced central hole for the bit mouthpiece to go through; where complete sets survive these are held in place by the ends of the mouthpiece bar being curled back.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 155–157; EI II&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs are varied, but most common are animals, very often in fantastic versions with wings, and the Master of Animals. Other subjects include charioteers, and a subject with two figures flanking a tree-like object.  Many examples survive as single plates, perhaps separated after they were dug up.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 155–157; EI II&lt;/ref&gt;  The common story that the pieces were often found placed underneath the heads of men in burials seems not to be true.  Most pieces were found in unrecorded contexts, but one example of a Luristan [[horse burial]] is known; it is unclear if it was from the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Though horse riding was very common among Near Eastern elites by this date, who all used some type of bit, this large style of cheekpiece is only found in Luristan. The rigid single-piece mouthpiece bar, secured by bent back ends, is also unusual; elsewhere more flexible mouthpieces are found.  Many pieces have small spikes on the reverse of the plates; it is thought these were either used to control the horse, or to fix backing pads of softer material.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pin heads===
[[File:Disc - headed Pin LACMA M.76.97.154 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Face from an otherwise undecorated disk pin]]
Large decorated pin heads are the third common and distinctive type of Luristan bronzes, falling into two distinct groups: sculptural and openwork designs, many using the iconographic repertoire of other types of objects, and flat, normally round, disk heads.  Their use is uncertain; they were probably both used as [[votive offering]]s, as the numbers found in the excavated temple at [[Surkh Dum]] suggests, but also worn as decoration or for fastening clothes. Other uses have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 122–132 on bronze Surkh Dum finds, 173–180&lt;/ref&gt;  These have not been found in excavated tombs.&lt;ref&gt;EI II&lt;/ref&gt; Pin heads in bone and [[faience]] were also found at Surkh Dum.

The disk-headed pins are made from sheet metal by [[repoussé and chasing]] work, [[engraving]] and other techniques, so differing from the types described above, which are [[casting|cast]].  Many designs centre on a large face, and in general humans predominate over animals in their decoration, another difference to the other types.  The diameter of the disk is typically between 6 and 9 centimetres, and the whole pin and head up to about 20 centimetres.  Similar large face designs are found on some other plaques of uncertain purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 202–206&lt;/ref&gt;

The faces are mostly rounded to fill a circular space, and may be intended as female.  They lack beards, and some full figures are clearly female, sitting with open legs displaying a [[vulva]], perhaps shown in [[childbirth]]; in other pins this is clearly the case.  These pieces were presumably votives for fertility.  The eyes are sometimes inlaid in white, with a black dot for the pupil.  The face may occupy most of the disk, or be small, at the centre of a wide border with other subjects. Other designs feature a wide range of subjects, with some purely decorative motifs, and others featuring some complex, mainly religious, scenes with many figures ("odd-looking demons and animals apparently involved in cultic and mythological activities", as Muscarella describes them).&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 202–206; EI I quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Other types===
Other types include bronzes centred on a large ring, mostly decorated with animals in way similar to the finials and cheekpieces.  These perhaps were part of horse-harnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt;  Large socketed pieces are assumed to be handles for [[sharpening stone|whetstone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;  Other pieces made from sheet metal include sheets for the front covers of [[quiver]]s, typically divided vertically into registers with small scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 192–202&lt;/ref&gt;  There are cups and [[situlae]], both with rounded bottoms.  Weapons are common, including a type of "spiked axehead" with spreading strips or spikes behind the axehead; these are also found in miniature votive versions.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 135, 184–191&lt;/ref&gt;  Some examples seem to have had "spikes" that were designed to be functional in combat, others perhaps not.&lt;ref&gt;EI II&lt;/ref&gt;  A kind of long "[[halberd]]-axe" has the head of an animal perched at the top of the blade, and spikes on the other side. Pieces of bronze jewellery such as rings, bracelets pendants and arm or anklets are also found.&lt;ref&gt;Muscarella, 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lux Helsinki''' is an annual light art event. It is arranged in the beginning of January in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. The event introduces a wide array of light artworks by both international and Finnish artists. The event is arranged by the City of Helsinki. The entry is free of charge. The Artistic Director of Lux Helsinki is Markku Uimonen, Professor in Lighting Design at the [[Theatre Academy Helsinki|Theatre Academy]] of the [[University of the Arts Helsinki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mac Dougall|first=David|title=Finnish capital lights up in winter dark|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130108/eu-finland-winter-lights|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davey|first=Alexandra|title=New Northern Lights|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/news/2013/january/lux-helsinki|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Condé Nast Traveller|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lux Helsinki was held for the first time in 2009.

== 2014 ==
The sixth Lux Helsinki was arranged between 4 and 8 January 2014. Light installations were seen at 11 sites. An exhibition of light art ''Lux IN'' was held for the first time in Merikaapelihalli at the [[Kaapelitehdas|Cable Factory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pantzar|first=Katja|title=Lux lights up Helsinki|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/lux_lights_up_helsinki/7012511|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Yle News|date=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 11 light installations were seen at the centre of Helsinki, 19 installations at the Cable Factory and almost 150 lanterns at the ''Lantern Park'' of the Hesperia Park. In addition to the Cable Factory and Hesperia Park, the event venues of 2014 were [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]], the [[New Student House, Helsinki|New Student House]], Kansalaistori, the [[Helsinki Music Centre]], Hakasalmi Villa, the [[National Museum of Finland]], the [[VR Warehouses]] and the [[Finnish National Opera|National Opera]] Amphitheatre. The ''Lux Ratikka'' [[tram]] travelled along tracks in the centre already for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lux Helsinki keräsi 150 000 kävijää|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/Lux+Helsinki+ker%C3%A4si+150000+k%C3%A4vij%C3%A4%C3%A4/a1389235225437|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event gathered circa 150 000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Valotapahtuma keräsi 150 000 kävijää|url=http://metro.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/valotapahtuma_kerasi_150_000_kavijaa/|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Metro.fi|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corazón ===
The installation of the Senate Square was ''Corazón'' by the Spanish fashion designer [[Agatha Ruiz de la Prada]] in collaboration with the production and design company D-Facto. The installation consisted of a huge heart placed at the top of the steps of [[Helsinki Cathedral]]. Also the Cathedral backdrop, with its own lighting, merged into the installation. The installation was previously seen in the 2012 [[Fête des Lumières]] in [[Lyon]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karila|first=Juhani|title=Lux Helsinki tuo Senaatintorille valoja sykkivän alumiinisydämen|url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/Lux+Helsinki+tuo+Senaatintorille+valoja+sykkiv%C3%A4n+alumiinisyd%C3%A4men/a1388644251645|accessdate=27 January 2014|newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Flipper ===
The installation of the New Student House was ''Urban Flipper'' by the French company CT Light Concept, a giant [[pinball]] game at the facade of the building. One viewer at a time could operate the game onsite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lux Helsinki tuo valoa pimeään vuodenaikaan|url=http://www.helsinginuutiset.fi/artikkeli/270528-lux-helsinki-tuo-valoa-pimeaan-vuodenaikaan|accessdate=28 January 2014|newspaper=Helsingin Uutiset|date=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was seen for the first time in the 2011 [[Fête des Lumières]] in [[Lyon]], France.

==Projects==
In Rakowitz's project return he reopens his grandfather's import and export business. The company initially functioned as a drop box. In 2005 it became a packaging center and sorting facility. Members of the Iraqi diaspora community and interested citizens were invited to send things to be shipped free of charge to recipients in Iraq. Rakowitz also wanted to explore the possibility of importing things clearly labeled "Product of Iraq"; he chose dates which were legendary{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} in Iraq, with a yield of over 600 varieties. The first batch he tried to ship died in Syria but the second made its way through different nations and different customs; the dates became a representative for an Iraq refugee traveling to a new life.When they finally made it to Brooklyn there people were eager to try them, this fruit that caused so many problems to get there asked questions and brought up memories.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

One of his more notable{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} projects is Enemy Kitchen. The project began in 2004; in it Rakowitz compiles Baghdad recipes with the help of his mother and then teaches them to public audiences. The first time this project was performed was with students who lived in Chelsea and went to the Hudson Guild Community Center. With the project in cooking and eating the food, it opens up the lines of communication allowing, in this case, the students to attach the word Iraq to food as a representative of culture and discuss it. The students discussed the war and compare it to their own lives. Later this project also included a [[food truck]] that roamed around Chicago. The food truck itself gives home to the Iraqi ex-pat community and is another way of bringing art down to a level that involves and interacts with people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-09/entertainment/ct-ae-0311-michael-rakowitz-20120308_1_art-project-smart-museum-conceptual-art Michael Rakowitz interview: Enemy Kitchen food truck - tribunedigital-chicagotribune, March 9, 2012, by Christopher Borrelli]&lt;/ref&gt; Rakowitz says, "I see the truck as a potentially healing gesture, not that it has to be. I don't have delusions that it will perform the hard work of healing traumas. I do believe there can be an aesthetic of good intentions, but I'm leery of saying what those are. No, I'm not going to tell anyone it's art."{{Cite quote|date=July 2016}}

Rakowitz about how he sees his art: "As an artistic gesture I try to make an unlikely thing happen, and the impossible becomes possible. It's art because it's impossible for this to exist in the world."{{Cite quote|date=July 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4253">'''Park McArthur''' (born 1984, North Carolina, USA) is an artist living in [[New York City]] who works in [[sculpture]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[Writing|text]], and [[sound]]. McArthur is a wheelchair user whose work uses this position to inform her art.

==Life and work==
McArthur graduated with a Masters in Fine Art from the [[University of Miami]] in 2009 and studied at the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program, 2011-2012. About McArthur's 2014 exhibition ''Ramps'', wherein the artist exhibited the wheelchair ramps of institutions with which she had previously worked, writer Andrew Blackley said, "The exhibition displayed the means by which institutions both produce and deny access. Each ramp challenged reappraisal and reinforced a set of past and future foreclosures. ‘Ramps’ enlisted generative, generous responses to the negativity of the institution, to the point of engendering the reproduction of those very negative characteristics (by removing the objects’ previously assumed ‘function’). By extension, at stake and always under threat are the threaded relationships between queerness and disability, the breakdown of their concomitant binaries and the temporality of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackley|first1=Andrew|title=Park McArthur: Geometry, Material, Scale|journal=Afterall Journal|date=Autumn–Winter 2015|pages=54–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McArthur, recently, in 2015, addressed [[Félix González-Torres|Felix Gonzalez-Torrez]]'s ''"Untitled" (Love Letter From the War Front)'' in [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], Lower Manhattan, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Park McArthur on "Untitled" (Love Letter From The War Front) by Felix Gonzalez-Torrez|url=http://whitney.org/WatchAndListen/Artists?context=Artist&amp;play_id=1283|website=Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McArthur's work has been described as questioning of "care alongside questions of autonomy and dependency" in regards to the daily experience of disabled individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/lang/faculty/Park-McArthur/|title=Park McArthur|website=www.newschool.edu|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; McArthur uses her work to challenge the status quo and give those who are usually marginalized by societal structures a voice. Her choice of medium are sculptures and installations that "conceptually driven and often composed of utilitarian materials such as blocks of foam or a Wikipedia entry."&lt;ref name="lnchen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Park McArthur|url=https://www.artsy.net/artist/park-mcarthur|website=Artsy|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her works elicit an “experience of activism and jerry-built ingenuity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/12/19-best-art-shows-of-2014.html|title=The 19 Best Art Shows of 2014|website=Vulture|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, McArthur won the [[Wynn Newhouse Award]], an annual prize given to disabled artists in recognition of their artistic merit.

McArthur is represented by Essex Street Gallery, New York, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McArthur|first1=Park|url=http://www.essexstreet.biz/artist/mcarthur|website=Essex Street Gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Goffin''' [[FRSA|F.R.S.A.]] (28 February 1906 - 22 March 1974), was an English set and costume designer and stage manager, known for his work with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

==Biography==
Goffin was born in [[Plymouth]], England, the son of Willam Earl Goffin and Elizabeth Goffin, née Underwood. From 1922 to 1930 he worked as an interior decorator and mural painter locally.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', fourteenth edition (1967), p. 655, Pitman Publishing, London&lt;/ref&gt;  As a young man, he was taken on by the local repertory theatre in Plymouth as a designer, going on to [[Dartington Hall]] from 1931-34 where he took over responsibility for staging, costumes and lighting of the Dance-Drama Group.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;  In 1935 and 1936 he was resident director at the Barn Theatre, [[Chesham Bois]], [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

In 1936, Goffin went to the Westminster Theatre in London, working with [[Harley Granville Barker]] and Michael MacOwan on a range of productions, from classics such as ''[[Volpone]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', to modern works including ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]], [[Heartbreak House]],'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''The Family Reunion.''  In 1938 Goffin was invited by the government to supervise a course on stagecraft and to lecture on the subject.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

During his Dartington days, Goffin met [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].  She introduced him to her father, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], who commissioned Goffin to redesign the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s production of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' in 1938.  Goffin's new set caused dissent among traditionalists because it did not depict the familiar backdrop of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]].  [[Martyn Green]], the reigning principal comedian, was far from happy with his new costume, and he implied in his memoirs that it was one of the reasons why he later left the company.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Green, ''Here’s a How-De-Do'', London, Max Reinhardt, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rupert and later Bridget D'Oyly Carte, he designed new sets and costumes for ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1948), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1958 – sets only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961), and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  He also created a unit set – a framework on which the sets for each opera could easily be interchanged, which, according to [[Frederic Lloyd]], the General Manager of the D'Oyly Carte Company, "saved the management an enormous amount of expense and facilitated taking more operas to more theatres."&lt;ref&gt;Goffin's obituary in ''The Savoyard''&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Goffin designed a number of posters and other graphic art for the D'Oyly Carte organisation.

Goffin wrote books including ''Stage Lighting'' (1938), ''The Realm of Art'' (1946), ''Stage Lighting For Amateurs'' (1947) and ''The art and science of stage management'' (1953).  His ''The Realm of Art'', and his meeting [[Leon MacLaren]], led the [[School of Economic Science]] to begin teaching philosophy; Goffin later presented their early public philosophy lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Stewart |title=Standing for Justice |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |page=67|year=2009 |isbn=0-85683-194-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dorine Tolley |title=The Power Within: Leon MacLaren, A Memoir of His Life and Work |publisher=BookSurge Publishing| pages=76–77 |year=2009 |isbn=1-4392-1030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1948.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

He was married to Margaret Wallace Dale.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt; Goffin died in [[Buckinghamshire]] at the age of 68.

'''''Saying Grace''''' is a 1951 painting by American illustrator [[Norman Rockwell]], painted for the cover of ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'''s November 24, 1951, [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] issue.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{Cite web |work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/arts/design/norman-rockwells-america-newly-up-for-bid.html|title=Norman Rockwell's America, Newly Up for Bid|author=Carol Vogel|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=National Public Radio|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/12/04/248790682/norman-rockwells-saying-grace-sells-for-46-million-at-auction|title=Norman Rockwell's 'Saying Grace' Sells For $46 Million At Auction|accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a woman and a young boy [[Grace (prayer)|saying grace]] in a crowded restaurant, as they are observed by other people at their table.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; Rockwell's inspiration for ''Saying Grace'' came from a ''Saturday Evening Post'' reader who saw a [[Mennonite]] family praying in a restaurant.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; Rockwell used his son, Jarvis, as one of the models for the painting.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; Elizabeth Goldberg, director of American Art at [[Sotheby's]] said that in his preparations for ''Saying Grace'' Rockwell "... visited [[Automat]]s and diners in New York and Philadelphia to get the scene just right&amp;nbsp;... his imagery was so vivid people would say they recognized the diner even though it didn't exist, each painting felt so universal."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Rockwell took the table and chairs from a diner in [[Times Square]] for the photo shoot for the painting.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In preparations for a painting Rockwell would set up a scene, using his friends and neighbors, taking hundreds of photos until satisfied. Rockwell would produce sketches in charcoal, then oil sketches, before painting the final image.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Rockwell was paid $3,500 ({{Inflation|US|3500|1951|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}){{Inflation-fn|US}} for ''Saying Grace''.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Readers of ''The Saturday Evening Post'' voted ''Saying Grace'' their favorite ever cover in 1955.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt;  ''Saying Grace'' had been on a long term loan at the [[Norman Rockwell Museum]], and had been exhibited at 12 other museums across the United States before its 2013 sale.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

==2013 sale==
''Saying Grace'' sold for $46 million (including a buyer's premium) at Sotheby's in December 2013, setting a new record price for Rockwell's art. Rockwell's previous record had been set in 2006 by the $15 million sale of ''Breaking Home Ties''.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; ''Saying Grace'' had been expected to sell for between $15 million and $20 million.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; The buyer of ''Saying Grace'' was not identified.&lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;{{Cite web |work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/dec/04/norman-rockwell-painting-sells-record-auction|title=Norman Rockwell painting bought for record $46m price at Sotheby's auction|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other Rockwell paintings that had been loaned to the Norman Rockwell Museum were sold alongside ''Saying Grace''; ''The Gossips'' and ''[[Walking to Church]]''.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; The three paintings, along with four other art works by Rockwell, were sold by the descendants of Kenneth J. Stuart, the [[art director]] of ''The Saturday Evening Post''. The sale of the art works was initiated after the conclusion of a legal disagreement among Stuart's sons.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; A long term colleague of Rockwell's, Stuart had been given the paintings by Rockwell as a gift.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; ''Saying Grace'' had hung in Stuart's office at the ''Saturday Evening Post'', and subsequently in the Stuarts' living room in [[Wilton, Connecticut]]. Stuart's sons could no longer afford the insurance and upkeep of the paintings by the time of their 2013 sale.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

Upon Stuart's death in 1993, his estate was divided equally among his three sons, Ken Jr., William, and Jonathan.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The oldest brother, Ken Jr., was subsequently sued by William and Jonathan, who claimed that he had forced their father to sign papers so he could gain control of his fortune.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; They additionally claimed that Ken Jr. had used the assets of his father's estate for his own expenses. The three brothers settled out of court before the sale.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The owner of ''The Saturday Evening Post'', [[Curtis Publishing Company]], which retains reproduction rights to Rockwell's artworks, also unsuccessfully attempted to claim ownership of the paintings.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

The director of the Norman Rockwell Museum, Laurie Norton Moffatt, has expressed her hope that the paintings will eventually be reunited with the museum. Moffatt said of the paintings that "We cared for them like children&amp;nbsp;... We hope they come back some day. We believe that's where they belong."&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; Moffatt said that the loss of the paintings left an "irreplaceable hole in the museum's collection."&lt;ref name="Hub"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hubbusiness.com/the-normam-rockwell-museums-loss-is-sothebys-gain/ | title=The Normam Rockwell Museum’s loss is Sotheby’s gain | work=Hub Business | date=19 September 2013 | accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Six principles of [[Chinese painting]]''' were established by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]] in "Six points to consider when judging a painting" (繪畫六法, [[Pinyin]]:Huìhuà Liùfǎ) from the preface to his book "The Record of the Classification of Old Painters" (古畫品錄; [[Pinyin]]: Gǔhuà Pǐnlù) written circa 550 and refers to "old" and "ancient" practices.  The six elements that define a painting are:

# "''Spirit Resonance''," or vitality, and seems to translate to the nervous energy transmitted from the artist into the work.  The overall energy of a work of art.  Xie He said that without Spirit Resonance, there was no need to look further.
# "''Bone Method''," or the way of using the brush.  This refers not only to texture and brush stroke, but to the close link between handwriting and personality.  In his day, the art of calligraphy was inseparable from painting.
# "''Correspondence to the Object''," or the depicting of form, which would include shape and line.
# "''Suitability to Type''," or the application of color, including layers, value and tone.
# "''Division and Planning''," or placing and arrangement, corresponding to composition, space and depth.
# "''Transmission by Copying''," or the copying of models, not only from life but also the works of antiquity.

These have been translated over the years by a succession of sinologists with very varying translations. "The problem lies, of course, in the terseness of the original Chinese, where each principle is stated in but four characters.... Each period of Chinese painting has its own special way of interpreting the six principles...their application is fluid, varying according to period and artist".&lt;ref&gt;Fritz van Briessen, ''The Way of the Brush: Painting Techniques of China and Japan''. Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1962, pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6633">[[File:Rembrandt The Three Crosses 1653.jpg|thumb|340px|The Three Crosses, [[drypoint]] by [[Rembrandt]]. This is state III of 1653. State IV is believed to date from 1660, and looks very different, as Rembrandt greatly reworked and darkened the composition. State III is easy to identify, as only it has a visible signature.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher White, "The Late Etchings of Rembrandt", 1969, British Museum/Lund Humphries, London&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Judith with the Head of Holofernes Mocetto 2nd state.jpg|thumb|[[Girolamo Mocetto]], ''[[Judith beheading Holofernes|Judith with the Head of Holofernes]]'' (1500/05), engraving after [[Andrea Mantegna]], second state. In the first state the background is plain; the landscape of state II was probably added some years later.]] 
In [[printmaking]], a '''state''' is a different form of a print, caused by a deliberate and permanent change to a matrix such as a copper plate (for [[engraving]]s etc.) or woodblock (for [[woodcut]]).

Artists often take prints from a plate (or block, etc.) and then do further work on the plate before printing more impressions (copies). Sometimes two states may be printed on the same day, sometimes several years may elapse between them.

States are usually numbered in [[Roman numeral]]s: I, II, III&amp;nbsp;..., and often as e.g.: "I/III", to indicate the first of three recorded states. Some recent scholars refine the work of their predecessors, without wishing to create a confusing new numbering, by identifying states such as "IIa", "IVb" and so forth. A print with no different states known is catalogued as "only state".

Most authorities do not count accidental damage to a plate&amp;nbsp;– usually scratches on a metal plate or cracks in a woodcut block&amp;nbsp;– as constituting different states, partly because scratches can disappear again after being printed a number of times.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Prints and Printmaking, Antony Griffiths,p , British Museum Press (in UK),2nd edn, 1996 {{ISBN|0-7141-2608-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of states mostly goes back to [[Adam von Bartsch]], the great cataloguer of [[old master print]]s. A great deal of work was done by art historians during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and most non-contemporary printmakers now have all the states of their prints catalogued. To discover a new or ''unrecorded'' state of an old master print is therefore now rare, although it was only in 1967, after it was sold to Cleveland, that it was realised that what had long been famous as the best impression of the highly important print,  the ''[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nudes]]'' by [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]] (1465–75) was the unique surviving impression of a previously unrecognised first state.  This is especially surprising as the whole plate was extensively reworked between the two, apparently to renew it after it was worn from printing.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale, Shelley, ''Battle of the Nudes: Pollaiuolo's Renaissance Masterpiece'', pp. 33–34, The Cleveland Museum of Art, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In modern prints, a distinction is made between ''proof states'' or ''working proofs'', which are produced before the print is regarded as finished, and other states. This is usually possible because modern prints are issued in [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s, usually signed and numbered. In the case of old master prints, before about 1830, this was not usually the case, and ''proof state'' is only used when the print is clearly half-finished, as with two impressions of [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s ''Adam and Eve'' in the [[British Museum]] and the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in Vienna. However, most "[[Artist's proof|artist's proofs]]" are impressions of the main state which are not counted in the main limited edition numbers, and are taken by the artist; they are therefore from the same state as the main edition.

For example, unlike Dürer, for whom relatively few different states survive, [[Rembrandt]] prints have often survived in multiple states (up to eleven). It is clear that many of the earlier states are working proofs, made to confirm how the printed image was developing, but it is impossible to draw a confident line between these and other states that Rembrandt may well have regarded as finished at the point he printed them. Rembrandt is one of the most prolific creator of states, and also reworked plates after leaving them for some years.

New states in old master prints are often caused by the adding of inscriptions (signatures, dedications, publishers details, even a price) inside or below the image. Except for signatures, these would often not be added by the artist himself. A wholesale example is [[Daniel Hopfer]], the inventor of [[etching]] as a printmaking technique ({{circa|1500}}), and other members of his family. In the late 17th century, a distant relative of the Hopfers, David Funck, acquired 230 of the Hopfers' iron plates, and reprinted these under the title ''Operae Hopferianae'', adding a somewhat crudely scratched number, known as the ''Funck number'', to each one, thus creating a second state of the hitherto unretouched plates. 

Sometimes another artist may add to a plate, or a (usually) anonymous artist or craftsman would ''rework'' a plate which has become worn out by printing. This has now been done to most surviving plates by Rembrandt (often more than once) and many by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Martin Schongauer]] and others. An example is ''[[Forest Marsh with Travellers on a Bank]]'' (1640s-1650s), an etching by [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], where another hand later added clouds.

When they develop a keen collector's market, artists have often exploited this by creating extra states. This trend can be seen in, among others, the English [[mezzotint]]ers of the late 18th century ("before lettering" states were their speciality) and Sir [[David Young Cameron]] in the early 20th century (his record was a rather absurd twenty-eight states).&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;

==Book collecting==
A similar use of "state" is in [[book collecting]], where a particular page may be reset for some reason in the course of printing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aba.org.uk/bulletin/termsof.htm#4 Antiquarian Booksellers Association - Terms - see S. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2779">The '''Symphony in [[F-sharp major|F-sharp]], Op.&amp;nbsp;40''', is the only [[symphony]] written by the 20th-century [[Austria]]n [[composer]] [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], though he also wrote a ''[[Sinfonietta_(Korngold)|Sinfonietta]]'', Op.&amp;nbsp;5, in 1911-12. 

The symphony was completed in 1952 and was dedicated to the memory of American president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who died in April 1945.

The work utilises a theme Korngold had written for the 1939 film ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]''.

It was premiered on [[Austria]]n radio on 17 October 1954 by the [[Vienna Symphony|Vienna Symphony Orchestra]] under [[Harold Byrns]], although it was described as "poorly rehearsed and performed.&lt;ref name=ACO&gt;[http://www.americancomposers.org/notes20020310.htm American Composers Orchestra]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=datebook/&gt; In 1959, [[Dimitris Mitropoulos|Dimitri Mitropoulos]] wrote: "All my life I have searched for the perfect modern work. In this symphony I have found it. I shall perform it the next season." But Mitropoulos's death intervened, and the Symphony, though played several times on European radio, did not have its concert premiere until 27 November 1972 in [[Munich]], under [[Rudolf Kempe]].&lt;ref name=ACO/&gt;&lt;ref name=datebook&gt;[http://composersdatebook.publicradio.org/listings/datebook_20061127.shtml Composers Datebook]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the work has entered the repertoire with a number of CD recordings available,&lt;ref&gt;Surveyed by Ian Lace on [http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2011/June11/Korngold_Lace.htm MusicWeb International]. Retrieved 2011-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt; and the full score has been published by Schott Musik in their Eulenburg series.

It runs for about 50 minutes and is in four movements:
# Moderato, ma energico — intense and stormy, with a jagged main theme
# [[Scherzo]]
# Adagio — long, profound and meditative, in the tradition of [[Anton Bruckner]]. A memorial to Roosevelt.
# Finale — optimistic; listeners will recognize references to film music and the song, "[[Over There]]".

The work is scored for large orchestra consisting of: 3 [[flute]]s (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[Contrabassoon|double bassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 4 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] (3 players are handling: [[bass drum]], [[cymbals]], [[gong]], [[glockenspiel]], [[marimba]], [[xylophone]]), [[harp]], [[piano]] (doubling [[celesta]]) and [[String instrument|strings]].

Originally, several sources were visible next to and below the reliefs and arches, some of which are now covered. Sources next to the reliefs still feed a large basin in front of the rock. The site has been turned into an archaeological park and a series of late Sasanian and Islamic column capitals have been brought together (some found at Taq Bostan, others at [[Bisutun]] and Kermanshah).

The carvings, some of the finest and best-preserved examples of Persian sculpture under the Sassanids, include representations of the investitures of [[Ardashir II]] (379–383) and [[Shapur III]] (383–388). Like other Sassanid symbols, Taq-e Bostan, and its relief patterns accentuate power, religious tendencies, glory, honor, the vastness of the court, game and fighting spirit, festivity, joy, and rejoicing.

Sassanid kings chose a beautiful setting for their rock reliefs along an historic [[Silk Road]] caravan route [[waypoint]] and campground. The reliefs are adjacent a sacred springs that empty into a large reflecting pool at the base of a mountain cliff.

Taq-e Bostan and its rock relief are one of the 30 surviving Sassanid relics of the [[Zagros mountains]]. According to [[Arthur Pope]], the founder of Iranian art and archeology Institute in the US, "art was characteristic of the Iranian people and the gift which they endowed the world with."

==Description of the rock reliefs==
The Taq-e Bostan complex comprise a rock relief standing on its own and several more reliefs associated with two rock cut arches. They illustrate the investiture ceremonies of the kings [[Ardashir II]], [[Shapur II]], [[Shapur III]] and [[Khosrau II]]. They also depict the hunting scenes of Khosrau II.

=== Investiture of Ardashir II ===
[[Image:Scene outside the Taq Bostan arch, crowning ceremony of Ardashir II.png|250px|thumb|left|The first scene outside the arch, crowning ceremony of [[Ardashir II]]]]

The first Taq-e Bostan relief, and apparently the oldest, is a rock relief of the crowning ceremony of [[Ardashir II]] (379-383 AD) by his predecessor [[Shapur II]] or Ahura Mazda (although even the middle figure is wearing a Sassanian crown, with the balloon-like top/compartment [apparently to hold their hair in], and the figure to his left is the receiver of the ring; so he could not be Ahura Mazda, either). Researchers long debated the identities of the figures in this relief but is now ascertained that Ardashir II receives the beribboned ring - symbol of royal investiture - from his predecessor Shapur II or Ahura Mazda. There may be a deliberate mixture of the iconography of both identities. The two main figures are standing on the fallen Roman emperor Julianus Apostata (361-363 AD). Ardashir played an important role in his defeat during the reign of Shapur II (309-379 AD). Exceptional within Sasanian art is the fact that this is a portrait, based on the image of Julianus Apostata as it appears on Roman coins. Ardashir II was installed as interim ruler, awaiting the coming of age of the royal heir Shapur III (383-388 AD). The fourth figure is the god Mithra who holds a barsum in his hands and stands on a lotus flower. He is the protector of oaths and is witness to this pact. 
Local beliefs and Persian folk tale interpreted the scene as the victory of the first Sasanian kings on Artabanus IV, the last king of the Parthian dynasty. The Mithra figure became the visual inspiration for representations of the prophet Zoroaster.

The relief panel is approx. 4.07 m wide and 3.9 m high.

=== Shapur II and Shapur III ===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:ShapurIII-II.png|250px|thumb|Crowning ceremony of Shapur III bearing two Pahlavi scripture behind their heads in the smaller arch.]] --&gt;
The smaller arch or iwan (Taq-e Bustan II) has on the upper part of the back wall two [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]] inscriptions identifying two royal figures as Shapur II (Shapur the Great) and his son Shapur III. They are shown facing each other. The arch's vestibule measures 6 x 5 x 3.6 meters. It has been suggested as having been built during the reign of Shapur III and some put the date of its completion at 385 AD. However, the royal crown of Shapur III does not agree with those on his coins and is closer to that of his predecessor Ardashir II. It has been argued that the texts represent an usurpation of Ardashir's relief by Shapur III. The translation of the inscriptions follows:

'''Shapur II inscription :'''

:''This is the figure of [[Ahura Mazda|Mazda]]-worshipping Lord Shapur, the king of kings of Iran and [[Aniran]], whose race is from the Gods. Son of Mazda-worshipping Lord [[Hormizd II of Persia|Hormizd]], the king of kings of Iran and Aniran, whose race is from the Gods, grandson of Lord [[Narseh of Persia|Nersi]], the [[Shahanshah]] (king of kings).''

The figures of the two kings have been carved in low relief, looking at each other. Each figure is ca. 2.97 meters. Shapur II is on the right and Shapur III is on the left. Their hands are placed on a long straight sword which point downwards. The right hand is holding the grip and the left rests on the sheath. Both figures wear loose trousers, necklaces, curled hair, and a pointed beard ending in a ring.

=== Iwan of Khusrow II ===
The three figures on the back wall of the large ''iwan'' are usually considered to represent [[Khosrau II of Persia|Khosrow Parviz]] flanked by [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Anahita]]. They are placed above a mounted Persian knight, thought to be Khusrow himself riding his favourite horse, [[Shabdiz]]. There is, however, no unanimity about the exact identification of this late Sasanian king. The two attending figures are sometimes considered to be a priest and a priestess, rather than the gods Ahura Mazda and Anahita themselves.

One of the most impressive reliefs inside the largest grotto or ''ivan'' is the gigantic [[equestrian sculpture|equestrian]] figure of the Sassanid king [[Khosrau II]] (591-628 CE) mounted on his favorite charger, [[Shabdiz]]. Both horse and rider are arrayed in full battle armor.

The front of the rock-cut arch bears delicately carved patterns showing the tree of life or the sacred tree. Above the arch and located on two opposite sides are figures of two winged women with [[Diadem (personal wear)|diadems]].

Equestrian relief panel measured on 16.08.07 approx. 7.45m across by 4.25 m high

===Scene of boar and deer hunting===
[[File:IranTaqIBustanEberjagdKhosrowsII.jpg|thumb|Scene of boar and deer hunting]]
On the right and left wall of the arch, there is a picture of the king's hunting measuring 3.8 X 5.7 meters. From the time of Cyrus the Great to the end of Sassanid period, hunting was one of the most favourite activities of Iranian kings. Therefore, scenes of hunting are frequently found next to those of crownings.

There are two hunting scenes on each side of the ivan. One scene depicts the imperial boar hunt, and in a similar spirit, the other scene shows the king stalking deer. Five elephants flush out the fleeing boars from a marshy lake for the king who stands poised with bow and arrow in hand while being serenaded by female musicians. In the next scene, another boat carries female harpists and shows that the king has killed two large boars. The next boat shows the king standing with a semicircular halo around his head and a loose bow in his hand, meaning the hunt is over. Under this picture, elephants are retrieving the game with their trunks and putting them on their backs. Several episodes of the royal hunt are thus shown at the same time.

These royal hunting scenes are among the most vivid and highly narrative murals immortalized in stone.

Panel depicting boar hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 6.0 m wide x 4.25 m high

Panel depicting deer hunt measured on 16.08.07 as approx. 5.9 m wide x 4.35 m high

=== Dowlatshah Relief ===
Jumping 1300 years in time the upper relief shows the 19th century [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Governor in [[Kermanshah]] city, [[Dowlatshah]] carving a relief in a big arch.

The '''Taran Panth''', also known as '''Taran Svami Panth''', '''Taran Samaj''' or '''Taranapanthi''', is a sect of [[Digambara]] [[Jainism]] founded by [[Taran Svami]] in [[Bundelkhand]] in central India in c. 1505 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Smarika, Sarva Dharma Sammelan, 1974, Taran Taran Samaj, Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taran Svami==
{{main|Taran Svami}}
Taran Svami was a Jain religious teacher and founder of the Taran Panth. He lived in the 15th century central India. The traditional biographies places him within the Digambara mystic tradition. They also consider him as a ritual reformer for rejecting the authority of [[Bhattaraka]]s and his emphasis on [[aniconism]] and inner realization. He is credited with writing fourteen texts.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=264-277}}

==Texts==
{{Jainism}}
The following fourteen texts are credited to Taran Svami. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of ''Thikanesara'' (now at Khurai temple).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=277-278}} Scholars have expressed doubts about his authorship of the ''Chadmastha Vani'' as it cites his death and of the ''Nama Mala'' as it contains names of his disciples. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of ''Thikanesara'' (now at Khurai temple).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=277}}

* ''Vicara mata'' (Reflections)
** ''Malarohana'' ("Garland offering")
** ''Pandita Puja'' ("Wise worship")
** ''Kamala Battisi'' ("Lotus thirty-two [verses]")
* ''Acara mata'' (Conduct)
** ''Shravakacara'' ("Lay conduct")
* ''Sara mata'' (Essential teachings)
** ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' ("Collected essence of knowledge")
** ''Tribhangi Sara'' ("Essence in triads")
** ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' ("Pure essence of the teachings")
* ''Mamala mata'' (Spiritual purity)
** ''Mamala Pahuda'' ("Handbook on purity")
** ''Caubisa Thana'' ("Twenty-four topics")
* ''Kevala mata'' (Enlightenment)
** ''Chadmastha Vani'' ("Sayings of the unliberated")
** ''Nama Mala'' ("Garland of names")
** ''Khatika Vishesa'' ("Special uprooter")
** ''Siddha Subhava'' ("Nature of the perfected soul")
** ''Sunna Subhava'' ("Nature of emptiness")

The three texts in the ''Vicara mata'' category are thirty-two verse compositions. They are the most popular texts of Taran Svami. ''Malarohana'' was composed for the marriage of Taran Svami's followers, according to the tradition. It is still read during marriage of the followers. Premi had said that during [[Daslakshana]],  the followers gather in the temple and recite ''Pandita Puja'' and ''Mamalapahuda'' in day and ''Malarohana'' and ''Kamala Battisi'' at night. K. Samaiya had equated them with [[Ratnatraya]]. Some members recite some of these texts daily.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=278}}

Other texts are not well-known. ''Sravakacara'' has 462 verses which defines code of conduct for lay followers which draws from earlier Digambara text ''[[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]]''. The ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' has 908 verses, and the ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' has 588 verses. These two texts discuss the Digambara philosophy and metaphysics. The ''Jñana Samuccaya Sara'' discusses ''[[Ratnatraya]]'', scriptures, the stages of lay spirituality, [[Ethics of Jainism|''Anuvrata'' and ''Mahavrata'']], seven types of Jain philosophy, ''[[Dravya]]'', ''Dhyana '' etc. The ''Upadesha Shuddha Sara'' discusses the path of liberation and its hurdles. The ''Tribhangi Sara'' has 71 verses which discusses the topics in triads. These four texts are close to the Digambara tradition of philosophy.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=278-279}}

The ''Mamala Pahuda'' is a collection of songs. It has more than 3,200 verses. The ''Caubisa Thana'' discusses 24 topics of spirituality to gain liberation. It is mix of prose and verse and about 20 pages in total.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=279}}

The ''Chadmastha Vani'' and ''Nama Mala'' are short prose texts about nine pages. It has information on Taran Svami and his followers and other subjects. Premi had said that ''Chadmastha Vani'' is recited by followers for five days after [[Diwali]]. The ''Khatika Vishesa'' discusses about ''Karma'' in context of the cycle of time. It is mix of prose and verse. The ''Siddha Subhava'' and ''Sunna Subhava'' are short prose. The ''Siddha Subhava'' discusses the purification of soul while the ''Sunna Subhav'' discusses ways of destoying ego.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=279}}

Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been done recently. [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh|Osho]] (Rajnish), who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included ''Sunna Subhava'' and ''Siddhi Subhava'' as among the books that influenced him most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |title=Books I have Loved |publisher=Osho.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-04-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517013255/http://www.osho.nl/New-Osho-NL/EnglBooks/BooksIHave.htm |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
After death of Taran Svami, the history of the sect is unclear. The ''Nam Mala'' contains around 2000 names but its significance is unclear. Based on oral traditions, Taran Svami had disciples from varied classes and castes. His disciples were from Jain as well from non-Jain background. Some of his disciples had Muslim background. No scholarly study has constructed the early history of Taran Panth due to clear lack of literary tradition. The religious profession is also unclear in the sect. There were some associated with ''Nisaiji'' temples. There are no monks in the sect but they had some lay celibates (''Brahmachari'' and ''Brahmacharini''s).{{snf|Cort|2006|p=280-282}}

Today a large number of the followers of Taran Panth come from six merchant castes of [[Bundelkhand]] region of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Three of these – Samaiya, Dosakhe and Gulalare – were converts from [[Murtipujaka]] Jain communities, and the other three – Asethi, Ayodhyavasi and Carnagar – were converts from [[Vaishnava]] Hindu communities as informed to Jain scholar Cort. The total number of the followers of the Taran Panth range from 20,000 to 100,000. R. Samaiya had listed 131 temples and the number of followers just under 20,000 in 1989. Majority of the followers reside in Madhya Pradesh and some in south [[Uttar Pradesh]] and northwest [[Maharashtra]].{{snf|Cort|2006|p=281-282}}

==Pilgrimage sites and temples==
[[File:NisaiJiBina.jpg|thumb|Nisaiji, built by Tarachand Mallusav, 1817.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=285}}]]

The most important site is located in Malhargadh village in [[Guna district]] where Taran Svami spent his final years and where his last rites were performed. The shrine known as Nisaiji ("Honoured Memorial") is on the banks of the Betwa river.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=282}} The three-days annual fair known as Phag Phulna ("Phag Flowering") is orhanised from [[Falgun]] Bright Fifth. In the past, there was an annual fair organised in honour of one of his Muslim disciple Ruiya Raman or Ruiya Jin but it is discontinued. Many followers visit here for [[Chudakarana]] ritual of their children. The shrine has stone windows and high canopies built in "late medieval Rajput" style. The style became standard for other shrines. The history of the site is written by Phulchandra who says that the shrine was initially just a ''chhatri'' (canopy). In 1817,  Taracand Mallusav, a merchant from [[Nagpur]] rebuilt the shrine in its current form, the platform with twelve doors and several canopies. He had sponsored the annual fair and one of his family member, Kesaridau, died here. The shrine is simple and has a central marble altar which houses a pile of printed books. Behind it, there is an older stone altar which is considered as the original one. There are a records of patrons of fair from 1817. Since 1933, the fair is organised by the community. There are no images due to Taran Svami's emphasis on aniconism. There are three stone platforms in the Betwa river associated with events in his life.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283-285}}

Semarkheri located near Sironj in [[Vidisha district]] has a shrine built by [[Banjara]]s. Here he spent some time engaging in spiritual activities. The annual fair is organised on [[Vasant Panchami]]. It is oldest shrine after Nisaiji and has records of the patrons of the fair dating back to 1881.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=282-283}} Sukha near Pathariya village in [[Damoh district]] where Taran Svami preached. The old site was in dilapidated condition before the new constructions started in 1938. The annual fair is organised on Agahan Bright Seventh (November–December). The day of fair known as ''Taran Jayanti'' and is of recent origin. The shrine at Bilhari village near Katni in [[Jabalpur district]] is associated with birth of Taran Svami. The site became focus of community only recently and no annual fair is organised here.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

There is a memorial dedicated to Himau Pande, one of Taran Svami's chief disciple at Chand village in [[Chhindwara district]]. The site only recently became a focus of development by local followers. There was only large platform in the past but now a large temple is built. The annual fair is organised on Jeth Dark Sixth, known as Samadhi Sixth, the death anniversary of Himau Pande.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

There is also a large platform at Garaula (or Garhaula), near Tindua in [[Damoh district]] which is associated with Taran Svami's childhood days at his maternal uncle's house.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=283}}

The temples are fairly simple in design with open spaces and least ornamentation. The marble altars in temple has symbols associated with generalized auspiciousness. Due to aniconic emphasis, there are no images placed in the temples. Sometimes the altar has books of Taran Svami and of other writers from Digambara mystic and philosophical traditions.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=286}}

==Rituals and practices==
The order of the services were organised by Jayasagar in the mid-twentieth century.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=288}}

The temple rituals are as follows: The follower enters the temple and bows to the altar as the sign of respect then recites three verses drawn from Taran Svami's texts known as ''Tatva Patha'' or ''Tatva Mangal'' in front of the altar. This is followed by singing ''[[Bhajan]]''s or hymns. If there is a sermon, ''bhaiji'' or ''pande'',  a local intellectual associated with temple or other intellectuals known as ''[[pandit|pundit]]'' will deliver sermons to seated followers. The sermon ends with everyone standing and singing a hymn known as ''Abalabali''. The ritual ends with the ''[[Arati]]''. The ''Arati'' has two parts; the first one is dedicated to ''Dev'' (God), ''Guru'' (teacher) and scriptures while the other part is dedicated to Taran Svami.{{snf|Cort|2006|p=290-291}}

==Synopsis==
A king raised a flea until it was the size of a sheep.  Then he had it skinned and promised his daughter in marriage to whoever could guess what the skin came from.  An [[ogre]] guessed, and the king had to marry his daughter to him.  The [[Princess and dragon|ogre]] took her to his house, decorated by the bones of men he had eaten, and brought her back men's bodies to eat.  She wept by the window and told an old woman her plight. The old woman told her that she had seven marvelous half-giants sons who could help her.  The next day, the old woman and her sons came and carried her off.

The oldest son heard the ogre whenever he approached, and each of his brothers [[Shapeshifting#Transformation chase|put]] up an obstacle:  one washed his hands and produced a sea of soapsuds, one transformed a piece of iron into a field of razors, one turned a little stick into a forest, and one turned a little water into a river.  The last one turned a pebble into a tower where they could take refuge, but they were trapped there, and the ogre came with a ladder.  The youngest son shot his eye out and cut his head off.

The sons brought her to her father and were richly rewarded.  The princess was married to a suitable prince and lived happily.

'''''The Gettysburg Review''''' is a quarterly literary magazine featuring [[short stories]], [[poetry]], [[essays]] and reviews. Work appearing in the magazine often is reprinted in "best-of" anthologies and receives awards. 

The little magazine "is recognized as one of the country’s premier journals," according to a description at the Web site of the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/press/2007/periodically2007.cfm  "Literary Magazine Editors Introducing Emerging Writers at The New York Public Library"] New York Public Library Web site (the description does, however appear to have come from the magazine itself; nevertheless, it was approved for publishing at the respected library's Web site), Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The 2007 ''[[U.S. News]]'' guide to the best colleges described the review as "recognized as one of the country's best literary journals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drmiss_3268_brief.php] Web page titled "America's Best Colleges 2007 / Gettysburg College", (given the similarity in wording, the phrase, slightly reworded, may have come from some promotional material from the college; nevertheless, the magazine's editors endorsed it by publishing it), Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Web page of the English Department of the University of Wisconsin Colleges, the Gettysburg Review is considered a "major literary journal in the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwc.edu/uwc/depts/english/Links/links.htm Literature and Writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603002824/http://www.uwc.edu/uwc/depts/english/Links/links.htm |date=2007-06-03 }} University of Wisconsin Colleges Web site, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Literary Magazine|url=http://www.everywritersresource.com/topliterarymagazines.html|work=EWR|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine is published by [[Gettysburg College]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]].

The magazine does not print material which has been published elsewhere. Along with fresh and new short stories, it is open to publishing original poetry, whether short or long,  and excerpts from novels. The magazine will occasionally serialize longer fictional works over more than one issue. "Essays can be on virtually any subject, so long as it is treated in a literary fashion &amp;mdash; gracefully and in depth," according to the magazine's Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.gettysburg.edu/academics/gettysburg_review/sbmssns.html Submissions] ''The Gettysburg Review'' Web site, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guide-fic&gt;[http://www.gettysburgreview.com/submissions/guidelines/  Guidelines - Fiction]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Gettysburg Review'' is one of the most frequent sources of material for ''[[The Best American Essays]]'', ''[[The Best American Poetry]]'', and ''[[The Best American Short Stories]]'' series. Other anthologies that have reprinted work originally published in the magazine: ''The Pushcart Prize: Best of the Small Presses'', ''The Best Creative Nonfiction'', ''The Best American Mystery Stories'', ''Best New American Voices'', ''Best New Poets'', ''New Stories from the South'', and ''Prize Stories: The O. Henry Awards''. Other work has been reprinted in publications such as ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]]'' and the ''UTNE Reader.''&lt;ref name=new&gt;[http://newpages.com/magazineguide/gettysburg_review.htm Gettysburg Review] New Pages, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The periodical has won awards including the Best New Journal award, four Best Journal Design awards from the Council of Editors of Learned Journals, and a PEN/Nora Magid Award for Excellence in Editing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gettysburg.edu/uniquely_gettysburg/ Uniquely Gettysburg] Gettysburg College Web site, Retrieved February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1994 review of the magazine, Ron Tanner wrote that the stories in the 1993 issues were widely varied in style, but "are clearly in the mainstream of contemporary American fiction &amp;mdash; you will not find 'experimental' work in ''The Gettysburg Review''." 

He also found the stories have a common "concern for character, and an examination of the emotional and psychological distance one might travel when faced with a problem.  [...] each compels the character to make a decision, to make an effort, to make a move. Consequently, things happen in these stories. Which is to say that we end in a place very different from the story's beginning. In no resolution of a ''Gettysburg'' story, however, do we find ourselves living Happily Ever After. Life is more complicated than that, these writers assert."&lt;ref&gt;Tanner, Ron.

The quarterly gets about 6,000 submissions per year and does not solicit work except for occasional reviews. "[W]e work hard not to have a regular stable of writers or favored persons of any kind," according to founding editor Peter Stitt. "We are most proud of publishing writers who have never before appeared in a nationally-circulated journal. But we do not actively search through the slush pile for anything but good writing."&lt;ref name=emerging&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050214092444/http://www.breaktech.net/EmergingWritersForum/View_Interview.aspx?id=115 "Interview with LitJournals / Conducted by Dan Wickett on January 19, 2005"] Emerging Writers Forum, Retrieved June 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine is supported financially by Gettysburg College, for the most part, although it also receives grants from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts and the NEA, along with some revenue from subscriptions.&lt;ref name=emerging/&gt;

==Plot==
The film shows a fictional week in the life of [[Chuck Barris]] as the host and creator of ''[[The Gong Show]]'', through a series of outrageous competitors, stressful situations, a nervous breakdown (which compels him to run away and hide in the desert) and other comic hijinks in his life and work on the TV show. Among the highlights included a group of men dressed as a [[Roman Catholic]] priest and three nuns [[lip-synching]] [[Tom Lehrer]]'s song "The Vatican Rag", a man blowing out a candle with [[flatulence]], and the uncensored version of [[Jaye P. Morgan]]'s infamous breast-baring incident.

==Reception==
The film opened against ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', beating the latter at the box office in its opening weekend but losing to the former.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZYtg2BTWBI]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last of England''''' is an 1855 oil-on-panel painting by [[Ford Madox Brown]] depicting two emigrants leaving [[England]] to start a new life in Australia with their baby.

==Background==
Brown began the painting in 1852 inspired by the departure of his close friend, the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[sculptor]], [[Thomas Woolner]], who [[Immigration history of Australia|had left for Australia]] in July of that year. Emigration from England was at a peak, with over 350,000 people leaving that year. Brown, who at the time considered himself "very hard up and a little mad", was himself thinking of moving to [[India]] with his new family.

==Painting==
Although Ford Madox Brown was never a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, ''The Last of England'', like many of his paintings, exhibits all the characteristics of the movement.
The painting depicts a man and his wife seeing England for the last time. The two main figures, based on Brown and his wife, [[Emma Hill|Emma]], stare ahead, stony-faced, ignoring the [[white cliffs of Dover]] which can be seen disappearing behind them in the top right of the picture. The family's clothing indicates that they are middle class, and so they are not leaving for the reasons that would force the emigration of the [[working class]]es; Brown's writing touched on the same theme:

{{quote|The educated are bound to their country by quite other ties than the illiterate man, whose chief consideration is food and physical comfort}}

The fair-haired child in the background behind the man's shoulder is Brown and Emma's child, [[Catherine Madox Brown|Catherine]], who was born in 1850. The baby concealed under the woman's cloak, and whose hand she is clasping, is supposedly their second child, Oliver. 

In order to mirror the harsh conditions in the painting Brown worked mostly outside in his garden, and was happy when the weather was poor — he recorded his feelings of delight when the cold turned his hand blue, as this was how he wanted it to appear in the painting. He was seen as strange by his neighbours who saw him out in all kinds of weather. He composed a short verse to accompany the painting in which the woman is depicted as hopeful for the future:

{{quote|She grips his listless hand and clasps her child,&lt;br /&gt;Through rainbow tears she sees a sunnier gleam,&lt;br /&gt;She cannot see a void where he will be.}}

Brown's painting room was above a china shop at 33 High Street, [[Hampstead]] and sittings took place in the house's garden. His diary noted that the 'ribbons of the bonnet took me 4 weeks to paint'.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Barringer, ‘[[Brown, Ford Madox]] (1821–1893)’, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], Sept 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
[[Image:FMB last.jpg|thumb|upright|Finished study for the painting]]
Two finished versions of the picture exist, one in [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] and the other in the [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in [[Cambridge]]. A reduced watercolour replica of the painting in Birmingham produced between 1864&amp;ndash;66 is in [[Tate Britain]]. A fully worked study also exists, and a detailed compositional drawing. All are in the form of round panels, a rarely revived Renaissance format called a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]], but differ in colouring. 

In March 1859 ''The Last Sight of England'' as it was then known, was sold by Benjamin Windus to [[Ernest Gambart]] for 325 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sale Of Valuable Pictures'', [[The Times]], 28 Mar 28 1859&lt;/ref&gt; (''2010: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|341.25|1859|2010|r=-2}}}}'').

==Popularity==
The picture was voted Britain's eighth-favourite picture in a poll carried out by [[BBC Radio 4]]. In 2013 it was voted 32 out of 57 paintings chosen by the British public from national collections, which were used for ''Art Everywhere The World's Largest Public Art Exhibition''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artlyst.com/articles/peter-blake-launches-art-everywhere-the-worlds-largest-public-art-exhibition "Peter Blake Launches Art Everywhere The World's Largest Public Art Exhibition", Artlyst,  08 August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timur Petrovich Novikov''' (September 24, 1958, [[Leningrad]] – May 23, 2002, [[St. Petersburg]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[philosopher]], [[Drawing|graphic artist]],  [[designer]], [[Painting|painter]], [[Art theory|art theorist]] and [[curator]]. He is considered one of the most influential proponents of [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#The Petersburg group|Nonconformist Art]] before and after [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] in Russia.

==Life and work==

As he grew up in the [[Soviet Union]], Novikov experienced its cultural and political constraints. His artistic education began at the age of seven at the House of Pioneers in Leningrad, and later at the Young Art Historians Club at the [[Russian Museum]] in the same city.

In 1977 he became a member of the Letopis (Chronicles) art group; and in 1982 he founded the Novye khudozhniki (New Artists) movement. During the 1980s Novikov worked at the Russian Museum and enjoyed access to its collection and archive, as well as close working relationships with its curators. This connection lasted to when he started work as an artist. In 1990 and 1991 he studied as an intern at the Institut des Arts Plastiques (Institute of Plastic Arts) in [[Paris]], France.

During the 1980s and 1990s Novikov was a regular participant in the Pop Mekhanika show of experimental composer [[Sergey Kuryokhin]] and worked on its stage design. Several pop groups from the show worked with him to explore a new visual and stage design. In 1983 Novikov founded and led an experimental rock-group Novye Kompozitory (New Composers) and invented new musical instruments for it. He was also involved in a number of film projects as an actor and artist, and made a name as an innovative film designer. In 1987 Novikov shared the [[Nika Award]] for his contribution to the popular Russian film [[Assa (film)|Assa]], directed by [[Sergei Solovyov]].

The New Academy of Fine Arts, founded by Novikov in 1989, soon became a well-known meeting point for the Leningrad, Russian and international art scene and a symbol for the spirit of freedom and recomposition in the new Russia. The academy and artist community, named also after its address Pushkinskaya 10, was at first self-organized by artists. It later offered ateliers as well as regular courses for students, including scholarships. The academy, with Novikov as one of its most prominent teachers, was sometimes referred to as an underground art project, but also cooperated with established art institutions, among them the [[Russian Museum]] and the [[Hermitage Museum]].

The core conception of the academy was called Neo-Academism and comprised a specific teacher-student relationship as well as a focus on the historic and aesthetic perspective of [[Neoclassicism]].

Novikov also contributed to numerous art exhibitions outside Russia. His style of painting combined a bold avant-garde attitude with refined classically based conceptions of Neo-Academism. Furthermore, he contributed to contemporary [[art theory]], writing books such as "The New Russian Classicism" (1998), "Horizons" (2000), and "Intercontacts" (2000), published by the [[Russian Museum]].

A lengthy illness led to blindness in the later part of Novikov's career. He continued working as a lecturer at the New Academy and led assistants to work on graphic works. Novikov died of pneumonia on May 23, 2002, in St. Petersburg.

Posthumous exhibitions of Novikov's works were held at the Moscow Russian Museum and in Brussels in 2002, in Denmark 2004, London 2005 and 2012, and several times in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timurnovikov.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=23&amp;lang=en timurnovikov.ru: Personal exhibitions], registered Dec 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
In spring 2013 the Moscow Museum of Modern Art presented a large-scale solo retrospective of Novikov's work, curated by Ekaterina Andreeva, the leading academic researcher at the State Russian Museum and author of Novikov's biography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmoma.ru/en/exhibitions/gogolevsky/timur/ mmoma.ru: Timur], registered Dec 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaboration'''

In 2015, the estate of Timur Novikov collaborated with Russian street wear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy. The resulting collection consisted of T-shirts, sweatshirts and caps incorporating designs from Novikov's work. The 'eternal sun' motif is the stand out design element and has previously been appropriated by Rubchinskiy, who greatly reveres his art. The pieces were very well received, selling out within minutes on the Dover Street Market e-shop.

[[File:Cooper, Oliver Cromwell.jpg|thumb|An unfinished [[portrait miniature]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] by [[Samuel Cooper]].]]
An '''unfinished creative work''' is a painting, [[novel]], musical composition, or other [[creative work]], that has not been brought to a completed state. Its creator may have chosen not to finish it, or may have been prevented from doing so by circumstances outside of their control, such as [[death]]. Such pieces are often the subject of speculation as to what the finished piece would have been like had the original creator completed the work. Sometimes artworks are finished by others and [[List of works published posthumously|released posthumously]]. Unfinished works have had profound influences on their genres and have inspired others in their own projects. The term can also refer to ongoing work which could eventually be finished (i.e. the creator is still living) and is distinguishable from "incomplete work", which can be a work that was finished but is no longer in its complete form.

There are many reasons for work not being completed. Works are usually stopped when their creator dies, although some, aware of their failing health, make sure that they set up the project for completion. If the work involves other people, such as a cast of actors or the subject of a portrait, it may be halted because of their unavailability. Projects that are too grandiose might never have been finished, while others should be feasible but their creator's continual unhappiness with them leads to abandonment.

Unfinished works by popular authors and artists may still be made public, sometimes in the state they were in when work was halted.  Alternatively, another artist may finish the piece.  In some fields work may appear unfinished but are actually finished, such as [[Donatello]]'s "[[non finito]]" technique in [[sculpture]].

==Media==

===Literature===
[[File:Kafka1906.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Kafka]]'s unfinished writings were released after his death despite his wishes for them to be destroyed.]]
Many acclaimed [[author]]s have left work incomplete. Some such pieces have been published posthumously, either in their incomplete state or after being finished by somebody else.

It is the job of [[literary executor]]s to take charge of the work of a writer after their death.  They must often decide what to do with incomplete work, using their own judgement if not given explicit instructions.  In some cases this can lead to something happening to the work that was not originally intended, such as the release of [[Franz Kafka]]'s unfinished writings by [[Max Brod]] when Kafka had wished for them to be destroyed.  These works have become iconic in [[Western literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} Contijoch, Francesc Miralles (2000) "Franz Kafka". ''Oceano Grupo Editorial, S.A. Barcelona.'' {{ISBN|84-494-1811-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The posthumous publication of some of [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s unfinished novels was met with controversy. Several books were published, but it has been suggested that it is not within the jurisdiction of Hemingway's relatives or publishers to determine whether these works should be made available to the public.  For example, scholars often disapprovingly note that the version of ''The Garden of Eden'' published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]] in 1986, though not a revision of Hemingway's original words, nonetheless omits two-thirds of the original manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/shortguide-garden_of_eden/ BookRags] makes this quantitative note; it also reveals some more information about the publication of ''The Garden of Eden'' and offers some discussion of thematic content.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Twain]] took 20 years to write three versions of ''[[The Mysterious Stranger]]'' but he did not finish any of them.]]
Novels can remain unfinished because the author continually rewrites the story. When enough material exists, someone else can compile and combine the work, creating a finished story from several different drafts.  [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Mysterious Stranger]]'' was written in three different versions over a period of 20 years, none of which were completed.  Twain biographer and literary executor [[Albert Paine]] combined the stories and published his version six years after Twain's death.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20040918015059/http://www.geocities.com/hal9000report/hal96.html  A History of War]".  Accessed 6 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] continuously rewrote ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' throughout his lifetime; a definitive version was still uncompiled at the time of his death, with some sections very fragmented.  His son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], invited fantasy fiction writer [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] to reconstruct some parts of the book, and they eventually published a final version in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkienlibrary.com.  "[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/reviews/silmarillion.htm Collecting The Silmarillion]".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Christopher Tolkien published another posthumous collection of his father's unfinished work, appropriately entitled ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.  Between 1982 and 1996, he published twelve volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', a substantial portion of which is unfinished and incomplete drafts.  In 2007, Christopher Tolkien published another novel from his father entitled ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.  Like ''The Silmarillion'', Christopher assembled the novel from various incomplete drafts.

The size of a project can be such that a piece of literature is never finished.  [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] never completed ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' to the extensive length that he originally intended. Chaucer had, however, already written much of the work at the time of his death, and the ''Canterbury Tales'' are considered to be a seminal work despite the unfinished status.&lt;ref&gt;6 December 2000.  "[http://ccsun7.sogang.ac.kr/~anthony/Chaucer/index.htm The Canterbury Tales Geoffrey Chaucer : an overall survey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825163916/http://ccsun7.sogang.ac.kr/~anthony/Chaucer/index.htm |date=25 August 2006 }}".

Some works are presented as separate sections, each written at different times.  This can lead to a piece appearing complete while the author actually intended for it to continue, or where other authors try to fake their own writing as part of the work.

Numerous "continuations" of the story had been published by various publishing houses even between issues of the story, along with several fake conclusions.  Byron had intended to continue the story, as evidenced by the find of the 17th canto after his death, but it is not clear how long the poem would continue or how it would conclude.

[[File:SummaTheologiae.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas]] stopped work on his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'' in 1273 after a mystical experience.]]
Religious works have also been left incomplete, leading to debates about the possible missing content. Some theologians consider the [[Gospel of Mark]], in its existing form, incomplete; the text after 16:8 is probably not original, thus creating speculation whether the author was arrested or died suddenly, or whether the end of the gospel could have broken away from the rest of the gospel as it was handed to the next person.&lt;ref name="Mark's Incomplete Gospel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Scriptures (New Testament) Alleged forgery in the Gospel of Mark|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/mark_16.htm|work=Religious Tolerance|publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance|accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunni Islamic classic Qur'anic commentary, Mafatihu-l-Ghayb, better known as Tafseer Al-Kabeer ([[Tafsir al-Kabir (al-Razi)]]) by [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] was left unfinished and it was finished by either Qadi Shahab-ud-deen bin Khaleel al-Khauli, of [[Damascus]] (died 639 AH) or Shaikh Najm-ud-deen Ahmad bin Al-Qamooli (died 777 AH) as mentioned in Kashf-az-Zunoon. The [[Masnavi]], the most famous poem in [[Sunni]] Islamic [[Sufi poetry]] by [[Rumi]] was left unfinished and it was later finished by [[Mufti]] [[Ilahi Baksh Kandhlawi]] about five hundred years after the demise of [[Rumi]]. The [[Persian Bayán]], a [[religious text|scripture]] from [[Bábism]], was left unfinished when the [[Báb]] died.  There have been some claims that the text has been completed by other people, though the Báb stated that it would be finished by [him] whom God shall make manifest.&lt;ref&gt;Poirier, Brent; Terry, Peter;

In Greek philosophy, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'' was unfinished when Plato died at age 80.

The most influential document in [[computer science]] was [[John von Neumann]]'s ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'', a 101-page manuscript dating from 1946.  Littered with ellipses and spaces for the eventual addition of further material, von Neumann never completed it, as by that time its distribution had already influenced an explosion in postwar computer development.  Its elaboration of the [[stored program]] concept and formalization of the logical design of computer architecture&amp;mdash;ideas not all of which were original to von Neumann but which he first expressed in the mathematical language he favoured&amp;mdash;endure in the architectures of modern computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Goldstine|Goldstine, Herman H]].  1972.

Still in computer science, the seminal work on algorithms, ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' by [[Donald Knuth]], has had only the first three of its seven planned volumes written.

The first genuine [[historiography|historiographical]] work, the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'' by [[Thucydides]], was undergoing a major revision by the author at the time of his death, so different sections of it reflect a starkly contrasting general outlook on Persian influence in the events depicted.

Artists leave behind incomplete work for a variety of reasons. A piece may not be completed if the subject becomes unavailable, such as in the changing of a landscape or the death of a person being painted.  [[Elizabeth Shoumatoff]]'s ''[[Unfinished portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Unfinished Portrait]]'' of 32nd [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was started around noon on 12 April 1945 but left unfinished when Roosevelt died later that day. In other instances, outside circumstances can prevent the execution of an otherwise "finished" artwork: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] developed sketches and models for the {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} "Gran Cavallo" horse statue but the bronze to cast the sculpture was diverted to make cannons.&lt;ref name="vezzosi"&gt;[[Alessandro Vezzosi|Vezzosi, Alessandro]], ''Leonardo da Vinci: Renaissance Man'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1997, {{p.|73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Five hundred years later, two full-size sculptures were completed based on Leonardo's work.&lt;ref name="leo-horse"&gt;''[http://www.leonardoshorse.org/never_was_is.asp The horse that never was...is!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903015833/http://www.leonardoshorse.org/never_was_is.asp |date=3 September 2006 }}'' Accessed 26 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Technically  his ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'' is unfinished. In most pictures it shows a roof, but at Milan, where the painting lies, it shows some [[Latin]] that is half done. [[Robert William Buss]] left unfinished his most famous painting, ''Dickens' Dream'', just as [[Charles Dickens]] himself had left a novel half-complete at his death.

Depending on the medium involved, it can be difficult for another artist to complete an unfinished artwork without damaging it. Some artists completed the paintings of their mentors, such as [[Giulio Romano]] is believed to have done on [[Raphael]]'s ''[[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gerten-Jackson, Carol.  "[http://cgfa.floridaimaging.com/raphael/raphael_bio.htm Raphael]".

Instead of completing another artist's masterpiece, particularly when many years have passed, unfinished works frequently inspire others to create their own version.  [[Michelangelo]] left several unfinished [[sculpture]]s and [[painting]]s, with sketches and partially completed paintings inspiring others.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Jim.  24 March 1999.

Accessed 6 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the work is to be done on commission but is not finished it is commonly passed on to another artist.  Leonardo da Vinci's work on the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the monastery of San Donato was halted when he left [[Florence]] for [[Milan]].  Still requiring an [[altarpiece]], the monks employed [[Filippino Lippi]] to create one.&lt;ref&gt;Universal Leonardo: ''[http://www.universalleonardo.org/lifeevent.php?event=242 Birth of Filippino Lippi]''.

Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paintings are usually sketched on the [[canvas]] before work begins, and sculptures are frequently planned using a [[maquette]].  These works-in-progress can be as sought after as (or even more sought after than) completed works by highly regarded artists because they help reveal the process of creating a work of art.  [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], a sculptor from the [[Baroque]] period, made his bozzetti (an Italian term for the prototype sculpture) from [[wax]] or baked [[terracotta]] to show those that had commissioned him how the final piece was intended to look.  Eleven of these bozzetti were displayed in an exhibition at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Victor M.  [[artnet]].  2004.  "[http://www.artnet.com/magazine_pre2000/reviews/cassidy/cassidy8-25-98.asp Chicago Report]".  Accessed 22 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[museum]]s specialise in collections of maquettes, such as the [[Museo dei Bozzetti]] in [[Pietrasanta]], [[Italy]].

During the [[Renaissance]], [[Donatello]] made sculptures that appeared unfinished by only sculpting part of the block, leaving the figure appearing to be stuck within the material.  He called this technique "[[non finito]]", and it has been used by several artists since then.&lt;ref&gt;The Open Door Web Site.  "[http://www.saburchill.com/history/events/014.html The Renaissance]".  Accessed 10 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the age of [[mass media]], incomplete work can reach an audience due to sheer demand for material by the artist.  ''[[Tintin and Alph-Art]]'', the 24th [[comics|comic]] in [[Hergé]]'s popular ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' series, was unfinished at his death.  Though he had illustrated much of the book, several sketched panels remained in the final scenes.  The book was still published and the story can be followed despite the incomplete artwork.

===Architecture, construction and engineering===
{{See also|Unfinished building}}

Many [[construction]] or [[engineering]] projects have remained unfinished at various stages of development.  The work may be finished as a [[blueprint]] or [[whiteprint]] and never be realised, or be abandoned during construction.

There are numerous [[unfinished building]]s that remain partially constructed in countries around the world, some of which can be used in their incomplete state, while others remain as mere shells.  An example of the latter is the [[Ryugyong Hotel]] in [[North Korea]].  If finished, it would become the tallest hotel in the world and the seventh [[List of largest buildings in the world|largest building]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Emporis]].

Accessed 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some projects are intentionally left with an unfinished appearance, particularly the [[folly|follies]] of the late 16th to 18th century.

There are many reasons for construction works being halted.  Amongst others, they include a changing financial climate, unforeseen structural weaknesses, and a dramatic shift in the politics of a country.  Work on the [[Palace of Soviets]], a project to construct the world's largest building in [[Moscow]], was halted when the city [[Operation Barbarossa|was attacked]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Beautiful Atrocities.  8 April 2005.

Accessed 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some buildings are in a cycle of near-perpetual construction, with work lasting for decades or even centuries.  [[Antoni Gaudí]]'s [[Sagrada Família]] in [[Barcelona]] has been under construction for around 120 years, having started in [[1882]].  Work was delayed by the [[Spanish Civil War]], during which part of the original models  were destroyed. After the restoration of these models, the works are still in progress and the prevision is that the building will be finished in 2026.  Today, even with portions of the [[basilica]] incomplete, it is still the most popular tourist destination in Barcelona with 1.5 million visitors every year.  Gaudí spent 40 years of his life overseeing the project and is buried in the crypt.&lt;ref&gt;Barcelona Information.

Accessed 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in Barcelona, construction on the [[Barcelona Cathedral]] started in 1298, but its dome and central tower only was finished in 1913, 615 years later.

It is not only buildings that have failed during the construction phase.  In the 1920s, the [[White Star Line]] hired the shipbuilders [[Harland and Wolff]] to build the first {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} [[ocean liner]], with the planned name of ''[[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|Oceanic]]''.  However, a dispute between the companies and eventually the [[Great Depression]] halted the construction, and eventually the portion of the [[keel]] already constructed was broken up and used in building the smaller but similar ship, the ''[[MV Britannic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Othfors, Daniel.

Many projects do not get to the construction phase and are halted during or after planning.  [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]] commissioned several designs for [[Falkenstein Castle (Pfronten)|Castle Falkenstein]], with the fourth plan being vastly different from the first.  The first two designs were turned down, one because of costs and one because the design displeased Ludwig, and the third designer withdrew from the project.  The fourth and final plan was completed and some [[infrastructure]] was prepared for the site, but Ludwig died before construction work began.&lt;ref&gt;Yan, Mark.

Computer technology has allowed for [[3D computer graphics|3D representations]] of projects to be shown before they are built.  In some cases the construction is never started and the [[computer simulation|computer model]] is the nearest that anyone can ever get to seeing the finished piece.  For example, in 1999 Kent Larson's exhibition "''Unbuilt Ruins: Digital Interpretations of Eight Projects by Louis I. Kahn''" showed computer images of designs completed by noted [[architect]] [[Louis Kahn]] but never built.&lt;ref&gt;Eiteljorg II, Harrison.  1999.

Accessed 21 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer simulations can also be used to create [[prototype]]s of engineering projects and test them before they are actually made; this has allowed the design process to be more successful and efficient.

===Music===

====Classical music====
{{see also|Unfinished symphony|Composer tributes (classical music)}}
In the days of [[classical music]] all compositions were sketched on manuscripts – the technology to record music did not exist.  Often these manuscripts are roughly sketched, with drafting work scribbled over the top of the music, and have been found in unordered piles.  Many [[unfinished symphony|unfinished symphonies]] have been pieced together from these original manuscripts by other composers, after the original author's death, with some remaining incomplete until many decades later.  One of the most famous examples of unfinished musical compositions is [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 8 in B minor]]'', or as it is more commonly known, ''The Unfinished Symphony''.&lt;ref&gt;Vial Jaffe, Jane.  Stockton Symphony Association.

Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another famous unfinished classical piece is [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]]'', famous in part because of the numerous myths and legends that surround its creation and in part because of Mozart's prestige. At the time of his death, Mozart had fully orchestrated only the first movement, leaving nine further movements in varying states of completion. [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr]], an acquaintance of Mozart, finished the nine incomplete movements and wrote four more. [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 10]] was incomplete, with only drafts, sketches, and two mostly orchestrated movements existing at the composer's death.  Several people have "completed" it with varying degrees of success, the most notable of these being [[Deryck Cooke]]'s "performing version of the draft."&lt;ref name = Cooke&gt;{{cite book|title = A Performing Version for the Draft of the Tenth Symphony|last= Cooke|first= Deryck  |publisher = Associated Music Publishers|year=1976|isbn = 0-571-51094-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bach-unfinishedfugue.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'' breaks off abruptly during ''Contrapunctus XIV''.]]
Some compositions are finished "in the style of" the original composer, with someone who is highly familiar with the work adopting the same writing style and continuing the musical tone. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', which was broken off abruptly during ''Contrapunctus XIV'', probably shortly before the death of the composer, was first published in the mid 18th century. Many reconstructions have been written, but in 1991 [[Zoltán Göncz]] used the form of a [[Fugue#perm|permutation fugue]] to make a strong argument as to the structure of the Fugue to come.&lt;ref&gt;Göncz, Z.  1997.  Reconstruction of the Final Contrapunctus of ''[[The Art of Fugue]], in: ''International Journal of Musicology'' Vol. 5, pp. 25–93. {{ISBN|3-631-49809-8}}; Vol. 6, pp. 103–119. 1998 {{ISBN|3-631-33413-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See external links.) Sir [[Edward Elgar]] was composing a [[Symphony No. 3 (Elgar/Payne)|Symphony No. 3]] at the time of his death and left 130 pages of sketches.  These sketches were put into a reasonable order, orchestrated in the style of Elgar, and elaborated by [[Anthony Payne]].  Payne's reconstruction has been played numerous times to great acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/elgar/56393.stm | work=BBC News | title=Anthony Payne on Elgar's Symphony No 3 | date=13 February 1998 | accessdate=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some works, deemed complete by the composer, are nonetheless augmented for non-musical reasons. In May 2000 composer [[Colin Matthews]] premiered his "completion" of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', whereby he composed a piece for the ninth planet [[Pluto]], giving it the name "Pluto, The Renewer".  When Holst had written the original piece Pluto had not been discovered, and this addition therefore updated the suite and completed the eight [[movement (music)|movement]]s that represented the planets of the [[solar system]] (Earth was never included) some 80 years after it was originally performed.&lt;ref&gt;Andante.

Some extremely famous 20th century [[opera]]s have been left incomplete at their composers' deaths. [[Giacomo Puccini]] left the finale of ''[[Turandot]]'' unfinished and the missing music had to be provided by [[Franco Alfano]] for the premiere in 1926. Recently, [[Luciano Berio]] composed an alternative ending. [[Alban Berg]] had only finished the first two acts of his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'' at the time of his death in 1935. Due to objections from his widow it was not until 1979 that a full version was performed, with music for the final act devised by [[Friedrich Cerha]] using Berg's sketches.&lt;ref&gt;''Viking Opera Guide'', ed. Holden (Viking, 1994): articles on Puccini and Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other musical works which are unfinished but performable, are simply given in their incomplete state. Schubert's symphony is the most famous, but [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Bruckner)|Ninth Symphony]] is performed without a finale, and in [[Karl Amadeus Hartmann]]'s ''[[Gesangsszene]]'', the final words of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s text, left unset at the composer's death, are simply spoken by the soloist.

Some other well-known examples of unfinished works completed by other hands include:
* [[Béla Bartók]]'s [[Viola Concerto (Bartók)|Viola Concerto]], completed by [[Tibor Serly]] and others
* [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 10 (Beethoven/Cooper)|Symphony No. 10]], completed by [[Barry Cooper (musicologist)|Barry Cooper]]
* [[Alexander Borodin]]'s opera ''[[Prince Igor]]'', completed by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] and [[Alexander Glazunov]]
* [[Ernest Chausson]]'s [[String Quartet (Chausson)|String Quartet]], completed by [[Vincent d'Indy]]
* [[Claude Debussy]]'s opera ''[[Rodrigue et Chimène]]'', completed by [[Edison Denisov]]
* [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s opera ''[[Le duc d'Albe]]'', completed by [[Matteo Salvi]]
* [[Manuel de Falla]]'s opera ''[[Atlántida (opera)|Atlántida]]'', completed by [[Ernesto Halffter]]
* [[Fromental Halévy]]'s opera ''[[Noé (opera)|Noé]]'', completed by [[Georges Bizet]]
* [[Charles Ives]]' [[Universe Symphony (Ives)|Universe Symphony]], completed by various composers, including [[Larry Austin]]
* [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s [[Great Mass in C minor, K. 427|Great Mass in C minor]], completed in various versions, among which are those by [[Robert D. Levin]] and [[Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs]]
* [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s opera ''[[The Fair at Sorochyntsi]]'', completed in various versions by [[César Cui]], [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], [[Vissarion Shebalin]] and [[Emil Cooper]]
* Mussorgsky's opera ''[[Khovanshchina]]'', completed in versions by Rimsky-Korsakov; [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]] working together; and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]
* Mussorgsky's opera ''[[Zhenitba]]'', completed in various versions, including Rimsky-Korsakov, [[Aleksandr Gauk]], [[Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov]], [[Alexander Tcherepnin]], [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]] and [[Vyacheslav Nagovitsyn]]
* [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s opera ''[[Maddalena (opera)|Maddalena]]'', completed by [[Edward Downes]]
* [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s opera ''[[La rondine]]'', completed by [[Lorenzo Ferrero]]
* [[Ottorino Respighi]]'s opera ''[[Lucrezia (opera)|Lucrezia]]'', completed by [[Elsa Respighi]]
* [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s opera ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', third act written but never set to music
* [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Schubert)|Symphony No. 7]] and [[Symphony No. 10 (Schubert)|10]], completed by [[Brian Newbould]]
* [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s [[Mysterium (Scriabin)|Mysterium]], of which the ''Prefatory Action'' was completed by [[Alexander Nemtin]]
* [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 3 in E flat]], completed by [[Sergei Taneyev]]
** This work was originally intended to be a [[Symphony in E flat (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony in E flat]]; it would have been Tchaikovsky's 6th symphony had he not abandoned it (the work now known as his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 6 in B minor, ''Pathétique'']] is a completely different work).  Tchaikovsky converted his sketches into a piano concerto, and in that form it was completed by Taneyev.  However, Semyon Bogatyrev took the original sketches and completed the symphony Tchaikovsky had first planned, publishing it as Tchaikovsky's "Symphony No. 7".
* [[Carl Maria von Weber]]'s opera ''[[Die drei Pintos]]'', completed by [[Gustav Mahler]]

[[Peter Schickele]] parodied the concept in his "Unbegun Symphony," which contains only movements III and IV because, as Schickele put it, "I was born too late to write the first two movements."

====Modern recordings====
Since recording equipment has been an integral part of writing music it has been possible to use the original master tapes and [[demo (music)|demos]] to construct a song from the parts that had already been completed.  Many demos are released officially if the artist has been unable (or unwilling) to complete it, or made available as a [[bootleg recording]].  The continued popularity of [[the Beatles]] led to "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]" being released in the mid-1990s after the band members pieced together incomplete recordings by the deceased [[John Lennon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Caroline.  [[Guardian Unlimited]], 21 November 1995.  "[https://www.theguardian.com/thebeatles/story/0,,606548,00.html Do they believe in yesterday?]".  Accessed 6 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both songs reached the top five in the British singles chart.

[[File:Brian Wilson.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Wilson]] performing ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|Smile]]'' as a solo artist in 2005]]

[[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' is considered the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=63}}  Recorded in 1966 and 1967, ''Smile'' was to be the followup to the album  ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), but due to [[Brian Wilson]]'s deteriorating mental health and increased friction among the band members, the band abandoned the project after completing numerous recordings slated for the project.  In 2004, Wilson and writing partner [[Van Dyke Parks]] went into the studio, and newly recorded the material and released it as a completed solo album.

Other famous unfinished rock albums include [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Let It Be#Get Back albums|Get Back]]'', [[the Who]]'s [[rock opera]] ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'', and [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s ''[[First Rays of the New Rising Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=unt-unrel&gt;{{Citation |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |date=2015-04-13 |title=The Top Ten Unreleased Albums From the Mid-1960s Through the Early 1970s |publisher= |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/wordpress/the-top-ten-unreleased-albums-from-the-mid-1960s-through-the-early-1970s/ |accessdate=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All have been released, in whole or part, in various posthumous forms in the ensuing years,&lt;ref name=unt-unrel/&gt; ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'' being another case of using demos in order to present a completed work.

Several artists have found that some of their studio work have been leaked onto the [[Internet]] before their album has been completed.  [[System of a Down]]'s 2002 follow-up to ''[[Toxicity (album)|Toxicity]]'', untitled at the time, was leaked onto the Internet as [[MP3]] files.  When the album was released under the title ''[[Steal This Album!]]'' the songs were significantly different from the work-in-progress, with different titles, lyrics and even melodies.  There were some reports that the changes were a direct result of negative feedback about the leaked material.&lt;ref&gt;Sputnikmusic.  "[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=135 System of a Down - ''Steal This Album!'']".  Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists will try to ensure that their work is completed (as much as possible) before their health prevents them from continuing.  [[Johnny Cash]], aware of his failing health, made sure that he recorded the vocals for 60 more songs, with the music being completed after his death.  These songs were compiled by producer [[Rick Rubin]] and released as ''[[American V: A Hundred Highways]]'' and ''[[American VI]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gundersen, Edna.  [[USA Today]], 1 May 2006.  "[https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2006-05-01-cash_x.htm Johnny Cash's final work yields 2 more albums]".  Accessed 6 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not all artists get the chance to complete their work before their death, and the recordings that are made public may be somewhat different from what had originally been intended.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}  ''[[From a Basement on the Hill]]'' by [[Elliott Smith]] was released posthumously in 2004 with comments from the initial album producer saying that "[t]he record he would have delivered would [have] had more songs, would have had different mixes and [been] a little more in your face".&lt;ref&gt;Confabulators.

Accessed 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] released several tracks decades after his sister Karen died in 1983, leaving a multitude of unfinished work. One track, released on the "Interpretations" album in the mid-nineties, included Karen's lead vocal for the song "[[Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again]]" which had previously been recorded and released by [[Barry Manilow]]. The lead had been lost for years on a mislabelled tape. Strings, piano, and backup singers were added to the sound of Karen's lead vocal, while Richard left the sound of her turning the lead sheet over in the finished product. Another track was Karen's cover "[[The Rainbow Connection]]", which had been written by [[Kenny Ascher]] and [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] for [[Jim Henson]] to sing as [[Kermit The Frog]] in ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'' (1979). Recording it only a year later, Richard claims that Karen just did not like the song and that was why it was omitted from their 1981 album, ''[[Made in America (Carpenters album)|Made In America]]''. A toy piano, choir, and strings were added against Karen's vocals. The song was released in 2001 on the album ''[[As Time Goes By (Carpenters album)|As Time Goes By]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Film===
[[File:Orson Welles 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Orson Welles]] left behind numerous unfinished films.]]
[[Film]]s may not be completed for several reasons, with some being shelved during different stages of the production. ''[[Arrive Alive]]'' was scrapped after a week of filming when the comedy was not living up to the screenplay. Shelving a film without it ever being released can be very expensive for the studios, with ''Arrive Alive'' costing $7 million.

With so many people involved in [[filmmaking]] it is very possible for a film to remain incomplete because of an injury or death. While a member of the crew (even a [[film producer|producer]] or [[film director|director]]) can often be replaced, it is much more difficult to change to a different [[actor]] if many of the scenes have already been filmed. For example, ''[[Dark Blood]]'' was cancelled halfway through filming due to the death of its star [[River Phoenix]]; however, the film premiered to a private guest audience on September 27, 2012 at the Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht, Netherlands. Some films have been completed despite such problems. A famous example is [[Bruce Lee]]'s ''[[Game of Death]]''; Lee died during the filming and the rest of the filming was finished by [[Tai Chung Kim]], a Lee look-alike; and [[Yuen Biao]], a then-stunt actor who later became a TV/movie actor. His son, [[Brandon Lee]], also suffered from the same fate: he died after filming most of ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]'', but the remaining scenes were played by [[stunt double]] [[Chad Stahelski]] with Lee's face digitally composited onto the double.&lt;ref&gt;[[Urban Legends Reference Pages]]. 7 December 1997. "[http://www.snopes.com/movies/actors/brandlee.htm Brandon Lee]". Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued delays can prevent a film from ever being completed. ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' was a [[1962 in film|1962 film]] with a difficult production history, which included the firing of leading lady [[Marilyn Monroe]]. She was later rehired but died before filming started; without the delay the film might have been completed.&lt;ref&gt;CoverUps.com. "[http://www.coverups.com/monroe/countdown.htm Marilyn Monroe's Death, Countdown To Tragedy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820043058/http://www.coverups.com/monroe/countdown.htm |date=20 August 2006 }}".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Orson Welles]]' lifetime his unfinished films became legendary. For decades he worked on a version of ''[[Don Quixote (unfinished film)|Don Quixote]]'', and he claimed that the film could be finished despite the deaths of his two leading actors.&lt;ref&gt;"The Orson Welles Story", ''Arena'', BBC TV 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' remains one of the only films that was released as Welles intended, with most of his other films remaining incomplete or being changed by the studios. His death on 10 October 1985 came while he was working on ''[[The Other Side of the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Dreamers (unfinished film)|The Dreamers]]'', the former being completed.&lt;ref&gt;Cabrelli, Paolo. 22 May 2006.

Retrieved 17 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animation|Animated films]], though less vulnerable to problems such as the death of an actor, can still fail to be completed. ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'' was a twenty-six-year [[animation|animated film]] project by [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] which was taken away from him and completed by [[Fred Calvert]].&lt;ref&gt;Briney, Daniel. 21 August 2001. "[http://www.culturecartel.com/review.php?aid=1000025/ The Thief and the Cobbler: How the Best Was Lost, 1968-1995]" at CultureCartel.  Accessed 12 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[workprint]] of the original film became available as a bootleg, and there have been several attempts to restore the film, most notably Garrett Gilchrist's "Recobbled" cut. The 1978 animated adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' was not viewed by the studio as enough of a commercial success to warrant the funding of a sequel, thus not completing the story from the original trilogy of books.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, Connor. March 2006. "[http://www.conlanpress.com/html/zaentz_b.html Peter S. Beagle and the Saul Zaentz Company] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120722165309/http://www.conlanpress.com/html/zaentz_b.html |date=22 July 2012 }}". Accessed 25 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Computer [[software]], particularly [[computer and video games|games]], are sometimes cancelled quite far into their [[software engineering|development]]. Occasionally they are demonstrated to the press so that [[Technical preview|preview]]s can be written but are never completed or published. ''[[Amen: The Awakening]]'' had an extensive preview written in the magazine ''PC Paradox'' in 1999, including numerous [[screenshot]]s, which generated a lot of interest in the project. However, it was cancelled the following year.&lt;ref&gt;PlanetPhillip. 18 August 2004. "[http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/amen-the-awakening/ Amen: The Awakening] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016152052/http://www.planetphillip.com/posts/amen-the-awakening/ |date=16 October 2006 }}". Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to continued interest in a game, some are eventually made available in their unfinished state. ''[[Combat 2]]'', the sequel to the 1977 [[Atari 2600|Atari VCS]]-bundled game ''[[Combat (video game)|Combat]]'', was never completed, but many years later, at the 2001 [[Classic Gaming Expo]], 200 copies of the unfinished game were sold after a company created a box and manual.&lt;ref&gt;AtariAge. "[http://www.atariage.com/software_page.html?SoftwareLabelID=1137 Combat Two]". Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software undergoes a [[software testing|testing phase]] that helps to eliminate problems before it is released; however, [[development stage|beta testing]] is a form of testing where the software is open to the public (usually limited to a set number of people or organisations) but is still essentially unfinished. This is often an important part of the development of a software package.

If a piece of software is becoming overly delayed the developer may just release the program despite the presence of a few [[software bug|bugs]]. The Internet has allowed [[patch (computing)|patch]]es to be deployed that fix these bugs, but before such technology was available the problems could not be fixed after the game was published. Even with this, a game with too many bugs when it is made public will receive very poor reviews that will undoubtedly affect sales. For example, 2002's ''[[Destroyer Command]]'' received some very positive reviews about many aspects of the game but was criticised for the number of glitches it contained that, given a lengthier software testing phase, should have been fixed.&lt;ref&gt;Metacritic. "[http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/destroyercommand Destroyer Command]". Accessed 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Some developers choose to disable certain features in order to release the game on time, especially if a project has seen an amount of [[feature creep]]. One such title was [[Cinemaware]]'s ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'', which was released before all the features were completed when the company was faced with a strict deadline and the loss of two programmers.&lt;ref&gt;Hall Of Light. "''[http://hol.abime.net/305 Defender Of The Crown]''". Accessed 20 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In law==
Unfinished work is often covered by the [[copyright]] laws of the country of origin.  The [[United States]] have taken the step of creating a law which specifically mentions ongoing work, whereby work which is in progress but will in the future be completed can be covered by copyright.  On 27 April 2005 the "Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act", a subpart of the [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act]], was signed into U.S. law.  This act allows for organisations or individuals to apply for copyright protection on unfinished commercial products, such as [[software]], films, and other visual or audible media.&lt;ref&gt;[[Center for Democracy and Technology]].  April 2005.  {{cite web|url= http://www.cdt.org/copyright/20050426s167analysis.pdf |title=Analysis of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005 (S. 167) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(74.1&amp;nbsp;KB)}} .  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a [[photographer]] can preregister a photograph by giving a written description of what the final piece (or collection thereof) will look like before the work is finished.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, Daryl.  14 November 2005.  "[http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001479563 New Copyright Law Lets Photographers Register Unfinished Work]".  Accessed 9 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In copyright law, an artistic creation that includes major, basic copyrighted aspects of an original, previously created first work is known as a '[[derivative work]]'.  This holds for all kinds of work, including those that have never officially been published.  The rights of the first work's originator must be granted to the secondary work for it to be rightfully called a 'derivative work'.  If no copyright permission is granted from the originator, it is instead called a 'copy'.  Upon completion of the new piece both parties hold a joint copyright status, with both having to agree to any publications.  When the copyright has lapsed for the original work the second artist fully owns the copyright for their work, but cannot stop distribution of the original piece or another artist from completing the work in their own way.  However, such copyrights can only be granted if the work shows significant new creative content.&lt;ref name="publaw"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lloyd |first=L.

==Collection sale==
In early 2009, the collection, estimated to be worth in excess of US$40 million, was placed for sale by [[Sotheby's]], with the proviso that it be sold as a whole and not broken up,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt; and remain accessible to scholars. The custodian [[Jack V. Lunzer]], who is not benefitting from the proceeds of the sale, has stated that "I would like our library to be acquired by the [[Library of Congress]]. That would be my great joy."&lt;ref name="bnet"/&gt;  After visiting the exhibition of the collection at Sotheby's, a scholar from the [[Drisha Institute]] wrote of Lunzer's achievement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The morning of our visit, I studied the commentary of Rabbi [[David Kimhi]], who is known as the Radak, on Joseph's conflict with his brothers. Honestly, it felt like just another of the many rabbinic commentaries....  Then I went to the Valmadonna. Peering closely at one of the oldest manuscripts, I saw that it was a volume of Psalms with the Radak's commentary.  In that instant, time and space collapsed as I found myself bound to every other Jew who has studied Kimhi's work since it was penned in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. That moment made clear to me that I am not simply a modern Jew studying in a contemporary yeshiva near [[Lincoln Center]]. I am tied to every other Jew through 800 years of history. I envision Kimhi hunched over his work, and wonder if his soul knows that even still we are learning from him, that his elucidation remains as relevant to the study of biblical text as it was to his contemporaries. The books of the Valmadonna – the books of our people – bring history alive [and] keep our history alive even when the communities that produce them are long dead.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Debra Nussbaum. [http://www.forward.com/articles/105933/ "Receiving the Original Text Messages"]. ''The Jewish Daily Forward''.  May 13, 2009 (issue of May 22, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In May 2011, ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' in London reported that the collection was still for sale, perhaps for around US$25 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/48829/valmadonna-goes-back-market Valmadonna goes back on the market], by Robyn Rosen, 11 May 2011, ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', accessed 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Sotheby's New York presided over the sale of the [[Daniel Bomberg]] ''Babylonian [[Talmud]]'' (1519-1523) from the Valmadonna Trust for $9.3 million, the copy that Lunzer obtained in trade from [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finebooksmagazine.com/press/2015/12/daniel-bombergs-16th-century-talmud-sells-for-93-million-at-sothebys-ny.phtml Fine Books Magazine], accessed 5 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tablet&gt;{{cite web|title=Tablet Magazine|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/196121/new-york-businessman-leon-black-buy-bomberg-babylonian-talmud-for-9-3-million|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the collection was sold to the [[National Library of Israel]] in January 2017 through a private sale arranged by Sotheby's.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; David Blumberg, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the [[National Library of Israel]], said:&lt;blockquote&gt;“''The Valmadonna Trust Library represents an historic addition to our leading collection of Jewish manuscripts, prints and books, which reflect and embody the cultures of the Jewish people around the world and across the ages''”.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Valmadonna Trust Library will be housed in the National Library of Israel's landmark new building in Jerusalem, due to open to the public in 2020.[https://worldisraelnews.com/national-library-gets-finest-collection-of-hebrew-prints-and-manuscripts/]

The '''''Wall of the Sun''''' and '''''Wall of the Moon''''' are a pair of [[mural]]s made of ceramics and designed by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist [[Joan Miró]] for the [[UNESCO]] building in Paris. The works were carried out by the ceramicist [[Josep Llorens Artigas]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=Dupin&gt;{{cite book|last=Dupin|first=Jacques|title=Miró|date=2004|publisher=Éditions Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=2-0803-0450-X|page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the walls were installed on the Place de Fontenoy in Paris, but afterwards were enclosed in a building that was constructed in order to protect them from damage caused by acid rain.&lt;ref name=Unesco&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wall of the Sun|url=http://www.unesco.org/visit/uk/notices/miro1.htm|publisher=UNESCO website|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Joan Miró]] and [[Josep Llorens Artigas]] met in 1910 at the school of art of the artist [[Francesc Galí]] (1880–1965), in Barcelona. Since the 1940s, Miró and Josep Llorens Artigas started an artistic duo that spawned objects and large ceramic murals such as one at the [[Unesco]] building in Paris or the ceramic wall of the [[Barcelona–El Prat Airport|Barcelona Airport]]. These works fused Miró lexicon with the essential qualities of the arts of earth and fire.&lt;ref name=artigas&gt;{{Cite web | title= Joan Gardy Artigas, Spanish (1938 - )|url=http://rogallery.com/Artigas_Joan_Gardy/artigas-biography.html| editor = rogallery.com| accessdate= 28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 Joan Miró was contacted by the heads of UNESCO to ask if he want to take part of the team of artists that decorated the future headquarters of the institution that is located in Paris.&lt;ref name=runner93&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corredor-Matheos|first=Josep|title=The Miró-Artigas Murals|journal=Catalonia Culture|date=October 1993|pages=34–37|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once agreed, they granted the exterior walls of the building conferences, two perpendicular walls of three meters high and seven meters long and fifteen, respectively. Miró proposed to make a ceramic mural in collaboration with Llorens Artigas.

In 1956, Miró began working on the mural in his studio in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]]. The following year he went to the [[Cave of Altamira|Caves of Altamira]] in with Llorens Artigas inspired to carry on the work,&lt;ref name="Mink2000"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Janis |last=Mink|title=Joan Miró, 1893-1983|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uDW3HgIw7aYC&amp;pg=PA93|year=2000|editor=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-5975-9|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Preckler2003"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ana María |last=Preckler|title=Historia del arte universal de los siglos XIX y XX|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ_edWCq2UoC&amp;pg=PA236|date= 1 January 2003|editor=Editorial Complutense|isbn=978-84-7491-707-9|pages=236–}}&lt;/ref&gt; by seeing "the first mural in the world".&lt;ref name=BYN59&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miró|first=Joan|title=Como hice los murales para la UNESCO|journal=Blanco y Negro|date=6 July 1959|volume=2457|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also visit the [[Colegiata y Claustro de Santa Juliana]] and the romanesque collection of the Museum of Art of Catalonia, the current [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]].&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt;

=== Construction ===
Once inspired, Miró moved to [[Gallifa]], at the workshop of Artigas, to proceed to prepare the tile mural. It took 35 batches, 25 tons of wood, 4 tons of sandstone and 200 kilos of enamel.&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt; Once finished, the pieces were transported to Paris. Although he had worked in large formats, he had never done ceramics. Beside the ceramist Josep Llorens Artigas, they failed to find technical feasibility for baking pottery in a way that allows to obtain a background textures similar to the paintings of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Rebull, Melania (1994) p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; It was decided that the composition was on the subjects of "Sun" and "Moon".&lt;ref&gt;Malet, Rosa M. (1992) pg. 107-112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inauguration ===
The two mosaic murals were assembled ''in situ'' by a team of technicians under the direct supervision of Miró and Llorens Artigas.&lt;ref name=caca/&gt; The works were inaugurated in 1958, as same as the building, and received rave reviews. Even one of the murals, the ''Wall of the Sun'' won the Biennial Prize of Guggenheim Foundation.&lt;ref name=runner93 /&gt;&lt;ref name=caca/&gt; Miró later return to work for UNESCO, designing the UNESCO Medal for [[Pablo Picasso]].

=== Conservation ===
Initially, the walls were outdoors, but later moved inside the building to protect them from damage caused by [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name=caca /&gt;

'''Waruga''' are a type of [[sarcophagus]] or above ground [[tomb]] traditionally used by the [[Minahasa]]ns of [[North Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]]. They are made of stone and consist or a ridged upper part and a box shaped lower section.

Dead Minahasans were originally wrapped in woka, a type of leaf. Woka is the leaf of the fan palm, Livistona. Then they were put in wooden coffins.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} In the 9th century the Minahasa started using waruga.

Bodies are put in a position facing north. They seated with heel and toe attaches to the buttocks and the head "kissing" the knees. The Minhasa believe their ancestors came from the north.

In 1828 the Dutch banned the use of waruga&lt;ref name=indo&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoIooGXjPYC&amp;pg=PA962&amp;lpg=PA962&amp;dq=Waruga+sarcophagus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uvEGJrG_rg&amp;sig=WFinmy8qUpeos4oRln9NyeUQte0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCmoVChMIuffQyI2fxwIVzCUeCh2rQA2z#v=onepage&amp;q=Waruga%20sarcophagus&amp;f=false Indonesia] by Stephen Backshall page 962&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minahasa started making coffins. Disease outbreak, including typhoid and cholera, was feared. And Christian practice is to bury the dead.

Waruga in Tonsea have carvings and reliefs showing how the bodies are stored in their respective waruga and illustrating livelihoods.

There are about 370 Warugas (waruga-waruga) in [[Rap-Rap]] (15), [[Airmadidi Down]] (211) and  [[Sawangan, North Sulawesi]] (144). They are a tourist attraction and were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1995 in the [[waruga archaeological park]] in Sawangan. At Taman Purbakala Waruga-Waruga, the sarcophagi have been collected from surrounding areas and at a nearby museum porcelain, armbands, axes and bone fragments are exhibited.&lt;ref name=indo/&gt; Most of the waruga have been looted for valuable contents.
