'''Argonne National Laboratory''' is a science and engineering research [[United States Department of Energy National Labs|national laboratory]] operated by the [[University of Chicago]] Argonne LLC for the [[United States Department of Energy]] located near [[Lemont, Illinois]], outside [[Chicago]]. It is the largest national laboratory by size and scope in the [[Midwest]].

Argonne was initially formed to carry out [[Enrico Fermi]]'s work on [[nuclear reactor]]s as part of the [[Manhattan Project]], and it was designated as the first national laboratory in the United States on July 1, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page xx (Introduction).&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war era the lab focused primarily on non-weapon related nuclear physics, designing and building the first power-producing nuclear reactors, helping design the reactors used by the US's [[nuclear navy]], and a wide variety of similar projects. In 1994 the lab's nuclear mission ended, and today it maintains a broad portfolio in basic science research, energy storage and [[renewable energy]], environmental [[sustainability]], [[Supercomputer|supercomputing]], and [[national security]].

UChicago Argonne, LLC, the operator of the laboratory, "brings together the expertise of the [[University of Chicago]] (the sole member of the LLC) with [[Jacobs Engineering Group|Jacobs Engineering Group Inc]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchicagoargonnellc.org/ |title=World-class Scientific Research &amp; Innovation |publisher=UChicago Argonne, LLC |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argonne is a part of the expanding [[Illinois Technology and Research Corridor]]. Argonne formerly ran a smaller facility called Argonne National Laboratory-West (or simply Argonne-West) in Idaho next to the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. In 2005, the two Idaho-based laboratories merged to become the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|work = Post Register|location = Idaho Falls, ID|title = Cleaning house and charting a future at INL|last = Menser|first = Paul|publisher = |accessdate = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131113020138/http://www.postregister.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008|archivedate = 2013-11-13|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Argonne has five main areas of focus. These goals, as stated by the [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Department of Energy|url=http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|accessdate=2009-12-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095748/http://humansubjects.energy.gov/labs/argonne.htm|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; consist of:

* Conducting [[Basic research|basic scientific research]];
* Operating national scientific facilities;
* Enhancing the nation's energy resources;
* Developing better ways to manage environmental problems;
* Protecting national security.

==History==
[[Image:ZGS preaccelerator.png|thumb|200px|[[Albert Crewe]] (right), Argonne's third director, stands next to the [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]]'s [[Cockcroft-Walton generator]].]]
Argonne began in 1942 as the "[[Metallurgical Laboratory]]" at the [[University of Chicago]], which became part of the [[Manhattan Project]]. The Met Lab built [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first [[nuclear reactor]], under the stands of a University of Chicago sports stadium. Considered unsafe, in 1943, CP-1 was reconstructed as CP-2, in what is today known as [[Red Gate Woods]] but was then the Argonne Forest of the Cook County Forest Preserve District near [[Palos Hills, Illinois|Palos Hills]]. The lab was named after the surrounding Argonne Forest, which in turn was named after the [[Forest of Argonne]] in [[France]] where U.S. troops fought in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.gov/about-argonne/history|title=Argonne: History|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate=12 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fermi's pile was originally going to be constructed in the Argonne forest, and construction plans were set in motion, but a labor dispute brought the project to a halt. Since speed was paramount, the project was moved to the squash court under [[Stagg Field]], the football field on the campus of the University of Chicago. Fermi told them that he was sure of his calculations, which said that it would not lead to a runaway reaction, which would have contaminated the city.

Other activities were added to Argonne over the next five years. On July 1, 1946, the "Metallurgical Laboratory" was formally re-chartered as Argonne National Laboratory for "cooperative research in nucleonics." At the request of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]], it began developing nuclear reactors for the nation's peaceful nuclear energy program. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the laboratory moved to a larger location in unincorporated [[DuPage County, Illinois]] and established a remote location in [[Idaho]], called "Argonne-West," to conduct further nuclear research.

In quick succession, the laboratory designed and built [[Chicago Pile 3]] (1944), the world's first [[heavy water reactor|heavy-water moderated reactor]], and the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (Chicago Pile 4), built in Idaho, which lit a string of four light bulbs with the world's first nuclear-generated electricity in 1951. A complete list of the reactors designed and, in most cases, built and operated by Argonne can be viewed in the, "[http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/ANL-Reactors.html Reactors Designed by Argonne]" page. The knowledge gained from the Argonne experiments conducted with these reactors 1) formed the foundation for the designs of most of the commercial reactors currently used throughout the world for electric power generation and 2) inform the current evolving designs of liquid-metal reactors for future commercial power stations.

Conducting classified research, the laboratory was heavily secured; all employees and visitors needed badges to pass a checkpoint, many of the buildings were classified, and the laboratory itself was fenced and guarded. Such alluring secrecy drew visitors both authorized—including [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III of Belgium]] and [[Frederica of Hanover|Queen Frederica of Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne Highlights: 1950–1959 |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/fifties.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and unauthorized. Shortly past 1 a.m. on February 6, 1951, Argonne guards discovered reporter [[Paul Harvey]] near the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on}} perimeter fence, his coat tangled in the barbed wire. Searching his car, guards found a previously prepared four-page broadcast detailing the saga of his unauthorized entrance into a classified "hot zone". He was brought before a federal grand jury on charges of conspiracy to obtain information on national security and transmit it to the public, but was not indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Stephens |first = Joel |title = New documents show longtime friendship between J.

Not all nuclear technology went into developing reactors, however. While designing a scanner for reactor fuel elements in 1957, Argonne physicist William Nelson Beck put his own arm inside the scanner and obtained one of the first [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] images of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = William Nelson "Nels" Beck: Joliet Physicist's Work Changed Medical World |publisher = CityofJoliet.com |url = http://www.cityofjoliet.com/halloffame/scientists/wnbeck.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remote manipulators designed to handle radioactive materials laid the groundwork for more complex machines used to clean up contaminated areas, sealed laboratories or caves.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the "Janus" reactor opened to study the effects of neutron radiation on biological life, providing research for guidelines on safe exposure levels for workers at power plants, laboratories and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Research helps safeguard nuclear workers worldwide |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/hn/news960803.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists at Argonne pioneered a technique to analyze the [[Moon|moon's]] surface using [[alpha decay|alpha radiation]], which launched aboard the [[Surveyor 5]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Jacobsen |first = Sally |title = Getting Aboard Viking: No Room on the Mars Lander. |date = December 1971|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JgsAAAAAMBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1967 and later analyzed lunar samples from the [[Apollo 11]] mission.

In addition to nuclear work, the laboratory maintained a strong presence in the basic research of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. In 1955, Argonne chemists co-discovered the [[Chemical element|elements]] [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], elements 99 and 100 in the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 179.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, laboratory chemists produced the first compound of the inert [[noble gas]] [[xenon]], opening up a new field of chemical bonding research.&lt;ref&gt;Holl, Hewlett, and Harris, page 226.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, they discovered the [[Aqueous electron|hydrated electron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Argonne History: Innovation and Serendipity |publisher = Argonne National Laboratory |url = http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/chemhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-energy physics made a leap forward when Argonne was chosen as the site of the 12.5 GeV [[Zero Gradient Synchrotron]], a [[particle accelerator|proton accelerator]] that opened in 1963. A [[bubble chamber]] allowed scientists to track the motions of [[subatomic particle]]s as they zipped through the chamber; in 1970, they observed the [[neutrino]] in a hydrogen bubble chamber for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Patel, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the laboratory was also helping to design the reactor for the world's first [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|U.S.S. ''Nautilus'']], which steamed for more than 513,550 nautical miles (951,090&amp;nbsp;km). The next nuclear reactor model was Experimental [[Boiling Water Reactor]], the forerunner of many modern nuclear plants, and [[Experimental Breeder Reactor II]] (EBR-II), which was sodium-cooled, and included a fuel recycling facility. EBR-II was later modified to test other reactor designs, including a [[fast-neutron reactor]] and, in 1982, the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] concept—a revolutionary design that reprocessed its own fuel, reduced its atomic waste and withstood safety tests of the same failures that triggered the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Frontline: Nuclear Reaction: Interview with Dr. Charles Till |publisher = PBS |url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/reaction/interviews/till.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, however, the U.S. Congress terminated funding for the bulk of Argonne's nuclear programs.

Argonne moved to specialize in other areas, while capitalizing on its experience in physics, chemical sciences and [[metallurgy]]. In 1987, the laboratory was the first to successfully demonstrate a pioneering technique called [[plasma wakefield acceleration]], which accelerates particles in much shorter distances than conventional accelerators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Argonne History: Understanding the Physical Universe |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |url=http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html#neutrino |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909173546/http://www.anl.gov/Science_and_Technology/History/Anniversary_Frontiers/physhist.html |archivedate=9 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also cultivated a strong [[battery (electricity)|battery]] research program.

Following a major push by then-director Alan Schriesheim, the laboratory was chosen as the site of the [[Advanced Photon Source]], a major X-ray facility which was completed in 1995 and produced the brightest X-rays in the world at the time of its construction.

{{Atmospheric sciences}}
{{Weather}}
'''Atmospheric sciences''' are the study of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], its processes, the effects other systems have on the atmosphere, and the effects of the atmosphere on these other systems. [[Meteorology]] includes [[atmospheric chemistry]] and [[atmospheric physics]] with a major focus on [[weather forecasting]]. [[Climatology]] is the study of atmospheric changes (both long and short-term) that define average climates and their change over time, due to both natural and anthropogenic [[climate change|climate variability]]. [[Aeronomy]] is the study of the upper layers of the atmosphere, where [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] and [[ionization]] are important. Atmospheric science has been extended to the field of [[planetary science]] and the study of the atmospheres of the [[planet]]s of the [[solar system]].

Experimental instruments used in atmospheric sciences include [[satellite]]s, [[rocketsonde]]s, [[radiosonde]]s, [[weather balloon]]s, and [[laser]]s.

The term '''aerology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀήρ, ''aēr'', "[[air]]"; and -λογία, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is sometimes used as an alternative term for the study of Earth's atmosphere. Early pioneers in the field include [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]] and [[Richard Assmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OlckxY7BA_0C&amp;pg=PA17 Ultraviolet radiation in the solar system] By Manuel Vázquez, Arnold Hanslmeier&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Atmospheric chemistry}}
Atmospheric chemistry is a branch of atmospheric science in which the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere and that of other planets is studied. It is a multidisciplinary field of research and draws on environmental chemistry, physics, meteorology, computer modeling, oceanography, geology and volcanology and other disciplines. Research is increasingly connected with other areas of study such as climatology.

The composition and chemistry of the atmosphere is of importance for several reasons, but primarily because of the interactions between the atmosphere and living organisms. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere has been changed by human activity and some of these changes are harmful to human health, crops and ecosystems. Examples of problems which have been addressed by atmospheric chemistry include acid rain, photochemical smog and global warming. Atmospheric chemistry seeks to understand the causes of these problems, and by obtaining a theoretical understanding of them, allow possible solutions to be tested and the effects of changes in government policy evaluated.

== Atmospheric dynamics ==
{{see also|Synoptic scale meteorology}}
Atmospheric dynamics involves the study of observations and theory dealing with all motion systems of meteorological importance. Common topics studied include diverse phenomena such as [[thunderstorms]], [[tornado]]es, [[gravity wave]]s, [[tropical cyclone]]s, [[extratropical cyclone]]s, [[jet stream]]s, and global-scale circulations. The goal of dynamical studies is to explain the observed circulations on the basis of fundamental principles from [[physics]]. The objectives of such studies incorporate improving [[weather forecasting]], developing methods for predicting seasonal and interannual climate fluctuations, and understanding the implications of human-induced perturbations (e.g., increased carbon dioxide concentrations or depletion of the ozone layer) on the global climate.&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Washington]].

== Atmospheric physics ==
{{main|Atmospheric physics}}
Atmospheric physics is the application of physics to the study of the atmosphere. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model Earth's atmosphere and the atmospheres of the other planets using fluid flow equations, chemical models, radiation balancing, and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere and underlying oceans. In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of scattering theory, [[wave propagation]] models, [[cloud physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and spatial [[statistics]], each of which incorporate high levels of mathematics and physics. Atmospheric physics has close links to meteorology and climatology and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including remote sensing instruments.

In the United Kingdom, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the Meteorological Office. Divisions of the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) oversee research projects and weather modeling involving atmospheric physics. The [[U.S. National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center]] also carries out studies of the high atmosphere.

The [[Earth's magnetic field]] and the [[solar wind]] interact with the atmosphere, creating the [[ionosphere]], [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, [[telluric current]]s, and [[radiant energy]].

== Climatology ==

[[File:El_Nino_regional_impacts.png|thumb|250px|Regional impacts of warm ENSO episodes (El Niño).]]
{{main|Climatology}}
In contrast to [[meteorology]], which studies short term [[weather]] systems lasting up to a few weeks, climatology studies the frequency and trends of those systems. It studies the periodicity of weather events over years to millennia, as well as changes in long-term average weather patterns, in relation to atmospheric conditions. [[List of climate scientists|Climatologists]], those who practice climatology, study both the nature of climates&amp;nbsp;– local, regional or global&amp;nbsp;– and the natural or human-induced factors that cause climates to change. Climatology considers the past and can help [[prediction|predict]] future [[climate change]].

Phenomena of climatological interest include the [[atmospheric boundary layer]], [[atmospheric circulation|circulation patterns]], [[heat transfer]] ([[thermal radiation|radiative]], [[convection|convective]] and [[latent heat flux|latent]]), interactions between the atmosphere and the [[oceans]] and [[Landform|land]] surface (particularly [[vegetation]], [[land use]] and [[topography]]), and the chemical and physical composition of the atmosphere. Related disciplines include [[astrophysics]], [[atmospheric physics]], [[chemistry]], [[ecology]], [[physical geography]], [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[glaciology]], [[hydrology]], [[oceanography]], and [[volcanology]].

All of the Solar System's planets have atmospheres.  This is because their gravity is strong enough to keep gaseous particles close to the surface.  Larger gas giants are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] close by, while the smaller planets lose these gases into [[space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Sheppard |first1=S.

Planetary atmospheres are affected by the varying degrees of energy received from either the Sun or their interiors, leading to the formation of dynamic [[weather system]]s such as [[hurricane]]s, (on Earth), planet-wide [[dust storm]]s ([[Climate of Mars|on Mars]]), an Earth-sized [[Anticyclonic storm|anticyclone]] on Jupiter (called the [[Great Red Spot]]), and [[Great Dark Spot|holes in the atmosphere]] (on Neptune).&lt;ref name=Weather&gt;{{cite web |last=Harvey |first=Samantha |date=1 May 2006 |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |title=Weather, Weather, Everywhere? |publisher=NASA |accessdate=9 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808201459/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/scitech/display.cfm?ST_ID=725 |archivedate=8 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one extrasolar planet, [[HD 189733 b]], has been claimed to possess such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.&lt;ref name="knutson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knutson |first=Heather A. |author2=Charbonneau, David |author3=Allen, Lori E. |author4=Fortney, Jonathan J. |title=A map of the day-night contrast of the extrasolar planet HD 189733b |journal=Nature |year=2007 |volume=447 |pages=183–6 |doi=10.1038/nature05782 |pmid=17495920 |issue=7141 |bibcode=2007Natur.447..183K |arxiv=0705.0993}} (Related [http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/press/2007/pr200713.html press release])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bayʿah''''' ({{lang-ar|بَيْعَة}}, Pledge of allegiance"), in [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terminology]], is an [[oath of allegiance]] to a leader. It is known to have been practiced by the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. ''Bayʿah'' is sometimes taken under a written pact given on behalf of the subjects by leading members of the tribe with the understanding that as long as the leader abides by certain requirements towards his people, they are to maintain their allegiance to him. ''Bayʿah'' is still practiced in countries such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-77384488.html THE IMPASSE IN THE CIVIL WAR], [[Arab Studies Quarterly]], Lesch, Ann M., March 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Morocco]], ''bayʿah'' is one of the foundations of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|monarchy]]. 

== In Islamic history ==
The tradition of ''bayʿah'' can be traced back to the era of Muhammad. From the beginning bayʿah was taken by Muhammad as an oath of allegiance. Anybody who wanted to join the Islamic community did so by reciting the basic statement of the faith expressing his faith in the oneness of God and the [[prophethood]] of Muhammad. However, this differed from the proclamation of faith necessary to simply become a Muslim. In addition to this the prophet formally took bayʿah from the people and tribes. Through this formal act they entered the [[Ummah|Islamic community]] and showed their willingness to follow and obey Muhammad. The wordings of the oath differ in different traditions but it contains the ''[[shahada]]'' and prayers of repentance.

It is reported that at the occasion of annual gatherings outside [[Mecca]], Muhammad met people from Yathrib, later to be renamed [[Medina]], who accepted his call towards Islam. Muhammad then took ''bayʿah'' from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desker|first1=Barry|title=Perspectives on the Security of Singapore: The First 50 Years|date=2015|page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Qur'an ==
[[File:Bay'ah Ceremony of the Commanders of Islamic Revolution Committees with Ali Khamenei, 8 June 1989 (video).webm|thumb|Bay'ah Ceremony of the Commanders of [[Islamic Revolution Committees]] with Ali Khamenei, 8 June 1989]]

After the [[Pledge of the Tree]], which led to the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], the following was revealed in the [[Qur'an]] commemorating and appreciating the pledge and those who made it:

{{Quote|Certainly [[Allah]] was well pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, and He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity on them and rewarded them with a near victory, |[[Sura]] [[Al-Fath]], [[Ayah]] 18|{{Cite quran|48|18|s=r|t=s}}}}

=== History ===
The ''bay'ah'' of Rizwan, a collective initiation of thousands of Muslims at the hand of Muhammad, is mentioned in the Qur'an. The tradition was continued by the [[caliph]]s.

In subsequent ages, it was associated with [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders, and spiritual masters would initiate their followers. The practice still exists in Sufi orders around the world.

'''Bugchasing''', also known in slang as '''charging''', is the practice of pursuing [[human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive]] individuals in order to contract HIV. Individuals engaged in this activity are referred to as bugchasers. It is a form of [[self-harm]]. Bugchasers seek [[sexual partner]]s who are HIV-positive for the purpose of having [[Bareback (sex)|unprotected sex]] and becoming HIV-positive; '''giftgivers''' are HIV-positive individuals who comply with the bugchasers' efforts to become infected with HIV.

Bugchasers indicate various reasons for this activity. Some bugchasers engage in the activity for the excitement and intimacy inherent in pursuing such a dangerous activity, but do not implicitly desire to contract HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Freeman, "In Search of Death," ''Rolling Stone'', January 23, 2003 https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crossley Michelle | year = 2004 | title = 'Resistance' and health promotion | doi = 10.1348/0144666041501679 | journal = British Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 225–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers suggest that the behavior may stem from a "resistance to dominant heterosexual norms and mores" due to a defensive response by gay men to repudiate stigmatization and rejection by society.&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt;

Some people consider bugchasing "intensely erotic" and the act of being infected through the "fuck of death" as the "ultimate taboo, the most extreme sex act left."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gregory A. Freeman |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print |title=Rolling Stone : Bug Chasers |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116220955/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chas/print |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who are HIV negative and in a [[Serodiscordant|relationship]] with someone who is HIV-positive may seek infection as a way to remain in the relationship, particularly when the HIV-positive partner may wish to break up to avoid infecting the HIV negative partner.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Others have suggested that some people who feel lonely desire the nurturing community and social services that support people with [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Crossley, Michelle 2004. pp. 225"/&gt; It has also been used as a form of [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frances, Richard J. |author2=Wikstrom, Thomas |author3=Alcena, Valiere | title=Contracting AIDS as a means of committing suicide| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1985|volume=142|issue=5|page=656| doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.656b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flavin, Daniel K. |author2=Franklin, John E. |author3=Frances, Richard J. | title=The acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and suicidal behavior in alcohol-dependent homosexual men| journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1986|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1440–1442| doi=10.1176/ajp.143.11.1440 | pmid=3777237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==

By design, bug chasing involves [[unprotected sex]], but members of the [[Bareback (sex)|bareback]] subculture are not necessarily bugchasers. The difference is intent:

{{quote|text=In reviewing the scarce unpublished and published materials on bugchasing, as well as general healthcare speculations, a common theme appears — the lumping of bug chasers with barebackers.... Although these two groups share some of the same practices, namely unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), there are distinctions that differentiate bug chasing...even though all bug chasers are indeed barebackers, not all barebackers are bugchasers.&lt;ref name="pmid17612955"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Moskowitz DA, Roloff ME |title=The existence of a bug chasing subculture |journal=Cult Health Sex |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=347–57 |year=2007 |pmid=17612955 |doi=10.1080/13691050600976296 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/13691050600976296}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In simple terms, bugchasers engage in unprotected intercourse, and seek out partners with HIV, because they desire infection. Barebackers engage in unprotected intercourse because they prefer the sensation of it but generally prefer to avoid contracting STIs. While actual activity is the same for both groups the two do not share the same psychology. Barebackers conceptually have the same motivation as heterosexual couples that use non-barrier methods of birth control (more enjoyable sex), and, in contrast with bugchasers, do not deliberately seek HIV-infected partners.

As many "bugchasers" appear to be seeking the community and sympathy that HIV+ individuals experience, comparisons have been drawn with [[Munchausen syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffiths|first1=Dr Mark|title=Contract Killing: A brief look at ‘bug chasing’|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201410/contract-killing|website=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Over the past decade, researchers have endeavored to document, explain, and look for a solution to bugchasing. Dr. DeAnn Gauthier and Dr. Craig Forsyth put forth the first academic article in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K.Gauthier|first=Deann|last2=J.Forsyth|first2=Craig|date=1999-01-01|title=bareback sex, bug chasers, and the gift of death|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016396299266605|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=20|issue=1|pages=85–100|doi=10.1080/016396299266605|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; They explored the emerging trend of gay men who eschew [[condom]]s and the development of a barebacking subculture. They also noted through their qualitative research that some barebackers were in search of HIV.

Dr. Richard Tewksbury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewksbury|first=Richard|date=2003-09-01|title=bareback sex and the quest for HIV: assessing the relationship in internet personal advertisements of men who have sex with men|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713840245|journal=Deviant Behavior|volume=24|issue=5|pages=467–482|doi=10.1080/713840245|issn=0163-9625}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first researchers to acknowledge bug chasing online and that bug chasers were using the [[Internet]] to assist their [[Seroconversion|seroconversive]] efforts. In his more recent research, he gave a strong analysis of what bug chasers and gift givers resemble in their behaviors, attitudes, and demographics.

Drs. Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bug Chasing and Gift Giving: The Potential for HIV Transmission Among Barebackers on the Internet|last1=Grov|first1=Christian|last2=Parsons|first2=Jeffrey T.|date=2006|doi=10.1521/aeap.2006.18.6.490|journal=AIDS Education and Prevention|volume=18|issue=6|pp=490–503|pmid=17166076}}&lt;/ref&gt; research using the internet profiles of 1,228 bug chasers and gift givers identified six subsets of bug chasers and gift givers.

# "The Committed Bug Chaser" included men who indicated they were HIV-negative and seeking HIV-positive partners. Of the committed bug chasers who indicated a desired sexual position, the majority were bottoms (62.2 percent [[anal sex|anal receptive]]). Only 7.5 percent of the sample were classified as committed bug chasers.
# "The Opportunistic Bug Chaser" included men who were HIV-negative and indicated that their partner’s HIV status did not matter. Most of these men were either versatile (43.6 percent; meaning [[anal receptive]] and [[anal insertive]]) or bottoms (46.3 percent). In total, 12.1 percent of their sample included opportunistic bug chasers.
# "The Committed Gift Giver" included men who were HIV-positive who also indicated they were seeking HIV-negative partners. Notably, only five men from the entire sample of 1,228 fell into this category.
# "The Opportunistic Gift Giver" included men who indicated they were HIV-positive and that their partner’s status did not matter to them. Most of these men (61.8 percent) were versatile. Opportunistic Gift Givers accounted for 26 percent of the sample.
# "The Serosorter" Although all men Drs Grov and Parsons sampled indicated they were a gift giver or a bug chaser in their [[User profile|Internet profile]], behavioural intentions did not consistently match with bug chaser/gift giver identity. Some HIV-positive men (8.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-positive men. Meanwhile, some HIV-negative men (12.5 percent of the total sample) indicated preference for other HIV-negative men. Although having indicated they were a bug chaser or a gift giver, these men were [[serosorting]] for partners of similar HIV status.
# "The Ambiguous Bug Chaser or Gift Giver" included men who indicated they did not know their HIV status and thus it was difficult to determine if they were seeking to bug chase or gift give. This category was 16.3 percent of the sample.

In total, Drs Christian Grov and Jeffrey T. Parsons concluded that bug chasing and gift giving might occur among a select few individuals. Further, their research found that there was substantial variation in intentions to spread HIV (with some not intent on spreading HIV) among those who indicated they were gift givers or bug chasers.

Dr. David Moskowitz, Dr. Catriona MacLeod and Dr. Michael Roloff attempted to quantitatively explain why bug chasers chase HIV. They claimed that individuals who look for HIV are more likely [[sex addict]]s. These individuals have exhausted the sexual high they previously derived by performing other sexual risk taking behaviors, and now turn to bug chasing to achieve the risk-oriented high.

Dr. Bruce D. LeBlanc (2007) &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=An Exploratory Study of  Bug Chasers|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=20321517|journal=Sociological imagination|volume=43|issue=2|issn=1077-5048}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an exploratory study involving survey responses from self identified bug chasers, one of the first published studies involving direct responses from this identified group. His findings challenge "common sense" and research findings regarding bug chasers. Examining psychological and social motivations for seeking HIV the most frequent response was that individuals could not identify a psychological (internal thought process) or social (interactions with others) factor for seeking HIV. Regarding motivations for seeking infection the most frequent response was seeing becoming infected as a thrill, hot, or erotic, as well as seeing the semen through a similar lens.  Few respondents identified "getting it over with" as a motivating factor.

Some limited identification of becoming part of the "community" or "brotherhood" was identified.  Other variables studied included methods for finding partners, sexual behaviors undertaken while seeking infection, average number of sexual partners, length of time for which they will seek infection and life event changes if they were successful in becoming infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Medical response==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Bugchasing has, more recently, been taken more seriously by medical health promotion bodies, such as the [[Centers for Disease Control]], which hosted a workshop on the topic, hosted by Dr. Michael Graydon of [[Carleton University]], [[Ottawa]], at the 2004 National [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]] Prevention Conference.

==In mainstream media==
The bugchasing/giftgiving phenomenon gained press coverage and notoriety after ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine printed an article in 2003 by a freelance journalist, Gregory Freeman, entitled "Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+".&lt;ref name=RollingStone&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304003441/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|archivedate=2008-03-04|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5939950/bug_chasers|title=In Search of Death|author=Gregory A. Freeman|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=7 December 2009|date=23 January 2003|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article quoted San Francisco health services director Dr. Bob Cabaj as saying that as many as 25 percent of new HIV infections a year (about ten thousand people) were from men who had contracted it on purpose.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Roeper&gt;{{Cite news| title = What makes bug chasers, gift givers do such a thing? | first = Richard | last = Roeper | newspaper = Chicago Sun-Times | date = 2003-04-22 | page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya&gt;{{Cite news| title = A new generation rethinks AIDS risk | page = 1D |department=Island Life | newspaper = Honolulu Advertiser | date = 2003-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabaj disputed the quotes attributed to him, but ''Rolling Stone'' stands behind the story.&lt;ref name = Roeper/&gt;&lt;ref name = Tanya/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = n TRANSMISSION |journal= AIDS Policy and Law |volume= 18 |issue= 4 | date = 2003-03-03 | publisher = LRP Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mnookin&gt;{{Cite news| title = Using 'Bug Chasers' | page = 10 | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | publisher = Newsweek | date = 2003-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Marshall Forstein, the medical director of mental health and addiction services at Boston's [[Fenway Health|Fenway Community Health]], was reported to have said that the clinic regularly saw bug-chasers and warned that it was growing.&lt;ref name = RollingStone/&gt;&lt;ref name = Bugged&gt;{{Cite news| title = Bugged Out Over AIDS Story | page = 10 | publisher = New York Post | date = 2003-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He called the statements "entirely a fabrication," but ''Rolling Stone'' also stood behind them.&lt;ref name = Bugged/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Is Rolling Stone's HIV Story Wildly Exaggerated? | newspaper = Newsweek | first = Seth | last = Mnookin | date = 2003-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weinstein, then editor of the ''New York Blade'', an established gay newspaper, called the article "less than truthful" and attributed it to a ''Rolling Stone'' editor (whom he did not name) recently recruited from a competing "lad mag" who wished to make a sensation for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Weinstein | first = Steve | title = Chasing the bug chasers [editorial] | journal = Washington Blade | date = May 23, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the article, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] put out an action alert, calling its members to "PROTEST ROLLING STONE'S IRRESPONSIBLE 'BUG CHASING'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Savage Love |department=Hot Spot | page = 171 | authorlink = Dan Savage | first = Dan | last = Savage | newspaper = The Village Voice | date = 2003-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics criticized the use of the disputed figures by conservative organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Men Who Want AIDS | first = Matthew | last = Laza | pages = 21–24 | newspaper = The Spectator | date = 2003-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, The Traditional Values Coalition used the article to urge the [[Centers for Disease Control]] to cut down on its AIDS funding.&lt;ref name = Mnookin/&gt;

Writer/[[film director|director]] Daniel Bort made a [[2003 in film|2003]] short film  on the subject called ''Bugchaser'', which premièred at the 16th Annual [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, and was shot mainly in [[New York City|New York]] [[sex club]]s. In an interview with the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', he explained: ''"The matter-of-fact declarations of a string of articulate, apparently nonsensical people...affected me tremendously. I had to find out the reasons why such individuals will seek suicide in this almost symbolic way."'' At the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, the film was shown with an accompanying [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Gift (2003 film)|The Gift]]'' by Louise Hogarth.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

HIV-positive male Ricky Dyer, who investigated the apparent bug chasing phenomenon for a 2006 [[BBC]] programme, ''I love being HIV+'', said that an air of complacency about the realities of living with the virus may be one reason why infection rates have been rising.&lt;ref name="HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4895012.stm|title=HIV 'bug chasers': Fantasy or fact? |accessdate=2008-07-06|publisher=BBC News|author=Richard Pendry   | date=2006-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the BBC also described bugchasing as more internet fantasy than reality, saying that, "Dyer finds that the overwhelming majority of the talk is pure fantasy." The article also quotes Will Nutland, head of health promotion at Terrence Higgins Trust, as saying, "The concepts of 'gift giving' and 'bug chasers' are definitely based more in fantasy than reality" as well as Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, who said, "There is very little evidence of people trying to get infected with HIV."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' a former student of Professor Ben Bruckner asked Ben to infect him with HIV, wanting to experience "the gift". Ben refuses and writes a short story about the incident.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In the NBC series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', Season 7, Episode 13, Dr. Malucci treats a gay man who wants to contract HIV from his positive partner. Malucci asked the HIV-negative patient if he is "bug chasing".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

On his 2003 EP HRG, Vol. 1, singer/songwriter [[Marc with a C]] has a song on the subject entitled "Chasing the Bug".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

[[File:Bikaner Kamelfarm.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Camel Research Farm, Bikaner]]
'''Camel Research Farm, Bikaner''' is a farm engaged in the research of camels.  It is located  about 8 km from [[Bikaner]] city in the state of [[Rajasthan]] in [[India]].
This is a one-of-a-kind institute in India.  The farm is a complex of camel stables, enclosures and buildings.  One can enjoy camel rides or ice cream made of camels milk. The farm permits tourists at certain hours of the day.  It is interesting to watch camel calves gamboling around and also quite spectacular when the [[camel]]s return from a day out in the desert.  It is also known as a Camel Breeding Farm and was established in 1984 by the central government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5310">'''Circulus''' was a [[socioeconomics]] doctrine devised by nineteenth-century French [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] [[socialist]] [[Pierre Leroux]] (1797-1871), who proposed that human [[excrement]] be collected by the state in the form of a [[tax]] and used as [[fertiliser]], thereby increasing agricultural production sufficiently to prevent [[Malthusian catastrophe]].

== The theory ==
According to Leroux, human excrement has remarkable fertilising properties, which society fails to harness. The human waste that is otherwise discarded would fertilise agricultural production sufficient to cover society's progressively increasing food consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[Pierre Jannet, J. F. Payen, Auguste Alexandre Veinant] ''Bibliotheca Scatologica, ou catalogue raisonné des livres traitant des vertus faits et gestes de très noble et très ingénieux'' [Paris: Imprimerie Guiraudet et Jouaust, 1849], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux posits the existence of a natural law dependent on the circulation of human excrement back through the agricultural process and which maintains a necessary balance between soil fertility and inexorable population growth.&lt;ref&gt;''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Revue de l'ordre social'' (No. 1, 1850, p.&amp;nbsp;6), Leroux responded to his critics, summing up his theory as follows: "Si les hommes étaient croyants, savants, religieux, ajoute-t-il, au lieu de rire, comme ils le font, du socialisme, ils professeraient avec respect et vénération la doctrine du circulus. Chacun recueillerait ''religieusement'' son fumier pour le donner à l’état, c’est-à-dire au percepteur, en guise d’impôt ou de contribution personelle. La production agricole serait immédiatement doublée, et la misère disparaîtrait du globe"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Bibliotheca Scatologica'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; (If men were believers, learned, religious, then, rather than laughing at socialism, as they do, they would profess the doctrine of circulus with respect and veneration. Each would religiously collect his dung to give it to the state, that is, to the tax-collector, by way of an impost or personal contribution. Agricultural production would instantly be doubled, and poverty would vanish from the globe).

== Origin and history of the theory ==
Leroux first put forward his theory of circulus in 1834, as part of an attempt to explain the failure of a [[Fourierism|Fourierist]] [[phalanstery]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald Reid, ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen: Realities and Representations'', Harvard University Press, 1991, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Madame Baudet-Dulary, astonished at the failure of the utopian community established on her land, Fourier himself is supposed to have said: "Madame, donnez-moi fumier" (Madame, give me dung).&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Laporte, ''Histoire de la Merde'', Christian Bourgois, Editeur, Paris, 1978, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite public ridicule,&lt;ref&gt;See for example Alfred Sudre, who derides Leroux's theory in ''Histoire du communisme: ou, Réfutation historique des utopies socialistes'' (4th edition, Alfred Pagny, Éditeur, Brussels, 1850, p. 309), as follows: "M. Pierre Leroux s’écrie: Pour renverser le Léviathan de l’économie politique, il me suffit… d’un détritus" (Monsieur Pierre Leroux cries out: to overturn the Leviathan of the political economy, all I need is... a piece of waste).&lt;/ref&gt; Leroux held firm to his theory in the decades that followed and, while living in exile in [[Jersey]] after the fall of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], he carried out experiments using his own excrement as fertiliser in an attempt to persuade the local authorities to adopt the doctrine of circulus.&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Leroux's theory did gain the sympathetic ear of fellow exile [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the digression on the sewers of Paris in ''[[Les Misérables]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"L'intestin de Léviathan", Book Five, Part Two.&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo would seem to have been influenced by Leroux's diagnosis of socio-economic ills when he declares that the present sewerage system is "a misunderstanding" ("Un égout est un malentendu"), a negligent waste ("coulage") of public wealth ("la richesse publique"), and that were the "givens of a new social economy" ("les données d'une économie sociale nouvelle") applied to human waste, then the problem of poverty would be attenuated.&lt;ref&gt;''Les Misérables'', ed. Guy Rosa and Nicole Savy, Le Livre de Poche, 1985, vol. 2, p. 1685.&lt;/ref&gt; But in practical terms, rather than by Leroux's vision of individual members of society willingly paying a tax in their own excrement for the sake of the common weal, Hugo's collector sewers were sooner inspired by the ideas of English social reformer [[Edwin Chadwick]], who proposed that human waste be pumped from cities to the countryside to provide fertiliser for crops to feed those very cities, thereby completing "the circle and [realising] the Egyptian type of eternity by bringing as it were the serpent's tail into the serpent's mouth".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Paris Sewers and Sewermen'', p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cursive]] handwriting instruction is a historical instrument for composition and important to the learning capability of young students.

== History ==
Cursive has traditionally been used as a way of signing one's name, a [[signature]], and is considered a very important skill. The last few lines of the [[Declaration of Independence]] remind us what it means to inscribe a signature.&lt;ref name="signature value"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Value of the Signature|url=http://med.uth.tmc.edu/students-current/SCAIP/signature-value.htm|work=Student Committee for Academic Integrity and Professionalism|publisher=The University of Texas Medical School at Houston|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''"And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Declaration of Independence|url=http://federalist.freeservers.com/|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:- [[Thomas Jefferson]], ''Declaration of Independence''

While many people sign their names enough that it becomes very routine, it is still an important skill to have.&lt;ref name="signature value" /&gt; A ''false signature'', [[forgery]], is a punishable by law offense. Writing a [[Certified check|check]], signing a [[credit slip]], signing a [[marriage certificate]], and signing an apartment lease are just a few of the occasions when a valid signature is necessary.&lt;ref name="signature value" /&gt; Signatures are reflections of the identity of a person  and that person as a professional.&lt;ref name="signature value" /&gt;

=== Important Figures ===
Autographs are some of the most expensive collectors items on the market. Typically, an autograph is a signature written in cursive by someone of notable fame. One of the most notable signatures comes from [[John Hancock]], which is also the most notable signature on the Declaration of Independence.

== No Child Left Behind ==
When the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] was implemented, several changes were made to the classroom curriculum. One of those changes, that has been frequently altered, is the requirement for cursive handwriting. The [[U.S. Department of Education]] has provided updates of the changes as they are implemented into the school systems. The general curriculum states that by 5th grade, students use cursive exclusively and give oral presentations.&lt;ref name="no child 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 No Child Left Behind- Blue Ribbon Schools Program |url=http://nces.ed.gov/ |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |accessdate=March 27, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116125625/http://nces.ed.gov/ |archivedate=January 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there have been more recent updates of the required curriculum for primary schools nationwide, cursive handwriting has been an essential part of reading and writing instruction.

== Handwriting ==
"[[Handwriting]] is a psychomotor skill taught by instruction".&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arslan|first=Derya|author2=Mehmet Akif Ersoy University|title=Examining First Grade Teachers' Handwriting Instruction|journal=Education Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwriting instruction is a student's primary means of communicating academic progress to teachers, and that is doubly true for cursive handwriting instruction.&lt;ref name="comparison of cursive"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shimel|first=Kristin |author2=Candler, Catherine |author3=Neville-Smith, Marsha|title=Comparison of Cursive Handwriting Instruction Programs Among Students Without Identified Problems|journal=Physical &amp; Occupational Therapy in Pediatrics|year=2009|volume=29|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many important aspects of handwriting instruction, the most important items are; age of handwriting instruction, handwriting style, methods of handwriting instruction, handwriting equipment, evaluation, and handwriting difficulties.&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction" /&gt; Legibility is the main determinant in handwriting evaluations, especially cursive handwriting.&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction" /&gt; It is very important that handwriting instruction is taught properly; it is a skill that is very difficult to restore if it is gained incorrectly.&lt;ref name="handwriting instruction" /&gt;

== Current Events ==
Many schools have removed cursive handwriting instruction from their curriculum. A recent news article claims that a new bill could require cursive writing in schools again.&lt;ref name="require cursive"&gt;{{cite news|last=Morgan|first=Jessika|title=New Bill Could Require Cursive Writing In School Again|newspaper=The Free Press (Kinstin, North Carolina)|date=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bill was filed in North Carolina, it is something that is being conversed about in many of the states of America. If the bill is approved, it will alter the curriculum to include cursive handwriting instruction.&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt; "These schools would be required to provide instruction for students to create legible, cursive documents by the end of the fifth grade."&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt;  Under the LCS cursive guidelines, student's are not expected to be completely proficient in cursive writing by the end of the fifth grade but be able to use the skill.&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt;  When the system was revisited, after the skill was taken out of the core requirements, school therapists reported that some students struggled with manuscript but excelled in cursive writing.&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt; Several students interviewed said they enjoy writing in cursive for reasons such that "you can write faster than normal," "you can use it as you get older," and "it helps you learn more."&lt;ref name="require cursive" /&gt; Students in Atlantic Shores Christian School, in Virginia, say that there is no substitute for cursive handwriting instruction.&lt;ref name="cursive lost"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winborn|first=Tracy|title=Writing in Cursive: Skill Lost on America's Youth?|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2011/June/Writing-in-Cursive-Skill-Lost-on-Americas-Youth-/|accessdate=March 27, 2013|newspaper=CBN News|date=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cursive is something you need to sign your name in a legal document, "it teaches you to get more muscles in your hand," and "because it's fun...you get to do different symbols than normal."&lt;ref name="cursive lost" /&gt;
Many schools have adopted keyboarding as an alternative to cursive handwriting instruction. Because cursive handwriting instruction has been removed from the mandatory curriculum, schools around the country are debating whether or not to spend teaching resources on penmanship.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news|title=Schools Debate Cursive Handwriting Instruction Nationwide|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/30/cursive-handwriting-instr_n_842069.html|accessdate=March 27, 2013|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown whether or not the next generation will be taught to read manuscripts, although the sentiment, "Nobody reads handwriting anymore," expressed by [[Luis von Ahn]], seems to encourage the idea that cursive handwriting instruction may become obsolete in the near future.&lt;ref name="debate" /&gt;

=== Text Messaging ===
Text messaging, or simply [[texting]], is a very popular way to communicate through a text only message. It began as a simple message sent from a computer in 1992 to a billion dollar operation in 2011.&lt;ref name=texting&gt;{{cite web|title=Text Messaging: A timeline of how 160 characters changed the way we communicate|url=http://www.tatango.com/blog/history-of-text-messaging-timeline-wide/|work=tatango|publisher=SMS Marketing Blog|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passing notes in class has become a thing of the past as it is not very common to see students in grades [[K-12]] without a [[cellular phone]] but the majority of cell phone owners who text on a regular basis are age 18-25.&lt;ref name="texting ruins" /&gt;  Forty-one states have adopted new standards that replace cursive handwriting instruction with keyboarding.&lt;ref name="cursive lost" /&gt; Students in Augusta, Georgia expressed that "texting is my life" and "texting is more fun".&lt;ref name="cursive lost" /&gt; While it may be an acceptable form of communication among friends, text lingo is also diminishing proper grammar and spelling techniques. As the use of [[textese]] increases, test scores, specifically grammar, decrease.&lt;ref name="texting ruins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Texting Ruining the English Language?|url=http://sourcefednews.com/is-texting-ruining-the-english-language/|publisher=Source Fed|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The relevancy of this section as it pertains to the subject isn't known at this time.

'''David Greetham''' (born October 21, 1941) is an Anglo-American literary critic and the founder of the [[Society for Textual Scholarship]].

==Career==

Greetham received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1963 and completed his Ph.D. in English at the [[City University of New York]].

[[Marta Werner]] of [[D'Youville College]] describes Greetham as "drawn to texts that spill over the boundaries of genre, that exist in multiple versions, that explore intertextuality, and that complicate in various other ways the notion of text as fixed or stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Marta|title=Post-Everything|journal=Text|date=2003|volume=15|pages=337–349|ref=post_everything|jstor=30227799}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works, Greetham has sought to co-opt "the terminology
and practice of literary theory in re-designating textual operations in
the guise of ... literature, anthropology, sociology,
gender studies, history, political science, linguistics, psychology, [and]
philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Theories of the Text|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67Yg06eUaDkC|accessdate=15 April 2015|ref=theories_text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theorist of scholarly editing, Greetham has taken up a middle ground between [[intentionalist]] positions like that of [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] and the [[social textual criticism]] of [[Jerome McGann]], maintaining the goal of establishing an authoritative text while allowing the possibility that multiple authorized versions can exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathijsen|first1=Marita|title=The Concept of Authorisation|journal=Text|date=2002|volume=14|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later work, Greetham has moved away from the idea that an editor can establish a "psychic" connection with the author through which he or she can determine the author's true intentions, instead seeing editing as an occasion for reflections on the ideology underlying scholarly practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Marta|title=Signals from a Distance: Editing, Telepathy, Elegy|journal=Textual Cultures|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Textual Scholarship==

Greetham was one of the founders of the Society for Textual Scholarship and served as the Society's President from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Society for Textual Scholarship|journal=Textual Cultures|date=Spring 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=166–169|jstor=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166|ref=soc_text|doi=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1979, the Society provides an interdisciplinary forum for presentation of research in a number of textual disciplines. Notable past members have included [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Fredson Bowers]], and [[Jerome McGann]].

'''Digital sociology''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that focuses on understanding the use of [[digital media]] as part of everyday life, and how these various technologies contribute to patterns of human behavior, social relationships and [[Self-concept|concepts of the self]].

The first scholarly article to have the term 'digital sociology' in the title appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Wynn, J. (2009) Digital sociology: emergent technologies in the field and the classroom. ''Sociological Forum'', 24(2), 448--456&lt;/ref&gt; The author reflected on the ways in which digital technologies may influence both sociological research and teaching. In 2010, 'digital sociology' was described, by [https://about.me/rrneal Richard Neal], in terms of bridging the growing academic focus with the increasing interest from global business through the publication of the book, ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization''.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, R. (2010) ''Expanding Sentience: Introducing Digital Sociology for moving beyond Buzz Metrics in a World of Growing Online Socialization.'' Lulu&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2013 that the first purely academic book tackling the subject of 'digital sociology' was published. The edited collection of review chapters addressed a range of topics, including concepts and experiences of space, community, intimacy, the role played by gender and social inequalities in people's use of digital technologies and the impact of these technologies in education, health, finance and war reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Orton-Johnson, K. and Prior, N. (eds) (2013) ''Digital Sociology: Critical Perspectives''. Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; The first sole-authored book entitled ''Digital Sociology'' was published in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2015) ''Digital Sociology''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The first academic conference on "Digital Sociology" was held in New York, NY in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, J., Gregory, K., Cottom, T.M. Digital Sociology MiniConference, organized in conjunction with the Eastern Sociological Society meetings, February 27–28, 2015. http://digsoc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/conference-papers-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ‘digital sociology’ has not yet fully entered the cultural lexicon, sociologists have engaged in research related to the internet since its inception. These sociologists have addressed many social issues relating to [[online communities]], [[cyberspace]] and cyber-identities. This and similar research has attracted many different names such as 'cybersociology', [[sociology of the Internet|'the sociology of the internet']], 'the sociology of online communities', 'the sociology of social media', 'the sociology of cyberculture' or something else again.

Digital sociology differs from these terms in that it is wider in its scope, addressing not only the internet or [[cyberculture]] but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century. Since the internet has become more pervasive and linked with everyday life, references to the 'cyber' in the social sciences seems now to have been replaced by the 'digital'. 'Digital sociology' is related to other sub-disciplines such as [[digital humanities]] and [[digital anthropology]]. It is beginning to supersede and incorporate the other titles above, as well as including the newest [[Web 2.0]] digital technologies into its purview, such as [[wearable technology]], [[augmented reality]], [[smart objects]], the [[Internet of Things]] and [[big data]].

== Aspects ==

Four aspects of digital sociology have been identified:&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/handle/2123/8621 "Digital sociology: an introduction"]. Sydney: University of Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Professional digital practice''': using digital media tools for professional purposes: to build networks, construct an e-profile, publicise and share research and instruct students.
# '''Sociological analyses of digital use''': researching the ways in which people's use of digital media configures their sense of selves, their embodiment and their social relations.
# '''Digital data analysis''': using digital data for social research, either quantitative or qualitative.
# '''Critical digital sociology''': undertaking reflexive and critical analysis of digital media informed by social and cultural theory.

=== Professional digital practice ===
Although they have been reluctant to use social and other digital media for professional academics purposes, sociologists are slowly beginning to adopt them for teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;Carrigan, M. (2013) [http://markcarrigan.net/2013/06/06/is-the-use-of-sociological-media-becoming-mainstream-within-uk-sociology/ "The emergence of sociological media? Is social media becoming mainstream within UK sociology?"]. Mark Carrigan.net&lt;/ref&gt; An increasing number of sociological blogs are beginning to appear and more sociologists are joining Twitter, for example. Some are writing about the best ways for sociologists to employ social media as part of academic practice (see the [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/ LSE Impact of the Social Sciences website]) and the importance of [[self-archiving]] and making sociological research open access,&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/2013/06/06/opening-up-your-research-self-archiving-for-sociologists/ "Opening up your research: self-archiving for sociologists"]. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt; as well as writing for [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wadewitz, A. (2013) [http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/04/09/change-the-world-edit-wikipedia/ "Wikipedia is pushing the boundaries of scholarly practice but the gender gap must be addressed"]. LSE Impact of the Social Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sociological analyses of digital media use ===
Digital sociologists have begun to write about the use of wearable technologies as part of quantifying the body&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2013) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09581596.2013.794931#.UbrhSpN--V4 "Quantifying the body: monitoring and measuring health in the age of mHealth technologies"]. ''Critical Public Health''&lt;/ref&gt; and the social dimensions of big data and the algorithms that are used to interpret these data.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney-Lippold, J. (2011) [http://lass312a14.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/89244152/A-New-Algorithmic-Identity-Soft-Biopolitcs.pdf "A new algorithmic identity: soft biopolitics and the modulation of control"]. ''Theory, Culture &amp; Society'', 28(6), 164-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have directed attention at the role of digital technologies as part of the surveillance of people's activities, via such technologies as [[CCTV cameras]] and customer loyalty schemes&lt;ref&gt;Graham, S. and Wood, D. (2003) [http://csp.sagepub.com/content/23/2/227.full.pdf+html "Digitizing surveillance: categorization, space, inequality"]. ''Critical Social Policy'', 23(2),227-48.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[mass surveillance]] of the internet that is being conducted by secret services such as the [[National Security Agency|NSA]].&lt;!-- [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)]] --&gt;

The '[[digital divide]]', or the differences in access to digital technologies experienced by certain social groups such as the socioeconomically disadvantaged, those of lower education levels, women and the elderly, has preoccupied many researchers in the social scientific study of digital media. However several sociologists have pointed out that while it is important to acknowledge and identify the [[Structural inequality|structural inequalities]] inherent in differentials in digital technology use, this concept is rather simplistic and fails to incorporate the complexities of access to and knowledge about digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, S. and Tranter, B. (2006) [http://www.uk.sagepub.com/chaston/Chaston%20Web%20readings%20chapters%201-12/Chapter%205%20-%2026%20Willis%20&amp;%20Tranter.pdf "Beyond the 'digital divide': Internet diffusion and inequality in Australia"]. Journal of Sociology, 42(1), 43-59&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the ways in which social media contribute to the development of intimate relationships and concepts of the self. One of the best-known sociologists who has written about social relationships, selfhood and digital technologies is [[Sherry Turkle]].&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1984) [http://monoskop.org/images/5/55/Turkle_Sherry_The_Second_Self_Computers_and_the_Human_Spirit_20th_ed.pdf "The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit"]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (1995) [[Life on the Screen|"Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet"]]. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; In her most recent book Turkle addresses the topic of social media.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. (2011) ''Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other''. New York: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that relationships conducted via these platforms are not as authentic as those encounters that take place "in real life".

Visual media allows the viewer to be a more passive consumer of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynn|first=Jonathan R|title=Digital Sociology: Emergent Technologies in the Field and the Classroom|url=https://www.academia.edu/26473501/Digital_Sociology_Emergent_Technologies_in_the_Field_and_the_Classroom|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are more likely to develop online personas that differ from their personas in the real world. This contrast between the digital world (or 'cyberspace') and the 'real world', however, has been critiqued as ''''digital dualism'''', a concept similar to the '[[The Aura of the Digital|aura of the digital]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, M. (2006) [http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=519 "The Aura of the Digital"], CTheory&lt;/ref&gt; Other sociologists have argued that relationships conducted through digital media are inextricably part of the 'real world'.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgenson, N. (2012) [http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/83 "When atoms meet bits: social media, the mobile web and augmented revolution"]. ''Future Internet'', 4, 83-91&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'augmented reality' has been used as an alternative, to denote the concept of reality as being altered in some way by the use of digital media but not replaced.

The use of social media for [[social activism]] have also provided a focus for digital sociology. For example, numerous sociological articles,&lt;ref&gt;Maireder, A. and Schwartzenegger, C. (2011) A movement of connected individuals: social media in the Austrian student protests 2009. ''Information, Communication &amp; Society'', 15(2), 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, M. (2012) [http://cspo.org/legacy/library/1207150932F24192826YK_lib_LimJoC2012Egypt.pdf "Clicks, cabs, and coffee houses: social media and oppositional movements in Egypt"], 2004-2011. ''Journal of Communication'', 62(2), 231-248.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least one book&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, D. (2013) ''Twitter: Social Communication in the Twitter Age''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; have appeared on the use of such social media platforms as Twitter, [[YouTube]] and [[Facebook]] as a means of conveying messages about activist causes and organizing political movements.&lt;!-- [[Social movement theory]] / Digital social movement theory --&gt;

Research has also been done on how racial minorities and the use of technology by racial minorities and other groups.  These "'''digital practice'''" studies explore the ways in which the practices that groups adopt when using new technologies mitigate or reproduce social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2014) ''The Digital Practices of African Americans: An Approach to Studying Cultural Change in the Information Society''. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, R. (2016) "The Content of Our #Characters: Black Twitter as Counterpublic". ''Sociology of Race and Ethnicity'', 2(4) 433 – 449&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital data analysis ===
Digital sociologists use varied approaches to investigating people's use of digital media, both qualitative and quantitative. These include [[Ethnography|ethnographic research]], interviews and surveys with users of technologies, and also the analysis of the data produced from people's interactions with technologies: for example, their posts on social media platforms such as Facebook, [[Reddit]], [[4chan]], [[Tumblr]] and Twitter or their consuming habits on online shopping platforms. Such techniques as [[data scraping]], [[social network analysis]], [[time series analysis]] and [[textual analysis]] are employed to analyse both the data produced as a byproduct of users' interactions with digital media and those that they create themselves. 
For Contents Analysis, in 2008, Yukihiko Yoshida did a study called&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida,Yukihiko, Leni Riefenstahl and German Expressionism: A Study of Visual Cultural Studies Using Transdisciplinary Semantic Space of Specialized Dictionaries ,Technoetic Arts: a journal of speculative research (Editor Roy Ascott),Volume 8, Issue3,intellect,2008&lt;/ref&gt; "Leni Riefenstahl and German expressionism: research in Visual Cultural Studies using the trans-disciplinary semantic spaces of specialized dictionaries." The study took databases of images tagged with connotative and denotative keywords (a search engine) and found Riefenstahl’s imagery had the same qualities as imagery tagged "degenerate" in the title of the exhibition, "Degenerate Art" in Germany at 1937.

The emergence of social media has provided sociologists with a new way of studying social phenomenon. Social media networks, such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], are increasingly being mined for research. For example, Twitter data is easily available to researchers through the Twitter API. Twitter provides researchers with demographic data, time and location data, and connections between users. From these data, researchers gain insight into user moods and how they communicate with one another. Furthermore, social networks can be graphed and visualized.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murthy|first=Dhiraj|last2=Bowman|first2=Sawyer A|date=2014-11-25|title=Big Data solutions on a small scale: Evaluating accessible high-performance computing for social research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053951714559105|journal=Big Data &amp; Society|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|doi=10.1177/2053951714559105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using large data sets, like those obtained from Twitter, can be challenging. First of all, researchers have to figure out how to store this data effectively in a database. Several tools commonly used in [[Big data|Big Data]] analytics are at their disposal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since large data sets can be unwieldy and contain numerous types of data (i.e. photos, videos, GIF images), researchers have the option of storing their data in non-relational databases, such as [[MongoDB]] and [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Processing and querying this data is an additional challenge. However, there are several options available to researchers. One common option is to use a querying language, such as [[Apache Hive|Hive]], in conjunction with [[Apache Hadoop|Hadoop]] to analyze large data sets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The internet and social media have allowed sociologists to study how controversial topics are discussed over time—otherwise known as Issue Mapping.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marres|first=Noortje|last2=Gerlitz|first2=Carolin|date=2015-08-14|title=Interface Methods: Renegotiating Relations between Digital Social Research, STS and Sociology|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-954X.12314|journal=The Sociological Review|language=en|volume=64|issue=1|pages=21–46|doi=10.1111/1467-954x.12314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists can search social networking sites (i.e. Facebook or Twitter) for posts related to a hotly-debated topic, then parse through and analyze the text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sociologists can then use a number of easily accessible tools to visualize this data, such as MentionMapp or Twitter Streamgraph. MentionMapp shows how popular a hashtag is and Twitter Streamgraph depicts how often certain words are paired together and how their relationship changes over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Critical digital sociology ===
This aspect of digital sociology is perhaps what makes it distinctive from other approaches to studying the digital world. In adopting a critical reflexive approach, sociologists are able to address the implications of the digital for sociological practice itself. It has been argued that digital sociology offers a way of addressing the changing relations between social relations and the analysis of these relations, putting into question what social research is, and indeed, what sociology is now as social relations and society have become in many respects mediated via digital technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Marres. N. (2013) [http://www.csisponline.net/2013/01/21/what-is-digital-sociology "What is digital sociology?"] CSISP Online&lt;/ref&gt;

How should sociology respond to the emergent forms of both 'small data' and 'big data' that are collected in vast amounts as part of people's interactions with digital technologies and the development of data industries using these data to conduct their own social research? Does this suggest that a "coming crisis in empirical sociology" might be on the horizon?&lt;ref&gt;Savage, M. and Burrows, R. (2007) [https://www.gold.ac.uk/media/coming-crisis-empirical-sociology.pdf "The coming crisis of empirical sociology"]. ''Sociology'', 41(5),885-889&lt;/ref&gt; How are the identities and work practices of sociologists themselves becoming implicated within and disciplined by digital technologies such as [[Citation impact|citation metrics]]?&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, R. (2012) Living with the h-index? Metric assemblages in the contemporary academy. ''The Sociological Review'', 60(2), 355—72.&lt;/ref&gt;

These questions are central to critical digital sociology, which reflects upon the role of sociology itself in the analysis of digital technologies as well as the impact of digital technologies upon sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Lupton, D. (2012) [http://simplysociology.wordpress.com/category/digital-sociology/page/2/ "Digital sociology part 3: digital research"]. This Sociological Life&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public digital sociology ===
{{main|Public sociology}}
Public sociology using digital media is a form of public sociology that involves publishing sociological materials in online accessible spaces and subsequent interaction with publics in these spaces. This has been referred to as "e-public sociology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher J. Schneider]] (2014). Social Media and e-Public Sociology. In Ariane Hanemaayer and Christopher J. Schneider, editors, The Public Sociology Debate: Ethics and Engagement, University of British Columbia Press: 205-224&lt;/ref&gt;

Social media has changed the ways the public sociology was perceived and given rise to digital evolution in this field. The vast open platform of communication has provided opportunities for sociologists to come out from the notion of small group sociology or publics to a vast audience.

Blogging was the initial social media platform being utilized by sociologists. Sociologists like Eszter Hargittai, Chris Bertram, and Kieran Healy were few amongst those who started using blogging for sociology. New discussion groups about sociology and related philosophy were the consequences of social media impact. The vast number of comments and discussions thus became a part of understanding sociology. One of such famous groups was [http://crookedtimber.org/ Crooked Timber]. Getting feedback on such social sites is faster and impactful. Disintermediation, visibility, and measurement are the major effects of e-public sociology. Other social media tools like Twitter and Facebook also became the tools for a sociologist. [https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/soc-social-media.pdf "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media"].&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Kieran. "Public Sociology in the Age of Social Media." Berkeley Sociology Journal (2015): 1-16. APA&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''', Its Origins and Character'', is a 1953 book on [[art history]] by [[Erwin Panofsky]], derived from the 1947–48 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]. The book had a wide impact&lt;ref&gt;Shone, Richard and Stonard, John-Paul, eds. ''The Books That Shaped Art History: From Gombrich and Greenberg to Alpers and Krauss'', chapter 7. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; on studies of [[Renaissance art]] and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] in particular, but also studies in [[iconography]], art history, and [[intellectual history]] in general. The book is particularly well-known for its iconographic treatment of [[Jan Van Eyck|Van Eyck's]] ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' as a kind of marriage contract, a hypothesis advanced by Panofsky as early as 1934. The book remains influential despite its reliance on black-and-white reproductions of paintings, which led to some errors of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;''The Books That Shaped Art History'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

''Early Netherlandish Painting'' shares its title with the [[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|comprehensive, 14-volume survey]] by [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Max J. Friedländer]], a fact obliquely acknowledged at the beginning of the preface.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Netherlandish Painting'', p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eidophusikon.jpg|thumb|250px|Eidophusikon]]
The '''''Eidophusikon''''' ({{lang-el|Ειδωφυσικον}}) was a piece of [[art]], no longer extant, thought up by the English actor [[David Garrick]] and created by 18th-century [[France|French]] painter [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. It opened in [[Leicester Square]] in February 1781.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Described by the media of his day as "Moving Pictures, representing Phenomena of Nature", the ''Eidophusikon'' can be considered an early form of [[movie making]]. The effect was achieved by mirrors and pulleys.

A small exhibition centered on his Eidophusikon can currently be seen at [[The Huntington Library]].

A full Eidophusikon, described also as a "small, mechanical theatre", was exhibited from June to November 2014 at the exhibition "Underworlds" (Unterwelten) in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]].

The Eidophusikon consisted of a large-scale miniature theatre that let experiment the try of creating the perfect illusion of the moving nature: sunrise scenes, sunsets, moonlight images, storms, and volcanoes from all over the world with sound and music effects. The sound and light effects of the Eidophusikon, compared with the shows seen until that time, were specially inventive by their realism.

== Creation ==
The need to build an element such as this was born from December 1811, when one of the great calamities of American history took place: one of its most important theaters, the Richmond Theater, was burned completely. The fire burned 72 spectators during the first act of a play and expanded rapidly across all locations, causing people to leap into decorations that had not yet been consumed. This made David Garrick think that people could interfere with the theater, and not only was it something that was going to be seen sitting.

== Reconstructions ==
The first reconstruction was the year 2004 by Wolkenbilder at the Altonaer Museum Exhibition (cloud images) at Jenisch Has, Hamburg. It was a full-sized theater with two scenes on the basis of Loutherbourg: from dawn to sunset over Royal Naval College in Greenwich and a Mediterranean scene with a lighthouse, moonlight, storms and wrecks.

The second Eidophusikon was created in 2005 by the Yale Center for British Art, New Connecticut and California Huntington Library by the English painter Gainsborough for his collection 'Sensation and sensibility. Gainsborough was a great admirer of Eidophusikon. This full-size version was built in conjunction with Kevin Derkin and the Yale technical department under Rick Johnson. The scene, this time, was 'Satan and the Creation of the Pandemonium Palace in Hell', by Milton of the "lost paradise."

In 2006, a third Eidophusikon was created by Robert Poulter for the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco. Another Mediterranean scene was created with a volcano, the moonlight, the storm and the shipwreck. This Eidophusikon is part and the permanent collection of the museum.

'''Emotional and behavioral disorders''' ('''EBD'''; also known as '''behavioural and emotional disorders''' ([[ICD-10]]);&lt;ref name="ICD-10-web-EN"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/F90 |title=International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision (ICD-10): Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence (F90–F98) |date=2016 |access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICD-10-Clinical"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Clinical descriptions and diagnostic guidelines |place=[[Geneva]] |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''emotional disturbance''' or '''serious emotional disturbance''') refer to a disability classification used in educational settings that allows educational institutions to provide [[special education]] and related services to students that have poor social or academic adjustment that cannot be better explained by biological abnormalities or a [[developmental disability]]. 

The classification is often given to students, after conducting a Functional Behavior Analysis. These students need individualized [[classroom management|behavior supports]] such as a Behavior Intervention Plan, to receive a [[free and appropriate public education]]. They would not be eligible for an [[individualized education program]] under another disability category of the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA).

==Criteria==
The IDEA requires that a student must exhibit one or more of the following characteristics over a long duration, and to a marked degree that adversely affects their educational performance, to receive an EBD classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/categories/|title=Categories of Disability Under IDEA|work=parentcenterhub.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Difficulty to learn that cannot be explained by intellectual, sensory, or health factors.
* Difficulty to build or maintain satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
* Inappropriate types of behavior (acting out against self or others) or feelings (expresses the need to harm self or others, low self-worth, etc.) under normal circumstances.
* A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.
* A tendency to develop physical symptoms or fears associated with personal or school problems.

The term "EBD" includes students diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], but does not apply to students who are "socially maladjusted", unless it is determined that they also meet the criteria for an EBD classification.

===Criticisms===
Providing or failing to provide an EBD classification to a student may be controversial, as the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] does not clarify which children would be considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an [[individualized education program]] under an EBD classification. Some states do not allow students with a psychiatric diagnosis of [[conduct disorder]] to receive additional educational services under an EBD classification,&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp/ |title=Students with Emotional Disturbance: Eligibility and Characteristics |work=cecp.air.org |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115029/http://cecp.air.org/resources/20th/eligchar.asp |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; although many students with an EBD classification do meet the diagnostic criteria for various [[disruptive behavior disorder]]s, including [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), or [[conduct disorder]] (CD).&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Additionally, students considered "socially maladjusted", but ineligible for an EBD classification (i.e., students diagnosed with [[conduct disorder]]), often receive better educational services in special education classrooms or alternative schools with high structure, clear rules, and consistent consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behavior-consultant.com/social.htm|title=Social Maladjustment|work=behavior-consultant.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they would not receive in general education settings. The ambiguous guidelines for determining what students are "socially maladjusted", but without EBD, may cause many students that would benefit from special education services to receive less effective educational services.

==Student characteristics==
Students with EBD are a diverse population, and have a wide range of intellectual and academic abilities. Males, African-Americans, and economically disadvantaged students are overrepresented in the EBD population, and students with EBD are more likely to live in single-parent homes, foster homes, or other non-traditional living situations.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; They also tend to have low rates of positive social interactions with students and peers in instructional contexts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wehby|first1=Joseph|last2=Symons|first2=F.|last3=Shores|first3=R. E.|title=A descriptive analysis of aggressive behavior in classrooms for children with emotional and behavioral disorders|journal=Behavioral Disorders|date=1995|volume=20|pages=87–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many have one or more comorbid psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; Students with EBD are often categorized as [[internalizing disorder|"internalizers"]] (e.g., have poor [[self-esteem]], or are diagnosed with an [[anxiety disorder]] or [[mood disorder]]) or [[Emotional and behavioral disorders#Internalizing and externalizing behavior|"externalizers"]] (e.g., disrupt classroom instruction, or are diagnosed with [[disruptive behavior disorders]] such as [[oppositional defiant disorder]] and [[conduct disorder]]). Male students may be overrepresented in the EBD population because they tend to exhibit disruptive externalizing behavior that interferes with classroom instruction, whereas females more commonly exhibit internalizing behavior that does not interfere with classroom instruction;&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt; thus, teachers may refer males for special education services more often than females. Students with EBD are also at an increased risk for [[learning disabilities]], [[school dropout]], [[substance abuse]], and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

==Internalizing and externalizing behavior==
A person with EBD with [[internalizing disorder|"internalizing" behavior]] may have poor [[self-esteem]], suffer from [[depression (mood)|depression]], experience [[anhedonia|loss of interest]] in social, academic, and other life activities, and may exhibit [[non-suicidal self-injury]] or [[substance abuse]]. Students with internalizing behavior may also have a diagnosis of [[separation anxiety]] or another [[anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[specific phobia|specific]] or [[social phobia]], [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[panic disorder]], and/or an [[eating disorder]]. Some research suggests students with EBD with internalizing behavior are underdiagnosed; teachers are more likely to write referrals for students that are overtly disruptive, and screening tools to detect students with high levels of internalizing behavior are not sensitive and are rarely used in practice.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

Students with EBD with "[[Externalizing Disorders|externalizing]]" behavior may be aggressive, noncompliant, extroverted, or disruptive, and generally "act out" inappropriately. Students with EBD that show externalizing behavior are often diagnosed with [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[oppositional defiant disorder]] (ODD), [[conduct disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]; however, this population can also include typically developing children that have [[operant conditioning|learned]] to exhibit externalizing behavior for various reasons (e.g., [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|escape from academic demands]] or [[Reinforcement#Positive and negative|access to attention]]). These students often have difficulty inhibiting emotional responses resulting from anger, frustration, and disappointment, and may exhibit behaviors such as insulting, provoking, threatening, bullying, cursing, and fighting, along with other forms of aggression; noncompliance with and disrespect towards teachers and other authority figures is also common. Male students with EBD exhibit externalizing behavior more often than their female counterparts.&lt;ref name="cecp.air.org"/&gt;

{{Fantasy}}
A '''fantasy world''' is a human conceived world created in fictional media, such as literature, film or games.  Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology&lt;ref&gt;Brian Attebery, ''The Fantasy Tradition in American Literature'', pp. 166–7, {{ISBN|0-253-35665-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes, either a [[historical]] or [[futuristic]] theme. Some worlds may be a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] connected to [[Earth]] via magical portals or items (like [[Narnia]]); a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future (like [[Middle-earth]]); or an entirely independent world set in another part of the universe (like the [[Star Wars]] Galaxy).&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Imaginary lands", pp. 495–5 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fantasy worlds draw heavily on real world history, geography, sociology, mythology, and folklore.

==Plot function==
The setting of a fantasy work is often of great importance to the plot and characters of the story. The setting itself can be imperiled by the evil of the story, suffer a calamity, and be restored by the transformation the story brings about.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Land", p. 558 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories that use the setting as merely a backdrop for the story have been criticized for their failure to use it fully.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Fantasyland", p. 341 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the land itself is not in danger, it is often used symbolically, for thematic purposes, and to underscore moods.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moorcock, Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy pp. 72–3 {{ISBN|1-932265-07-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Early fantasy worlds appeared as fantasy ''lands'', part of the same planet but separated by geographical barriers.  For example, [[Land of Oz|Oz]], though a fantasy world in every way, is described as part of this world.&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Oz", p. 739 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although medieval peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that, for example, an [[ogre]] could live a day's travel away, distant continents were necessary from the [[Renaissance]] onwards for such fantastic speculation to be plausible, until finally, further exploration rendered all such terrestrial fantasy lands implausible.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], "On Science Fiction", ''Of Other Worlds'', p. 68 {{ISBN|0-15-667897-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even within the span of mere decades, Oz, which had been situated in a desert in the United States when first written about in 1900,&lt;ref name="John Clute p 739"/&gt; was relocated to a spot in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p. 99, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the fantasy land/world concept can be seen in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (''Arabian Nights''), where places of which little was known, but where the occurrence of marvels was thus more credible, had to be set "long ago" or "far away". This is a process that continues, and finally culminates in the fantasy world having little connection, if any, to actual times and places.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Arabian fantasy", p 52 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent example of a fantasy land with definite connections to the actual world is Austin Tappan Wright's [[Islandia (novel)|Islandia]]. Islandia's remoteness and aura of mystery, as well as its preservation of an [[Arcadia (utopia)|arcadian]] society, are explained by means of a law which allows only limited contact with foreigners.

[[Dream world (plot device)|Dream frames]] were also once common for encasing the fantasy world with an explanation of its marvels. Such a dream frame was added to the story of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' for the movie version; in the book, Oz is clearly defined as an actual place.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 96, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[H.P. Lovecraft]] made active use of the dream frame, creating elaborate geographies accessible to humans only when they were asleep and dreaming. These dream-settings have been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;J.R.R. Tolkien, "On Fairy-Stories", p. 14, ''The Tolkien Reader'', Ballantine Books, New York 1966&lt;/ref&gt; and are far less frequent today.

This change is part of a general trend toward more self-consistent and substantive fantasy worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p 210 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has also altered the nature of the plots; earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance, and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures, and later works more often feature characters in a social web, where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p. 211–2 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common elements==
The most common fantasy world is one based on medieval Europe, and has been since [[William Morris]] used it in his early fantasy works, such as ''[[The Well at the World's End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Waggoner, ''The Hills of Faraway: A Guide to Fantasy'', p 37, {{ISBN|0-689-10846-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and particularly since the 1954 publication of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Such a world is often called "pseudo-medieval"—particularly when the writer has snatched up random elements from the era, which covered a thousand years and a continent, and thrown them together without consideration for their compatibility, or even introduced ideas not so much based on the medieval era as on [[Medievalism|romanticized views]] of it. When these worlds are copied not so much from history as from other fantasy works, there is a heavy tendency to uniformity and lack of realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Grant, "[http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/gulliver.htm Gulliver Unravels: Generic Fantasy and the Loss of Subversion]"&lt;/ref&gt; The full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be uncompromisingly feudal-based, or evil empires or [[oligarchies]], usually corrupt, while there was far more variety of rule in the actual Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Alec Austin, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020624/epic_fantasy.shtml "Quality in Epic Fantasy"]&lt;/ref&gt; Fantasy worlds also tend to be medieval in economy, and disproportionately [[pastoral]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jane Yolen]], "Introduction" p viii ''After the King: Stories in Honor of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ed, Martin H. Greenberg, {{ISBN|0-312-85175-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Careful world-building plus meticulous attention to detail is often cited as the reason why certain fantasy works are deeply convincing and contain a magical sense of place.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p. 113, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Heavy and faithful use of real world setting for inspiration, as in [[Barry Hughart]]'s ''[[Bridge of Birds]]'', clearly derived from China, or [[Lloyd Alexander]]'s use of real world cultures such as Welsh for ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' or Indian for ''[[The Iron Ring]]'', make the line between fantasy worlds and [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate histories]] fuzzy. The use of cultural elements, and still more history and geography, from actual settings pushes a work toward alternative history.

Conversely, the creation by an author of an imaginary country—such as [[Ruritania]] or [[Graustark]]—does not automatically transform that imaginary country into a fantasy world, even if the location would be impossible in reality owing to a lack of land to contain it; but such [[Ruritanian romance]]s may be pushed toward the category of fantasy worlds by the introduction of, say, witches and wise women, where it is not clear if their magic is effectual.&lt;ref&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 6 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lin Carter in ''[[Imaginary Worlds – the Art of Fantasy|Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy]]'', fantasy worlds, by their nature, contain some element of [[magic (paranormal)]]. This element may be the creatures in it ([[dragon]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[genie]]s and so on) or the magical abilities of the people inhabiting the world. These are often drawn from [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], frequently that of the historical country also used for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Lin, ''Imaginary Worlds, the Art of Fantasy''. Ballantine, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructed worlds==
{{further|Constructed world}}
[[File:Tolkien The two trees.jpg|right|thumb|The Creation of the Two Trees figured in Tolkien's fantasy world, [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]]]]
Fantasy worlds created through a process called [[world building]] are known as a [[constructed world]]. Constructed worlds elaborate and make self-consistent the setting of a fantasy work. World building often relies on materials and concepts taken from the real world.

Despite the use of magic or other fantastic elements such as dragons, the world is normally presented as one that would function normally, one in which people could actually live, making economic, historical, and ecological sense. It is considered a flaw to have, for example, pirates living in lands far from trade routes, or to assign prices for a night's stay in an inn that would equate to several years’ income.

Furthermore, the fantastic elements should ideally operate according to self-consistent rules of their own; for example, if wizards' spells sap their strength, a wizard who does not appear to suffer this must either be putting up a facade, or have an alternative explanation. This distinguishes fantasy worlds from surrealism and even from such dream worlds as are found in ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''.

===Examples===
*[[L. Frank Baum]] created the [[Land of Oz]] for his novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its original sequels. He was one of the few authors before Tolkien to use consistent internal geographies and histories to enrich his world.
*[[C. S. Lewis]], author of ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', set that series' novels mostly in a magical land called [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. Lewis was a colleague of Tolkien, and their fictional worlds share several key elements.
*[[Terry Pratchett]] created [[Discworld (world)|Discworld]], a large disc resting on the backs of four huge elephants, which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle, as it slowly swims through space.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] created [[Middle-earth]], possibly the most famous fantasy world. He introduced several revolutionary concepts to fantasy fiction and popularized the idea of intricately detailed fantasy worlds. He wrote at some length about the process, which he called "sub-creation". Middle-earth is intended to be Earth's [[Old World]] in a fictional ancient era.
*[[George R. R. Martin]] created a [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|fictional world]] for his novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were deliberately not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were unilluminated about distant places. Most of the story is set in the western continent of Westeros, though some is set in the Eastern continent Essos. The Southern continent of Sothoryos is also shown on maps, with a possible fourth continent, Ulthos, to its East. A map of the world is shown in the [[Game of Thrones title sequence|title sequence]] of the [[HBO]] TV adaptation, ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Fairytale and comic fantasy==
[[Fairytale fantasy]] may ignore the normal world-building in order to present a world operating by the same logic as the fairytales from which they are derived, though other works in this subgenre develop their worlds fully.  [[Comic fantasy]] may ignore all possible logic in search of humor, particularly if it is parodying other fantasies' faulty world-building, as in [[Diana Wynne Jones]]'s ''[[Dark Lord of Derkholm]]'', or the illogic of the setting is integral to the comedy, as in [[L. Sprague de Camp]]'s ''[[Solomon's Stone]]'', where the fantasy world is populated by the heroic and glamorous figures that people daydream about being, resulting in a severe shortage of workers in the more mundane, day-to-day industries. Most other [[Fantasy subgenres|subgenres of fantasy]] suffer if the world-building is neglected.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== The retreat of magic ==
Rather than creating their own fantasy world, many authors choose to set their novels in Earth's past. In order to explain the absence of miraculous elements, authors may introduce "a retreat of magic" (sometimes called "thinning") that explains why the [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and other fantastic elements no longer appear:&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Thinning", p. 942 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the destruction of the [[One Ring]] defeated Sauron, but also destroyed the power of the [[Three Rings]] of the [[elves]], resulting in them sailing to the West at the end of the story. A [[contemporary fantasy]] necessarily takes place in what purports to be the real world, and not a fantasy world. It may, however, include references to such a retreat. [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' explains that wizards eventually decided to conceal all magic creatures and artifacts from non-magic users.

==Role-playing games==
''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'', the first major [[role-playing game]], has created several detailed and commercially successful fantasy worlds (called "[[campaign setting]]s"), with established characters, locations, histories, and sociologies. The [[Forgotten Realms]] is perhaps the most extensively developed of these worlds. These elements of detail can be a large part of what attracts people to RPGs.

Many established fantasy writers have also derided ''Dungeons and Dragons'' and the fantasy fiction it has inspired due to its influencing new writers toward reading the ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons [[Monster Manual]]'' instead of studying the original literature and mythology from which modern fantasy literature has sprung.

Due to the fuzzy boundary between fantasy and [[science fiction]], it is similarly difficult to make a hard-and-fast distinction between "fantasy worlds" and [[planets in science fiction]]. For example, the worlds of [[Barsoom]], [[Darkover]], [[Gor]], and the [[Witch World]] combine elements of both genres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3621">'''Foregrounding''' is the practice of making something stand out from the surrounding words or images.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It is "the 'throwing into relief' of the linguistic sign against the background of the norms of ordinary language."&lt;ref&gt;Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd. p157&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first associated with Paul Garvin in the 1960s, who used it as a translation of the [[Czech (language)|Czech]] ''aktualisace'' (literally "to actualise"), borrowing the terms from the [[Prague school]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Procházka (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c9a9nhXQUKEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Prague%20School%20and%20Theories%20of%20Structure&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Prague School and Theories of Structure]'' p.196 footnote 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of foregrounding: [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and deviation. Parallelism can be described as unexpected regularity, while deviation can be seen as unexpected irregularity.&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. (1969) ''A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry''. Longman&lt;/ref&gt; As the definition of foregrounding indicates, these are relative concepts. Something can only be unexpectedly regular or irregular within a particular context. This context can be relatively narrow, such as the immediate textual surroundings (referred to as a 'secondary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;) or wider such as an entire genre (referred to as a 'primary norm'&lt;ref&gt;Leech, G. and Short, M. (2007) ''Style in Fiction'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For example, the last line of a poem with a consistent metre may be foregrounded by changing the number of syllables it contains. This would be an example of a deviation from a secondary norm. In the following poem by [[E. E. Cummings]],&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Wales, K. (2001) ''Dictionary of Stylistics'' (2nd ed.) Pearson Education Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; there are two types of deviation:

:light’s lives lurch

:a once world quickly from rises

:army the gradual of unbeing fro{{Clarify|date=June 2016}}

:on stiffening greenly air and to ghosts go

:drift slippery hands tease slim float twitter faces

:Only stand with me, love! against these its

:until you are, and until i am dreams...

Firstly, most of the poem deviates from 'normal' language (primary deviation). In addition, there is secondary deviation in that the penultimate line is unexpectedly different from the rest of the poem. [[Nursery rhyme]]s, adverts and [[slogan]]s often exhibit parallelism in the form of repetition and [[rhyme]], but parallelism can also occur over longer texts. For example, jokes are often built on a mixture of parallelism and deviation. They often consist of three parts or characters. The first two are very similar (parallelism) and the third one starts out as similar, but our expectations are thwarted when it turns out different in end (deviation).

Foregrounding can occur on all levels of language&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, p (2004) "Stylistics, A Resource Book". London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; ([[phonology]], [[graphology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[pragmatics]]). It is generally used to highlight important parts of a text, to aid memorability and/or to invite interpretation.

'''Group sex''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] involving more than two participants.  Group sex can occur between people of all [[sexual orientation]]s and genders.  Group sex also occurs in populations of non-human animals such as [[Bonobo#Sexual social behavior|bonobo]] apes and [[chimpanzee]]s.

Group sex most commonly takes place in a private '''sex party''' or semi-public '''[[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger gathering]]''', but may also take place at [[massage parlor]]s or [[brothel]]s or, in some jurisdictions, at purpose-built locations such as [[sex club]]s. In places where [[Polyamory|non-monogamous sex]] is [[taboo]] or illegal, group sex may take place in private or clandestine locations including homes, [[hotel]] rooms, or private clubs.

[[Sexual fantasy|Fantasies]] of group sex are extremely common among both men and women, and group sex is a subgenre in [[pornographic film]]s.

==Terms==

[[File:KamaSutra25.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration from the Kama Sutra]]
In principle, any sexual behavior performed by more than two people can be referred to as group sex, but various terms are used to describe particular acts or combinations of people.  Many swingers argue that non-swingers have conflated the terms because of lack of understanding and that there are distinct differences among the terms with specific meanings as to number, intent, sexual orientation, and familiarity of the persons involved.
;'''[[Circle jerk (sexual practice)|Circle jerk]]''': Group [[masturbation]] among men, usually sitting in somewhat of a circle formation.
;'''[[Daisy chain (sex)|Daisy chain]]''': Group of participants perform [[cunnilingus]] or [[fellatio]] on each other in a circular formation, permitting each participant to both give and receive oral sex simultaneously.
;'''[[Gang bang]]''': A number of people performing sex acts on one person, either in turn or at the same time.
;'''[[Threesome]]''' or '''three-way''': Three people all having sexual relations, not necessarily simultaneously. Not to be confused with [[ménage à trois]] (literally, "household of three").
;[[Foursome (group sex)|Foursome]] or '''four-way''': Sex between four people. Not to be confused with [[ménage à quatre]] (literally, "household of four").
;'''[[Double Penetration|Double penetration]]''': When a person is entered or penetrated in the vagina and/or anus by two people at the same time. This usually is when one enters the anus while another enters the vagina, although it does also refer to two simultaneous penetrations in the same orifice.
;'''Spintrian''': Term used by [[Suetonius]] to describe sexual group practices indulged in by the emperor [[Tiberius]] on [[Capri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title=Manual of classical erotology ([[De figuris Veneris]]) | first=Friedrich Karl | last=Forberg | authorlink=Friedrich Karl Forberg | publisher=Medical Press of New York | year=1963 | page=233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;'''Monogamous Group Sex''' or '''Same Room Sex''' (a.k.a. Soft Swapping): Couples engaging in sexual activity in the same room but in separate pairs, without any [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swapping of partners]] or other major sexual activity between couples.

==Prevalence==
Fantasies of group sex are extremely common among both men and women. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Many forms of sexual behavior were reported by Kinsey's subjects, but the official Kinsey Reports web site does not mention threesomes or group sex in the summary of Kinsey's findings.

[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (30).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of a foursome by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (25).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illustration of an orgy by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
A sex party is a gathering at which [[human sexual behavior|sexual activity]] takes place. Sex parties may be organized to enable people to engage in [[casual sexual activity]] or for [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinging couples]] or people interested in group sex to meet, but any gathering where sexual activity is anticipated can be called a sex party.

Sex parties, under various names, have been a common focus of [[moral panic]]s fed by media reports claiming that such parties are prevalent, or growing in prevalence, especially among teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/love-sex/is-your-teen-sending-you-secret-sex-sgnals-2235874.html|title=Is your teen sending secret sex signals?|last=Daly|first=Susan|date=Jun 26, 2010|work=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are number of types of sex parties:

===Swinger party/gathering===
A [[Swinging (sexual practice)|swinger]] party or partner-swapping party is a gathering at which individuals or couples in a [[committed relationship]] can engage in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

 |accessdate=2010-01-24
 |url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume3/swing/body.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Swinging takes place in various contexts, ranging from a spontaneous sexual activity at an informal social gathering of friends to a regular social gathering in a [[sex club]] (or swinger club) or residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swinger parties may involve various group sex activities.  Partners can engage in [[sexual intercourse|penetrative sex]], known as "full swap", or choose to "soft swap" in which they engage only in [[non-penetrative sex]]. New swinging couples often choose a soft swap before they are comfortable with a full swap, although many couples stay soft swap for personal reasons.&lt;ref name="What Is a Swinger?"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://swingersocial.com/swinger-blog/?page_id=13 | title=What is a Swinger? | publisher=The Swinger Blog | date=Sep 2011 | accessdate=April 15, 2012 | author=Wojick, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Soft swinging" is when a couple engages in sexual activities with only each other while other couples perform sex acts in the immediate vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingersocial.com/lifestyle-sex-defintions/s|title=SWINGERS DEFINITIONS - Swinger words that begin with a S|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technically this is a form of exhibitionism rather than "group sex" per se.

===Rainbow party===
A [[rainbow party (sexuality)|rainbow party]] is a baseless [[urban legend]] spread from the early 2000s. At these events, allegedly increasingly popular among adolescents, females wearing various shades of lipstick take turns [[Fellatio|fellating]] males in sequence, leaving multiple colours on their penises,&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;Lewin, Tamar (June 30, 2005). [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/30/fashion/thursdaystyles/30rainbow.html?ex=1157774400&amp;en=ac7b855f4b419e84&amp;ei=5070 "Are These Parties for Real?"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring the fact that in such a situation the colors would blend.

Rainbow parties were covered on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called ''Rainbow Party''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; On May 27, 2010, the television program ''[[The Doctors (2008 TV series)|The Doctors]]'' discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals. However, sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and as such attribute the spread of the stories to a [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

===Orgy===
[[File:Fourgy-Inked-Colour.png|thumb|2 bisexual men and 2 bisexual women ringed in a circlular foursome [[sex position]] performing 4 combinations of oral sex: M-F, F-F, F-M, M-M.]]
An [[orgy]] is a gathering where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained sexual activity or group sex; and a [[bunga bunga]] orgy is an orgy in which participants have [[Aquaphilia (fetish)|sex underwater]], such as in a [[swimming pool]] or a [[hot tub]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-07/silvio-berlusconis-bunga-bunga-parties/ [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]’s "Bunga Bunga Orgies"—Daily Beast 7 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual positions and combinations possible only in group sex==
{{main article|List of sex positions#Group sex|l1=List of sex positions for group sex}}

==Initialism codes==
[[Image:PeterFendi Erotic Scene.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Peter Fendi]] portrayed group sex in [[lithography]], c. 1834]]
A system of [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]]s has evolved to describe the variety of group sex arrangements. These codes can appear in [[erotic literature]] and film descriptions, member profiles in online communities, and personal ads. These codes consist of arrangements of the letters ''M'' (for ''male'') and ''F'' (for ''female''). Adjacent letters are sometimes used to signify sexual contact between the participants represented by those letters, though this does not necessarily mean there is no contact between the other participants. For example, ''MMF'' would signify a [[ménage à trois]] of two men and one woman in which the center male has sexual contact with the other male and the female, and in which it is not specified whether there is contact between the female and the other male. ''MFMF'' (situation pictured in photo to right), on the other hand, implies no same-sex contact.

Variations on this system exist that use case to convey more information. Within the [[BDSM]] and [[Domination &amp; submission (BDSM)|D/s]] subcultures, upper and lower case letters can signify [[dominant (BDSM)|dominant]] (or [[top (BDSM)|top]]) and [[submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] (or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottom]]), respectively.

==Daisy chain==
A daisy chain refers to sexual relations among three or more people, with each person both performing and receiving [[oral sex]] simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/d.htm|title=A dictionary of slang - "D" - Slang and colloquialisms of the UK.|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources consider only groups of five or more people to be a daisy chain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theswinginglife.com/vocabulary.htm |title=theswinginglife.com |publisher= |accessdate=16 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204165221/http://www.theswinginglife.com/vocabulary.htm |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and some define the term to require all participants be female.

Self-evidently, for a closed daisy chain to be entirely [[heterosexual]] there must be an equal number of males and females, making the number of participants even. An odd number of participants would result in two people having to connect "both ways" to complete the chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4493353.stm | title=Are teen sex antics tall tales?| author= | date=28 April 2005 | publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' | accessdate=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1588791,00.html | title=Teenage ‘daisy chain’ sex alert| author=Nigel Hawkes and Sam Lister | date=28 April 2005 | publisher=''[[The Times]]'' | accessdate=2006-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in an “erotic foursome or ''partie-carrée''”,  “two couples ... form a chain or Maltese cross carefully alternating man and woman”.&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

"The matter of ... erotic or spintrian chains ("daisy-chains")",&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; i.e,  "of "spintries" or erotic human chains, ... has been taken to ... permutational development in the appendix of postures to the well-known ''Manual of Classical Erotology'' (1824) of the Fichtean philosopher, [[Friedrich Karl Forberg]], and in a Swedish work, ''Ju fler vi är tillsammans'' (“The More the Merrier”), by a schoolteacher, Ragnar Aaslund, published in 1966 and intended frankly as a manual of group-sex."&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bukkake==
{{main article|Bukkake}}
[[Bukkake]] is a group sex practice where multiple men [[ejaculation|ejaculate]] onto the face or body of a female or male subject. At the end of the process, the subject may drink the [[semen]], called [[gokkun]]. Its first filming is credited to adult filmmaker [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]] in 1998. Bukkake originally became a [[pornography]] trend because of the mandatory porn [[pixelization|mosaic]] in Japan. Since the directors could not show penetration they had to figure out new, visually appealing ways to approach sex acts that would satisfy the audience without violating Japanese law.

==Health==
As with all sexual activity, the relative risks of group sex depend on the specific activities engaged in, although having a large number of sexual partners increases one's risk of exposure to [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs).

From the mid-1980s there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for the spread of STIs, in particular [[HIV]], and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Proponents point out that venues where group sex takes place often provide [[condom]]s, [[dental dam]]s, [[latex glove]]s, [[sex lubricant|lubricants]] and other items for safer sex. Bathhouses in particular are a major source of safer sex information—they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises.&lt;ref name="Alex%252520Westerfelt%252520"&gt;{{cite web|last=Westerfelt |first=Alex |title=Bathhouse Norms: What goes on in the Bathhouse? |publisher=Healthy Living |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm |accessdate=10 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220130453/http://www.4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharon%252520Bernstein"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Sharon|title=Rising Rate of HIV Infection Renews Bathhouse Debate|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=March 23, 2004|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/23/local/me-bathhouse23 |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS to hold STI testing in gay sauna|date=October 15, 2007|newspaper=Pink News|accessdate=21 October 2009|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5752.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=QX758&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[QX (British magazine)|QX Magazine]] London|date=September 17, 2009|publisher=QX|accessdate=25 October 2009|issue=758|page=44|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqqwpg#/page44|title=QX journal article|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Corporate involvement==
A 1996 [[sexual harassment]] case filed against [[Mitsubishi Motors North America|Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America]] by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) highlighted corporate involvement by Mitsubishi in sex parties arranged by managers and other employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contilaw.com/pleadings/EEOCvMitsubishsi.htm "Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

==In the media==
Sensational media reports about the prevalence of sex parties, especially among young people, appear with some regularity. In the early 1950s, for example, it was alleged that teenage girls, mainly throughout the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] [[United States]] were forming "non-virgin clubs", in which they organized and held [[orgy|sex orgies]] with reports of couples being paired off by drawing numbers from a hat. These claims were investigated and debunked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qy0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CPEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6771,6733980&amp;dq=non+virgin+clubs&amp;hl=en|title='Non-Virgin Club'  New Aspect of Teen-age Sex Misbehavior |last=Morin |first=Relmin |date=August 26, 1951 |work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]] |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, Susan (2007).

Several stories of this type arose in the US in 2003. In New York, rumors began that teens had been taking days off from school to attend "hooky parties" while their parents were at work. One school even suspended a group of girls for allegedly skipping school to attend such a party. They were refused the right to return to school until each had submitted to a medical examination for sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy and school officials were allowed to examine the results. The [[American Civil Liberties Union|New York Civil Liberties Union]] filed a federal lawsuit against the school&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/studentsrights/gen/12776prs20030708.html "NYCLU Sues New York School Officials for Forcing Teen-Age Girls to Undergo Intrusive Medical Exams"] (July 8, 2003). aclu.org. Retrieved February 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the girls and won a settlement which included monetary damages and a change in the school district's policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyclu.org/case/doe-and-roe-v-reid nyclu.org/case/doe-and-roe-v-reid] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707061617/http://www.nyclu.org/case/doe-and-roe-v-reid |date=2010-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar stories concerning teenagers using [[gel bracelet]]s as coupons or signals for sex also arose at the time, with a similar lack of corroborating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara (2003).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24003">'''Health impact assessment''' ('''HIA''') is defined as "a combination of procedures, methods, and tools by
which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the
[[Population health|health of a population]], and the [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of those effects within the population." {{Harv|ECHP|1999|p=4}}

==Overview==
HIA is intended to produce a set of [[evidence]]-based recommendations to inform [[decision-making]] {{Harv|Taylor|Quigley|2002|p=2}}. HIA seeks to maximise the positive [[health]] impacts and minimise the negative health impacts of proposed [[policies]], programs or [[projects]].

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of [[impact assessment]], such as [[environmental impact assessment]] or [[social impact assessment]]. HIA is usually described as following the steps listed, though many practitioners break these into sub-steps or label them differently:

# ''Screening'' - determining if an HIA is warranted/required
# ''Scoping'' - determining which impacts will be considered and the plan for the HIA
# ''Identification and assessment of impacts'' - determining the magnitude, nature, extent and likelihood of potential health impacts, using a variety of different methods and types of information
# ''Decision-making and recommendations'' - making explicit the trade-offs to be made in decision-making and formulating evidence-informed recommendations
# ''Evaluation, monitoring and follow-up'' - process and impact [[evaluation]] of the HIA and the monitoring and management of health impacts

The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve [[community health]] and [[wellbeing]]. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both [[design]] and [[operational]] aspects of a proposal.

HIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential [[health inequalities]] can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project {{Harv|Acheson|1998}}.

A number of manuals and guidelines for HIA's use have been developed (see [[#Further reading|further reading]]).

==Determinants of health==
The proposition that policies, programs and projects have the potential to change the [[determinants of health]] underpins HIA's use. Changes to health determinants then leads to changes in health outcomes or the health status of individuals and communities. The determinants of health are largely [[Social environment|environmental]] and [[social]], so that there are many overlaps with [[environmental impact assessment]] and [[social impact assessment]].

==Levels of HIA==
Three forms of HIA exist:

* Desk-based HIA, which takes 2–6 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides a broad overview of potential health impacts;
* Rapid HIA, which takes approximately 12 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides more detailed information on potential health impacts; and
* Comprehensive HIA, which takes approximately 6 months for one assessor and provides a in-depth assessment of potential health impacts. {{Harv|IMPACT|2004|p=7}}

It has been suggested that HIAs can be prospective (done before a proposal is implemented), concurrent (done while the proposal is being implemented) or retrospective (done after a proposal has been implemented) {{Harv|Taylor|Gorman|Quigley|2003|p=1}}. This remains controversial, however, with a number of HIA practitioners suggesting that concurrent HIA is better regarded as a monitoring activity and that retrospective HIA is more akin to [[evaluation]] with a health focus, rather than being assessment per se {{Harv|Kemm|2003|p=387}}. Prospective HIA is preferred as it allows the maximum practical opportunity to influence decision-making and subsequent health impacts.

==HIA practitioners==
HIA practitioners can be found in the private and public sectors, but are relatively few in number. There are no universally accepted competency frameworks or certification processes. It is suggested that a lead practitioner should have extensive education and training in a health related field, experience of participating in HIAs, and have attended an HIA training course. It has been suggested and widely accepted that merely having a medical or health degree should not be regarded as an indication of competency.

==HIA worldwide==
HIA is currently being used or developed around the world, most notably in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Africa]] and [[Thailand]].

The new safeguard policies and standards of the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), part of the [[World Bank]], were established in 2006. These contain a requirement for health impact assessment in large projects. The standards have been accepted by most of the leading lending banks who are parties to the [[Equator Principles]]. Health impact assessments are becoming routine in many large development projects in both public and private sectors of developing countries. There is also a long history of health impact assessment in the water resource development sector - large dams and irrigation systems.

==HIA conferences==
The [http://www.unige.ch/medecine/eis2013/accueil_en.html 13th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Geneva]] in 2013.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120327020826/http://www.hia2012.ca/en/home.aspx 12th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Québec City]] in 2012.

NASA's IV&amp;V Program was established in 1993 as part of an Agency-wide strategy to provide the highest achievable levels of safety and cost-effectiveness for mission critical software. NASA's IV&amp;V Program was founded under the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/ NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)] as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the [https://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html Space Shuttle Challenger Accident].

Since then, NASA's IV&amp;V Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&amp;V efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, [[Independent Verification and Validation]] (IV&amp;V) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&amp;V. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's primary business, software IV&amp;V, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&amp;V is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report).

NASA's IV&amp;V Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition.

== Affiliations ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is affiliated with [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the ERC is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities.

== Projects ==
NASA's IV&amp;V Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&amp;V, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&amp;V efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&amp;V Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&amp;V on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure.

NASA's IV&amp;V Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality.

== Educator Resource Center ==
Thanks to a grant with [[Fairmont State University]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114223/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/erc_index.html Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center] (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state.  The on-site student outreach program brings over 2,000 youth to the facility annually to experience workshops on robotics, rocketry, aviation, and other STEM topics.  The ERC also runs numerous student STEM competitions in the fields of robotics and aviation.  Starting in 2012 the ERC became the partner for the FIRST LEGO League competition and has overseen a rapid growth in [http://WVRoboticsAlliance.org robotic competitions] that now include over 100 teams at 10 tournaments statewide each fall.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4610">'''The "Simion Stoilow" Institute of [[Mathematics]] of the Romanian Academy''' is a [[research institute]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. 

== History ==

On December 29th, 1945, a group of twenty Romanian mathematicians from various institutions in Bucharest led by [[Dimitrie Pompeiu]] held a meeting at the [[University of Bucharest]] to establish ''The Institute of Mathematical Sciences'' with the aim of "promoting scientific research in mathematical sciences, through communications, talks, publications, congresses, and other means proper to this aim". In January 1946 they registered the Institute as a [[legal person]], specifically an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], with the [[Ilfov County]] Court. On June 9th, 1948 the new [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist regime]] revamped the [[Romanian Academy]] to an institution modeled on the [[Russian_Academy_of_Sciences#The_Academy_of_Sciences_of_the_USSR|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]], increasing by 1966 the number of its member research centers and institutes from 7 to 56. Among the newly created institutes was ''The Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy'', established in 1949 on the basis of the previous NGO with the contribution of [[Simion Stoilow]], one of the twenty founding members in 1945. 

In 1974, [[Zoia Ceauşescu]], a graduate of the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Bucharest, and the daughter of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], the communist head of state, was hired by the institute. Her parents were not happy with her choice in studying Mathematics. Provoked by a verbal disagreement with [[Miron Nicolescu]], in April 1975, Ceauşescu issued a decree to close down the Institute. The ensued disruption of normal scientific life led to eventual departure from Romania of a number of leading mathematicians, including [[Ciprian Foias]] and [[Dan-Virgil Voiculescu]]. In 1978, with contribution from Zoia Ceauşescu some of the former members of the Institute were hired into a newly established Mathematical section of the National Institute Scientific and Technical Creation (''Institutul National pentru Creatie Stiintifica si Tehnica'', INCREST), previously known as the Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Aerospace Research (''Institutul de Mecanica Fluidelor si Cercetari Aerospatiale'', IMFCA), currently a private company (''INAV S.A.''), owned by [[:ro:Serviciile Comerciale Române|Grupul S.C.R.]].

After the [[1989 Romanian Revolution]], the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy (abbreviated IMAR) was re-established on March 8th, 1990 by a decree of the post-Communist Romanian government. It was placed under the Romanian Academy, itself partially reorganized by a decree of the same government on January 5th, 1990.

==Current situation==

Currently, IMAR is the leading Romanian institution in Mathematics research, with about 100 full- and part-time researchers. In 2000-2004, the Institute was a Centre of Excellence in Research of the [[European Commission]]. Since 2008, IMAR has a ''Laboratoire Européen Associé'' collaboration with [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. The Institute publishes two scientific journals (''Mathematical Reports'' and ''Revue roumaine de Mathématiques pures et appliquées''), and organizes many specialized conferences and congresses. Some of its members are well-known mathematicians.

IMAR also hosts the Theta Foundation, a not-for-profit independent publisher of scientific mathematical literature, and SNS-B, an independent postgraduate-level teaching initiative to guide towards research the best Romanian students. 

The Institute is located on Calea Griviţei street in downtown Bucharest in the same building it had before 1975.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7000">'''Intersubjective verifiability''' is the capacity of a concept to be readily and accurately communicated between different individuals ("[[intersubjectivity|intersubjectively]]"), and to be [[reproducibility|reproduced]] under varying circumstances for the purposes of verification. It is a core principle of [[empiricism|empirical]], [[science|scientific]] investigation.&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;''Philosophy of Mind.'' Jaegwon Kim. 2005. Westview Press, p. 75.  ({{ISBN|0813342694}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;
''Verstehen: The Uses of Understanding in the Social Sciences.'' Michael Martin. 2000. Transaction Publishers, p. 64 ({{ISBN|1560004169}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ferment&gt;''Knowledge in Ferment:  Dilemmas in Science, Scholarship and Society.'' Adriaan in ’t Groen, Henk Jan de Jonge,
Eduard Klasen, Hilje Papma, and Piet van Slooten, Eds. 2007. Leiden University Press, p. 265 ({{ISBN|9789087280178}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are areas of belief that do not consistently employ intersubjective verifiability (e.g., many [[religion|religious]] claims), intersubjective verifiability is a near-universal way of arbitrating [[truth]] claims used by people everywhere. In its basic form, it can be found in colloquial expressions, e.g., "[[:wikt:from Missouri|I'm from Missouri. Show me!]]" or "[[:wikt:Seeing is believing|Seeing is believing]]". The scientific principle of replication of findings by investigators other than those that first reported the phenomenon is simply a more highly structured form of the universal principle of intersubjective verifiability.

==Subjective experience==
Each individual is a [[subject (philosophy)|subject]], and must [[subjectivity|subjective]]ly [[experience]] the physical world. Each subject has a different perspective and point of view on various aspects of the world. However, by sharing their comparable experiences intersubjectively, individuals may gain an increasingly similar understanding of the world. In this way, many different subjective experiences can come together to form intersubjective ones that are less likely to be prone to individual bias or gaps in knowledge.

While specific internal experiences are not intersubjectively verifiable, the existence of thematic patterns of internal experience can be intersubjectively verified.  For example, whether or not people are telling what they believe to be the truth when they make claims can only be known by the claimants.  However, we can intersubjectively verify that people almost universally experience discomfort (hunger) when they haven't had enough to eat.  We generally have only a crude ability to compare (measure) internal experiences.

==Congruence and incongruence==
When an external, public [[phenomenon]] is experienced and carefully described (in words or measurements) by one individual, other individuals can see if their experiences of the phenomenon "fit" the description. If they do, a sense of [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] between one subject and another occurs. This is the basis for a definition of what is true that is agreed upon by the involved parties. If the description does not fit the experience of one or more of the parties involved, incongruence occurs instead.

Incongruent contradictions between the experience and descriptions of different individuals can be caused by a number of factors. One common source of incongruence is the inconsistent use of language in the descriptions people use, such as the same words being used differently. Such [[semantics|semantic]] problems require more careful development and use of language.

Incongruence also arises from a failure to describe the phenomena well. In these cases, further development of the description, [[model (abstract)|model]], or [[theory]] used to refer to the phenomena is required.

A third form of incongruence arises when the descriptions do not conform to consensual (i.e., intersubjectively verifiable) experience, such as when the descriptions are faulty, incorrect, wrong, or inaccurate, and need to be replaced by more accurate descriptions, models, or theories.

==Versus belief based on faith==
{{Main|Science and religion}}

The contradiction between the truths derived from intersubjective verification and beliefs based on faith or on [[appeal to authority]] (e.g., many religious beliefs) forms the basis for the [[conflict between religion and science]].&lt;ref name=rel&amp;sci&gt;''The Marriage of Sense and Soul:  Integrating Science and Religion.'' Ken Wilbur. 1998. Random House ({{ISBN|0375500545}})&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been attempts to bring the two into congruence, and the modern, cutting edge of science, especially in [[physics]], seems to many observers to lend itself to a melding of religious experience and intersubjective verification of beliefs.  Some scientists have described religious worldviews—generally of a [[mystical]] nature—consistent with their understanding of science:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle ...

Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind ...

The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. The religion which is based on experience, which refuses dogmatism ...

There remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force beyond anything that we can comprehend is my religion. ([[Albert Einstein]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other scientists, who are committed to basing belief on intersubjective verification, have called for or predicted the development of a religion consistent with science.

&lt;blockquote&gt;A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. Sooner or later, such a religion will emerge. ([[Carl Sagan]], [[Pale Blue Dot]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolutionary epic is probably the best myth we will ever have ...
The true evolutionary epic, retold as poetry, is as intrinsically ennobling as any religious epic. ([[Edward O. Wilson]])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to this apparent overlap between cutting edge science and mystical experience, in recent years, there have been overt efforts to formulate religious belief systems that are built on truth claims based upon intersubjective verifiability, e.g. [[Anthroposophy]], [[Yoism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yoism.org Yoism YOism site]&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Intuition''' is the ability to acquire knowledge without [[proof (truth)|proof]], [[evidence]], or conscious [[reason]]ing, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired.&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/intuition |accessdate= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different writers give the word "intuition" a great variety of different meanings, ranging from direct access to unconscious knowledge, unconscious cognition, inner sensing, inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition and the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.&lt;ref name="AurobindoDef"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=479–480|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenblatt&gt;Intuition and consciousness – Rosenblatt AD, Thickstun JT. Psychoanal Q. 1994 Oct;63(4):696-714.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''intuition'' comes from the Latin verb ''intueri'' translated as "consider" or from the [[Late Middle Ages|late middle English]] word ''intuit'', "to contemplate".&lt;ref name="Webster dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |title=intuition|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intuition |access-date= 22 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Both [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern]] and [[Western philosophy|Western]] philosophers have studied the concept in great detail. [[Philosophy of mind]] deals with the concept of intuition.

===Eastern philosophy===
In the East intuition is mostly intertwined with [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], and various meanings exist from different religious texts.&lt;ref name="eastern"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leaman |first1=Oliver   |title=Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=FLuEAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2014 |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-415-17357-4 |pages=5–40 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
In Hinduism various attempts have been made to interpret the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and other esoteric texts.

For [[Sri Aurobindo]]  intuition comes under the realms of knowledge by identity, he describes the psychological plane in human (often referred to as mana in [[sanskrit]]) has two arbitrary nature, the first being imprinting of psychological experiences which is constructed through sensory information (mind seeking to become aware of external world). The second nature being the action when it seeks to be aware of itself, resulting in humans being aware of their existence or aware of being angry &amp; aware of other emotions, he terms this second nature is knowledge by identity.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=68|ps=}}
He finds that at present as the result of evolution the mind has accustomed itself to depend upon certain physiological functioning and their reactions as its normal means of entering into relation with outer material world, as a result when we seek to know about external world the dominant habit is through arriving at truth about things via as much as senses convey to us.  However, with  knowledge by identity which we currently only gives the awareness of human beings existence can be extended further to outside of ourselves resulting in intuitive knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|pp=69-71|ps=}}

He finds this intuitive knowledge was common to older humans ([[Vedic]]) and later was taken over by [[reason]] which currently organises our perception, thoughts and actions resulting in from Vedic to metaphysical philosophy and later to experimental science. he finds that this process which seems to be a decent, is actual a circle of progress.  As a lower faculty is being pushed to take up as much from a higher way of working.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=75|ps=}} He finds when self-awareness in mind is applied to own-self and the outer (other-Self), results in luminous self-manifest identity, the reason also converts itself into the form of the self-luminous intuitional knowledge.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=72|ps=}}&lt;ref name="Integral yoga"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aurobindo |first1=  Sri  |title=The synthesis of yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=799–800|publisher=Sri Aurobindo ashram trust |location=Pondicherry |isbn= 978-0-9415-2465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

[[Rajneesh|Osho]] believed consciousness of human beings to be in increasing order from basic animal [[instinct]]s to intelligence and intuition, and humans being constantly living in that conscious state often moving between these states depending on their affinity and he also suggests living in the state of intuition is one of the ultimate aims of humanity.&lt;ref name="osho"&gt;{{cite book |last1= osho |first1=  Bhagwan  |title=Intuition: Knowing Beyond Logic |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=zyBfk5V5HRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=osho+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y8maVNOMEInzPJHLgbgN&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=10–20|publisher=osho international foundation |location=New York |isbn= 0-312-27567-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Advaita]] vedanta (a school of thought) takes intuition to be an experience through which one can come in contact with and experience [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name="advaita"&gt;{{cite book |last1= M. Indich |first1=  William   |title=Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=7ykZjWOiBMoC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=advaitha+on+intuition&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=49CaVPG_HIHlOJOygfAP&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=advaitha%20on%20intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 December 2014 |pages=8–10|publisher=Motilal banarisdas |location=varanasi |isbn= 81-208-1251-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
Buddhism finds intuition being a faculty in the mind of immediate knowledge and puts the term intuition beyond mental process of conscious [[thinking]], as the conscious intellect cannot necessarily access subconscious information, or render such information into a communicable form.&lt;ref name="Sumedho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buddhismnow.com/2013/08/07/buddha-by-ajahn-sumedho/|title=Buddha, by  Ajahn Sumedho|work=Buddhism now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zen Buddhism]] various techniques have been developed to help develop ones intuitive capability, such as [[koans]] – the resolving of which leads to states of minor enlightenment ([[satori]]). In parts of Zen Buddhism intuition is deemed a mental state between the Universal mind and one's individual, discriminating mind.&lt;ref name="Bdictionary"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Humphreys |first1= Christmas |title=A Popular Dictionary of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TlWRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT406&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=enmZVNyjLs32O8vlgdAM&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn= 0-203-98616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zen Buddhism"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Conners |first1=  Shawn  |title=Zen Buddhism – The Path to Enlightenment |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=zVPUsSW-by0C&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=intuition+in+buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iXeZVLu3LsjDOZjFgfgD&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition%20in%20buddhism&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014 |page=81|publisher=El paso trust |location=Texas |isbn= 1-934255-97-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
In Islam there are various scholars with varied interpretation of intuition (often termed as hads ([[Arabic]]: حدس), hitting correctly on a mark), sometimes relating the ability of having intuitive knowledge to [[prophet]]hood. 
[[Shahab al-Din Yahya ibn Habash Suhrawardi|Siháb al Din-al Suhrawadi]], in his book ''Philosophy Of Illumination'' (ishraq) finds that intuition is a knowledge acquired through illumination and is mystical in nature and also suggests mystical contemplation ([[mushahada]]) on this to bring about correct judgments.&lt;ref name="Islam1"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Lawson |first1=  Todd  |title=Reason and Inspiration in Islam: Theology, Philosophy and Mysticism in Muslim Thought |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bq9zSbNr8gIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=210–225|publisher=I.B touris co ltd |location=London |isbn=1-85043-470-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Ibn Sīnā]] finds the ability of having intuition as a "prophetic capacity" and terms it as a knowledge obtained without intentionally acquiring it. He finds that regular knowledge is based on imitation while intuitive knowledge as based on intellectual certitude.&lt;ref name="Islam2"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kalin |first1=  Ibrahim  |title=Knowledge in Later Islamic Philosophy: Mulla Sadra on Existence, Intellect, and Intuition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6EGwDLio0QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 December 2014 |pages=155–160|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
In the West, intuition does not appear as a separate field of study, and early mention and definition can be traced back to [[Plato]]. In his book ''[[Plato Republic|Republic]]'' he tries to define intuition as a fundamental capacity of human [[reason]] to comprehend the true nature of [[reality]].&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite web |title=Plato: Education and the Value of Justice |url=http://www.philosophypages.com/hy/2h.htm |accessdate= |last = Kemerling|first = Garth|date = 12 November 2011|website = Philosophy Pages }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', he describes intuition as a pre-existing knowledge residing in the "soul of eternity," and a phenomenon by which one becomes conscious of pre-existing knowledge. He provides an example of mathematical truths, and posits that they are not arrived at by reason. He argues that these truths are accessed using a knowledge already present in a dormant form and accessible to our intuitive capacity. This concept by Plato is also sometimes referred to as [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. The study was later continued by his [[Neo-platonism|followers]].&lt;ref name="Meno"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klein |first1= Jacob |title=A Commentary on Plato's Meno|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Commentary_on_Plato_s_Meno.html?id=HXI2lcrSsxIC&amp;redir_esc=y |accessdate=22 December 2014 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0-226-43959-3 |pages=103–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', [[René Descartes|Descartes]] refers to an intuition as a pre-existing knowledge gained through rational reasoning or discovering truth through contemplation. This definition is commonly referred to as [[logical intuition|rational intuition]].&lt;ref name="Descartes"&gt;{{cite book |last1= L. Mursell |first1=James |title=The Philosophical Review  |series=4 |volume=28 |publisher= Duke University Press |location=USA |pages=391–401 |chapter=The Function of Intuition in Descartes' Philosophy of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later philosophers, such as [[David Hume|Hume]], have more ambiguous interpretations of intuition. Hume claims intuition is a recognition of relationships (relation of time, place, and causation) while he states that "the resemblance" (recognition of relations) "will strike the eye" (which would not require further examination) but goes on to state, "or rather in mind" – attributing intuition to power of mind, contradicting the theory of [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="hume"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Hume|first1=David |title=A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RIusIRd2q8C|accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press  |isbn= 9781775410676|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  A. Johnson|first1= Oliver|title=The Mind of David Hume: A Companion to Book I of A Treatise of Human Nature |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=fMjhcXhrv48C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=david+hume+on+intuition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lDorBgwuhQ&amp;sig=4X0cOWxYQunqi8k_8rb5R5W8lbA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ai-ZVJy8HcWHPbeQgYAB&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=23 December 2014  |publisher=The Floating Press |isbn= 0-252-02156-8|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] finds intuition is thought of as basic sensory information provided by the [[cognitive]] faculty of sensibility (equivalent to what might loosely be called [[perception]]). Kant held that our [[mind]] casts all of our external intuitions in the form of [[space]], and all of our internal intuitions ([[memory]], thought) in the form of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url= https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=5144&amp;pageno=35|title= Critique of Pure Reason|publisher= gutenberg.org|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intuitionism]] is a position advanced by [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer]] in [[philosophy of mathematics]] derived from Kant's claim that all [[mathematics|mathematical knowledge]] is knowledge of the pure forms of the intuition – that is, intuition that is not empirical. [[Intuitionistic logic]] was devised by [[Arend Heyting]] to accommodate this position (and has been adopted by other forms of [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivism]] in general). It is characterized by rejecting the [[law of excluded middle]]: as a consequence it does not in general accept rules such as [[double negation elimination]] and the use of [[reductio ad absurdum]] to prove the existence of something.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Intuitions are customarily appealed to independently of any particular theory of how intuitions provide evidence for claims, and there are divergent accounts of what sort of mental state intuitions are, ranging from mere spontaneous judgment to a special presentation of a necessary truth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lynch "Trusting Intuitions", in P. Greenough and M. Lynch (ed) ''Truth and Realism'', pp. 227-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in recent years a number of philosophers, especially [[George Bealer]] have tried to defend appeals to intuition against [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quinean]] doubts about [[conceptual analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Bealer "Intuition and The Autonomy of Philosophy" in M. Depaul and W. Ramsey (eds) ''Rethinking Intuition: The Psychology of Intuition and Its Role In Philosophical Inquiry'' 1998, pp. 201-239.&lt;/ref&gt; A different challenge to appeals to intuition has recently come from [[experimental philosophy|experimental philosophers]], who argue that appeals to intuition must be informed by the methods of social science.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

The [[metaphilosophy|metaphilosophical]] assumption that philosophy depends on intuitions has recently been challenged by some philosophers. [[Timothy Williamson]] has argued that intuition plays no special role in philosophy practice, and that skepticism about intuition cannot be meaningfully separated from a general [[skepticism]] about judgment. On this view, there are no qualitative differences between the methods of philosophy and common sense, the sciences or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Timothy (2008) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN2KGBgKwOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false The Philosophy of Philosophy]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==

===Freud===
According to Sigmund [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], knowledge could only be attained through the intellectual manipulation of carefully made observations and rejected any other means of acquiring knowledge such as intuition, and his findings could have been an analytic turn of his mind towards the subject.&lt;ref name="Freud"&gt;{{cite book |last1=  Walker Punerr|first1= Helen |title=Sigmund Freud: His Life and Mind |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=386tCTzeb28C&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=intuition+sigmund+freud&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1DqgVLCrJcvfPYeWgLAK&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=intuition&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 December 2014  |publisher=Transaction Publishers |pages=197–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jung===
In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of the [[Human ego|ego]], described in 1916 in ''[[Psychological Types]]'', intuition is an "irrational function", opposed most directly by sensation, and opposed less strongly by the "rational functions" of thinking and feeling. Jung defined intuition as "perception via the unconscious": using sense-perception only as a starting point, to bring forth ideas, images, possibilities, ways out of a blocked situation, by a process that is mostly unconscious.&lt;ref name=ptypes /&gt;

Jung said that a person in whom intuition is dominant, an "intuitive type", acts not on the basis of rational judgment but on sheer intensity of perception. An extraverted intuitive type, "the natural champion of all minorities with a future", orients to new and promising but unproven possibilities, often leaving to chase after a new possibility before old ventures have borne fruit, oblivious to his or her own welfare in the constant pursuit of change. An introverted intuitive type orients by images from the unconscious, ever exploring the psychic world of the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]], seeking to perceive the meaning of events, but often having no interest in playing a role in those events and not seeing any connection between the contents of the psychic world and him- or herself. Jung thought that extraverted intuitive types were likely entrepreneurs, speculators, cultural revolutionaries, often undone by a desire to escape every situation before it becomes settled and constraining—even repeatedly leaving lovers for the sake of new romantic possibilities. His introverted intuitive types were likely mystics, prophets, or cranks, struggling with a tension between protecting their visions from influence by others and making their ideas comprehensible and reasonably persuasive to others—a necessity for those visions to bear real fruit.&lt;ref name=ptypes&gt;C.G. Jung. ''Psychological Types''. Bollingen Series XX, Volume 6, Princeton University Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern psychology===
In more-recent psychology, intuition can encompass the ability to know valid solutions to problems and [[decision making]]. For example, the [[recognition primed decision]] (RPD) model explains how people can make relatively fast decisions without having to compare options. [[Gary A. Klein|Gary Klein]] found that under time pressure, high stakes, and changing parameters, experts used their base of experience to identify similar situations and intuitively choose feasible solutions. Thus, the RPD model is a blend of intuition and analysis. The intuition is the pattern-matching process that quickly suggests feasible courses of action. The [[analysis]] is the mental simulation, a conscious and deliberate review of the courses of action.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Gary. ''Intuition At Work''. Random House, NY, NY. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Instinct]] is often misinterpreted as intuition and its reliability considered to be dependent on past knowledge and occurrences in a specific area. For example, someone who has had more experiences with children will tend to have a better instinct about what they should do in certain situations with them. This is not to say that one with a great amount of experience is always going to have an accurate intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Sadler-Smith. Inside Intuition. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitive abilities were quantitatively tested at Yale University in the 1970s. While studying [[nonverbal communication]], researchers noted that some subjects were able to read nonverbal facial cues before reinforcement occurred.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, J Daood, MC Giannini, R Boniface, PG Rhodes. Intellect versus intuition--dichotomy in the reception of nonverbal communication.Journal of General Psychology. 99:19-24,1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In employing a similar design, they noted that highly intuitive subjects made decisions quickly but could not identify their rationale. Their level of accuracy, however, did not differ from that of non intuitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;AJ Giannini, ME Barringer, MC Giannini, RH Loiselle. Lack of relationship between handedness and intuitive and intellectual (rationalistic) modes of information processing. Journal of General Psychology. 111:31-37 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial usage==
Intuition, as a gut feeling based on experience, has been found to be useful for business leaders for making judgement about people, culture and strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=gcm_pubs|title=Australian Elite Leaders, Intuition and Effectiveness |publisher=epubs.scu.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement officers often claim to observe suspects and immediately "know" that they possess a weapon or illicit narcotic substances, which could also be action of [[instinct]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/concept-creep/477939/|title=Why Americans Are So Sensitive to Harm|first=Conor|last=Friedersdorf|date=|website=theatlantic.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often unable to articulate why they reacted or what prompted them at the time of the event, they sometimes retrospectively can plot their actions based upon what had been clear and present danger signals. Such examples liken intuition to "[[Feeling#Stomach feeling|gut feelings]]" and when viable illustrate [[preconscious]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony J. Pinizzotto, PhD, Edward F. Davis, MA, and Charles E. Miller III [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Emotional%2Frational+decision+making+in+law+enforcement-a0114370262 Emotional/rational decision making in law enforcement] (Federal Bureau of Investigation), ''Free Online Library'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
[[Intuition Peak]] in [[Antarctica]] is so named "in appreciation of the role of scientific intuition for the advancement of human knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=134566 Intuition Peak.] SCAR [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Gilchrist Lawson''' (1874–1946) was a prolific British Christian author and compiler. Most notably, he compiled biographical sketches into ''Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians'' (1911), which is a landmark text in Pentecostal and Charismatic history. This book draws broadly from Christian history and the Wesleyan [[holiness movement]] to include many post-conversion experiences with the Holy Spirit, which Lawson believed to be the [[baptism of the Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Gilchrist Lawson, ″Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, The Warner Press, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, it connects the modern [[Pentecostal movement]], which began in 1900, to the much larger stream of Christian theology and history.&lt;ref&gt;″Book Review: Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, Charlie Whitlow. http://charliewhitlow.com/book-review-deeper-experiences-of-famous-christians/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gilchrist Lawson, ″Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical sketches include [[Girolamo Savonarola]], [[Fenelon]], [[Madame Guyon]], [[John Wesley]], [[Charles Finney]], [[William Booth]], and many others.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gilchrist Lawson, ″Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, The Warner Press, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and professor [[Dallas Willard]] wrote that ''Deeper Experiences'' is ″the one book other than the Bible that has most influenced me.″ &lt;ref&gt;Dallas Willard, ″When God Moves In: My Experience with Deeper Experiences of Famous Christians″, in ''Indelible Ink: 22 Prominent Christian Leaders Discuss the Books That Shape Their Faith.'' ed. Scott Larsen. WaterBrook Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawson was editor of ''The Marked Reference Bible'', which was an expansion on ''The Christian Worker's New Testament'' which he had published in 1924. ''The Marked Reference Bible'' includes a chain-reference and a color-coding system. The four colors represent the primary topics of salvation (red), the Holy Spirit (green), temporal blessings (brown), and prophetic subjects (blue). This Bible comes highly recommended by [[Winkie Pratney]] as a reference for [[biblical theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkie Pratney, 21CR Conference. Hamilton, New Zealand. May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible allows you to see not only where a topic or subtopic is mentioned, but how many times, as a guide to that topic's importance to the biblical text.&lt;ref&gt;''New Marked Reference Bible'', King James Version. ed.

Lawson was also a prolific compiler of quotes and stories. His compilations include ''Greatest Thoughts About the Bible'',&lt;ref&gt;George H. Doran Company, 1918&lt;/ref&gt; ''Greatest Thoughts About Jesus Christ'',&lt;ref&gt;George H. Doran Company, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;''Greatest Thoughts About God'',&lt;ref&gt;George H. Doran Company, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; ''The World’s Best Humorous Anecdotes'' (1923), ''The World’s Best Conundrums and Riddles of all Ages'' (1924), ''The World's Best Epigrams'' (1924), and ''The Best Loved Religious Poems''.&lt;ref&gt;Revell, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Lawson published a compilation of biographical sketches called ''Famous Missionaries''.

James Lawson says of himself in the introduction to ''Greatest Thoughts About God'', ″For the greater part of his life the compiler of this volume has been collecting the greatest thoughts of the greatest thinkers on the greatest themes. During the years the compiler has engaged in evangelistic work in the United States and Great Britain, he was able to consult the best books in the best libraries of America and Britain and to glean the best thoughts from them. While engaged in journalistic work, for five years, for the leading religious papers, in London, England, he was brought in contact with most of the religious leaders of the world and garnered the best thoughts from them. Through his connection with the religious publishing business during the last ten years, he has been able to collect the best thoughts from all the leading religious papers. Owing to the exceptional privileges which have been given to him by the providence of God, the compiler of this volume is able to give to the world the very cream of religious thoughts concerning God.″ &lt;ref&gt;"Greatest Thoughts About God", J. Gilchrist Lawson, George H. Doran Company: New York, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Greatest Thoughts About God''. Kindle edition. 20134&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary''' refers to a [[biblical commentary]] entitled a ''Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible'', prepared by Robert Jamieson, [[Andrew Robert Fausset]] and [[David Brown (Free Church of Scotland)|David Brown]] and published in 1871; and derived works from this initial publication, in differing numbers of volumes and abridgements. The commentary uses the [[King James Version of the Bible]] as its text.

==Background==
Robert Jamieson D.D. (1802–1880) was a minister at St. Paul’s Church, [[Provanmill]] in [[Glasgow]]. Andrew Fausset, A.M. (1821–1910) was rector of [[St Cuthbert's Church, York|St. Cuthbert’s Church]] in [[York (England)|York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/fausset_ar|title=A. R. Fausset - Christian Classics Ethereal Library|work=[[Christian Classics Ethereal Library]]|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Brown (1803–1897) was a [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] minister at St. James, Glasgow, and professor of [[theology]] at [[Christ's College, Aberdeen|Free Church College]] of the [[University of Aberdeen]].

The writers described their work as:

:[a] humble effort to make Scripture expound itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and prayed:

:May the Blessed Lord who has caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning, bless this ... effort ... and make it an instrument towards the conversion of sinners and the edification of saints, to the glory of His great name and the hastening of His kingdom! Amen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/jamieson-fausset-brown/revelation/revelation-22.html|title=Revelation 22 Commentary - Commentary Critical and Explanatory on the Whole Bible|website=Bible Study Tools|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example text==
On [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 1:1 -

1. In the beginning — a period of remote and unknown antiquity, hid in the depths of eternal ages; and so the phrase is used in {{bibleverse||Proverbs|8:22-23|KJV}}:

&lt;blockquote&gt;God — the name of the Supreme Being, signifying in Hebrew, "Strong," "Mighty." It is expressive of omnipotent power; and by its use here in the plural form, is obscurely taught at the opening of the Bible, a doctrine clearly revealed in other parts of it, namely, that though God is one, there is a plurality of persons in the Godhead — Father, Son, and Spirit, who were engaged in the creative work ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 8:27; [[Gospel of John|John]] 1:3, 10; [[Letter to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 3:9; [[Letter To the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 1:2; [[Book of Job|Job]] 26:13).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{sexual orientation}}
The '''Kinsey scale''', also called the '''Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale''',&lt;ref name="kinsey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual–Homosexual Rating Scale|publisher=The [[Kinsey Institute]]|accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used in research to describe a person's [[sexual orientation]] based on their experience or response at a given time. The scale typically ranges from 0, meaning exclusively [[heterosexual]], to 6, meaning exclusively [[homosexual]]. In both the male and female volumes of the ''[[Kinsey Reports]]'', an additional grade, listed as "X", indicated "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions". The reports were first published in ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' (1948) by [[Alfred Kinsey]], [[Wardell Pomeroy]], and others, and were also prominent in the complementary work ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'' (1953).&lt;ref name="kinsey" /&gt;
==History ==
Alfred Kinsey, the creator of the Kinsey scale, is known as "the father of the sexual revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kinseyinstitute.org/about/history/index.php|title=Kinsey History|website=www.kinseyinstitute.org|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kinsey scale was created in order to demonstrate that sexuality does not fit into two strict categories: homosexual and heterosexual. Instead, Kinsey believed that sexuality is fluid and subject to change over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of using sociocultural labels, Kinsey primarily used assessments of behavior in order to rate individuals on the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?af=R&amp;mobileUi=0|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey's first rating scale had thirty categories that represented thirty different case studies, but his final scale has only seven categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sexarchive.info/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEXOR4.HTM|title=Archive for Sexology|website=www.sexarchive.info|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 8,000 interviews were coordinated throughout his research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullough|first=Vern L.|date=January 2010|title=Alfred Kinsey and the Kinsey report: Historical overview and lasting contributions|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224499809551925|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=35|pages=|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introducing the scale, Kinsey wrote:
{{cquote|Males do not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided into sheep and goats. It is a fundamental of taxonomy that nature rarely deals with discrete categories... The living world is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] in each and every one of its aspects.

While emphasizing the continuity of the gradations between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual histories, it has seemed desirable to develop some sort of classification which could be based on the relative amounts of heterosexual and homosexual experience or response in each history [...] An individual may be assigned a position on this scale, for each period in his life. [...] A seven-point scale comes nearer to showing the many gradations that actually exist.|Kinsey, et al. (1948). pp. 639, 656}}

== Table of the scale ==

The Kinsey scale ranges from 0, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively heterosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with their same sex, to 6, for those who would identify themselves as exclusively homosexual with no experience with or desire for sexual activity with those of the opposite sex, and 1-5 for those who would identify themselves with varying levels of desire for sexual activity with either sex, including "incidental" or "occasional" desire for sexual activity with the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/research/ak-hhscale.html |title=Kinsey Sexuality Rating Scale |publisher=The Kinsey Institute |date= |accessdate=2013-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinsey recognized that the seven categories of the scale could not fully capture every individual's sexuality. He wrote that "it should be recognized that the reality includes individuals of every intermediate type, lying in a continuum between the two extremes and between each and every category on the scale."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHWHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP3#v=onepage|title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Female|last=Kinsey|first=Alfred C.|last2=Pomeroy|first2=Wardell B.|last3=Martin|first3=Clyde E.|last4=Gebhard|first4=Paul H.|date=1998-05-22|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253019240|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although sociologists [[Martin S. Weinberg]] and [[Colin J. Williams]] write that, in principle, people who rank anywhere from 1 to 5 could be considered [[bisexual]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Weinberg, Martin S. |author2=Williams, Colin J. |author3=Pryor, Douglas W. |title=Dual Attraction: Understanding Bisexuality |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-19-509841-2 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey disliked the use of the term ''bisexual'' to describe individuals who engage in sexual activity with both males and females, preferring to use ''bisexual'' in its original, biological sense as [[hermaphroditic]]; he stated, "Until it is demonstrated [that] taste in a sexual relation is dependent upon the individual containing within his anatomy both male and female structures, or male and female physiological capacities, it is unfortunate to call such individuals bisexual."&lt;ref name="Stange"/&gt; Psychologist Jim McKnight writes that while the idea that bisexuality is a form of sexual orientation intermediate between homosexuality and heterosexuality is implicit in the Kinsey scale, that conception has been "severely challenged" since the publication of ''[[Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women|Homosexualities]]'' (1978), by Weinberg and the psychologist [[Alan P. Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, Jim. ''Straight Science: Homosexuality, Evolution and Adaptation''. Routledge, 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, although the additional X grade used to mean "no socio-sexual contacts or reactions" is today described as [[asexuality]],&lt;ref name="Stange"&gt;{{cite book|authors =Mary Zeiss Stange, Carol K. Oyster, Jane E. Sloan |title = Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn = 978-1-4129-7685-5|publisher=Sage Pubns|year=2011|page=158|accessdate=December 17, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar Justin J. Lehmiller stated, "the Kinsey X classification emphasized a lack of sexual behavior, whereas the modern definition of asexuality emphasizes a lack of sexual attraction. As such, the Kinsey Scale may not be sufficient for accurate classification of asexuality."&lt;ref name="Lehmiller"&gt;{{cite book|author=Justin J. Lehmiller|title=The Psychology of Human Sexuality|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1119164702|page=250|date=2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ytk5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==

=== Kinsey reports ===
{{Main|Kinsey Reports}}
The Kinsey Reports are two published works, "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" and "Sexual Behavior in the Human male". These reports look into the sexual characteristics and development of the human males and females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt; Sexuality is examined in the Kinsey scale through the level of homosexuality in each person.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt; The data to scale the participants comes from their "psychosexual responses and/or overt experience" in relation to sexual attraction and activity with the same and opposite sexes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The inclusion of psychosexual responses allows someone with less sexual experience to rank evenly with someone of greater sexual experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;!--Anyone who has access to the reports please complete the findings for prevalence of Kinsey 0, 1, 2, and 4. The statistics below were taken from http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/ak-data.html --&gt;

* '''Men''': 11.6% of white males aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651"&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1948. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'', Table 147, p. 651&lt;/ref&gt;  The study also reported that 10% of American males surveyed were "more or less exclusively homosexual for at least three years between the ages of 16 and 55" (in the 5 to 6 range).&lt;ref name="Kinsey 651" /&gt;
* '''Women''': 7% of single females aged 20–35 and 4% of previously married females aged 20–35 were given a rating of 3 for this period of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', Table 142, p. 499&lt;/ref&gt; 2% to 6% of females, aged 20–35, were given a rating of 5&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; and 1% to 3% of unmarried females aged 20–35 were rated as 6.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, et al. 1953. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'', Table 142, p. 499, and p. 474&lt;/ref&gt;

The results found in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" show a higher amount of men who lean towards homosexuality than recorded for the women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kinsey addresses that the result is contrary to reports that women have more homosexual leanings than men. He poses that such reports are due to the "wishful thinking on the part of such heterosexual males."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Impact and later developments ==
===General===
{{Main|Scales of sexual orientation}}
The Kinsey scale is credited as one of the first attempts to "acknowledge the diversity and fluidity of human sexual behavior" by illustrating that "sexuality does not fall neatly into the [[Dichotomy|dichotomous]] categories of exclusively heterosexual or exclusively homosexual."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M. Paz|date=18 June 2014|title=Sexual Minority Reflections on the Kinsey Scale and the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid: Conceptualization and Measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15299716.2014.929553?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true|journal=Journal of Bisexuality|volume=14|pages=404–432|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies regarding homosexuality, at the time, were conducted by medical professionals who were sought out by individuals that wanted to change their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Sell ScD &amp; Christian Petrulio BA (1996) Sampling Homosexuals, Bisexuals, Gays, and Lesbians for Public Health Research:, Journal of Homosexuality, 30:4, 31-47, DOI: 10.1300/J082v30n04_02&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Kinsey's publications on human sexuality, which encompasses the Kinsey scale, were widely advertised and had a huge impact on society's modern conceptions of sexuality, post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;“Page 167.” Sexual Revolution and the Politics of Gay Identity, by Jeffery Escoffier.&lt;/ref&gt; His work incorporates thousands of men and women who deviate widely on the Kinsey Scale.

Galupo et al. argued, "Despite the availability of the Kinsey Scale, assessment via [[Sociocultural perspective|sociocultural]] labels (i.e., heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual) is the predominant modality for determining the sexual orientation of research participants."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many sexologists see the Kinsey scale as relevant to sexual orientation, but not comprehensive enough to cover all [[sexual identity]] aspects. Measures of sexual orientation do not always correlate with individuals' self-identification labels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As such, sexual identity involves more than one component and may also involve [[biological sex]] and [[gender identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/sexual-orientation-gender-4329.htm |title=Sexual Orientation &amp; Gender |publisher=Planned Parenthood |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bullough et al. argued that this "wide-scale public discussion of human sexuality" ultimately led Americans to challenge traditional [[heteronormative]] behaviors. His research and findings encouraged [[gay]] men and [[lesbian]]s to [[Coming out|come out]] by debunking a lot of stigma revolved around homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, V.L. Arch Sex Behav (2004) 33: 277. https://doi.org/10.1023/B:ASEB.0000026627.24993.03&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have further defined the scale. In 1980, Michael Storms proposed a two dimensional chart with an X and Y axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluation of Models of Sexual Orientation |url=http://www.uwlax.edu/pridecenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf |publisher=University of Wisconsin–La Crosse |accessdate=September 6, 2012 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715130712/http://www.uwlax.edu/PrideCenter/images/101/Eval%20of%20Models%20of%20Sexual%20Orientation.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scale explicitly takes into account the case of asexuality and the simultaneous expression of hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |title=Graph of Michael Storm Scale versus Kinsey Scale |publisher=Southern Illinois University Edwardsville |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001438/http://www.siue.edu/~cbwilso/203misc4.jpg |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Klein, in his [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]], included factors such as how orientation can change throughout a person's lifetime, as well as emotional and social orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americaninstituteofbisexuality.org/thekleingrid/|title=The Klein Grid|website=AIB|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinsey, Storm, and Klein are only three of more than 200 scales to measure and describe sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author1=Clive M. Davis |author2=William L. Yarber |author3=Robert Bauserman |author4=George Schreer |author5=Sandra L. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are scales that rate homosexual behaviors from 1 to 14, and measures for gender, masculinity, femininity, and transsexualism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinsey's Heterosexual-Homosexual Rating Scale|url=http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/research/ak-hhscale.html|publisher=The Kinsey Institute|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Sexuality-Related Measures|year=2000|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-4129-1336-2|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Handbook_of_Sexuality_Related_Measures.html?id=EFPs55zfAKcC|author1=Clive M. Davis |author2=William L. Yarber |author3=Robert Bauserman |author4=George Schreer |author5=Sandra L. Davis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveys and other studies===
There have been similar studies using a scale from 0 to 10. In such studies, the person would be asked a question such as "If 0 is completely gay and 10 is completely hetero, what is your orientation number?".&lt;ref&gt;Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity (2006) – Janbell L Caroll&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2014 aimed to explore "[[sexual minority]] individuals' qualitative responses regarding the ways in which the Kinsey Scale [...] captures (or fail to capture) their sexuality."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants completed the [Kinsey] scale and then were asked to respond to the following question: "In what ways did this scale capture or fail to capture your sexuality?"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "A diverse sample of sexual minority participants, including individuals who (1) identify outside the traditional sexual orientation labels (i.e. [[Pansexuality|pansexual]], [[queer]], fluid, [[Asexuality|asexual]]) and (2) identify as [[transgender]], were recruited to complete an online questionnaire."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants represented a convenience sample of 285 individuals who self-identified as [[non-heterosexual]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "Approximately one third of participants self-identified primarily as [[Monosexuality|monosexual]] (31.5%), whereas 65.8% identified as nonmonosexual, and 2.8% identified as asexual. Monosexual participants represented those who self-identified as lesbian (18.5%) or gay (12.2%) or homosexual (0.8%). Nonmonosexual participants included bisexual (24.1%), pansexual (16.8%), queer (19.6%), and fluid (1.4%) participants. A small minority of participants identified as 'other' (3.8%)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Participants represented all regions of the continental United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For this study, the use of "X" was intended to describe asexuality or individuals who identify as nonsexual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For a 2015 [[YouGov]] UK survey, when asked to place themselves on the Kinsey scale, 72% of all adults, and 46% of adults aged 18–24 years, picked a score of zero, totally heterosexual.

Another study published in 2017, questioned how people who do not identify as heterosexual felt about their representation on the Kinsey Scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galupo|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9787">'''Kunyaza''' is the [[Rwanda-Rundi]] name given to a sexual practice found in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of [[East Africa]] which is meant to facilitate [[female orgasm]] during [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]].

==Terminology==
The Rwanda-Rundi word ''kunyaza'' is derived from the verb ''kunyaàra'', meaning "to urinate" but also signifying [[female ejaculation]] achieved by the practice.&lt;ref name=fusachi/&gt; It is known with various names in different regions, the regular Ugandan term being ''kakyabali'' (often ''kachabali'' in anglicised spelling) or "Western Jazz" in slang, due to its prevalence in western regions such as [[Ankole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weddingbells.co.ug/index.php/weddings-in-uganda/wedding-cultures/item/145-culture-pulling Culture of Pulling - Weddings in Uganda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415045101/http://weddingbells.co.ug/index.php/weddings-in-uganda/wedding-cultures/item/145-culture-pulling |date=2014-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic extent==
Kunyaza is present particularly in [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], western [[Uganda]], western [[Tanzania]], and eastern [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].&lt;ref name=bizimana&gt;[http://www.afrik-news.com/article14174.html Kunyaza, the secret to female orgasm], AfrikNews, 30 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey with Rwandan male respondents suggested that female [[Europe]]an visitors to the country are being introduced to the practice by local men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oxlund |first1=Bjarke |last2= |first2= |editor1-last=Barrett |editor1-first=Barbara Ann |editor2-last=Groes-Green |editor2-first=Christian |title=Studying Intimate Matters: Engaging Methodological Challenges in Studies on Gender, Sexuality and Reproductive Health in sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Fountain Publishers |date= |orig-year=1st pub. 2011 |pages=103 |chapter=Let's Talk About Sex: Comparing Notes from Qualitative Research on Men, Relationships and Sex in South Africa and Rwanda|chapterurl=|isbn=978-9970-02-999-0 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2010s, the practice saw spread through [[social media]] to [[Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/m/story.php?articleID=2000155361&amp;story_title=New-sex-craze-that-has-Nairobi-women-begging-for-more New sex craze that has Nairobi women begging for more], Standard Digital News, 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nairobiwire.com/2014/06/former-tv-presenter-offers-sex-advice-kenyan-ladies.html Former TV Presenter Offers Sex Advice To Kenyan Ladies], Nairobi Wire, 9 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Kunyaza is usually considered a traditional practice in Rwanda and the folk tradition suggests that it dates back to the [[List of kings of Rwanda#3rd Dynasty|Third Dynasty]] rule. According to the lore, a royal guard the queen chose to have sex became very anxious and failed to penetrate the queen but instead, his [[penis]] rubbing against her [[labia minora|labia]] and [[clitoris]] gave satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/dating/love_tip/a-kunyara-primer.html|title=Kunyara|author=Matthew Stein|work=AskMen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A formulated version of kunyaza was introduced to the Western public in books ''Weiblicher Orgasmus und weibliche Ejakulation dank afrikanischer Liebeskunst'' (2005) and ''Le secret de l’amour à l’africaine'' (2008) by [[Germany|German]]-based Rwandan traditional medicine specialist Nsekuye Bizimana.&lt;ref name=bizimana/&gt; A [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation of ''Le secret de l’amour à l’africaine'' was published in [[Hong Kong]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cp1897.com.hk/product_info.php?BookId=9789861854496|title=非洲慾經|author=商務印書館|work=cp1897.com.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Kunyaza_phases.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Progressive non-penetrative (rubbing and tapping) and penetrative (thrusting and "screwing") phases of kunyaza.]]
Publicised by Dr. Nsekuye Bizimana as a secure means to achieve [[female orgasm]], often in the form of ejaculation, kunyaza involves a [[non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] and a penetrative phase in progression:

# The male partner first stimulates the [[labia minora]] of the female partner by tapping and also rubbing with his penis and then, at a certain level of arousal, proceeds to stimulate the internal surfaces of the labia minora and the [[vulval vestibule]], including the [[urinary meatus]] in the same manner, followed by stimulation of the [[clitoris]], vulval vestibule, labia minora and the vaginal opening.&lt;ref name="nsekuye bizimana"&gt;Dr. Nsekuye Bizimana, ''Kunyaza, a traditional sexual technique for triggering female orgasm at heterosexual encounters''. Sexologies (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hair removal|Removal]] of the female partner's [[pubic hair]] is advised for more comfortable manipulation of the penis.&lt;ref name="redpepper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.co.ug/kunyaza-sex-trick-that-trigger-womans-orgasm-in-five-minutes|title=Kunyaza, Sex Trick That Trigger Woman’s Orgasm In Five Minutes|work=Brian Kwesiga}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The male partner penetrates the vagina with alternating shallow thrusts (''gucuga'') at the vaginal opening with deep thrusts (''gucumita'') pushing against the [[cervix]] while maintaining exaggerated circular movements between [[vagina]] walls in a "screwing" fashion during penetration, often facilitating the movement by holding the penis between the middle and the index finger.&lt;ref name="nsekuye bizimana"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebadamani.com/2/post/2013/07/kunyaza-an-afrika-sexual-technique.html|title=Kunyaza: An Afrikan Sexual Technique|work=Seba Damani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paroledafrique.wordpress.com/2013/07/24/le-kunyaza-une-methode-de-nos-ancetres-qui-fait-jouir-intensement-les-femmes-pendant-les-rapports/|title=Le kunyaza, une méthode de nos ancêtres qui fait jouir intensement les femmes pendant les rapports|work=PAROLE D'AFRIQUE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, other researchers emphasise that the version introduced by Dr. Bizimana diverts from the traditional kunyaza in fully omitting the [[labia elongation]] technique of ''gukuna'', which is in fact seen as integral to kunyaza.&lt;ref name=fusachi&gt;[http://gss.revues.org/2571?lang=en Plaisirs croisés : gukuna-kunyaza. Missions, corps et sexualités dans le Rwanda contemporain], Michela Fusaschi, ''Genre, sexualité &amp; société'', Autumn 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
As ''kunyaza'' involves some commitment of time, and, on the part of the man, restraint, it is posited as a relationship signifier. "A man only ''kunyazas'' a woman that he really cares for, whereas it would be odd to ''kunyaza'' a sex worker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barrett|first1=Barbara Ann|last2=Groes-Green|first2=Christian|title=Studying Intimate Matters: Engaging Methodological Challenges in Studies on Gender, Sexuality and Reproductive Health in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2011|publisher=Christian Groes-Green|isbn=9789970251308|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sWJYBFOSGXIC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=Studying+intimate+matters+:+emerging+methodological+challenges+in+studies+on+gender,+sexuality+and+reproductive+health+in+sub-Saharan+Africa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pJFc98QQfG&amp;sig=-WFVBur2_qfCK2SjODexBJ4x-48&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinvOqGiovbAhXHbMAKHXmHAqEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Studying%20intimate%20matters%20%3A%20emerging%20methodological%20challenges%20in%20studies%20on%20gender%2C%20sexuality%20and%20reproductive%20health%20in%20sub-Saharan%20Africa&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18991">'''Language analysis for the determination of origin''' ('''LADO''') is an instrument used in asylum cases to [[Linguistic profiling#Geographic origin|determine the national or ethnic origin]] of the asylum seeker, through an evaluation of their language profile. To this end, an interview with the asylum seeker is recorded and analysed. The analysis consists of an examination of the [[Dialectology|dialectologically]] relevant features (e.g. [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], [[grammar]], [[vocabulary]] and [[loanword]]s) in the speech of the [[asylum seeker]]. LADO is considered a type of speaker identification by [[Forensic linguistics|forensic linguists]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Tiersma &amp; Lawrence M. Solan (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 531.&lt;/ref&gt; LADO analyses are usually made at the request of government immigration/asylum bureaux attempting to verify asylum claims, but may also be performed as part of the appeals process for claims which have been denied; they have frequently been the subject of appeals and litigation in several countries, e.g. Australia, the Netherlands and the UK.

==Background==
A number of established linguistic approaches are considered to be valid methods of conducting LADO, including language variation and change,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2010). 'Language variation and LADO (Language Analysis for Determination of Origin).' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The role of language in European asylum procedures: A linguistic and legal survey, pp73-87. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;JK Chambers, Peter Trudgill and Natalie Schilling-Estes, eds. (2002). The Handbook of Language Variation and Change. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; forensic phonetics,&lt;ref&gt;Moosmüller, Sylvia. (2010). 'IAFPA position on language analysis in asylum procedures.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 43–47. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; dialectology, and language assessment.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Tim &amp; Carsten Roever. (2006). Language testing: The social dimension. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying assumption leading to government immigration and asylum bureaux's use of LADO is that a link exists between a person's nationality and the way they speak. To linguists, this assumption is flawed: instead, research supports links between the family and community in which a person learns their  native language, and enduring features of their way of speaking it. The notion that [[Linguistic anthropology#Socialization|linguistic socialization]] into a [[speech community]] lies at the heart of LADO has been argued for by linguists since 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Language and National Origin Group. (2004). 'Guidelines for the Use of Language Analysis in relation to Questions of National Origin in Refugee Cases'. The International Journal of Speech, Language and the Law 11(2): 261–266.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now accepted by a range of government agencies (e.g. Switzerland,&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Baltisberger, Eric &amp; Priska Hubbuch. (2010). 'LADO with specialized linguists: The development of Lingua's working method.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp9-19. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Norway&lt;ref&gt;UDI 2009. 'Specified requirements for language analysis for the Norwegian Immigration Administration.' Oslo: Utlendingsdirektoratet, July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;), academic researchers (e.g. Eades 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Eades, Diana. (2009). 'Testing the claims of asylum seekers: The role of language analysis.' Language Assessment Quarterly 6: 30–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser 2011,&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Helen. 2011. 'Language analysis for the determination of origin (LADO).' In C. A. Chapelle (Ed.), Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Maryns 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Maryns, Katrijn. 2006. The asylum speaker: Language in the Belgian asylum procedure. Manchester: St. Jerome.&lt;/ref&gt; and Patrick 2013&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2013.) 'Asylum and language analysis.' In Susan K Brown &amp; Frank D Bean (eds.), Encyclopedia of Migration. Heidelberg: Springer Verlag. http://www.springerreference.com/docs/edit/chapterdbid/349348.html&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as some commercial agencies (e.g. De Taalstudio, according to Verrips 2010&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2010). 'Language analysis and contra-expertise in the Dutch asylum procedure.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(2): 279–294.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Where it is used==
Since the mid-1990s, language analysis has been used to help determine the geographical origin of [[asylum seeker]]s by the governments of a growing number of countries (Reath, 2004),&lt;ref&gt;Reath, A. (2004). 'Language analysis in the context of the asylum process: Procedures, validity, and consequences.' Language Assessment Quarterly: 1–4, 209–233.&lt;/ref&gt; now including [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

Pilots have been conducted by the UK, [[Ireland]], and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;UDI 2009. 'Specified requirements for language analysis for the Norwegian Immigration Administration.' Oslo: Utlendingsdirektoratet, July 2009. https://www.udiregelverk.no/Global/Images/Rettskilder/Rundskriv/RS%202011%20023/RS%202011%20023V5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The UK legitimised the process in 2003; it has subsequently been criticised by immigration lawyers (see response by the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association&lt;ref&gt;IPA April 2009. 'Response to the UK Border Agency "NAM+ Asylum Programme" presentation to the National Asylum Stakeholder Forum (NASF) on 19 March 2009' http://www.docstoc.com/docs/44362029/Response-to-the-UK-Border-Agency-NAM-Asylum-Programme&lt;/ref&gt;), and also Craig 2012&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Sarah. 2012. The use of language in asylum decision-making in the UK – a discussion. Journal of Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Law 26(3): 255–268. Oxford University Press: Westlaw.&lt;/ref&gt;); and social scientists (e.g. Campbell 2013&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John. (2013.) 'Language analysis in the United Kingdom's Refugee Status Determination system: Seeing through policy claims about 'expert knowledge'.' Ethnic and Racial Studies 36(4): 670–690.&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as linguists (e.g. Patrick 2011&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2011.) 'Key problems in language analysis for the determination of origin.' Plenary address to the International Association of Forensic Linguistics 10th Biennial conference at Aston University (July 2011). http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~patrickp/papers/IAFL10plenary_July2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the [[Netherlands]] LADO is commissioned by the Dutch Immigration Service (IND, http://www.ind.nl/Themas/Taalanalyse/Pages/default.aspx). Language analysis is used by the IND in cases where asylum seekers cannot produce valid identification documents, and, in addition, the IND sees reason to doubt the claimed origin of the asylum seeker. The IND has a specialised unit (Bureau Land en Taal, or BLT; in English, the Office for Country Information and Language Analysis, or OCILA) that carries out these analyses. Challenges to BLT analyses are provided by De Taalstudio &lt;http://www.taalstudio.nl/taalanalyse/index_uk.html&gt;, a private company that provides language analysis and contra-expertise in LADO cases. Claims and criticisms regarding the Dutch LADO processes are discussed by Cambier-Langeveld (2010),&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2010.) 'The validity of language analysis in the Netherlands.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 21–33. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; the senior linguist for BLT/OCILA, and by Verrips 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2010.) 'Language analysis and contra-expertise in the Dutch asylum procedure.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(2): 279–294.&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of De Taalstudio. Zwaan (2008,&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, Karin (ed). (2008). De taalanalyse in de Nederlandse asielprocedure. Een juridische en linguïstische verkenning. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; 2010&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, Karin. (2010.) 'Dutch court decisions and language analysis for the determination of origin.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 43–47. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) reviews the legal situation.

LADO reports are provided to governments in a number of ways: by their own regularly-employed linguists and/or freelance analysts; by independent academic experts; by commercial firms; or by a mixture of the above. In Switzerland language analysis is carried out by LINGUA, a specialized unit of the Federal Office for Migration, which both employs linguists and retains independent experts from around the world.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; The German and Austrian bureaux commission reports primarily from experts within their own countries. The UK and a number of other countries have commercial contracts with providers such as the Swedish firms Sprakab&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakab.se/Home.html |title=Home |publisher=Sprakab.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Verified &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verified.se/ |title=Verified AB – Language Analyses, Dialect Identification, Linguistic Expertise |publisher=Verified.se |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
both of which have carried out language analyses for UK Visas and Immigration (formerly UK Border Agency) and for the Dutch Immigration Service, as well as other countries around the world.

==Language analysts==
It is widely agreed that language analysis should be done by language experts. Two basic types of practitioners commonly involved in LADO can be distinguished: trained native speakers of the language under analysis, and professional linguists specialized in the language under analysis. Usually native speaker analysts are free-lance employees who are said to be under the supervision of a qualified linguist. When such analysts lack academic training in linguistics, it has been questioned whether they should be accorded the status of 'experts' by asylum tribunals, e.g. by Patrick (2012),&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Peter L. (2012.) 'Language analysis for determination of origin: Objective evidence for refugee status determination.' Chapter 38 in Peter M. Tiersma &amp; Lawrence M. Solan (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Language and Law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 544&lt;/ref&gt; who refers to them instead as "non-expert native speakers (NENSs)". Eades et al. (2003) note that "people who have studied linguistics to professional levels [...] have particular knowledge which is not available to either ordinary speakers or specialists in other disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Eades, D., H. Fraser, J. Siegel, T. McNamara &amp; B. Baker. (2003.) 'Linguistic identification in the determination of nationality: A preliminary report.' Language Policy 2: 179–199.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise Dikker and Verrips (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Dikker, S. &amp; Verrips, M. (2004.) 'Taalanalyse: een vak apart.' Onderzoeksrapport. Monnickendam: De Taalstudio.&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that native speakers who lack training in linguistics are not able to formulate reliable conclusions regarding the origin of other speakers of their language. The nature of the training which commercial firms and government bureaux provide to their analysts has been questioned in academic and legal arenas, but few specifics have been provided to date; see however accounts by the Swiss agency Lingua&lt;ref&gt;Baltisberger, Eric &amp; Priska Hubbuch. (2010.) 'LADO with specialized linguists: The development of Lingua's working method.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp9-19. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cambier-Langeveld of BLT/OCILA,&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2010.) 'The role of linguists and native speakers in language analysis for the determination of speaker origin.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 17(1): 67–93&lt;/ref&gt; as well as responses to the latter by Fraser &lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Helen. (2011.) 'The role of linguists and native speakers in language analysis for the determination of speaker origin: A response to Tina Cambier-Langeveld.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 18(1): 121–130.&lt;/ref&gt; and Verrips.&lt;ref&gt;Verrips, Maaike. (2011.) 'LADO and the pressure to draw strong conclusions: A response to Tina Cambier-Langeveld.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 18(1): 131–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Claims for and against the use of such native-speaker analysts, and their ability to conduct LADO satisfactorily vis-a-vis the ability of academically-trained linguists, have only recently begun to be the subject of research (e.g. Wilson 2009),&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Kim. (2009.) 'Language analysis for the determination of origin: Native speakers vs. trained linguists.' MSc dissertation in Linguistics, University of York&lt;/ref&gt; and no consensus yet exists among linguists. While much linguistic research exists on the ability of people, including trained linguists and phoneticians and untrained native speakers, to correctly perceive, identify or label recorded speech that is played to them, almost none of the research has yet been framed in such a way that it can give clear answers to questions about the LADO context.

==Litigation==
The matter of native-speaker analysts and many other issues are subjects of ongoing litigation in asylum tribunals and appeals courts in several countries. Vedsted Hansen (2010&lt;ref&gt;Vedsted Hansen, Jens. 2010. 'The use of language analysis in the Danish asylum procedure.' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 199–207. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) describes the Danish situation, Noll (2010&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Gregor. 2010. 'The 2007 rejection of anonymous language analysis by the Swedish Migration Court of Appeal: A precedent?' In K Zwaan, P Muysken &amp; M Verrips, eds., Language and Origin. The Role of Language in European Asylum Procedures: A Linguistic and Legal Survey, pp. 211–213. Nijmegen: Wolf Legal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;) comments on Sweden, and Zwaan (2010) reviews the Dutch situation.
 
In the UK, a 2010 Upper Tribunal (asylum) case known as 'RB',&lt;ref&gt;RB (Linguistic evidence Sprakab) Somalia [2010] UKUT 329 (IAC) (15 September 2010), http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKUT/IAC/2010/00329_ukut_iac_2010_rb_somalia.html&lt;/ref&gt; supported by a 2012 Court of Appeal decision,&lt;ref&gt;RB (Somalia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 277 (13 March 2012), http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/277.html&amp;query=rb+and+somalia&amp;method=boolean&lt;/ref&gt; argue for giving considerable weight to LADO reports carried out by the methodology of native-speaker analyst plus supervising linguist. In contrast, a 2013 Scottish Court of Sessions decision known as M.Ab.N+K.A.S.Y.&lt;ref&gt;M.Ab.N. &amp; K.A.S.Y. v SSHD [2013] CSIH 68, http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2013CSIH68.html&lt;/ref&gt; found that all such reports must be weighed against the standard Practice Directions for expert reports. Lawyers in the latter case have argued that "What matters is the lack of qualification",&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Joseph. Free Movement blog, 24 July 2013. 'Court of Sessions rules on linguistic analysis.' http://www.freemovement.org.uk/2013/07/24/court-of-session-rules-on-linguistic-analysis/&lt;/ref&gt; and since the Scottish court has equal standing to the England and Wales Appeals Court, the UK Supreme Court was petitioned to address the issues. On 5–6 March 2014, the UK Supreme Court &lt;ref&gt;UK Supreme Court. http://www.supremecourt.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; heard an appeal&lt;ref&gt;UKSC 2012/0202. {{cite web |url=http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/case_2013_0202.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407082701/http://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/case_2013_0202.html |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by the Home Office concerning the nature of expert linguistic evidence provided to the Home Office in asylum cases, whether expert witness should be granted anonymity, the weight that should be given to reports by the Swedish firm Sprakab, and related matters.

==Criticism==
Some methods of language analysis in asylum procedures have been heavily criticized by many linguists (e.g., Eades et al. 2003;&lt;ref&gt;Eades, Diana &amp; Jacques Arends, eds. (2004). Language Analysis and Determination of Nationality. In International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law: Forensic Linguistics, 11(2): 179–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Arends, 2003). Proponents of the use of native-speaker analysts agree that "[earlier] LADO reports were not very satisfactory from a linguistic point of view... [while even] today's reports are still not likely to satisfy the average academic linguist".&lt;ref&gt;Cambier-Langeveld, T. (2012.) 'Clarification of the issues in language analysis: A rejoinder to Fraser and Verrips.' International Journal of Speech, Language &amp; the Law 19(1): 95, 108, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Following an item on the Dutch public radio programme Argos, member of parliament De Wit of the Socialist Party presented a number of questions to the State Secretary of the Ministry of Justice regarding the reliability of LADO. The questions and the responses by the State Secretary can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justitie.nl/images/betrouwbaarheid%20taalanalyses_12840_tcm34-161304.pdf |title=Ministerie van Veiligheid en Justitie &amp;#124; Rijksoverheid.nl |publisher=Justitie.nl |date=1995-04-30 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization''' in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]], is a research institute for investigations of complex non-equilibrium systems, particularly in physics and biology.

Its founding history goes back to [[Ludwig Prandtl]] who in 1911 requested a [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] to be founded for the investigation of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. As a first step the Aeronautische Versuchsanstalt (now the [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]) was established in 1915 and then finally the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Flow Research]] was established in 1924. In 1948 it became part of the [[Max Planck Society]]. The Max Planck Society was founded in this institute. In 2003 it was renamed to Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization. It is one of 80 institutes in the Max Planck Society (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

== History ==
The early history of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization is closely linked to the work of the famous physicist [[Ludwig Prandtl]]. Prandtl is regarded as the founder of fluid dynamics and especially made a name for himself with his boundary layer theory. In Göttingen Prandtl opened two research facilities that both exist until today: in 1915 the Aerodynamical Experimental Station, which concentrated on application-oriented topics in fluid dynamics and evolved into the Göttinger branch of the German Space Agency DLR, and in 1925 the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fluid Dynamics. The latter mainly dealt with fundamental research in the field of fluid dynamics. After the Max Planck Society was founded the institute was renamed Max Planck Institute for Fluid Dynamics. In 2004 the institute again received a new name and is now called Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.

=== The early years ===

In 1904 Ludwig Prandtl accepted a position as professor for Technical Physics at the University of Göttingen. Here he continued his research in fluid dynamics that he had started as professor in Hannover. One of his experimental setups was a water channel, into which different obstacles could be inserted. Soon however, Prandtl wished to conduct more application-oriented research in larger test facilities. This became possible in 1907 with the foundation of an experimental facility in the Hildebrandt Street. Here Prandtl built the first German wind tunnel and thereby established the so-called "Göttinger type" of wind tunnels. Unlike those created by Gustav Eiffel in France wind tunnels of the Göttinger type feature a closed cycle for the liquids or gases to flow in. The founding of this experimental facility is the starting point of the later Aerodynamical Experimental Station.

When on January 11, 1911 the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, the preceding organisation of the Max Planck Society, was founded in Berlin, Prandtl acted again. Only one month later he appealed to the new organisation in a memorandum. In it he asked for an institute for fundamental research in fluid dynamics to be built in Göttingen. As reasons for his choice of location he listed his own previous research and the high esteem of mathematics at the University of Göttingen.

The following negotiations lasted for over a decade and were interrupted by World War I. The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fluid Dynamics was not opened until 1925. It was located on the premises between Böttinger and Bunsen Street, where it is still found today. Ludwig Prandtl was appointed head of the institute. Before, in 1915 the application-oriented Aerodynamical Experimental Station had been founded at the same location. The wind tunnel that Prandtl had built in the Hildebrandt Street was moved to the Bunsen Street in 1918. With the foundation of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute both the new institute and the Aerodynamical Experimental Station were united under the name "Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Fluid Dynamics together with the Aerodynamical Experimental Station".

=== After World War II ===

On April 11, 1945 the [[Control Commission for Germany - British Element|British military government]] temporarily closed the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institute and the Aerodynamical Experimental Station and installed a committee to decide about the future of both research facilities. In June a decision was made: The Aerodynamical Experimental Station was permanently closed and its experiments were disassembled. Having been built for the purpose of fundamental research only, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was permitted to carry on its work and was reopened on August 1, 1946. In the same year Ludwig Prandtl resigned as head of the institute. His successor was Albert Betz, who had led the Aerodynamical Experimental Station for years.

When on February 1948 the Max Planck Society was founded in Göttingen, the institute became part of this new organisation and was renamed Max Planck Institute for Fluid Dynamics. In 1953 the Aerodynamical Experimental Station was reopened as part of the Max Planck Society. In 1969 the Experimental Station was separated from the institute and became a predecessor of the German Space Agency DLR.

=== Fluid dynamics and more ===

Also in 1969 the Max Planck Institute began to focus on new fields of research and received three departments for molecular physics: Atomic and Molecular Physics, Molecular Interactions and Reaction Kinetics. In the following years this field of research became more and more important until in 1993 the institute discontinued all research in fluid dynamics.

In 1996 the institute again chose a new research focus and appointed Prof. Dr. Theo Geisel, who opened the Department of Nonlinear Dynamics. By 2001 all departments dealing with molecular physics had been closed. With the appointment of Prof. Dr. Stephan Herminghaus and Prof. Dr. Eberhard Bodenschatz in 2003 and the founding of the Department of Dynamics of Complex Fluids and the Department of Hydrodynamics, Pattern Formation and Nanonbiocomplexity fluid dynamics returned to the institute. However, now this field of research was put into the larger context of self-organized and nonlinear phenomena. This development led to the renaming of the institute on November 19, 2004. Since then the institute is called Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.

== Departments and independent research groups ==
The research conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization covers a broad spectrum, mainly in the physics of complex systems. Recently, the physics of complex systems has become a topic of increasing interest and includes open systems, which are characterized by dissipation of energy and entropy production. Pattern forming systems are particularly interesting, and the understanding of the general features are the topic of current research. Hydrodynamic turbulence is another example and continues to be one of the unsolved problems of the 21st century. These systems are mostly deterministic, and the influence of thermal fluctuations can be neglected. However, this does not include living nature. Biological systems have active components (genetic networks, protein networks, molecular motors, neurons), which consist of discrete units (i. e. cells) and require the consideration of stochastic processes (thermal noise). Moreover, for the molecular transport and fluid dynamics on scales smaller than micrometres the molecular structure of the fluid may become important. This is especially true for complex fluids, whose properties are determined by mesoscale Coulomb interactions and the presence of large molecules.

In January 2000 Ama Ata Aidoo started an initiative called '''Mbaasem''' (meaning "women’s words, women’s affairs" in [[Akan language|Akan]])&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt; based in Accra, Ghana, with the goal of building a women writers' centre and residency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wworld.org/archive/annual_report2000.htm Annual Report 1999-2000], Women's WORLD.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently incorporated as a registered non-governmental organization, the Mbaasem Foundation reflects the mission of its founder "to develop and support the sustainability of the work of African women writers who are usually sidelined in the industry".&lt;ref&gt;Kundai Mugwanda-Nyamutenha,

In 2012 Mbaasem launched a three-year project to develop a literacy manifesto to improve the literacy rate within Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;Marian Ansah, [http://efeansah1990.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/mbaasem-foundation-launches-manifesto.html "Mbaasem Foundation Launches manifesto To Bridge Literacy Gap"], 8 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other activities include organizing the "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls", funded by the US Embassy of Ghana and [[The Royal Bank]] Ltd, with GHC 1000 as the top prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gowomanafrica.com/mbaasem-writing-contest-for-girls-deadline-january-31st-2015/ "Mbaasem Writing Contest for Girls"], ''GoWoman'',

The Mbaasem Foundation has also been involved in international conferences for women writers. In 2013, it collaborated with the [[Organization of Women Writers of Africa]] (OWWA), [[New York University]] (NYU), and the [[Spanish Fundación Mujeres por África]] (Women for Africa Foundation) to present a major conference in Accra, ''Yari Yari Ntoaso: Continuing the Dialogue – An International Conference on Literature by Women of African Ancestry'', held from 16 to 19 May.&lt;ref name=CWG&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creativewritingghana.wordpress.com/tag/mbaasem/|title=Yari Yari Ntoaso: An International Conference in Ghana on Literature by Women of African Ancestry|publisher=Creative Writing Ghana|date=20 April 2013|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghanaian writers and scholars including Ama Ata Aidoo, [[Amma Darko]], [[Ruby Goka]], [[Mamle Kabu]], [[Esi Sutherland-Addy]] and [[Margaret Busby]] were invited to speak at the event, and among notable participants from other parts of the world who attended were [[Angela Davis]] of the USA, [[Tess Onwueme]] of Nigeria, [[Natalia Molebatsi]] of South Africa, [[Yolanda Arroyo Pizarro]] of Puerto Rico, [[Véronique Tadjo]] of Côte d'Ivoire, and [[Évelyne Trouillot]] of Haiti.&lt;ref name=CWG /&gt;

'''The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut''' is situated at the heart of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] in the State of [[Saxony-Anhalt]]. [[Naumburg Cathedral]] and the landscpae has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the [[World Heritage List|List of World Heritage]]. On July 1, 2018, only Naumburg Cathedral was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]].&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-naumburg-cathedral-wins-world-heritage-designation/a-44481701|title=Germany's Naumburg Cathedral wins World Heritage designation|work=[[DW-TV|DW]]|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The landscape arount the World Heritage nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" is representative for processes at the [[High Middle Ages]] that shaped the whole continent: [[Christianization]], settlement and [[Cultivation (agriculture)|cultivation]] processes, the so-called [[Landesausbau]], that took place between 1000 and 1300. This borderland region also bears witness of the intercultural exchange of different cultures in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The highest-ranking buildings and works of art, most of all Naumburg Cathedral with its globally unique artistic and iconographic founder figures, provides testimony to the claims to power and the self-confidence of the worldly and spiritual rulers as well as to the region’s crucial role as a place of interchange between Western and Eastern realms.

== Nomination as World Heritage ==
[[File:Steinmeister vineyard.jpg|thumb|Steinmeister vineyard]]
In 1998, Naumburg Cathedral was inscribed into the Tentative List for World Heritage nominations and extended seven years later by its surrounding cultural [[landscape]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Tentative Lists are prepared by States Parties to the Convention on the Protection of Cultural and Natural World Heritage. They contain a number of nominiation proposals to be submitted in the future. For further information on the selection of potential World Heritage sites, please see [http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/ selection criteria].&lt;/ref&gt; ″The ′Naumburg Cathedral and the surrounding cultural landscape along the rivers [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]]′ are outstanding and representative examples of the High Middle Ages (1000-1300). Nowhere else in the world has such a high density of monuments and cultural landscape elements from the High Middle Ages been preserved in such a small space in such a level of authenticity in its original spatial setting.″.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The nomination was discussed on the 39th meeting of [[World Heritage Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/INF.19.{{cite book|title=Summary Records of the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015).|publisher= UNESCO press|pages=206–207|url=http://whc.unesco.org/fr/sessions/39COM/documents/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Heritage Committee decided to defer the nomination in order to allow for a revision and renewed submission taking into account the recommendations of the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]-evaluation and seeking the guidance and advice by ICOMOS in the process.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2015): WHC-15/39.COM/19.{{cite book|title=Decisions adopted at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (Bonn, 2015).|publisher= UNESCO press|pages=206–207|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/39COM/documents/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On 1 February 2016, Germany submitted a renewed submission to the [[World Heritage Centre]] in [[Paris]], [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1.{{cite book|title=Nominations to the World Heritage List (Krakow, 2017).|publisher= UNESCO press|page=54|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomination was discussed at the 41st meeting of the World Heritage Committee in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], from 2 until 12 July 2017 where the Committee decided upon the Outstanding Universal Value of the Naumburg Cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=41st session of the World Heritage Committee in Krakow|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany submitted the revised nomination "Naumburg Cathedral" on  1 February 2018. However, only [[Naumburg Cathedral]] was listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] on July 1, 2018. The German officials were indifferent about the decision of excluding the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

=== Cultural landscape ===
The cultural landscape around the Naumburg Cathedral  is a [[cultural landscape]] that illustrates the "evolution of human society and settlement over time".&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO (2016): WHC.16/01. {{cite book|title=Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention.|page=11|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This landscape was created intentionally by man.&lt;ref name="Rössler2"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=World Heritage Centre|title=Cultural landscapes: The challenges of conservation|chapter-url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/publications|last=Rössler|first=Mechtild|chapter=Linking Nature and Culture: World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.|year=2002|publisher=UNESCO press|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut displays the rise of the [[Central Middle Ages]] in Europe.&lt;ref name="Le Goff"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Haverkamp|editor-first=Alfred|editor2-last=Schieder|editor2-first=Wolfgang|title=Aufbruch und Gestaltung, Deutschland 1056-1273, Volume 1.|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cz3bPMw_7h4C&amp;pg=PA407|last=Le Goff|first=Jacques|chapter=The High Middle Ages.|year=1992|publisher=C.H. Beck|isbn=3406302653|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time of rise, a ″take off″ due to an [[Population growth|increase in population]], [[Christianization]] and major transformation in [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name="″Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Classen|editor-first=Albrecht|title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms –Methods-Trends.|last=Newmann|first=Jonathan M.|chapter=Narratology and Literary Theory in Medieval Studies.|year=1992|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=3110267306|page=982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ″Landesausbau″, [[Urban planning|urban development]], internal [[colonization]] and territorialisation, took place all across [[Europe]]. ″Never again has Europe seen such cultural and institutional uniformity as at that time″.&lt;ref name="″Simms"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Smyth|editor-first=William J.|editor2-last=Wehlan|editor2-first=Kevin|title=Common Ground: Essays on the Historical Geography of Ireland presented to T.

The nominated area serves as an extraordinary model region due to the density and quality of elements displaying mediaeval land development and land exploitation. It was a melting pot of populations of different origins, [[Franks|Frankish]], [[Thuringian]], [[Saxon]], [[Flemish]], and [[Slavs|Slavonic]]. Furthermore, as a sensitive border region, it was shaped by [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] and secular powers seeking the rights of possession, representation and defense. &lt;br /&gt;
In the nominated landscape, 720 elements from the period of the [[Central Middle Ages]] are still in use, establish the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] of the region and give testimony of the shaping of border lands during a period of no more than 200 years in the [[High Middle Ages]], which has in this instance been tangibly preserved to present day.&lt;ref name="″Denyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Taylor|editor-first=Ken|editor2-last=Clair|editor2-first=Archer S.|editor3-last=Mitchell|editor3-first=Nora J.|title=Conserving Cultural Landscapes: Challenges and New Directions.|last=Newmann|first=Jonathan M.|chapter=Sustaining the Outstanding Universal Value of World Heritage Cultural Landscapes.|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415744058|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Component: Naumburg ===
==== Naumburg Cathedral ====
Naumburg Cathedral is known for its [[architecture]], [[sculpture]]s and images: ″The harmonic connection between architecture, sculpture and stained glass windows in the west choir of the cathedral counts among the most impressive creations of human creativity in the Middle Ages at large.″&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Jeffrey Hamburger, Harvard University, Prof. Dr. Dany Sandron, Université de Paris-Sorbonne,  Prof. Dr. Stefan Tebruck, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen a.o.(2017).{{cite book|title=The outstanding significance of the Naumburg Cathedral and the cultural landscape on the rivers Saale and Unstrut.|publisher= Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut|pages=1–2|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/sessions/41com/|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] core structure is flanked by two [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[Rood screen|choirs]] in the east and in the west, built in the transitional style between [[Romanesque architecture|Late Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]].&lt;ref name="″Wixom"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin v. 46, no. 3|title=Medieval Sculpture at the Cloisters.|last=Wixom|first=William D.|chapter=Medieval Sculpture.|year=1988|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Naumburg Masters =====
[[File:Naumburg Masters.jpg|thumb|Naumburg Masters]]
The worldwide known workshop of [[Sculpture|sculptors]] and [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]], which was likely established in the early [[13th century]], known as the [[Naumburg Master]]s, was headed by a sculptor-architect, who has been described by scholars as ″an artist of real genius″.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Janson|editor-first=Horst W.|editor2-last=Janson|editor2-first=Anthony F.|title=History of Art: The Western Tradition.|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415929356|page=407}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality of the work of the Naumburg Masters, marked by an extraordinary realism and individualism of sculptures and a detailed representation of the environment such as plants or ornaments, has justified Naumburg’s reputation beyond its region. The Naumburg Masters were conveyors and pioneers of the innovations in architecture and sculpture of the Late [[Hohenstaufen]] period in the [[13th century]].&lt;ref name="Willamson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Paul|title=Gothic Sculpture, 1140—1300.|date=October 1995|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300074522|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their building workshop has left traces of its work all the way from Northern [[France]] over the Middle [[Rhine]] area up to the eastern boundaries of the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Empire]] and further on the southwestern [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Skulptur, Architektur und Bautechnik des Naumburger Westchors|trans-title=Sculpture, Architecture and Building Techniques of the West Choir of Naumburg.|page=383|author=Dominik Jelschewski|publisher=Pustet, Friedrich GmbH|date=2015|language=German|isbn=3791726005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reflects the cultural artistic exchange during the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Der Naumburger Dom St. Peter and Paul - Ein Kleinod der europäischen Kulturgete.

===== Choir screens – Passion of Christ =====
[[File:West choir.jpg|thumb|West choir]]
One feature of the Naumburg Cathedral is its two almost completely preserved [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] screen structures from the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reeve|first=Matthew M.|title=Reading Gothic Architecture|date=2008|publisher=l'Université du Michigan|isbn=9782503525365|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the east choir, the only late [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] hall choir screen has survived. In the west choir, there is a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] partition-type screen: ″Even within the tiny corpus of medieval churches whose original configurations of architecture and sculpture remain intact, the arrangement at Naumburg is unique.″&lt;ref name="Jung"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen. Space, sculpture, and community in the cathedrals of France and Germany ca. 1200-1400|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=EW31mRyo8acC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jacqueline+E.+Jung:+The+gothic+screen.&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJyJ7P_OLTAhUG0xoKHVLwBzcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacqueline%20E.%20Jung%3A%20The%20gothic%20screen|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107022959|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The western mural choir screen shows artistic quality in terms of architecture, ornamentation and figural sculptures: ″The mid-thirteenth-century west choir of Naumburg Cathedral has long been admired both for its unified architectural design″.″&lt;ref name="Jung2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Jacqueline E.|title=The gothic screen.

The conceptually sophisticated arrangement of the [[Passion of Jesus|passion of Christ]] is one of the most outstanding among the preserved sculptural ensembles from the 13th century, providing i.a. detailed information on contemporary clothing. The [[Naumburg Master]] achieved a degree of dramatic expressiveness and natural vibrancy that conveys the suffering of [[Christ]] and the deep grief of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and St. John.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=L´Arte Medievale nel contesto 300-1300.

===== Founder statues – Uta =====
[[File:Uta from Naumburg.jpg|thumb|[[Uta von Ballenstedt]] statue, located in the west choir of the Naumburg Cathedral]]
[[File:Founder figures Hermann und Reglindis.jpg|thumb|left|Founder figures Hermann und Reglindis]]
The Early Gothic west choir was built with an elevated gallery portraying the founders. The life-sized representation of a group of 12 people of the high nobility that were neither emperor neither king is unique in [[History of art|art history]] : ″The twelve founder statues […] are extraordinary in many aspects. A series of monumental representations of secular male and female founders of the cathedral of Naumburg, the statues are characterized by startling vividness and by theatrical interaction″.&lt;ref name="Karge2"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hispanic Research Journal|title=Iberian and Latin American Studies |last=Karge|first=Henrik|chapter=From Naumburg to Burgos. European sculpture and dynastic politics in the thirteenth century|year=2012|publisher=Hispanic Research Journal|pages=432–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statues are considered ″sculptural ensemble of the major arts″&lt;ref name="Karge"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Colum|editor-first=Huriane|title=From Minor To Major. The Minor Arts in Medieval Art History|last=Wolter|first=Harald|chapter=Secular Arts: Their Order and Importance|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University|pages=66–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to their expressiveness and to the individualized portraits.

One founder couple, [[Ekkehard II]], [[List of margraves of Meissen|Margrave of Meissen]], with his wife [[Uta von Ballenstedt]], stands in the north. Margravess Uta is presented like a queen with a fleur-de-lis crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dallafinedelmondo.blogspot.de/2015/06/maestro-di-naumburg-uta-von-ballenstedt.html|title=Master of Naumburg|publisher=Daniel di Schüler|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture of Uta has experienced an unparalleled cult, due considerably to photographs taken by the Naumburger photographer Walter Hege in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Uta von Naumburg.

===== Glass painting =====
[[File:West choir Naumburg.jpg|thumb|West choir Naumburg]]
The window paintings of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the [[Naumburg Master]], together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of the images of the saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishops of Naumburg]] at the bottom of the window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders were standing on the same level as the medals.

===== Old Town of Naumburg =====
[[File:Old city of Naumburg.jpg|thumb|Old city of Naumburg]]
Naumburg was a [[Episcopal see|bishop’s seat]] and an important [[Market (place)|market place]] founded at the beginning of the [[11th century]] on the place of the former [[Slavs|Slav]] fortress of [[Wethau]]. The development of the town is closely connected with one of the most powerful and noble Ekkehardine dynasty of that time, [[Emperor Conrad II]] and [[Bishop of Zeitz|Bishop Hildeward of Zeitz]]. 
With the consent of the [[pope John XIX]] and the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Konrad II]], as well as citing the danger of Slav incursions, [[margrave]] Ekkerhard I relocated the [[Episcopal see|Episcopal See]] of Zeitz to Naumburg. Along with the bishop’s seat he transferred his own family seat from Kleinjena to their own estate at the new castle ″Nuwemburch″ in Naumburg around 1028. Furthermore, he assigned the protection of the See to the ″new castle″, an event hitherto unparalleled in the history of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vereinigte-domstifter.de/en/foundation/the-combined-cathedral-chapters/domstift-naumburg|title=

In 1033, another highly unusual event for this time took place: On the initiative of the bishop Kadeloh of Memleben, Emperor Conrad II granted the merchants of Kleinjena, who moved to Naumburg free trade and the heritable, interest-free ownership of their enclosed domicile.&lt;ref name="Reuter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reuter|first=Timothy|title=Germany in the Early Middle Ages c.800 – 1056 (Longman History of Germany)|date= 2013|publisher=Lucent Books|isbn=9780582081567|pages=42–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the earliest dated written document from 13 July 1033, that marked the Nuvemburg to the powerful market and merchant settlement in Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Urkundenbuch des Hochstifts Naumburg: Teil 1 (967-1207)|trans-title=The book of documents of the Bishopric Naumburg: Part1 |page=26|author=Rosenfeld, Felix|publisher=Magdeburg|date=1925|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Margraves Ekkehard II and Hermann also established two monasteries, the [[Benedictine monastery|Benedictine Monastery]] of St. George and the St Moritz Monastery. When the Ekkehardine dynasty died out by 1046, the bishops became the rulers of the town. By that time, Naumburg had already developed into a political, economic and religious center for the entirety of this border region. The trade routes in the region were relocated to Naumburg, which was strategically situated at the crossing of the [[Via Regia]] and the Regensburg Road.&lt;ref name="Jeep3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia|date=October 2001|publisher=Garland|isbn=9781135575069|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nowadays, the roads as well as parcel structures reflect the structure of the medieval civil town. The earliest stone buildings in Naumburg are situated in the cathedral precincts with the oldest residential tower of Naumburg with two Romanesque floors constructed probably in the mid-12th century at the cathedral precincts.

The old town of Freyburg is situated 9 kilometers north of Naumburg on the left bank of the Unstrut River. This component contains Neuenburg Castle above the river valley.

==== Neuenburg Castle ====
[[File:Neuenburg Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|Neuenburg Chapel]]
Around 1090, it was most probably [[Louis the Springer]]  who built the vast and impressive complex of Neuenburg Castle. Situated in the border region, this fortified castle served military purposes and reflected ambitions, self-confidence and sophistication of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowingians]]. Already in 1100, Neuenburg Castle was the largest and most important fortification in central Germany and remained of outstanding political and military significance until the [[13th century]]. It was designed as a border castle for the powerful Ludowinger dynasty and was part of a network of the landgraves’ castles, which also included [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die romanische Neuenburg bei Freyburg (Unstrut) und ihre Stellung im hochmittelalterlichen Burgenbau.

[[File:Neuenburg Castle.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg at night]]
Built around 1090, Neuenburg Castle was extended and modernized on a large scale several times. With its 30 000 square meters, the [[castle]] was amongst the strongest architectural representations of military power in all of the empire. It has survived to a remarkable extend: Major sections of the curtain walls in the north and east, part of the gate, the bottom part of the cattle, the castle keep, trenches in the east and in the south are conserved until today. The [[landmark]] big William (Dicker Wilhelm) is situated in the north-eastern part of the complex and visible from far away as a symbol of power. The castle keep III is classified as an independent development next to the French residential towers (donjons) which produced similar examples in the [[Rhineland]] region. Around 1225, a residential tower (residential tower II) was built probably for the landgrave’s family outside the southern curtain wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schloß Neuenburg bei Freyburg/Unstrut.

[[File:Residence building at Neuenburg.jpg|thumb|Residence building at Neuenburg]]
The court culture of the [[Count palatine|Count Palatine]] at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire at the end of the [[12th century in Germany|12th]] and beginning of the [[13th century]]. The most important poets of the 13th century, namely [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]  and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]]  stayed at Neuenburg Castle. Heinrich von Weldecke completed here the [[Eneas]] novel which was the foundation of the [[German language]] secular epic. ″When Veldeke was called to the court of Thuringia [..], he joined the entourage of a great patron and became the esteemed center of the most important literary circle that existed in Germany at the time″.&lt;ref name="Bunke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bunke|first=Joachim|title=Courtly Culture: Literature and Society in the High Middle Ages|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520066342|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Old town of Freyburg ====
[[File:Neuenburg view from Freyburg.jpg|thumb|Neuenburg view from Freyburg]]
In the last quarter of the 12th, [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Herman I]] from the [[Ludowinger]] dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built at the food of Neuenburg Castle around a rectangular market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the [[Unstrut|Unstrut River]]. The [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ″frey″ (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Freyburg an der Unstrut – Ein Beispiel landesherrlicher Städtepolitik.

The landgraves were not directly present in the town but resided in Neuenburg Castle. [[Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgrove Ludwig IV]] and his wife, the later Saint [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], built the town parish church of St Mary’s to emphasize the baronial need for representation.&lt;ref name="Heinemeyer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brekle|editor-first=Herbert E.|editor2-last=Dobnig-Jiilich|editor2-first=Edeltraud a.o.|title=New German Biography (NDB)|last=Barrera|first=Magdalena|chapter=Ludwig IV the Saint, Landgrave of Thuringia and Count Palatine of Saxony. |year=1987|publisher=Duncker &amp; Humblot|isbn= 3428001826|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital ornamentation in the entrance area with its diamond-shaped net and the Romanesque sculpting of the compact [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] is of outstanding quality in the way of the curves of the bodies and the graphic lines of the figures were sculptured. 
Freyburg’s regular layout is a grid of roads crossing each other in right angles, a distinct transverse axis and its nearly exact subdivision in blocks. After the extinction of the [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger dynasty]] in 1247, the city lost its significance but continued its [[viticulture]] for which it is still known in the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beziehungen zwischen Kulturlandschaften und Tourismus.

==== Zscheiplitz Monastery ====
[[File:Church in Zscheiplitz.jpg|thumb|Church in Zscheiplitz]]
The [[Benedictine]] convent of nuns, the Zscheiplitz Monastery, was first mentioned in 1203 and is situated two kilometers west of Freyburg. The name of Zscheiplitz has its roots in the Slavic name ″ciplic″ (small). Around 1085, after the murder of [[Friedrich III, Landgraf of Thuringia|landgrave Friedrich III]], his widow Adelheid donated the estate of Zscheiplitz to the church. It was then turned into a Benedictine monastery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Zscheiplitz. Sühnekirche, Kloster, Rittergut, Dorfkirche, Weingut.

The church of Zscheiplitz was built as a one-nave church in the 12th century and extended by a gallery to the west and in the north during the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zscheiplitz.com/history/|title=Official Website of the Zscheiplitz Monastery|publisher=zscheiplitz monastery|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vineyard of Schweigenberg ====
The [[vineyard]] of Schweigenberg is located west of Freyburg and was probably created by citizens of Freyburg upon the initiative of the [[List of rulers of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and / or the monasteries of Goseck and Zscheiplitz in the 13th century. It benefitted from favorable climatic conditions and agrarian innovations for a diversified subsistence economy in the region. This vineyard is still recognized in Germany as a prime example of [[Wine-growing in Germany|terraced winegrowing]] by way of hoe-farming as a monument of this traditional form of cultivation.

=== Component: Pforta ===
[[File:Pforta from air.jpg|thumb|left|Pforta from air]]
The [[Pforta|monastery of Pforta]]  was created by the [[Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kloster-pforta.de/#/#4/|title=Official Website of Pforta Monastery|publisher=Pforta monastery|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premises include functional buildings, the Romanesque House ([[Monastic grange|grange]]), the Kleine Saale [[canal]], as well as the vineyards of Köppelberg and Saalhäuser. The ensemble of Cistercian monuments attests to the order’s life and work and embodies the significant influence exerted in the wider [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]] and beyond the boundaries of the region.

==== History ====
[[File:Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Monastery Pforta]]
Pforta Monastery was founded around 1132 on the initiative of [[Bishopric of Naumburg-Zeitz|bishop Udo I of Naumburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Sankt Marien zur Pforte.''In: Förderverein Welterbe an Saale und Unstrut e.V.:''Macht.Glaube.Glanz: Auf dem Weg zum Welterbe.|trans-title= The Cistercian monastery Sankt Marien to Pforta.

The name of Porta, meaning Porta Coeli – i.e. Pearly Gates – , refers to the architecture of the richly ornamented western façade of the minster with its Roman triumphal arch portal and a gallery underneath the crucifixion group that did not at all correspond to the strict stipulations of the order.

==== Architecture ====
[[File:Facade of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|left|Facade of Monastery Pforta]]
The [[minster (church)|minster]] was built in the 1130s in the plain character of the [[Cistercian architecture|Cistercians monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Jeep"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeep|first=John M.|title=Germany. An Encyclopedia.|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203801765|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1251, the Cistercians decided on an ambitious building project. Even though the new church building with its west façade was still ascetic in the interior decor, it clearly reflected the significant economic and political power of the monastery. The Gothic [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the minster is the architectural example of the regional [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] reception with French roots, transferring the latest shapes and forms inspired by French Gothic design and adapting them to local conditions. The glass paintings of the church, including in Europe’s oldest Cistercian tracery rose window preserved almost completely together with its glazing, are an extraordinary treasure of medieval paintings.
[[File:Chapel of Monastery Pforta.jpg|thumb|Chapel of Monastery Pforta]]
The so-called Abbot’s Chapel (Abtskapelle) is considered to be an outstanding architectural example of the medieval infirmaries and nursing wards of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]]. Before its conversion into an [[abbot]]’s home, it had been part of the infirmary wing, allowing people to participate in the mass from there. Rare elements were found in the structure such as the latrine and the chamber of the [[Hospital|infirmary]].

==== Hydraulic system ====
In 1180, the [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] created the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] mill race called ″Kleine Saale″ (Little Saale), a [[canal]] of 10 kilometers length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Kulturlandschaft um Schulpforta.

The Benedictine monks of St George, the canons of St Moritz in Naumburg, and the Naumburg cathedral chapter participated in the costs and maintenance of the Kleine Saale in return for rights of utilization. Maintenance work was managed by a water expert from Pforta Monastery and the highest-ranking fisherman from the Naumburg. The Kleine Saale shows the Cistercian [[hydraulic engineering]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Wirtschaftstätigkeit der Zisterzienser im Mittelalter, Agrarwirtschaft.''In:'' Wirtschaft und Kulturlandschaft.|pages=84–112|trans-title=The economy of the Cisterciansin the Middle-Ages.

==== Grange ====
The Romanesque House is an impressive piece of evidence of a former [[Monastic grange|grange]] of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], Naumburg, [[Jena]] and [[Erfurt]]. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their service, offering the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As a result of its aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the [[Margravate of Meissen|margraviates of Meissen]] and [[Lower Lusatia]] – and thus to [[Silesia]] – without being charged [[tax]]es or dues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Das Zisterzienserkloster Pforte: die Urkundenfälschungen und die frühe Geschichte bis 1236.|trans-title=The Cistercian monastery Pforta: Document fraud and early history until 1236.|author=Kunde, Holger|publisher=Böhlau Verlag|date=2003|language=German.|isbn=9783412146016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Winemaking ====
The Cistercian monks set about profitably using the land they had bought in a single-minded, well-planned and versatile way. Economic activities of the Cistercians included quarrying, the planting of vines on the slopes of the Saale and other suitable areas, the planting of [[orchard]]s, the establishment of smithies, workshops for weaving, fur production and shoe-making, the setting-up of bakeries and cheese dairies as well as intense sheep rearing, grain growing, timber rafting and fishing. The Cistercians expanded their property from the Köppelberg vineyard, and created nine steep [[Vineyard|slope vineyards]] between 1195 and 1208. At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], the monastery owned 58 vineyards between Bad Kösen and Roßbach. Cellar and wine masters at Pforta ensured high quality in wine making, measuring it according to vinum bonum (1226), vinum melius (1289) or vinum terrestre (country wine, around 1340).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Zisterzienser und ihre Weinberge in Brandenburg.Studien zur Geschichte, Kunst und Kultur der Zisterzienser.|trans-title=The Cistercians and their vineyards in Brandenburg.

The area provided moderate climate, fertile soils, rich water sources and wood supply through forests and was populated by [[Stone Age]] hunters 380 000 years ago . From the [[Neolithic Age]]  onwards throughout all [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], the area was settled.&lt;ref name="Bogucki"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogucki|first=Peter|title=Forest Farmers and Stockherders.

=== The Early Middle Ages ===
[[File:Ebersorda.jpg|thumb|Ebersorda]]
The [[Migration Period]]  brought decisive changes from 375 AD onwards and also had an influence on the [[Saale-Unstrut|Saale-Unstrut region]]. The local population, consisting of migrating [[Germanic peoples|Germanic Varini]] and Angles, merged to form the [[Thuringians]]. Following the defeat of the Thuringian army by Frankish troops in 531, the [[Merovingians]] as Frankish rulers settled groups of [[Frisians]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and probably also [[Hessian (soldier)|Hessians]] to the south and north of the Unstrut in exchange for payment of [[Lay Tithes|tithes]].&lt;ref name="Steuer"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Fries-Knoblach|editor-first=Janine|editor2-last=Steuer|editor2-first=Heiko|title=The Baiuvarii and Thuring|last=Steuer|first=Heiko|chapter=Thuringians and Bavarians – Location in Space and Time and Social Relations|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843839156|pages=111–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumminger"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wood|editor-first=Ian|title=Franks and Alamanni in the Merovingian Period: An Ethnographic Perspective|last=Dumminger|first=Areas F.|chapter=Dwellings, settlements and settlement patterns of the sixth and seventh centuries in southwest Germany and adjacent areas.|year=2014|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn= 9781843830351|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These settlers were met by [[Sorbs (tribe)|Slav Sorb tribes]] originating from the region of the [[Dnieper]], who came westward as far as the [[Saale|River Saale]], crossed it repeatedly and beginning to settle on its western banks. The [[Sorbs]]  had more than 50 civitates, meaning central strongholds with relating settlements. Such a fortified district or “Gau” developed on the site of today’s town of Naumburg and was called “Wethau”; the centre was a Sorb castle complex in Wettaburg (now an urban district of Naumburg) .
The region by the Saale and Unstrut rivers had thus become a sensitive border area because it marked the border between the peoples of Germanic and [[Slavs|Slav]] origin and also the north-eastern border of [[Christianity]] in continental [[Europe]].

In 766, a successful Frankish attack was launched against Wettaburg Castle, that was the headquarters of the [[Sorbs]] in the Saale-Unstrut region. The [[Frankish empire|Frankish Empire]] was at its largest during the reign of [[Pepin the Short|Pippin]]’s son [[Charlemagne]] (768 – 814).

As elsewhere, Christianization ran parallel to military subjugation in the Saxon area.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Richard A.|title=The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity.|date=1999|publisher=University of California Press|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Saale]] remained the lasting natural border with the Slavic territories. In conjunction with the hinterland, the Saale was protected from possible attacks from the east by a chain of closely neighboring strongholds and fortifications,including the ″[[Limes Sorabicus]]″. &lt;br /&gt;
The territory of the [[Frankish Empire]] extended in the first quarter of the [[9th century]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the Elbe and Saale in the east, from the [[North Sea]] in the north to [[Central Italy]] in the south.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Michael E.|title=A Sacred Kingdom: Bishops and the Rise of Frankish Kingship|date=2011|publisher=Catholic University of America Press|isbn=9780813218779|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus most of Christian Europe was united in [[Charlemagne]]’s hands.

In 919, Heinrich, the duke of Saxony, also known as [[Henry the Fowler]], became king of the Franks and the Saxons. As a result, the Saale-Unstrut region moved from a peripheral position in the Frankish empire to the focus of political interest. Heinrich expanded his power along the eastern border of the Empire by conquering the Slav tribes (928/929) and defeating the [[Hungarians]] by the Unstrut in 933.&lt;ref name="Emmerson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emmerson|first=Richard K.|title=Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedi.|date=2013|publisher=Routeledge|isbn=9780415973854|page=314}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of Heinrich I’s expansion policy and the conquest of the Slav tribes, the character of the area east of the Saale and Unstrut changed from a direct border area to a connecting region between the old settlement land to the west and the newly conquered regions by the Elbe.&lt;ref name="Leyser"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leyser|first=Karl|title=Medieval Germany and its Neighbours, 900-1250.|date=1982|publisher=A&amp;C Black|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
With the consent of the Pope and the German Imperial bishops, the Emperor arranged for [[diocese]]s and bishop’s churches to be established in [[Merseburg Cathedral|Merseburg]], [[Zeitz]] and [[Meissen]] in 968, forming a new church province for the eastern part of the Empire within the equally newly founded [[archbishopric of Magdeburg]].

==== The High Middle Ages ====

From the [[10th century]] onwards, the Ekkehardine dynasty gained influence in the Empire. Contemporaneous Bishop [[Thietmar of Merseburg]] described the first prominent representative of this house, [[Ekkehard I]], as a person with an outstanding lack of humility ″He was an ornament to the Empire, a treasure of the land, a hope for his subjects and a terror to his enemies and he would have been completely perfect if he had only been able to remain humble″.&lt;ref name="Merseburg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merseburg|first=Thietmar of|title=Chronicles V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the murder of the margrave Ekkehard I on 30 April 1002, Ekkehard’s sons, Margrave Hermann (1009 – 1038) and [[Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen|Margrave Ekkehard II]] (1009 – 1046), assumed power in 1009. They became the most powerful rulers in the eastern part of the Empire and moved their family seat from Kleinjena to the ″Neue Burg″ (New Castle, Naumburg). The rise of Naumburg as ecclesiastical, political, cultural and economic centre of the Saale-Unstrut region had begun.&lt;ref name="Bagge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bagge|first=Sverre|title=Kings, Politics, and the Right Order of the World in German Historiography: C. 950-1150.|date=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9780415973854|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it has to be emphasized that Sorb ″Smurds″ and German residents lived largely peacefully alongside each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Slaven und Deutsche.

The [[bishops of Naumburg]], the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|landgraves of Thuringia]] and the [[margraves of Meissen]] as lords of the town of Naumburg promoted a systematic development of the city into the most important town in the Saale-Unstrut region. In March 1131, Bishop Udo I met the Cistercian abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] at the Imperial Diet in Liège in March 1131, a meeting of central significance for the propagation of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian order]] in the Empire. As a result, a delegation of monks from the Walkenried Cistercian monastery moved to a location next to Naumburg in 1137/1138. The founding of the Cistercian Pforta Monastery contributed to the propagation of the Order on to Eastern Europe. One of the greatest achievements of Pforta Monastery was furthermore the settlement of peasants in these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Mittelalter.|trans-title=Middle Ages. |author=Müller, Harald|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co|date=2008|language=German|isbn=9783050043661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called ″Landesausbau″ in the High Middle Ages was supplemented by military protection of the positions already achieved.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Due to increase of population, new public assignments of protection and administration for the diocese of Naumburg led to crucial changes in social structure. The prestige attained by the Naumburg bishop’s seat is expressed by the construction of a new cathedral around 1210 during the period of office of Bishop Engelhard (1206 – 1242).&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
For the Saale-Unstrut region, the Ludowingers were, together with the Wettin dynasty, the most influential aristocratic dynasty during the 12th and the 13th century. The Ludowingers created a princely court culture modeled to equal royal forms. The magnificent court of Count Palatine Hermann of Saxony (1181 – 1217) at Neuenburg Castle was an extremely important center of literary activities in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Im Schatten der Landgrafen: Studien zur adeligen Herrschaftsbildung im hochmittelalterlichen Thüringen.|trans-title=In the shadow of the margraves.

The [[Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt|Wettins]], with Margrave Heinrich the Illustrious (1221 – 1288), were appointed as margraves to the east of the Saale. They were able to expand their territories and achieved political dominance in the whole Central German region during the [[13th century in Germany|13th century]], creating most favorable conditions for their homelands in the Saale-Unstrut region. The cooperation of the Cistercians with the Wettin and [[Ludovingians|Ludowinger]] dynasties contributed to the transfer of spiritual, cultural and technological knowledge into the areas intended for colonization. Nevertheless, the economic emphasis moved gradually towards the east during the [[Late Middle Ages]], when the importance of the relatively young [[Leipzig|town of Leipzig]] outdid that of the old trade fair town of Naumburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Die Bedeutung der Zisterzienser für die Ostsiedlung, besonders in Ostschlesien.|trans-title=The importance of the Cistercians for the Eastern Settlement|page=68|author=Gottschalck, Joseph|publisher=Zeitschrift für Ostforschung|date=1966|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the late Middle Ages to the Present ===
Following the [[Reformation]] instigated by [[Martin Luther]](1485 – 1546) in nearby [[Wittenberg]], the Wettins and the region’s nobility turned to [[Protestantism]], promoting and funding the reformers. As a result of the alliance of Protestant rulers and spiritual leaders, the monasteries and religious establishments in Naumburg, Goseck, Zscheiplitz and Pforta were closed between 1533 and 1540 and their endowments and properties confiscated. Only the property rights held by the Naumburg Cathedral chapter remained untouched.&lt;ref name="Ocker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ocker|first=Christopher|title=Church Robbers and Reformers in Germany, 1525-1547: Confiscation and Religious Purpose in the Holy Roman Empire.|date=2006|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=9789004152069|pages=50–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

From the [[18th century]] on, the castles along the Saale and Unstrut amidst their cultural landscape became prime subjects of [[Romanticism|romantic]] admiration. As a result of the [[First Congress of Vienna|Congress of Vienna]], the [[kingdom of Saxony]] was forced to cede territories to the Prussian king in 1815. The landscape by the [[Saale]] and [[Unstrut]] now became part of the [[Prussian state]] until the end of the [[Second World War]]. Unlike many other regions, no drastic changes due to [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] altered this landscape.
It was due to Walter Hege’s photographs published in 1925, that the founder figure of [[Uta of Schauenburg|Uta]] became enormously popular but was exploited during the [[National Socialists]]’ regime. The regime turned Neuenburg Castle into a training centre for senior leaders of the German Girls’ Association (BDM) and the school at Pforta Monastery into a National Political Education Centre (NAPOLA) until the end of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Forschungen zum Kloster Schulpforta: Ergebnisse eines Arbeitsprojektes im Rahmen des Graduiertenkollegs "Kunstwissenschaft-Bauforschung-Denkmalpflege" der Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg und der Technischen Universität Berlin.|trans-title=Research on Monastery Pforta: Results of a working project and the Technical University Berlin. |author=Hubel, Achim; Cramer, Johannes|publisher=Janos Stekovics|date=2003|language=German|isbn=9783899230253}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
The Saale-Unstrut region was spared destruction during the [[Second World War]]. The liberation by American troops in the spring of 1945 was followed in the summer of the same year by hand-over of the area to the [[Red Army]] and the Saale-Unstrut region thus became part of [[East Germany]] (GDR). There was no attempt in the Saale-Unstrut area to demolish old town quarters. After the [[Reunification of Germany|reunification of the two German states]] in 1990 the well-preserved cultural landscape of the Saale-Unstrut region became part of the [[Saxony-Anhalt|Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt]].

'''Negative atheism''', also called '''weak atheism''' and '''soft atheism''', is any type of atheism where a person does not believe in the existence of any deities but does not explicitly assert that there are none.  '''Positive atheism''', also called '''strong atheism''' and '''hard atheism''', is the form of [[atheism]] that additionally asserts that no [[Deity|deities]] exist.&lt;!--

The terms "negative atheism" and "positive atheism" were used by [[Antony Flew]] in 1976&lt;ref name="Flew1976"/&gt; and have appeared in [[George H. Smith]]'s&lt;ref name="Smith1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080713012926/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies - an excerpt]; George H.

"negative atheism, the position of not believing a theistic God exists" / "positive atheism: the position of disbelieving a theistic God exists"; p.&amp;nbsp;464: "Clearly, positive atheism is a special case of negative atheism: Someone who is a positive atheist is by necessity a negative atheist, but not conversely".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of application==
Because of flexibility in the term [[god (word)|''god'']], it is possible that a person could be a positive/strong atheist in terms of certain [[conceptions of God]], while remaining a negative/weak atheist in terms of others. For example, the God of [[classical theism]] is often considered to be a personal supreme being who is [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]], [[omnipresent]], and [[omnibenevolent]], caring about humans and human affairs. One might be a positive atheist for such a deity (see [[problem of evil]]), while being a negative atheist with respect to a [[deism|deistic]] conception of God by rejecting belief in such a deity but not explicitly asserting it to be false.

Positive and negative atheism are frequently used by the philosopher [[George H. Smith]] as synonyms of the less-well-known categories of [[implicit and explicit atheism]], also relating to whether an individual holds a specific view that gods do not exist.&lt;ref name="Smith1"/&gt;  "''Positive''" atheists explicitly assert that it is false that any deities exist. "''Negative''" atheists assert they do not believe any deities exist, but do not explicitly assert it is ''true'' that no deity exists. Those who do not believe any deities exist, but do not assert such non-belief, are included among ''implicit atheists''. Among "implicit" atheists are thus included the following: children and adults who have never heard of deities; people who have heard of deities but have never given the idea any considerable thought; and those agnostics who suspend belief about deities, but do not reject such belief. All ''implicit'' atheists are included in the ''negative/weak'' categorization.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000831235652/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm The Case Against God - en excerpt]; George H. Smith; 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-negative-atheism-247866|title=Are You a Negative Atheist?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the negative atheism classification, agnostics atheists. The validity of this categorization is disputed, however, and a few prominent atheists such as [[Richard Dawkins]] avoid it. In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Dawkins describes people for whom the [[Spectrum of theistic probability|probability of the existence of God]] is between "very high" and "very low" as "agnostic" and reserves the term "strong atheist" for those who claim to know there is no God. He categorizes himself as a "[[de facto]] atheist" but ''not'' a "strong atheist" on this scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[The God Delusion]], pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt;  Within negative atheism, philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] further distinguishes between [[Agnosticism|agnostics]], who find the claim "God exists" uncertain, and [[Theological noncognitivism|theological noncognitivists]], who consider all talk of gods to be meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |year=2006 |title=Worshipping an Unknown God |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00339.x |journal=Ratio |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=442 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.2006.00339.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate meanings==
[[Jacques Maritain]] used the negative/positive phrases as early as 1949, but with a different meaning and in the context of a strictly [[Catholic]] [[apologist]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |authorlink=Jacques Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |quote=By positive atheism I mean an active struggle against everything that reminds us of God – that is to say, anti-theism rather than atheism – and at the same time a desperate, I would say heroic, effort to recast and reconstruct the whole human universe of thought and the whole human scale of values according to that state of war against God. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archivedate=2005-11-13 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goparaju Ramachandra Rao]] (1902–1975), better known by his [[nickname]] Gora, was an [[India]]n social reformer, anti-caste activist, and atheist. He proposed a philosophy he called "positive atheism", which treated atheism as a way of life in his 1972 book, ''Positive Atheism''.&lt;ref name="gorapositive"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robyn E. Lebron|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...Can There Be Common Ground?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KILFE33zGngC&amp;pg=PA532|accessdate=2013-09-08|date=January 2012|publisher=CrossBooks|isbn=978-1-4627-1262-5|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) uses the term ''positive atheism'' in the sense of putting a positive face to atheism and dispelling the false and negative image of atheism portrayed by religious people, especially in places of worship. ''Positive Atheism Magazine'' "sees atheism as being a positive, healthy outlook -- much healthier than any theistic approach to life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000823031822/http://www.positiveatheism.org/mission.htm What is Positive Atheism?]; Positive Atheism Magazine; November, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnostics are not always merely implicit atheists. For instance, [[Philip Pullman]], the English author of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' fantasy trilogy, which has atheism as a major theme, is an explicit atheist,&lt;ref name=PullmanAtheist01&gt;"As an atheist I'm rather on difficult ground here, but presumably this is what a Christian believes." [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2004/03/17/bodark17.xml The Dark Materials debate: life, God, the universe...] (interview of Pullman by Rowan Williams), Telegraph.co.uk, March 17, 2004 (Accessed November 12, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PullmanAtheist02&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/12/26/051226fa_fact|title='Far From Narnia'|accessdate=31 October 2007|author=Miller, Laura|format=Life and Letters article|publisher=The New Yorker|quote=he is one of England’s most outspoken atheists. ... He added, “Although I call myself an atheist, I am a Church of England atheist, and a 1662 Book of Common Prayer atheist, because that’s the tradition I was brought up in and I cannot escape those early influences.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also describes himself as technically an [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=PullmanAgnostic01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pluggedin.com/upfront/2007/sympathyforthedevil.aspx |title=Sympathy for the Devil by Adam R.

'''Politicards''' are a deck of [[playing cards]] produced each [[elections in the United States#Federal elections|election year]] in the [[United States]] with 54 [[caricatures]] depicting political candidates and prominent political figures. The first Politicards deck was produced in 1971 for the 1972 election by the artist Peter Green, the writer Lee Livingston, the businessman Mike Killeen and the designer Norman Friant.&lt;ref&gt;"What the Deuce?", ''Southland Sunday'' magazine, June 18, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, about 200,000 packs of cards were being sold during each election cycle.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt; Decks were said to have been used at the time by then New York Senator James Buckley and by the ladies of Mamie Eisenhower’s bridge club.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Stumbo, "Politicards Sweeping the Nation", ''The Los Angeles Times'', December 27, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Decks of "Politicards" have been produced for election years 1971, 1980, 1984&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Krebs, "Notes on People", ''New York Times'', August 16, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Vaillancourt, "Artist is Playing With a Full Deck", ''Glendale News-Press'', October 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1996 onwards.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt; 

The 1980 and 1984 edition decks were produced by the [[Washington, D.C.]] [[lobbyist]] [[Victor Kamber]], who purchased the Politicards name in 1979.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In 1996, the name expired and was reclaimed by the original artist Peter Green,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; who has since produced decks for every election through to 2016.&lt;ref name="glendale"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/glendale-news-press/community/tn-gnp-cartoonist-suits-up-for-the-2016-election-with-new-deck-of-political-playing-cards-20151201-story.html | title=Cartoonist suits up for the 2016 election with new deck of political playing cards | publisher= |work=Glendale News-Press | date=December 1, 2015 | accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green's 2016 edition was titled "Politikids" and depicted political figures as children.&lt;ref name="glendale"/&gt;

'''Pressure retarded osmosis''' ('''PRO''') is a technique to separate a solvent (for example, [[fresh water]]) from a solution that is more concentrated (e.g. [[sea water]]) and also pressurized. A [[semipermeable membrane]] allows the solvent to pass to the concentrated solution side by [[osmosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037673881300865X | doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2013.10.053 | volume=453 | title=Osmotic power with Pressure Retarded Osmosis: Theory, performance and trends – A review | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Membrane Science | pages=337–358 | author=Helfer Fernanda, Lemckert Charles, Anissimov Yuri G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique can be used to generate power from the [[salinity gradient]] energy resulting from the difference in the salt concentration between sea and river water.
In PRO, the [[water potential]] between [[fresh water]] and sea water corresponds to a pressure of 26 [[Bar (unit)|bar]]s. This pressure is equivalent to a column of water ([[hydraulic head]]) 270 meters high.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx How does it work?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128105625/http://www.statkraft.com/energy-sources/osmotic-power/default.aspx |date=2009-11-28 }} - [[Statkraft]]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the optimal working pressure is  only half of this, 11 to 15 bar.

== History ==

This method of generating power was invented by [[Sidney Loeb|Prof. Sidney Loeb]] in 1973 at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]], [[Beersheba]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Patent Application 42658. (July 3, 1973) [http://www.google.com/patents/US3906250 United States patent 3906250]. (Erroneously shows Israel priority as 1974 instead of 1973).
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 researchers verified that 95% of a PRO system's theoretical power output can be produced with a membrane that is half (or less) the size needed for achieving 100%. Output is proportional to the salinity. Desalination yields very salty brine, while treated municipal wastewater has relatively little salt. Combining those streams could produce energy to power both facilities. However, powering an existing wastewater treatment plant by mixing treated wastewater with seawater could require a membrane area of 2.5 million square meters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with these membrane requirements, scientists are working on rolled membranes &lt;ref&gt;"A New Kind of Power from Salt Water" Wall St. Journal, August 29–31, 2014 [https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-new-kind-of-power-from-salt-water-1409337076]&lt;/ref&gt; that will take up much less space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">The '''printing patent''' or '''printing privilege''' was a precursor of modern [[copyright]]. It was an exclusive right to print a work or a class of works.

The earliest recorded printing privilege dates from 1469, giving [[John of Speyer]] a five-year [[monopoly]] on all printing in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. In 1495, the city-state granted another monopoly on all Greek works to [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]] as a reward for his investments in a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[typeface|font]] for his [[printing press|press]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (2002) From Private to Public: Reexamining the Technological Basis for Copyright, ''Journal of Communication'', 52, 416-433&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the royal ''Code de la librairie'' of 1723 codified existing practice. It stated that there was no property in ideas or texts. Ideas, it was argued, were a gift from [[God]], revealed through the writer. [[Divine Right of Kings|God's first representative]], the [[Absolute monarchy in France|French king]] had the exclusive right to determine what could be printed by whom. Only members of the royal guild of publishers could apply for a "printing privilege", a permission and an exclusive right to print a work. Authors wishing to see their manuscript printed had no choice but to sell it to guild members. Most printing privileges were owned by the guild and automatically renewed over generations. In 1789, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] created by the [[French Revolution]] brought an end to all royal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, C. (1990) Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship in Revolutionary France, 1777-1793 ''Representations'', 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

English monarchs granted printing patents based on the [[Royal Prerogative]], with patents falling into one of two categories: ''particular patents'' gave an exclusive right to print a single work &amp;ndash; often popular, classic works written centuries earlier &amp;ndash; for a limited time, usually seven or ten years. ''General patents'' were usually granted for life and covered a class of works, such as law books or [[almanac]]s. Printing patents were independent of the private copyright system established by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], even though most printing patents were granted to members of the Company. The importance of printing privileges decreased over time, but they still existed after the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted.&lt;ref name="Patterson1968"&gt;[[Lyman Ray Patterson|Patterson, L. R.]] (1968) ''[[Copyright in Historical Perspective]]'', Vanderbilt University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The royal prerogative relating to printing patents was not removed until 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, I. (1992) The Copyright Clause of the U. S. Constitution: Why Did the Framers Include It with Unanimous Approval? ''The American Journal of Legal History'' 36(3), 361-378&lt;/ref&gt;

Various researchers have undertaken efforts to examine the '''psychological effects of Internet use'''. Some research employs studying [[brain function]]s in [[Internet]] users. Some studies assert that these changes are harmful, while others argue that asserted changes are beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/neuronculture/2010/06/17/carr-pinker-the-shallows-and-t-1/ |title=Carr, Pinker, the shallows, and the nature-nurture canard : Neuron Culture |publisher=Scienceblogs.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assertions==
American writer [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]] asserts that Internet use reduces the deep [[thinking]] that leads to true [[creativity]]. He also says that [[hyperlink]]s and [[overstimulation]] means that the brain must give most of its attention to short-term decisions. Carr also states that the [[Information overload|vast availability of information]] on the [[World Wide Web]] overwhelms the brain and hurts [[long-term memory]]. He says that the availability of stimuli leads to a very large [[cognitive load]], which makes it difficult to remember anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1 |title=Author Nicholas Carr: The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains &amp;#124; Magazine |publisher=Wired.com |date=2010-05-24 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16423330 |title=The effects of the Internet: Fast forward |publisher=The Economist |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abandonment rate of online video users for different Internet connectivities.jpg|thumbnail|In a recent study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://people.cs.umass.edu/~ramesh/Site/HOME_files/imc208-krishnan.pdf| title= Video Stream Quality Impacts Viewer Behavior, by Krishnan and Sitaraman, ACM Internet Measurement Conference|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving millions of users watching online videos, users with faster Internet connectivity (e.g., fiber) abandoned a slow-loading video at a faster rate than similar users with slower Internet connectivity (e.g., cable or mobile).  Commentators have argued that the  [[Ramesh Sitaraman|Sitaraman]] study shows that when humans get accustomed to a faster flow of information on the Internet, they become more impatient and have less tolerance for delays.&lt;ref name="nickcarr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; ]]
Computer scientist [[Ramesh Sitaraman]] has asserted that Internet users are impatient and are likely to get more impatient with time.&lt;ref name= "NPR"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/10/168974423/in-video-streaming-rat-race-fast-is-never-fast-enough/| title =NPR Morning Edition: In Video-Streaming Rat Race, Fast is Never Fast Enough, October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a large-scale research study&lt;ref name="people.cs.umass.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "sciencedaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/11/121113134805.htm| title = Science Daily: How Online Video Stream Quality Affect Viewer Behavior, November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that completed in 2012 involving millions of users watching videos on the Internet, Krishnan and Sitaraman show that users start to abandon online videos if they do not start playing within two seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/tech/web/video-loading-study/| title =CNN: Online viewers ditch slow-loading video after 2 seconds, November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition,  users with faster Internet connections (such as [[FTTH]]) showed less patience and abandoned videos at a faster rate than users with slower Internet connections. Many commentators have since argued that these results provide a glimpse into the future: as  Internet services become faster and provide more instant gratification,  people become less patient&lt;ref name="nickcarr"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.roughtype.com/?p=2069 | title= Patience is a Network Effect, by Nicholas Carr, Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;[http://edge.org/response-detail/23721 The Patience Deficit], by Nicholas Carr, Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and less able to delay gratification and work towards longer-term rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/style/2013/02/01/the-growing-culture-impatience-where-instant-gratification-makes-crave-more-instant-gratification/q8tWDNGeJB2mm45fQxtTQP/story.html?s_campaign=8315| title =Boston Globe: Instant gratification is making us perpetually impatient, Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], however, argues that people have control over what they do, and that research and reasoning never came naturally to people. He says that "experience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of the brain" and asserts that  the Internet is actually making people smarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/opinion/11Pinker.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mind%20over%20mass%20media&amp;st=cse |title=Mind Over Mass Media |publisher=The New York Times |date=2010-06-10|accessdate=4 July 2010 | first=Steven | last=Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MRI studies==
The BBC describes the research published in the peer-reviewed science journal ''[[PLoS ONE]]'':

:"A research team led by Hao Lei of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan carried out brain scans of 35 men and women aged between 14 and 21. Seventeen of them were classed as having [[Internet addiction disorder]] (IAD) on the basis of answering yes to questions such as, “Have you repeatedly made unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back or stop Internet use?”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-16505521 |title=Web addicts have brain changes, research suggests |author=Helen Briggs |work=BBC News |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialised [[MRI brain scan]]s showed changes in the [[white matter]] of the brain—the part that contains nerve fibres—in those classed as being web addicts, compared with non-addicts. Furthermore, the study says, "We provided evidences demonstrating the multiple structural changes of the brain in IAD subjects. VBM results indicated the decreased gray matter volume in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the supplementary motor area (SMA), the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the cerebellum and the left rostral ACC (rACC)."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |title=Microstructure Abnormalities in Adolescents with Internet Addiction Disorder  |vauthors=Yuan K, Qin W, Wang G, Zeng F, Zhao L, etal |work=PLoS ONE |volume= 6|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020708 |date=3 June 2011 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |pmid=21677775 |pmc=3108989 |page=e20708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCLA professor of psychiatry Gary Small studied brain activity in experienced web surfers versus casual web surfers. He used MRI scans on both groups to evaluate brain activity.  The study showed that when Internet surfing, the  brain activity of the experienced Internet users  was far more extensive than that of the novices, particularly in areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with problem-solving and decision making. However, the two groups had no significant differences in brain activity when reading blocks of text.  This  evidence suggested that the distinctive neural pathways of experienced Web users had developed because of their Web use. Dr. Small concluded that “The current explosion of digital technology not only is changing the way we live and communicate, but is rapidly and profoundly altering our brains.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1 |title=The Web Shatters Focus, Rewires Brains |author=Nicholas Carr |work=Wired Magazine |date=24 May 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on traditional reading===
In an August 2008 article in ''The Atlantic'' ("[[Is Google Making Us Stupid?]]"), Nicholas Carr experientially asserts that using the Internet can lead to lower [[attention span]] and make it more difficult to read in the traditional sense (that is, read a book at length without mental interruptions). He says that he and his friends have found it more difficult to concentrate and read whole books, even though they read a great deal when they were younger (that is, when they did not have access to the Internet).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/ |title=Is Google Making Us Stupid? |author=Nicholas Carr |work=The Atlantic |date=1 July 2008 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is based on anecdotal evidence, not controlled research.

Researchers from the University College London have done a 5-year study on Internet habits, and have found that people using the sites exhibited “a form of skimming activity,” hopping from one source to another and rarely returning to any source they’d already visited. The 2008 report says, "It is clear that users are not reading online in the traditional sense; indeed there are signs that new forms of “reading” are emerging as users “power browse” horizontally through titles, contents pages and abstracts going for quick wins. It almost seems that they go online to avoid reading in the traditional sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1108/00012530810887953 | volume=60 | title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future | year=2008 | journal=Aslib Proceedings | pages=290–310 | author=Rowlands Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain power==
Research suggests that using the Internet helps boost brain power for middle-aged and older people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/6395627/Internet-use-may-improve-brain-function-in-adults-says-UCLA-study.html | work=The Telegraph UK | title=Internet use 'may improve brain function in adults', says UCLA study | first=Tom |last=Chivers | date=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (research on younger people has not been done). The study compares brain activity when the subjects were reading and when the subjects were surfing the Internet. It found that Internet surfing uses much more brain activity than reading does. Lead researcher Professor Gary Small said: "The study results are encouraging, that emerging computerized technologies may have physiological effects and potential benefits for middle-aged and older adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailychump.org/internet-use-increases-brain-activity-in-seniors/ | work=DailyChump | title=Internet Use Increases Brain Activity in Seniors | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet searching engages complicated brain activity, which may help exercise and improve brain function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7667610.stm | work=BBC News | title=Internet use 'good for the brain' | date=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productivity==
One of the most widely debated effects of [[social networking]] has been its influence on productivity. In many schools and workplaces, social media sites are blocked because employers believe their employees will be distracted and unfocused on the sites. It seems, at least from one study, that employers do, indeed, have reason to be concerned. A survey from [[Hearst Communications]] found that productivity levels of people that used social networking sites were 1.5% lower than those that did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jung|first=Brian|title=The Negative Effect of Social Media on Society and Individuals|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negative-effect-social-media-society-individuals-27617.html|work=Chron|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logically, people cannot get work done when they are performing other tasks. If the employees suffer from degrading self-control, it will be even harder for them to get back to work and maintain productivity.

==Effects of social networking and behavior==
[[Evgeny Morozov]] has said that social networking could be potentially harmful to people. He writes that they can destroy privacy, and notes that "Insurance companies have accessed their patients’ Facebook accounts to try to disprove they have hard-to-verify health problems like depression; employers have checked social networking sites to vet future employees; university authorities have searched the web for photos of their students’ drinking or smoking [[cannabis (drug)|pot]]." He also said that the Internet also makes people more complacent and risk averse. He said that because much of the ubiquity of modern technology—cameras, recorders, and such—people may not want to act in unusual ways for fear of getting a bad name. People can see pictures and videos of you on the Internet, and this may make you act differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/2010/06/losing-our-minds-to-the-web/ |title=Losing our minds to the web |publisher=Prospect Magazine |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attention span==
According to the [[New York Times]], many scientists say that "people's ability to focus is being undermined by bursts of information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/technology/07brain.html?ref=matt_richtel&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=Attached to Technology and Paying a Price | first=Matt | last=Richtel | date=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 53,573 page views taken from various users, 17% of the views lasted less than 4 seconds while 4% lasted more than 10 minutes. In regards to page content, users will only read 49% of a site that contains 111 words or fewer while users will opt to read 28% of an average website (approximately 593 words). For each additional 100 words on a site, users will spend 4.4 seconds longer on the site.&lt;ref name="Attention Span Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Attention Span Statistics|url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-statistics/|work=Statistic Brain|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is found that those who read articles online go through the article more thoroughly than those who read from print-based materials. Upon choosing their reading material, online readers read 77% of the content, which can be compared to broadsheet newspaper where the corresponding number is 62%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldsmith|first=Belinda|title=Web news readers have greater attention span: study|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/31/us-internet-attention-idUSL292443320070331|work=Reuters|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=31 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of anonymity ==

{{See also|Internet anonymity|Anonymous post}}

Interacting on the Internet mostly does not involve "physical" interactions with another person (i.e. face-to-face conversation), and therefore easily leads to a person feeling free to act differently online, as well as unrestraint in [[civility]] and minimization of authority, etc.

People who are [[Social anxiety|socially anxious]] are more likely to use electronic communication as their only means of communication. This, in turn, makes them more likely to disclose personal information to strangers online that they normally wouldn't give out face-to-face.&lt;ref&gt;Cyberbullying: Bullying in the Digital Age&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is a likely cause for the prevalence of [[cyberbullying]], especially for children who do not understand "social networking etiquette."

Internet anonymity can lead to [[Online disinhibition effect|online disinhibition]], in which people do and say things online that they normally wouldn't do or say in person.  Psychology researcher [[John Suler]] differentiates between ''benign disinhibition'' in which people can grow psychologically by revealing secret emotions, fears, and wishes and showing  unusual acts of kindness and generosity and ''toxic disinhibition'', in which people use rude language, harsh criticisms, anger, hatred and threats or visit pornographic or violent sites that they wouldn't in the 'real world.'  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/1094931041291295 | volume=7 | title=The Online Disinhibition Effect | year=2004 | journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | pages=321–326 | author=Suler John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet addiction ==

{{Main|Internet addiction disorder|}}

People become [[Internet addiction disorder|addicted]] or dependent on the Internet through excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.  [[Kimberly Young|Kimberly S. Young]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young K | year = 1998 | title = The relationship between depression and internet addiction | url = | journal = CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 25–28 | doi=10.1089/cpb.1998.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  links internet addiction disorder with existing mental health issues, most commonly depression. Young states that the disorder has significant effects socially, psychologically and occupationally.

"Aric Sigman’s presentation to members of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health outlined the parallels between screen dependency and alcohol and drug addiction: the instant stimulation provided by all those flickering graphics leads to the release of [[dopamine]], a chemical that’s central to the brain’s reward system".&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

A 2009 study suggested that brain structural changes were present in those classified by the researchers as Internet addicted, similar to those classified as chemically addicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Zhou Y, etal | year = 2009 | title = Gray matter abnormalities in Internet addiction: A voxel-based morphometry study | url = | journal = European Journal of Radiology | volume = 79| issue = | pages = 92–95| doi = 10.1016/j.ejrad.2009.10.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, the researchers selected seventeen subjects with online gaming addiction and another seventeen naive internet users who rarely used the internet. Using a magnetic resonance imaging scanner, they performed a scan to "acquire 3-dimensional T1-weighted images" of the subject's brain. The results of the scan revealed that online gaming addiction "impairs gray and white matter integrity in the orbitofrontal cortex of the prefrontal regions of the brain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weng|first1=Chuan-Bu|title=Gray matter and white matter abnormalities in online game addiction|date=2013|pmid=23328472|volume=92|journal=Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi|pages=3221–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Keath Low, psychotherapist, the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] "has a major impact on our ability to perform such tasks as planning, prioritizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and controlling our attention".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Low|first1=Keath|title=Executive functions and ADD - ADHD. What are executive functions? How do executive functions relate to ADD - ADHD?|url=http://add.about.com/od/adhdthebasics/a/Execu-Functions.htm|website=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Keith Low believes that these online gaming addicts are incapable of prioritizing their life or setting a goal and accomplishing it because of the impairment of their orbitofrontal cortex.

==Escapism ==
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}
{{Main|Escapism}}

Ease of access to the Internet can increase [[escapism]] in which a user uses the Internet as an "escape" from the perceived unpleasant or banal aspects of daily/[[real life]]. Because the internet and virtual realities easily satisfy social needs and drives, according to Jim Blascovich and Jeremy Bailensen, "sometimes [they are] so satisfying that addicted users will withdraw physically from society.”  Stanford psychiatrist Dr. Elias Aboujaoude believes that advances in virtual reality and  immersive 3-D have led us to  “where we can have a ‘full life’ [online] that can be quite removed from our own.” Eventually, virtual reality may drastically change a person’s social and emotional needs.  “We may stop ‘needing’ or craving real social interactions because they may become foreign to us,” Aboujaoude says.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/the-good-and-the-bad-of-escaping-to-virtual-reality/385134/ Monica Kim, "The Good and the Bad of Escaping to Virtual Reality", ''The Atlantic'', February 20, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on children==
{{Expand section|date=May 2016}}
[[Internet]] has its impact on all age groups from elders to children. According to the article 'Digital power: exploring the effects of social media on children’s spirituality', children consider the Internet as their third place after home and school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Digital power: exploring the effects of social media on children’s spirituality | doi=10.1080/1364436X.2014.924908 | volume=19 | journal=International Journal of Children's Spirituality | pages=133–143 | year=2014 | author=Yust Karen-Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main effects social media has had on children is the effect of cyber bullying. A study carried out by 177 students in Canada found that “15% of the students admitted that they cyberbullied others” while “40% of the cyber victims had no idea who the bullies were”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Q|year=2010|title=cyberbullying in high schools: A Study of student behaviours and beliefs about this new phenomenon|url=|journal=journal of aggression, Maltreatment and trauma|volume=|pages=372–392|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological harm cyber bullying can cause is reflected in low self-esteem, depression and anxiety. It also opens up avenues for manipulation and control.  Cyber bullying has ultimately led to depression, anxiety and in severe cases suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24. Cyber bullying is rapidly increasing. Some writers have suggested monitoring and educating children from a young age about the risks associated with cyber bullying. {{Cite: Adams Richar,2015, [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/16/bullying-at-school-in-decline-but-cyberbullying-is-on-the-increase 'Fewer school bullies but cyberbullying is on the increase']}}  Not only does cyberbullying effect children but a huge issue is insomnia. This is because of the amount of time spent using the internet. children use on average 27 hours of internet a week and it is on the increase. {{ cite: Jerald J. Block, M.D.2008

== Effects on parenting ==
"A psychologist, Aric Sigman, warned of the perils of “passive [[parenting]]” and “benign [[neglect]]” caused by parent's reliance on gadgets".&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web|title=How technology is taking hold of our children's lives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9282582/How-technology-is-taking-hold-of-our-childrens-lives.html|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=26 May 2012|author=Rowan Pelling|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, parents' internet addictions can have drastic effects on their children.   In 2009, a three-year-old girl from New Mexico died of malnutrition and dehydration on the same day that her mother was said to have spent 15 hours playing World of Warcraft online.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; In another case in 2014, a Korean couple became so immersed in a video game that allowed them to raise a virtual child online that they let their real baby die.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/15/korean-couple-let-baby-die-while-they-played-video-game-261483.html Sean Elder, "Korean Couple Let Baby Die While They Played Video Game", ''Newsweek'', August 14, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
The effects of the Internet on parenting can be observed a how parents utilize the Internet, the response to their child's Internet consumption, as well as the effects and influences that the Internet has on the relationship between parent and child.

===Parental Internet use and opinions towards family impact===
Overall, parents are seen to do simple tasks such as sending e-mails and keep up with current events whereas social networking sites are less frequented. In regards to researching parental material, a study conducted in January 2012 by the [[University of Minnesota]] found that 75% of questioned parents have stated that the Internet improves their method of obtaining parenting related information, 19.7% found parenting websites too complex to navigate, and 13.1% of the group did not find any useful parenting information on any website.&lt;ref name=parenting_20&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents' Use of Technology and the Internet|url=http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/projects/parent20/pdf/p20summaryreport-july2012.pdf|publisher=University of Minnesota|author=Jessie Connell|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies have shown that parents view the Internet as a hub of information especially in their children's education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesch|first=Gustavo|title=Family Relations and the Internet: Exploring a Family Boundaries Approach|journal=The Journal of Family Communication|year=2007|pages=119–138|url=http://hevra.haifa.ac.il/~soc/lecturers/gustavo/files/1436.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They feel that it is a valuable commodity that can enhance their learning experience and when used in this manner it does not contribute to any family tension or conflicts. However, when the Internet is used as a social medium (either online gaming or social networking sites) there is a positive correlation between the use of the Internet and family conflicts. In conjunction with using the Internet for social means, there is a risk of exposing familial information to strangers, which is perceived to parents as a threat and can ultimately weaken family boundaries.

===Parental response to child #nline consumption===
A report released in October 2012 by [[Ofcom]] focused on the amount of online consumption done by children aged 5–15 and how the parents react to their child’s consumption. Of the parents interviewed, 85% use a form of online mediation ranging from face-to-face talks with their children about online surfing to cellphone browser filters. The remaining 15% of parents do not take active measures to adequately inform their children of safe Internet browsing; these parents have either spoken only briefly to their children about cautious surfing or do not do anything at all.

Parents are active in monitoring their child’s online use by using methods such as investigating the browsing history and by regulating Internet usage. However, since parents are less versed in Internet usage than their children they are more concerned with the Internet interfering with family life than online matters such as [[child grooming]] or [[cyber-bullying]].

When addressing those with lack of parental control over the Internet, parents state that their child is rarely alone (defined for children from 5–11 years old) or that they trust their children when they are online (for children 12–15 years old). Approximately 80% of parents ensure that their child has been taught Internet safety from school and 70% of parents feel that the benefits of using the Internet are greater than the risks that come along with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children and Parents: Media Use and Attitudes Report|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/media-literacy/oct2012/main.pdf|work=Ofcom|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely an American study, conducted by PewInternet released on November 20, 2012, reveal that parents are highly concerned about the problems the Internet can impose on their teenage children. 47% of parents are tend to worry about their children being exposed to inappropriate material on the Internet and 45% of the parents are concerned about their children’s behaviour towards each other both online offline. Only 31% of parents showed concern about the Internet taking away social time from the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parents, Teens, and Online Privacy|url=http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Teens-and-Privacy/Main-Report/Introduction.aspx|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=10 February 2013|author1=Mary Madden |author2=Sandra Cortesi |author3=Urs Gasser |author4=Amanda Lenhart |author5=Maeve Duggan |date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of Internet use on parent-child relationships===
Researcher Sanford Grossbart and others explores the relationship between the mother and child and how Internet use affects this relationship. This study forms its basis around Marvin Sussman and Suzanne Steinmetz’s idea that the relationship between parent and child is highly influenced by the changing experiences and events of each generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sussman |first1=Marvin |title=Handbook of Marriage and the Family|year=1987|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|author2=Suzanne Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Parental warmth” is a factor in how receptive a parent is to being taught the nuances of the Internet by their child versus the traditional method of the parent influencing the child. If the parent displayed “warm” tendencies she was more open to learning how to use the Internet from their child even if the parent happened to be more knowledgeable on the subject. This fosters teaching in a positive environment, which sustains a strong relationship between mother and child, encourages education, and promotes mature behaviour. “Cooler” mothers only allowed themselves to be taught if they thought that their child held the same amount of knowledge or greater and would dismiss the teaching otherwise suggesting a relationship that stems from the majority of influence coming from the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sanford Grossbart |author2=Stephanie McConnell Hughes |author3=Susie Pryor |author4=Amber Yost |title=Socialization Aspects of Parents, Children, and the Internet|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=2002|volume=29|pages=66–70|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=8559|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite ''warm'' and ''cool'' parenting methods, parents who encounter a language barrier rely more heavily on their children to utilize the Internet. Vikki Katz of [[Rutgers University]] has studied the interaction between immigrant parents and children and how they use technology. Katz notes that the majority resources that immigrants find helpful are located online, however the search algorithms currently in place do not direct languages other than English appropriately.  Because of this shortcoming, parents strongly encourage their bilingual children to bridge the gap between the Internet and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt|first=Alex|title=Immigrant Parents Rely On Kids For Help Online|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/12/141232534/immigrant-parents-rely-on-kids-for-help-online|work=NPR|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet is increasingly being used as a virtual babysitter when parents actively download applications specifically for their children with intentions to keep them calm. A survey conducted by [[Ipsos]] has found that half of the interviewed parents believe children ages 8–13 are old enough to own or carry smartphones thus increasing online content consumption in younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atagana|first=Michelle|title=US parents relying on mobile devices to entertain their kids [Survey]|url=http://memeburn.com/2012/09/us-parents-relying-on-mobile-devices-to-entertain-their-kids-survey/|work=Memeburn|accessdate=10 February 2013|date=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3018">'''Salirophilia''' is a [[sexual fetish]] or [[paraphilia]] that involves deriving erotic pleasure from soiling or disheveling the object of one's desire, usually an attractive person. It may involve tearing or damaging their clothing, covering them in mud or filth, or messing their hair or makeup. The fetish does not involve harming or injuring the subject, only their appearance.

It is related to [[wet and messy fetishism]], [[bukkake]] (ejaculating semen on someone), [[cum shot]], [[gokkun]] (drinking semen of someone), [[Facial (sex act)|facial]], [[omorashi]] (preventing urination), [[mysophilia]] (ex. fetishism of used underwear), [[urolagnia]] (urinating on someone),and [[coprophilia]], etc. Salirophilia also extends to other areas such as forcing the partner to wear torn or poorly fitting clothing and other actions which would render them normally unattractive.

The fetish sometimes manifests itself in the defacing of statues or pictures of attractive people, especially celebrities or fictional characters. It is common to refer to the practice involving ejaculating on a photo as "facepainting". This may be done with a physical photograph or the screen of a phone, tablet, or computer. The fetishist finds this sexually exciting, rather than mere vandalism and they sometimes form collections of defaced art, either created by themselves or in collaboration with others, for future enjoyment. A video of the fetishist ejaculating on a picture of someone or a photo depicting the result is known colloquially as a "tribute".

The term comes from the [[French language|French]] for soiling, ''salir''. In cases where the fetish is obsessive it is called saliromania.  It is frequently confused with [[salophilia]], an attraction to [[salt]] or salty things (especially body sweat) that derives from the [[Latin]] for salt, ''sal''.

==Mysophilia==
'''Mysophilia''' relates to soiled or dirty material or people.&lt;ref name="Butcher"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Butcher |first= Nancy |title= The Strange Case of the Walking Corpse: A Chronicle of Medical Mysteries, Curious Remedies, and Bizarre but True Healing Folklore |isbn= 1-58333-160-3 |oclc= 52107453 |year= 2003 |publisher= Avery |location= New York |page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mysophiliacs may find dirt, soiled underwear, feces, or vomit to be [[sexual arousal|sexually arousing]].&lt;ref name="Holmes"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Holmes |first= Ronald M. |title= Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior |publisher= Sage Publications |location= Thousand Oaks |isbn= 0-7619-2417-5 |oclc= 48883594 |page= 79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for people with mysophilia to be aroused by unclean locales, such as an alleyway, or a dirty room/bathroom; wearing the same clothing for many days at a time; or not bathing, from mere days to several weeks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Personal life==
Magid grew up as a non-observant Jew in New York when, at the age of 20, he became interested in learning more about Judaism. He became involved with the [[Haredi]] movement and studied [[Modern Orthodoxy]], but after several years he "...abandoned Orthodoxy more generally yet remained fascinated by, and deeply invested in, the complex nexus of Judaism and the American counter-culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Radical Banjo: About Shaul |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318003356/http://www.shaulmagid.net/ |archivedate=March 18, 2015 |url=http://www.shaulmagid.net/ |accessdate=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is often quoted on such issues in the popular press; for instance, he recently discussed [[Jerry Garcia]] and the [[Grateful Dead]] in relation to Judaism, speaking from the perspective of "an ordained rabbi and a professor of Jewish and religious studies at Indiana University who was also present for the Dead’s legendary performance on the grounds of Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey on Sept. 3, 1977."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rosen |first=Armin |date=August 1, 2017 |title=Happy Birthday, Jerry Garcia.

'''The Continence of Scipio''', or '''The Clemency of Scipio''', is an episode recounted by [[Livy]] of the Roman general [[Scipio Africanus]] during his campaign in Spain during the [[Second Punic War]]. He refused a generous ransom for a young female prisoner, returning her to her fiance '''Allucius''', who in return became a supporter of Rome.  In recognition of his magnanimous treatment of a prisoner, he was taken as one of the prime examples of mercy during warfare in classical times. Interest in the story revived in the [[Renaissance]] and the episode figured widely thereafter in both the literary and figurative arts.

==The classical story==
[[File:Nicolò dell'Abate - The Continence of Scipio - WGA00015.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Nicolò dell'Abate]], ''The Continence of Scipio'', c. 1555.]]
The story related by Livy in his history of Rome was followed by all later writers, although it is recorded that the earlier historian [[Valerius Antias]] took a dissenting view.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, p.550&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livy's account of the siege of the Carthaginian colony of [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]], the [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] prince Allucius was betrothed to a beautiful virgin who was taken prisoner by Scipio Africanus in 209 BC.  Despite having a reputation for womanizing, instead of the usual brutal treatment given to attractive female "barbarian" prisoners, Scipio summoned her parents and fiance, who arrived with a ransom of treasure. Scipio refused this and returned her to them, asking only that they be friends to Rome.  When they offered the ransom as a present, he accepted it, only to return it immediately as a wedding gift from himself.  Allucius then brought over his tribe to support the Roman armies in gratitude.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0158%3Abook%3D26%3Achapter%3D50 Book 26, chapter 50]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerius Maximus]], iv. 3. § 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sil. Ital. xv. 268 &amp;c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern treatments==
===Literature and opera===
This episode was a popular motif for [[exemplary literature]] from that time on, growing to a peak of popularity during the 17th and 18th centuries. Prior to this period, it was given pride of place in the story of Scipio inserted into translations of [[Plutarch’s Lives]] that was written originally by the Dutchman [[Carolus Clusius]] in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, p.519&lt;/ref&gt; Among dramatic treatments of the story, one of the foremost was the ''Scipion'' of [[Jean Desmarets]] (1638), which was then adapted into Dutch by Jan Lemmers as ''Schipio in Karthago'' (1649) and also performed later as ''Schipio en Olinde''. In England a verse drama on the episode, ''Scipio Africanus'', was chiefly distinguished by being the work of a schoolboy, [[Charles Beckingham]]. It was acted and later printed in 1718. 

Operatic treatments were numerous, with several composers setting the same libretto. So, for example, [[Nicolo Minato]]'s ''Scipione Africano'' was set, or served as the basis for adaptations, by [[Francesco Cavalli]] (1662); [[Carlo Ambrogio Lonati]] (1692); [[Francesco Bianchi (composer)|Francesco Bianchi]] (1787); and [[Gioacchino Albertini]] (1789). In addition, there was [[Johann Sigismund Kusser]]'s German version, ''Der großmütige Scipio Africanus'' (1694). [[Giovanni Battista Boccabadati]]'s prose drama ''Scipione'' (1693) served as the basis for [[Apostolo Zeno]]'s ''Scipione nelle Spagne''.  This was performed in 1710, with music possibly by [[Antonio Caldara]], and was also set by [[Alessandro Scarlatti]] (1714), [[Tomaso Albinoni]] (1724), [[George Friederic Handel]] (1726), [[Carlo Arrigoni]] (1739), and  [[Leonardo Leo]] (1740). [[Johann Christian Bach]]'s ''La Clemenza di Scipione'' (1778) was also based upon it.

===Visual arts===
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi - The Continence of Scipio Africanus - WGA01544.jpg|thumb|[[Domenico Beccafumi]]]]
There were numerous artistic depictions of the mercy and sexual restraint of Scipio although, as with the operas, they go now by a variety of titles. "The Continence of Scipio" is most common in English, although "The Clemency of Scipio" is also found. In other languages the terms magnanimity (''großmütigheit'') and generosity are alternatives. There is also sometimes a difficulty in identifying which scene is intended. The most common alternative example of military clemency descending from classical times was [[Alexander the Great]]'s generous treatment of the family of the defeated Persian King [[Darius III|Darius]], best known from [[The Family of Darius before Alexander|Veronese's painting in London]]. The scene of a victorious general seated at the centre of the composition with kneeling figures before him might portray either story without other clues to its interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle, p.524&lt;/ref&gt;  

Typically, Scipio sits on a throne on a raised dias, stretching out an arm in the direction of the Spanish party, with their treasure laid out in front of them. The "continence" shown by Scipio is both sexual and financial.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle&lt;/ref&gt;   The story of [[Timoclea]] and Alexander the Great is rather different, but produces similar compositions of a woman brought before a magnanimous classical commander, which sometimes accompanied the ''Continence'' in a series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2010/important-old-master-paintings-and-sculpture-n08610/lot.177.html "Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio ''The Continence of Scipio''], [[Sotheby's]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also capable of being confused with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=715754&amp;partId=1 British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118], by [[Perino del Vaga]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] paired the two stories as his "Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors" in a book of 1724.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-b_ojfBm3EQC&amp;pg=PT122&amp;lpg=PT122 ''Supplement au livre de l'antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures: tome quatrième: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares &amp; les tours octogones''], Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giovanni Antonio Fasolo, Castello Porto Colleoni Thiene, Cleopatra's Banquet - The Continence of Scipio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Giovanni Antonio Fasolo]]'s 16th century fresco is to the right of the door at the Castello Porto Colleoni Thiene.]]
Tapestry series based on the exploits of Scipio, which would often portray this scene, was one contextual identifier; so was connection with the histories of Livy or the expanded Plutarch for which the numerous surviving prints were intended, or on which they were dependent. Another context was the work's association with marriage, since the wedding between Allucius and his bride followed immediately on her restoration to him. [[Apollonio di Giovanni di Tommaso]]'s episodic depiction appeared as a painted panel on a 15th-century marriage chest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O14938/the-continence-of-scipio-oil-painting-apollonio-di-giovanni Victoria and Albert Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pietro da Cortona]]’s mural in the [[Palazzo Pitti]] was intended for the marriage of [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] in 1637. In the case of the 1621 painting of the scene by [[Anthony van Dyck]], which features prominently [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]], together with his future bride, the artist's patron was also the sponsor of the marriage. Several other paintings from this time may have similar histories. The connection also extends to literary works, since it is known that Boccabadati's 1693 drama ''Scipione'' was written for performance during the celebration of the marriage between [[Francesco II d'Este, Duke of Modena]] and [[Margherita Maria Farnese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovan-battista-boccabadati_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29 ''Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani'' - Volume 10 (1968)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:1751 Tiepolo Die Enthaltsamkeit Scipios anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright|''The Clemency of Scipio'' by [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]] (1751), [[Städel]].]]

Many paintings of Scipio's act of clemency were produced in Europe - over a hundred by [[Low Countries]] artists alone.&lt;ref&gt;Kunzle p.565ff&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists made a speciality of the subject, returning to it more than once. [[Frans Francken the Younger]] painted eight versions, [[Sebastiano Ricci]] six versions, [[Simon de Vos]] and [[Gerbrand van den Eeckhout]] four each. [[Joseph-Marie Vien]] painted two versions, as did [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. In the case of the latter, both paintings were subsequently destroyed. Beside the historical record, a sketch of the 1620 version remains, as does a copy now in [[Lacock Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-continence-of-scipio-100954 BBC Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 16th century [[fresco]]s by [[Gian Battista Zelotti]] at the Villa Emo, Fanzolo; the Villa Caldogno-Nordera, Caldogna; and elsewhere in Italy.

[[Image:TheDancingMaster-1stEd-TitlePage.png|thumb|350px|Title page of the 1st edition of The Dancing Master (1651)]]
'''''The Dancing Master''''' (first edition: '''''The English Dancing Master''''') is a dancing manual containing the music and instructions for [[English Country Dance]]s. It was published in several editions by [[John Playford]] and his successors from 1651 until c1728.  The first edition contained 105 dances with single line melodies; subsequent editions introduced new songs and dances, while dropping others, and the work eventually encompassed three volumes.  Dances from ''The Dancing Master'' were re-published in arrangements by [[Cecil Sharp]] in the early 20th century, and in these reconstructed forms remain popular among dancers today.

'''The Oprah Effect''' is the phenomenon in which consuming [[soft news]] causes the politically unaware to vote more consistently with their own views, articulated by Matthew A. Baum and Angela S. Jamison in their 2006 study, "''The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/OprahEffect_JOP.pdf|author=Matthew Baum and Angels Jamison|title=The ''Oprah'' Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|publisher=The Journal of Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of the study centered around the distinction between hard and soft news as written about by Baum, and the complex interactions both types of news have on people with low and high political awareness. The term was pioneered by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The increase of soft news content available has led some scholars to question its value in informing the public, and therefore question whether the media is properly fulfilling its duty to inform the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Search for a Standard: Markets and the Media|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeller|first1=John|title=A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oprah Effect was demonstrated by testing a dependent variable of voting consistently versus an independent variable which measured how often the voter watched daytime talk shows. Voting consistency measures the consistency between a voter's preferences and their vote. For the context of this experiment, the measure of voting consistently was created by applying Lau and Redlawsk's model of "correct" voting to data from the 2000 [[American National Election Studies|National Election Studies]]. Increased consumption of soft news caused low information voters to vote more consistently, but had no significant effect on more aware voters. Exposure to hard news modestly increased the voting consistency of politically aware individuals, but had no significant effect on those with low political awareness.

While Baum and Jamison agree that soft news contains lower quality political information, they conclude from their analysis that soft news fulfills a valuable duty by providing information to apolitical individuals. This is because soft news still exposes those individuals to the political information that they need to cast a vote for the candidate which best reflects their personal interests, even if it doesn't contain highly complex political information. They theorize that exposure to soft news has this effect on low information individuals because most people with little political knowledge have no interest in harder news, making their decision to consume soft news one between  consuming soft news or consuming no news. Even though soft news may not be highly informational, it's still beneficial compared to consuming no news. They also go even further, contending that even if an individual with little political knowledge were to consume hard news, the more complex political information would be difficult for them to comprehend, and they would get relatively little out of it. As a result, they conclude their results should give some pause to critics of the increase soft news content in the media, because it increases the voting consistency of those with little political knowledge.

'''''The Pomegranate: The International Journal of Pagan Studies''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] covering the field of [[Pagan studies]] including historical, sociological, and anthropological studies dealing with [[Paganism (contemporary)|contemporary Paganism]] and other forms of [[paganism|pagan]] religion. Since 2004 the journal has been published by [[Equinox Publishing (London)|Equinox Publishing]] and the [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Chas S. Clifton]] ([[Colorado State University–Pueblo]]).

The journal was established as a scholarly but not fully peer-reviewed publication in 1996 by [[Fritz Muntean]] and [[Diana Tracy]] with the subtitle ''A New Journal of Neopagan Thought''. In 2001 the production of the journal was put on hiatus, as Muntean stepped down as editor, to be replaced by Clifton when it resumed publication, this time as a fully peer-reviewed academic publication and with its current subtitle.

== History ==
[[File:Pomegranate New Journal.jpg|150px|left|thumb|The front cover to ''The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Studies'' (issue 17 portrayed).]]
The idea for ''The Pomegranate'' was initially developed by Fritz Muntean, a graduate student in [[religious studies]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] in Canada, who started the venture with his friend Diana Tracy, who was then living in Oregon in the United States.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially naming their work ''The Pomegranate: A New Journal of Neopagan Thought'', the stated intention of the publication was to "provide a scholarly venue for the forthright and critical examination of Neopagan beliefs and practices".&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt; From 1996 to 2001, Muntean published 18 issues of ''The Pomegranate'' on a quarterly basis, gaining a growing readership as time went on, particularly after Muntean and Tracy introduced the journal to the assembled members at the third Nature Religions Scholars Network (NRSN), a group which met in conjunction with the annual San Francisco meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]].&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt;

Muntean eventually decided to move on from his work as editor of ''The Pomegranate'', leaving that position to be occupied by Clifton. Together, Muntean and Clifton searched for a new publisher, in 2003 eventually signing an agreement with Equinox Publishing.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 5"/&gt; Under Clifton's control, the journal's subtitle was changed to ''The International Journal of Pagan Studies'' and it adopted a peer review structure for the papers which it published.&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 6"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
The journal is abstracted and indexed in [[Religious and Theological Abstracts]], [[Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index]], [[Current Contents]]/Arts &amp; Humanities, and [[Academic Search Premier]] and other [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO databases]].

'''''The Probability Broach''''' is a 1979 novel by American [[science fiction]] writer [[L. Neil Smith]]. It is set in an [[Alternate history (fiction)|alternate history]], the so-called [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatin]] Universe, where a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] society has formed on the [[North American]] continent, styled the [[North American Confederacy]] (''NAC''). This history was created when the [[Declaration of Independence]] has the word ''unanimous'' added to the preamble, to read that governments "derive their just power from the ''unanimous'' [[consent of the governed]]".

==Plot summary==
Edward William "Win" Bear is a [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] who works for the [[Denver Police Department]] in a version of the [[United States]] in an alternate history of 1987 to be controlled by an anti-business, [[ecofascism|ecofascist]] faction complete with a new police force created in 1984 called the Federal Security Police (FSP, or "SecPol" as it is more commonly known) reminiscent of the [[Gestapo]]. [[Henry M. Jackson]] is [[President of the United States|president]], citizens' freedoms are very limited, and many laws and regulations have been passed. Examples include [[hoarding]] precious metals, such as silver and gold, is illegal and due to strict [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control policies]], only the police and citizens with federal permits are allowed to carry guns.

Bear is called to investigate the unusual murder of physicist Vaughn Meiss; he eventually finds himself projected into the [[North American Confederacy]] by means of the "Probability Broach", an inter-dimensional conduit originally developed as a means for [[interstellar travel]] in the North American Confederacy by a [[bottlenose dolphin]] physicist, named Ooloorie Eckickeck P'Wheet, and her human compatriot, Dr. Dora Jayne Thorens.

Win encounters his NAC counterpart, Edward William "Ed" Bear, and Ed's neighbors, most notably the "healer" Clarissa Olson and Lucy Kropotkin, who is later revealed to be 135 years old. Lucy's life becomes the vantage point by which Win is acclimated to life in the NAC and Laporte, the NAC equivalent to Denver. Win and Ed unravel the mystery of the Meiss murder and learn that he was killed to hide an effort by SecPol to conquer the NAC with the help of [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]] forces on the NAC side, led by John Jay Madison, a.k.a. the infamous [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] expatriate and 1918 war hero [[Manfred von Richthofen]], known here as the Red Knight of Prussia. Win, Ed, Lucy and Clarissa lead the effort to notify the nascent NAC government of the threat. En route to the meeting of the [[Continental Congress]], Ed and Clarissa are kidnapped, leaving Win and Lucy to reveal the plot.

After fighting (and winning) a duel with a SecPol agent, Win and Lucy rescue their friends and track Madison and the Hamiltonians to a small town outside Laporte. Win sets off an explosion that eliminates all of the Hamiltonians.

Win elects to remain in the NAC and marries Clarissa. Ed marries Lucy, who at the time of the story is awaiting a delayed "regeneration" because of an accident involving massive radiation exposure, and they then set out for the asteroid belt to build a new life for themselves on the NAC frontier.

The Continental Congress agrees to begin a massive propaganda campaign to force Win's United States (and the rest of the globe) toward a similar [[Albert Gallatin|Gallatinist]] revolution.

==Awards==
''The Probability Broach'' won the 1982 [[Prometheus Award]], which L. Neil Smith himself had created, and which is awarded by the Libertarian Futurist Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfs.org/awards.htm Prometheus Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|[[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in an attempt to justify God's existence in light of the apparent imperfections of the world.]]

'''Theodicy''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|i}}), in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good [[God]] permits the manifestation of [[evil]], thus resolving the issue of the [[problem of evil]]. Some theodicies also address the [[evidential problem of evil]] by attempting "to make the existence of an [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[omnibenevolence|all-good or omnibenevolent]] God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Pecorino, ''An Introduction to Philosophy: An Online Textbook'' (2000), Chapter 3: ‘Philosophy of Religion’, Section 11: Problem of Evil, online at http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/ppecorino/INTRO_TEXT/Chapter%203%20Religion/Problem_of_Evil.htm. Retrieved September 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that [[existence of God|God's existence]] is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible.&lt;ref&gt;A defence is “an effort to show that there is no formal contradiction between the existence of God... and the existence of evil.” Michael Rea and Louis B. Pojman, eds., ''Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology'' (Cengage Learning, 2015, 7th ed.), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in 1710 in his work ''[[Théodicée]]'', though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher [[John Hick]] traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, ''Evil and the God of Love'', identifying three major traditions:
# the Plotinian theodicy, named after [[Plotinus]]
# the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which Hick based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]
# the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which Hick developed, based on the thinking of St. [[Irenaeus]]

The problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg, Ola Agevall, ''The Max Weber Dictionary: Key Words and Central Concepts'' (Stanford University Press, 2005), 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] (1929–2017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an “implicit theodicy of all social order” developed to sustain it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (Doubleday, 1st ed, 1967), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Holocaust]], a number of [[Jewish theology|Jewish theologians]] developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God's existence. Plantinga's [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|version of the free-will defence]] argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God.{{Citation needed lead|date=October 2016}}

Similar to a theodicy, a [[#Cosmodicy and anthropodicy|cosmodicy]] attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity.

==Definition and etymology==
As defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the "answer to the question of why God permits evil".&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom, and Evil'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] that mitigates against the existence of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/theodicy and {{cite book|title=The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809140489|editor=Anthony J. Tambasco|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of theodicy is the vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. The word ''theodicy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words Θεός ''Τheos'' and δίκη ''dikē''. ''Theos'' is translated "God" and ''dikē'' can be translated as either "trial" or "judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=di/kh "δίκη"]. ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theodicy literally means "justifying God".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', s. v. [http://0-www.britannica.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/EBchecked/topic/590596/theodicy "theodicy"], accessed October 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[Nick Trakakis]] proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy:
* Common sense views of the world
* Widely held historical and scientific opinion
* Plausible moral principles&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H4 |title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |author=Trakakis, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God's existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin &amp; Tsui-James 2002, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; A theodicy is often based on a prior [[natural theology]], which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God's existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God's permitting evil to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Defenses propose solutions to the [[logical problem of evil]], while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

{{quote|"It is important to note that there are at least two concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. The broad concept picks out any bad state of affairs... [and] has been divided into two categories: natural evil and moral evil. Natural evils are bad states of affairs which do not result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Hurricanes and toothaches are examples of natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are examples of moral evils. Evil in the broad sense, which includes all natural and moral evils, tends to be the sort of evil referenced in theological contexts... [T]he narrow concept of evil picks out only the most morally despicable... [it] involves moral condemnation, [and] is appropriately ascribed only to moral agents and their actions."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"&gt;Calder, Todd, "The Concept of Evil", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2016 Edition), Edward N.

Philosopher [Susan Nieman] says "a [[Crimes against humanity|''crime against humanity'']] is something for which we have procedures, ... [and it] can be ... fit into the rest of our experience. To call an action ''evil'' is to suggest that it cannot [be fitted in]..."&lt;ref name="Susan Nieman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nieman|first1=Susan|title=Evil in Modern Thought: An Alternative History of Philosophy|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-16850-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LpKCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Evil%20in%20Modern%20Thought%20by%20Susan%20Nieman&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}  

Marxism, "selectively elaborating Hegel," defines evil in terms of its effect.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=N. T.|title=Evil and the Justice of God|year=2006|publisher=Intervarsity Press|location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-3415-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}  Philosopher John Kekes says the effect of evil must include actual harm "that 'interferes with the functioning of a person as a full-fledged agent.' (Kekes 1998, 217)."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  Christian philosophers and theologians such as  [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[N. T. Wright]] also define evil in terms of effect saying an "...act is objectively good (or bad) if it is good (or bad) in its consequences".&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swinburne|first1=Richard|title=Providence and the Problem of Evil|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=0-19-823799-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;  Hinduism defines evil in terms of its effect saying "the evils that afflict people (and indeed animals) in the present life are the effects of wrongs committed in a previous life".&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Some contemporary philosophers argue a focus on the effects of evil is inadequate as a definition since evil can observe without actively causing the harm, and it is still evil.&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  

[[Pseudo-Dionysus]] defines evil by those aspects that show an absence of good.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|37}}  Writers in this tradition saw things as belonging to 'forms' and evil as an absence of being a good example of their form: as a deficit of goodness where goodness ought to have been present. In this same line of thinking, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] also defined evil as an absence of good, as did theologian and monk [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said: "... a man is called ''bad'' insofar as he lacks a virtue, and an eye is called ''bad'' insofar as it lacks the power of sight."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|37}} ''Bad'' as an absence of ''good'' resurfaces in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Karl Barth|Barth]].  Very similar are the [[Neoplatonists]], such as [[Plotinus]] and contemporary philosopher Denis O'Brien, who say evil is a privation.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;O'Brien, D., 1996, “Plotinus on matter and evil,” in The Cambridge Companion to Plotinus, L.P. Gerson (ed.), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 171–195.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Plotinus"&gt;Plotinus, The Enneads, S. Mackenna (trans.), London: Faber, 4th edition, revised by B.S. Page, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Immanuel Kant]] was the first to offer a purely secular theory of evil, giving an evaluative definition of evil based on its cause as having a will that is not fully good.  Kant has been an important influence on philosophers like [[Hanna Arendt]], [[Claudia Card]], and Richard Bernstein.&lt;ref name="Immanuel Kant"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kant|first1=Immanuel|title=Kant: Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason: And Other Writings|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-59049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "...Hanna Arendt... uses the term [radical evil] to denote a new form of wrongdoing which cannot be captured by other moral concepts."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;  The Muslim also provides an evaluative definition of evil saying it is the result of the world not being fully Muslim.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|34}}  Claudia Card says evil is excessive wrong-doing; others like [[Hillel Steiner]] say evil is qualitatively not quantitatively distinct from mere wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt; 

[[John Locke|Locke]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Liebniz]] define good and evil in terms of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref name="John Locke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=John|title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|date=1836|publisher=B.Griffin and Co.|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hobbes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hobbes|first1=Thomas|title=Leviathan|date=2018|publisher=Lerner Publishing Group|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|isbn=978 151 248609 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liebniz|first1=Gottfried Wilhelm|title=Theodicy|date=2009|publisher=Cosimo books|isbn=978-1-61640-295-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Richard Swinburne find that definition inadequate, saying, "the good of individual humans...consists...in their having free will...the ability to develop ...character..., to show courage and loyalty, to love, to be of use, to contemplate beauty and discover truth... All that [good]...cannot be achieved without ... suffering along the way."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

{{quote|"Most theorists writing about evil believe that evil action requires a certain sort of motivation... the desire to cause harm, or to do wrong,...pleasure (Steiner 2002), the desire to annihilate all being (Eagleton 2010), or the destruction of others for its own sake (Cole 2006). When evil is restricted to actions that follow from these sorts of motivations, theorists sometimes say that their subject is pure, radical, diabolical, or monstrous evil. This suggests that their discussion is restricted to a type, or form, of evil and not to evil per se."&lt;ref name= "Todd Calder"/&gt;}}

Some theorists define evil by what emotions are connected to it. "For example, Laurence Thomas believes that evildoers take delight in causing harm or feel hatred toward their victims (Thomas 1993, 76–77)."&lt;ref name="Todd Calder"/&gt;   Buddhism defines evil as behavior resulting from a failure to emotionally detach from the world.&lt;ref name="Nyanaponika Thera"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thera|first1=Nyanaponika|title=The Roots of Good and Evil: Buddhist Texts translated from the Pali|date=2008|isbn=978-955-24-0316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for theodicy==
German philosopher [[Max Weber]] interpreted theodicy as a social problem,&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; and viewed theodicy as a "problem of meaning". Weber argued that, as human society became increasingly [[rationality|rational]], the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a "meaningful cosmos". Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; For theodicies of suffering, Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—[[predestination]], [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and [[karma]]—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning, and he believed that the quest for meaning, when considered in light of suffering, becomes the problem of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world. He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order, despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber, but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society. He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves, denying the individual in favour of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead 2001, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Richard Swinburne says "most theists need a theodicy, [they need] an account of reasons why God might allow evil to occur. Without a theodicy evil counts against the existence of God."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

==History==
The term ''theodicy'' was coined by German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in his 1710 work, written in [[French language|French]], ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' (''Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil'').&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz 1734&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's ''Théodicée'' was a response to [[skepticism|skeptical]] Protestant philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]], who wrote in his work ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' that, after rejecting three attempts to solve it, he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil. Bayle argued that, because the [[Bible]] asserts the coexistence of God and evil, this state of affairs must simply be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ | title=Pierre Bayle | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=7 February 2003 | accessdate=January 22, 2012 | author=Lennon, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Voltaire]] criticised Leibniz's concept of theodicy in his ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' (''Poem on the Lisbon disaster''), suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the [[Lisbon earthquake]] demonstrated that God was not providing the "best of all possible worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, [[Candide]] and ''Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne''&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel ''Candide''.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1992), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1914), Constantine Kempf argued that, following Leibniz's work, philosophers called their works on the problem of evil "theodicies", and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy. He argued that theodicy began to include all of [[natural theology]], meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14569a.htm | title=Theodicy | publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia | year=2012 | accessdate=September 4, 2012 | author=Kempf, Constantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, British philosopher [[John Hick]] published ''Evil and the God of Love'', in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil, before developing his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy: Plotinian, which was named after Plotinus, [[Augustinian theodicy|Augustinian]], which had dominated [[Western Christianity]] for many centuries, and [[Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean]], which was developed by the Eastern [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]], a version of which Hick subscribed to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dialogue "Is God a Taoist?",&lt;ref&gt;Smullyan 1977, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1977 in his book ''[[The Tao is Silent]]'', [[Raymond Smullyan]] claims to prove that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing "evil", even for God, just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°. So the capability of feeling implies free will, which in turn may produce "evil", understood here as hurting other sentient beings. The problem of evil happening to good or innocent people is not addressed directly here, but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Ancient religions===
“Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years.”&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, David (1989). ''God and Evil''. Hoboken: Ktav Pub. House. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000 BC to 1700 BC) as “in Ancient Mesopotamian and Israelite literature,” theodicy was an important issue.&lt;ref&gt;Assman, Jan (2001). ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'' trans. David Lorton. Cornell University Press. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Philip Irving Mitchell of the [[Dallas Baptist University]] notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one, as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another, explain wisdom, or explain a conversion, rather than to justify God's goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/theodicy.htm | title=Theodicy: An Overview | publisher=Dallas Baptist University | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Mitchell, Dr Philip Irving}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Sarah Iles Johnston]] argues that ancient civilizations, such as the ancient [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] held [[polytheistic]] beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently. These religions taught the existence of many [[deity|gods]] and [[goddess]]es who controlled various aspects of daily life. These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued [[human]]ity. No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil; this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses. Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent, while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive. In this sense, the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune, while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right. There was still a sense of justice in that individuals who were right with the gods could avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004, pp. 531–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Epicurean trilemma]]" however was already raised ~300BC by [[Epicurus]]. It is the first credited to describe the problem of reconciling an omnipotent deity with their benevolence and the existence of evil.

====Biblical theodicy====
{{Main article|Theodicy and the Bible}}
The biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For the Hebrew Bible, the [[Book of Job]] is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Old Testament''. Modern Library Edition, Introduction, authored by George Steiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The author of Job seeks to expand the understanding of divine justice ...beyond mere retribution, to include a system of divine sovereignty [showing] the King has the right to test His subject's loyalty...  The book of Job corrects the rigid and overly simplistic doctrine of retribution in attributing suffering to sin and punishment. It closes with a focus on the bond between creator and creation, on placing one's trust in that, and on hope rooted in belief that God is in ultimate control."&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ko|first1=Grace|title=Theodicy in Habakkuk|date=2014|publisher=Paternoster|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

It is generally accepted that God's responsive speeches in Job do not directly answer Job's complaints; God does not explain Himself or reveal the reason for Job's suffering to him; instead Yahweh's speeches focus on increasing Job's overall understanding of his relationship with God. This exemplifies Biblical theodicy.&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21,28}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil, By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Mark S. M.|title=Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil|date=2015|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-6470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}   

This is in evidence in Yahweh's first and second speech in Job. Yahweh's first speech concerns human ignorance and God's authority. Job had seen himself at the center of events, lamenting that God has singled him out to oppress; God responds that Job is not the center, Yahweh is; His kingdom is complex, He governs on a large scale, and has the right to exercise divine authority; since God is the rightful owner of everything in the universe, Job cannot justly accuse Him of wrongful deprivation.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}  Yahweh's second speech is against human self-righteousness. Job has vehemently accused God of thwarting justice as "the omnipotent tyrant, the cosmic thug". Some scholars interpret Yahweh's response as an admission of failure on His part, but He goes on to say He has the power and in His own timing will bring justice in the end.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

"Isaiah is generally recognized as one of the most progressive books of the prophetic corpus."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Linafelt|editor1-first=Tod|title=Strange Fire: Reading the Bible After the Holocaust|date=2000|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0-8147-5165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}}  Hebrew Bible scholar [[Marvin A. Sweeney]] says "...a unified reading of [Isaiah] places the question of theodicy at the forefront... [with] three major dimensions of the question...: Yahweh's identification with the conqueror, Yahweh's decree of judgment against Israel without possibility of repentance, and the failure of Yahweh's program to be realized by the end of the book."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"/&gt;{{rp|209}}  Christian theologians read some passages in Isaiah differently.   "In either case, suffering is understood as having transcendent meaning... human agency can give particular instances of suffering a mystical significance that transforms it into something productive."&lt;ref name="Sarah K. Pinnock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinnock|first1=Sarah K.|title=Beyond Theodicy: Jewish and Christian Continental Thinkers Respond to the Holocaust|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7914-5523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodicy in the book of Ezekiel (and also in Jeremiah 31:29-30) confronts the concept of personal moral responsibility. "The main point is stated at the beginning and at the end--"the soul that sins shall die"--and is explicated by a case history of a family traced through three generations." It is not about heredity but is about understanding divine justice in a world under divine governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blenkinsopp|first1=Joseph|title=Ezekiel|date=1990|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=0-8042-3118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}  

"Theodicy in the Minor Prophets differs little from that in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel."&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redditt|first1=Paul L|title=Thematic Threads in the Book of the Twelve|date=2003|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=3-11-017594-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the first chapter of Habakuk raises questions about Yahweh's justice, laments God's inaction in punishing injustice, and looks for God's action in response--then objects to what God chooses.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 1}} Instead of engaging in debate, God gives Habakuk a vision of the future which includes five oracles that form a theodicy: (1) God has a plan and has appointed a time for judgment.  It may be slow in coming as humans see things, but it will come. (2) The woe oracles confront the prevalence of evil in the world and the justice those acts have earned (3) The vision of the manifestation of God is a recognition of God's power to address these issues  (4) God as a warrior will fight for his people  (5) The song of triumph says the faithful will prevail by holding to trust and hope.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Intro, Chapter 3}}  Joel and the other minor prophets demonstrate that theodicy and eschatology are connected in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Psalm 73 presents the internal struggle created by personal suffering and the prosperity of the wicked.  The writer gains perspective when he "enters the sanctuary of God (16-17)" seeing that God's justice will eventually prevail.  He reaffirms his relationship with Yahweh, is ashamed of his resentment, and chooses trust. &lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 73}}  Psalm 77 contains real outspokenness to God as well as determination to hold onto faith and trust.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 77}} 

For the Christian, the Scriptures assure him or her that the allowance of evil is for a good purpose based on relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Frame and Joseph E. Torres, Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2015), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Some of the good ... cannot be achieved without delay and suffering, and the evil of this world is indeed necessary for the achievement of those good purposes. ... God has the right to allow such evils to occur, so long as the 'goods' are facilitated and the 'evils' are limited and compensated in the way that various other Christian doctrines (of human freewill, life after death, the end of the world, etc.) affirm. ...the 'good states' which (according to Christian doctrine) God seeks are so good that they outweigh the accompanying evils."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|Intro.,51}} 

This is somewhat illustrated in the [[Book of Exodus]] when Pharaoh is described as being raised up that God's name be known in all the earth Exodus 9:16. This is mirrored in Romans' ninth chapter, where Paul appeals to God's sovereignty as sufficient explanation, with God's goodness experientially known to the Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics, Frame 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augustinian theodicy===
{{Main article|Augustinian theodicy}}
The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] reading of [[Augustinian theodicy]], as promoted primarily by [[John Hick]], is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=24 March 2000; substantive revision 12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic (pre-reformation) formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below. In Hick's approach, this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a [[privation]]—or corruption—of goodness, and therefore God did not create evil.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly, with no evil or human suffering. Evil entered the world through the disobedience of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–78&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness, form, order, and measure due to the inherited original sin of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God, for if a nature was completely evil (deprived of the good), it would cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains that God remains blameless and good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]] reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the issue of [[just war]] as developed in his book [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']] substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing, suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html A Time For War?] Christianity Today (2001-01-09). Retrieved on 2013-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine asserted that peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |date=2012-07-28 }}.

===Irenaean theodicy===
{{Main article|Irenaean theodicy}}

[[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202), born in the early second century, expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development. Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts: humans were made first in the image, then in the likeness, of God. The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection, whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection. To achieve moral perfection, Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will. To achieve such free will, humans must experience suffering and God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (a distance of knowledge) from humanity. Therefore, evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;
Davis 2001, pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, [[John Hick]] collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy. He argued that the world exists as a "vale of soul-making" (a phrase that he drew from [[John Keats]]), and that suffering and evil must therefore occur. He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origenian theodicy===
In direct response to John Hick's description of theodicy, Mark Scott has indicated that neither [[Augustine of Hippo]] nor [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick's theistic version of theodicy. As a theologian among the [[Church Fathers]] who articulated a theory of ''[[apokatastasis]]'' (or [[universal reconciliation]]), [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]] provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick's presentation of universal salvation and theodicy. Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Mark (2012). ''Origen and the Problem of Evil'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relatively minor theodicies===
[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 436–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The Finite God Theodicy maintains that God is all-good ([[omnibenevolent]]) but not all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]).
:* The [[Best of all possible worlds|Best of all Possible Worlds]] Theodicy, a traditional theology, argues that the creation is the best of all possible worlds.
:* The [[Original Sin]] Theodicy holds that evil came into the world because of humanity's original sin.
:* The Ultimate Harmony Theodicy justifies evil as leading to “good long-range consequences”.
:* The Degree of Desirability of a Conscious State Theodicy has been reckoned a “complex theodicy.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramblings of a Thomist, Blog of March 27, 2008 http://thomisticramblings.blogspot.com/2008/03/minor-theodicies-and.html. Accessed September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that a person’s state is deemed evil only when it is undesirable to the person. However, because God is unable to make a person’s state desirable to the person, the theodic problem does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 444–45. Martin finds this theodicy in George Schlesinger, ''Religion and Scientific Method'' (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012) and judges it unsatisfactory.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[Reincarnation]] Theodicy believes that people suffer evil because of their wrong-doing in a previous life.
:* The Contrast Theodicy holds that evil is needed to enable people to appreciate or understand good.
:* The Warning Theodicy rationalizes evil as God’s warning to people to mend their ways.

=== Islamic world ===

[[Mu'tazila]] theologians approached the problem of theodicy within a framework of [[moral realism]], according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ayman Shihadeh|title=Suffering|editor=Josef W. Meri|encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=772|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA772}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the divine act of creation is good despite existence of suffering, because it allows humans a compensation of greater reward in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; They posited that individuals have free will to commit evil and absolved God of responsibility for such acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; God's justice thus consists of punishing wrongdoers.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Following the demise of Mu'tazila as a school, their theodicy was adopted in the [[Zaydi]] and [[Twelver]] branches of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Most Sunni theologians analyzed theodicy from an anti-realist [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] standpoint.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theologians argued that ordinary moral judgments stem from emotion and social convention, which are inadequate to either condemn or justify divine actions.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ash'arites hold that God creates everything, including human actions, but distinguish creation (''khalq'') from acquisition (''kasb'') of actions.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;{{cite book|title=What is Islamic Philosophy?|author=Roy Jackson|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XPMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow individuals the latter ability, though they do not posit existence of free will in a fuller sense of the term. In the words of [[Al-Shahrastani]] (1086–1153):&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

{{quote|God creates, in man, the power, ability, choice, and will to perform an act, and man, endowed with this derived power, chooses freely one of the alternatives and intends or wills to do the action, and, corresponding to this intention, God creates and completes the action.}}

[[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, also insists on ultimate divine transcendence and teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, so that on the question of God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L.

[[Ibn Sina]], the most influential Muslim philosopher, analyzed theodicy from a purely ontological, [[neoplatonic]] standpoint, aiming to prove that God, as the absolutely good First Cause, created a good world.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ibn Sina argued that evil refers either to a cause of an entity (such as burning in a fire), being a quality of another entity, or to its imperfection (such as blindness), in which case it does not exist as an entity. According to Ibn Sina, such qualities are necessary attributes of the best possible order of things, so that the good they serve is greater than the harm they cause.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Philosophical Sufi theologians such as [[Ibn Arabi]] were influenced by the neoplatonic theodicy of [[Ibn Sina]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] anticipated the optimistic theodicy of Leibniz in his dictum "There is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Religious Diversity, Evil, and a Variety of Theodicies |author=Michael L. Peterson|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity|editor=Chad Meister|year=2011|page=162|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195340136.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195340136-e-12|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], who represented the mainstream Sunni view, challenged Ibn Sina's analysis and argued that it merely sidesteps the real problem of evil, which is rooted in the human experience of suffering in a world that contains more pain than pleasure.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

The [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]], whose writings became influential in [[Wahhabism]], argued that, while God creates human acts, humans are responsible for their deeds as the agents of their acts.&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Jon|last=Hoover|title=Ḥanbalī Theology|editor=Sabine Schmidtke|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696703.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199696703-e-014|subscription=yes|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that divine creation is good from a casual standpoint, as God creates all things for wise purposes.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; Thus apparent evil is in actuality good in view of its purpose, and pure evil does not exist.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; This analysis was developed further with practical illustrations by [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Jewish anti-theodicy===
{{Main article|Holocaust theology}}
In 1998, Jewish theologian [[Zachary Braiterman]] coined the term anti-theodicy in his book ''(God) After Auschwitz'' to describe Jews, both in a biblical and post-Holocaust context, whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering. An anti-theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God, but must rise from an individual's belief in and love of God. Anti-theodicy has been likened to [[Job (religious figure)|Job's]] protests in the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty &amp; Taliaferro 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Braiterman wrote that an anti-theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs &amp; Wolfson 2002, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holocaust]] prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some [[Jewish theology|Jewish]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;Pinnock 2002, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; French Jewish philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]], who had himself been a [[prisoner of war]] in Nazi Germany, declared theodicy to be "blasphemous", arguing that it is the "source of all immorality", and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended. Levinas asked whether the idea of [[moral absolutism|absolutism]] survived after the Holocaust, which he proposed it did. He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil, but to attempt to live godly lives; rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust, the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson &amp; Roth 2005, pp. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of theology David R. Blumenthal, in his book ''Facing the Abusing God'', supports the "theology of protest", which he saw as presented in the play, ''[[The Trial of God]]''. He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it. Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the [[book of Job]], in which Job does not question God's existence or power, but his morality and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal 1993, pp. 250–51&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L. Rubinstein in his book ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Richard L. ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]], sought to elucidate how faith (or trust, ''emunah'') in God defines the full, transcendental preconditions of anti-theodicy. Endorsing the attitude of "holy protest" found in the stories of Job and Jeremiah, but also in those of Abraham ([[Vayeira|Genesis 18]]) and Moses ([[Ki Tissa|Exodus 33]]), Rabbi Schneerson argued that a phenomenology of protest, when carried through to its logical limits, reveals a profound conviction in cosmic justice such, as we first find in Abraham's question: "Will the Judge of the whole earth not do justice?" (Genesis 18:25). Recalling Kant's 1791 essay on the failure of all theoretical attempts in theodicy,&lt;ref&gt;''Über das Misslingen aller philosophischen Versuche in der Theodizee'' http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a viable practical theodicy is identified with [[Chabad messianism|messianism]]. This faithful anti-theodicy is worked out in a long letter of 26 April 1965 to Elie Wiesel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/ The original letter in Yiddish is found in R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, ''Likutei Siḥot'', Vol. 33 (New York: Kehot, 1962–2001), pp. 255–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian alternatives to theodicy===
A number of Christian writers oppose theodicies. Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice”.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Billings, "Theodicy as a 'Lived Question': Moving Beyond a Theoretical Approach to Theodicy", http://www.luthersem.edu/ctrf/JCTR/Vol05/billings.htm Accessed September 25, 2013. About the author: http://www.westernsem.edu/about/faculty-staff/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Nick Trakakis]] observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils, not remove or illuminate them.”&lt;ref&gt;Nick Trakakis, “Theodicy: The Solution to the Problem of Evil, or Part of the Problem?”, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/72023480656648g2/ Springerlink.com], accessed December 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to theodicy, some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Musser and [[Joseph L. Price]], eds., ''A New Handbook of Christian Theology'' (Abingdon Press, 1992), s.v. “Tragedy.”&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil”.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Farley, ''Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: a Contemporary Theodicy'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1990) 12, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah K. Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering. However, she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God, evil, and suffering from a practical faith perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Katherine Pinnock, ''Beyond Theodicy'' (SUNY Press, 2002), 135, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Barth]] viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of [[divine providence]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'' (T &amp; T Clark, 1957), IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this view, Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes "the idea of the goodness of God".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', III-1, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; For Barth, only the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] could establish the goodness of God. In the crucifixion, God bears and suffers what humanity suffers.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion:&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Justification (theology)|justification of sinful humanity]] and “the justification in which God justifies Himself”.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]] offers a rational, though widely unacceptable, solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil", 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whale, J. S. The Christian answer to the problem of evil. 1948&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Mark Twain]] had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering, which are well-described by [[Stephen Gottschalk]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rolling Away the Stone: Mary Baker Eddy's Challenge to Materialism" (Indiana University Press, 2006) 83, 123, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redemptive suffering]] based in Pope John Paul II's [[theology of the body]] embraces suffering as having value in and of itself.&lt;ref name="Adrian J. Reimers"&gt;{{cite article|last=Reimers|first=Adrian J.|title=Human Suffering and Jon Paul II's Theology of the Body|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~areimers/Suffering-JPII-expanded.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicprimer.org/papal/theology_of_the_body.pdf|title=Catholicprimer.org|website=www.catholicprimer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleonore Stump]] in "Wandering in Darkness" uses psychology, narrative and exegesis to demonstrate that redemptive suffering, as found in Thomistic theodicy, can constitute a consistent and cogent defence for the problem of suffering.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stump|first=Eleonore|title=Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=N.Y. New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-927742-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Free will defense===
{{see also|Theodicy and the Bible#Bible and free will theodicy}}
As an alternative to a theodicy, a defense may be offered as a response to the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show that God's existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] offers [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|a free will defense]] which argues that human [[free will]] sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God's existence remains logically possible.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that, if God's existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails that God's existence remains consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.&lt;ref name="Ehrman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart D. Ehrman|title=God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question – Why We Suffer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOCx_wcDkbYC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-174440-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmodicy and anthropodicy&lt;!--'Anthropodicy' redirects here--&gt;===
A cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the [[universe]] in the face of [[evil]], and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of [[human nature]] in the face of the evils produced by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Meiner, Kristin Veel, eds., ''The Cultural Life of Catastrophes and Crises'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2012), 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy, Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;van der Ven 1989, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Philip E. Devenish proposed what he described as "a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary, rather than alternative concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Devenish 1992, pp. 5–23&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian J. Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy, cosmodicy and anthropodicy:
{{quote|In classical terms, this is to broach the problem of theodicy: how to think about God in the face of the presence of suffering in God's creation. After God's dethronement as the subject of history, the question rebounds to the new subject of history: the human being. As a consequence, theodicy becomes anthropodicy – justifications of our faith in humanity as the subject of history, in the face of the suffering that is so inextricably woven into the history that humanity makes.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley 2010, pp. 870–902&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Essential kenosis ====

Essential kenosis is a form of process theology, (also known as "open theism") that allows one to affirm that God is almighty, while simultaneously affirming that God cannot prevent genuine evil. Because out of love God necessarily gives freedom, agency, self-organization, natural processes, and law-like regularities to creation, God cannot override, withdraw, or fail to provide such capacities. Consequently, God is not culpable for failing to prevent genuine evil. Thomas Jay Oord's work explains this view most fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Uncontrolling Love of God: An Open and Relational Account of Providence|url = https://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolling-Love-God-Relational-Providence/dp/0830840842/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257309&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uncontrolling+love+of+god|publisher = IVP Academic|date = 2015-12-06|isbn = 9780830840847|language = English|first = Thomas Jay|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Love: A Theology|url = https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Love-Dr-Thomas-Oord-ebook/dp/B003UD7QQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nature+of+love+oord|publisher = Chalice Press|date = 2010-04-10|language = English|first = Dr Thomas|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gijsbert van den Brink effectively refutes any view which says God has restricted His power because of his love saying it creates a "metaphysical dualism", and it would not alleviate God's responsibility for evil because God could have prevented evil by not restricting himself. Van den Brink goes on to elaborate an explanation of power and love within the Trinitarian view which equates power and love, and what he calls "the power of love" as representative of God's involvement in the struggle against evil.&lt;ref name="Gijsbert van den Brink"&gt;{{cite book| last="van den Brink"| first=Gijsbert| title=Almighty God: A Study on the Doctrine of Divine Omnipotence| publisher=Kok Pharos publishing House| location=Kampen, the Netherlands|year=1993|pages=263–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">In [[science]] and [[research]], an '''attribute''' is a characteristic of an object (person, thing, etc.).&lt;ref name=babbie&gt;[[Earl R. Babbie]], ''The Practice of Social Research", 12th edition, Wadsworth Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0-495-59841-0}}, p. 14-18&lt;/ref&gt; Attributes are closely related to variables. A '''variable''' is a [[logic]]al set of attributes.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; Variables can "vary" - for example, be high or low.&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; How high, or how low, is determined by the value of the attribute (and in fact, an attribute could be just the word "low" or "high").&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt; ''(For example see: [[Binary option]])''

While an attribute is often intuitive, the '''variable''' is the [[operationalization|operationalized]] way in which the attribute is represented for further [[data processing]]. In data processing [[data]] are often represented by a combination of ''items'' (objects organized in rows), and multiple variables (organized in columns).

Values of each variable statistically "vary" (or are distributed) across the variable's domain. A domain is a set of all possible values that a variable is allowed to have. The values are ordered in a logical way and must be defined for each variable. Domains can be bigger or smaller. The smallest possible domains have those variables that can only have two values, also called ''binary'' (or dichotomous) variables. Bigger domains have ''non-dichotomous'' variables and the ones with a higher [[level of measurement]]. (See also [[domain of discourse]].)

Semantically, greater precision can be obtained when considering an object's characteristics by distinguishing 'attributes' (characteristics that are attributed to an object) from '[[Phenotypic_trait|traits]]' (characteristics that are inherent to the object).

==Examples==
[[Ageing|Age]] is an attribute that can be operationalized in many ways. It can be dichotomized so that only two values - "old" and "young" - are allowed for further data processing. In this case the attribute "age" is operationalized as a binary variable. If more than two values are possible and they can be ordered, the attribute is represented by ordinal variable, such as "young", "middle age", and "old". Next it can be made of rational values, such as 1, 2, 3.... 99&lt;ref name=babbie/&gt;

The "social class" attribute can be operationalized in similar ways as age, including "lower", "middle" and "upper class" and each class could be differentiated between upper and lower, transforming thus changing the three attributes into six (see the [[Social_class#William_Lloyd_Warner|model proposed by William Lloyd Warner]]) or it could use different terminology (such as the [[working class]] as in the [[Social_class#Gilbert_.26_Kahl|model by Gilbert and Kahl]]).

'''Wolfson Centre for Magnetics''' ('''WCM''') is a research and knowledge centre operating within School of Engineering at [[Cardiff University]].

__TOC__

==Research==
WCM is a centre for research, teaching and technology transfer over a wide spectrum of magnetics, including magnetic engineering, magnetic materials, magnetic devices, and the physics of magnetism.

Research within WCM focuses on several areas related to production, characterisation and applications of [[magnetic materials]]. The scope of the Centre's research activities has recently been broadened by the addition of several new academic staff, allowing the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics to capitalise on the anticipated growth of research opportunities in collaborative, interdisciplinary projects in [[magnetism]] and magnetic materials. [[Computer aided design]] in magnetics, [[electromagnetic machine]]s, [[magnetic imaging]], high permeability materials, [[magnetostriction]], magnetic [[sensors]] and [[actuators]], [[nanomagnetic materials]], magnetic [[thin films]] and multilayers, magnetic material for [[data storage device|data storage]], theory and modelling of magnetic materials are all areas of research currently under investigation in the centre.

Postgraduate research and industrial contract projects are carried out with the support of equipment and research facilities recently upgraded through major infrastructure investments.

WCM has collaborative links with leading research groups in magnetics throughout [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[India]] and [[Korea]]. Its members participate regularly in [[Academic conference|conference]]s, networking and collaborative research projects both nationally and internationally.

==Facilities==
The Wolfson Centre for Magnetics has a wide range of state of the facilities within its laboratories, which support the research and industrial consultancy activities. Ongoing investment, including an award  from the [[EPSRC]]/[[Energy Saving Trust|EST]] [[Joint Infrastructure Fund|Joint Infrastracture Fund (JIF)]] in 2003 helped in continuous improvement of existing infrastructure and a [[Strategic Research Investment Fund|Strategic Research Investment Fund (SRIF)]] awarded in 2005-2006.

The existing facilities include:

[[File:WCM universal measuring system.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of a measuring system]]

===AC and DC properties===

The [[power loss]], [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], [[apparent power]], [[flux density]], [[magnetic field]], [[Barkhausen noise]], [[magnetostriction]] characteristics of [[soft magnetic materials]] and [[hard magnetic materials]] can be measured with a range of test systems under [[Direct current|DC]], [[Alternating current|AC]] and rotational magnetising conditions. These systems enable material in a wide range of geometries to be tested from 0.001&amp;nbsp;Hz up to 200&amp;nbsp;kHz with controlled arbitrary [[waveform]]s.

===Stress and temperature annealing===

Several of the AC and DC characterisation systems can be used with the sample under stress (±50 [[kilonewton|kN]]) or at a pre-defined temperature (varied from &amp;minus;150&amp;nbsp;°C to +600&amp;nbsp;°C using an environmental chamber, [[laboratory oven]] or [[oil bath]]).

===Micro/nano scale characterisation===

High magnification domain observation system uses the longitudinal and polar [[Kerr effect]] for dynamic observation of surface domain structures at a maximumum rate of 1825 [[Film frame|frames]] per second and maximum magnetification of 500 times.

Vibrating Sample [[Magnetometer]] is used for the DC characterisation of magnetic [[film]]s, [[magnetic tape|tape]]s and [[Powder (substance)|powders]] at magnetic fields up to 3 T in the temperature range from 8 [[Kelvin|K]] to 1270 K.

Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS) performs DC characterisation utilising a reciprocating sample and SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) detection for ultimate resolution at magnetic fields up to 5 T.

Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS) enables the measurement of phenomena such as the magnetocaloric effect, magnetostriction and magnetoresistance over a wide range of temperatures at magnetic fields of up to 7 T.

Magnetic properties close to the surface of soft magnetic materials can be analysed using the Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect Potter (MOKE) which utilises the transverse Kerr effect to measure magnetisation loops in samples such as ferromagnetic films.

[[File:WCM wire production.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A system for production of amorphous microwires]]

===Fabrication of materials===

There is a magnetic [[microwire]]-making room, which is equipped with all units necessary for the production of uncoated and glass-coated amorphous and nanocrystalline wires using [[rapid quenching]] from the melt techniques. The room contains:
* Pre-alloy preparation unit - capacity 20-200 g, provides 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; atm vacuum or inert gas atmosphere. It consist of a [[quartz]] chamber and an [[Edwards Diffstak]] combined vacuum system. Can be used to prepare metallic pre-alloys containing [[metal]]s ([[iron|Fe]], [[cobalt|Co]], [[nickel|Ni]]), [[metaloid]]s ([[phosphorus|P]], [[boron|B]], [[carbon|C]]) and [[rare earth elements]].
* In rotating-water quenched wires preparation unit - used for the preparation of metallic [[amorphous]] and [[nanocrystalline]] wires with cross section diameter around 125 μm and length up to 100 m.
* Glass-coated wires preparation unit - used for the preparation of glass-coated wires (amorphous and nanocrystalline), with diameter 1-50 μm of metallic part and 3-15 μm thickness of the glass coating.

An induction heater providing an output power of 5&amp;nbsp;kW at an operating frequency of up to 400&amp;nbsp;kHz, which operates with multiple workheads and with induction coils of various geometry is used to supply the power for all the above-mentioned units.

===Modelling and simulation===

The Centre employs electromagnetic design and analysis software. These are used in the simulation of [[2D geometric model|2D]] and [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] electromagnetic applications, such as the design and optimization of [[electrical machine]]s, [[non-destructive evaluation]], sensors and actuators, [[permanent magnet]] devices and high frequency applications.

===Performance of electromagnetic devices===

A 3 phase [[transformer]] tester is available for the characterisation of production transformers or simulated cores with a rating up to 15 [[kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] driven by either a constant voltage transformer or selected [[inverter drive]]s through computer controlled [[variac]]s.

A range of dynamometers are used for the assessment of the performance of rotating machines up to a maximum speed of 24,000 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and maximum rating of 24 [[kilowatt|kW]].  Variable loads may be applied using [[eddy current]] brakes or DC [[Electrical generator|generator]]s.

A wide range of electromagnetic emissions and immunity testing (including conducted, radiated, ESD, [[Voltage spike|surge]]s, interrupts, [[harmonics]] and [[flicker noise|flicker]]) can be performed with the EMC test suite, which is housed within custom built electromagnetically shielded enclosures. [[Electromagnetic shielding|Shielding]] efficiency of sheet materials under DC and low frequency magnetic fields can also be assessed.

Low levels of ambient magnetic field are attained using a 5 layer [[Mumetal]] enclosure. Various coil systems and highly sensitive field sensors may be used for the calibration of novel magnetic sensors.

Acoustic noise emanating from devices such as transformers, motors and actuators can be measured in the [[hemi-anechoic]] [[acoustic chamber]] using calibrated [[microphone]]s.

Thompson (first director of WCM from 1969 to 1990), Prof. David Jiles (director of WCM, from 2005 till present) and Prof. Anthony J. Moses (director of WCM from 1990 to 2005)]]

==History==
In 1969 a grant from the Wolfson Foundation of £132,000 was awarded to the [[University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology]] (UWIST) to establish a research centre to carry out basic and applied studies on magnetic materials and their industrial applications. Professor [[Jack E. Thompson]] was appointed the Director of the '''Wolfson Centre for the Technology of Soft Magnetic Materials'''. The original objective was to create a unique UK Centre capable of competing at the international level. This objective remains broadly the same today. A property was purchased in 30 The Parade - a street near the University's buildings.

In the 1970s the WCM was awarded the multidisciplinary [[Center of excellence|Centre of Excellence]] recognition by the [[Science Research Council]], the forerunner of today's [[EPSRC]]. Professor Thompson was appointed Head of Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [[Cardiff University|University College Cardiff]] (UCC) and by mutual agreement WCM was transferred to UCC.

WCM hosted the Second [[Soft Magnetic Materials Conference]] (SMM2) in 1975 and the Centre's name was changed to the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics Technology reflecting its broader range of expertise and activities. The Wolfson Centre hosted SMM5 in 1985 and research carried out at the Centre became commercialised with the establishment of one of the University's first spin out companies, [[MR Sensors Ltd.]], to manufacture [[thin film]] [[sensor]]s in Cardiff.

When UWIST and UCC merged in 1988 the Wolfson Centre became part of the School of Electrical, Electronic and Systems Engineering, which later became the [[Cardiff School of Engineering]]. The Centre later moved to its present location in purpose built laboratories in the Queen's Buildings on Newport Road, which was part of a £30 million refurbishment of Engineering and Science buildings at Cardiff University.

Professor Thompson retired in 1990 and [[Anthony J. Moses|Professor Moses]] became the new Director. In 1994 the WCM was designated a [[Centre of Expertise]] by the [[Welsh Development Agency]]. The Wolfson Centre hosted another major international conference, the [[International Symposium on Non-Linear Electromagnetics]] (ISEM) in 1995.

In 1999, major government funding of £1.3 million under the [[Joint Infrastructure Fund]] (JIF) was awarded to the Wolfson Centre to expand and improve facilities and enable the Wolfson Centre research staff to carry out cutting-edge magnetics research into the next decade.

[[File:AJ Moses and Queen.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Prof. A.J. Moses (first from the left) and Queen Elizabeth II (second from the right)]]
In 2000 [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited Cardiff University and also saw some activity of the WCM.

In 2001 the Wolfson Centre hosted the first UK [[Joint Magnetics Workshop]] (JMW) of the new millennium and was approved as one of 20 [[Centre of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration|Centres of Excellence for Technology and Industrial Collaboration]] (CETIC) within [[Wales]]. The formal opening of new Wolfson Centre facilities established as a result of the £1.3 million investment awarded under the Joint Infrastructure Fund took place in January 2003.

In 1995, the WCM hosted the [[ISEM]] Conference on its first visit to Europe.

On 14 May 2003 Prof. A.J. Moses was awarded an [[honorary degree]] - ''Doctor Honoris Causa'' by the [[Lublin]] University of Technology (LUT), Poland. This was partially a part of recognition of the strong cooperation between LUT, other Polish Institutes and WCM, which started in 1985.

In June 2004 the Wolfson Centre was host to the Fifth [[European Magnetic Sensors and Actuators Conference]] (EMSA).

In August 2005 Professor [[David Jiles]] was appointed as the new Director and the name of the Centre was changed to its current form Wolfson Centre for Magnetics to better reflect the range of activities being undertaken within the Centre, which includes not only magnetics technology but also basic scientific aspects of magnetics.

In 2005-2006 the WCM was awarded a [[Strategic Research Investment Fund|Strategic Research Investment Fund (SRIF)]] (£1.5 million).

==Present and future==
WCM is a multinational centre and its members come from various countries around the world: [[Bangladesh]], [[Brazil]], [[Burma]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ghana]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Iraq]], [[Japan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[South Africa]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[UK]], [[Ukraine]], [[Thailand]] and [[United States]].

Cardiff University plans a further major expansion of the WCM to increase the number of faculty working in magnetics and to continue the improvement of the existing research facilities. The expansion will focus on aspects of magnetics related to energy, healthcare, nanoscale magnetics, sensors. These include: bulk hard magnetic materials, high frequency materials, low-dimensional materials (micro and nano), nanoscale magnetic structures, magnetic non-destructive evaluation methods, and biomedical applications of magnetics.

On completion the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics will be one of the largest and best-equipped research centres in magnetics in Europe.

In 2007 the WCM was the host for the [[Soft Magnetic Materials Conference]] (SMM18) and in 2008 will be for [[International Workshop on 1 &amp; 2 Dimensional Magnetic Measurement and Testing|1&amp;2DM Workshop]].

==People==
During its existence over 150 [[higher degree]]s were awarded on basis of research carried out in WCM. Over the years many internationally known scientists were, and are working within the WCM:
