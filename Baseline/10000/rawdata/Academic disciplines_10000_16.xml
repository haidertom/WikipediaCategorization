      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5416">[[File:Altamira, boar.JPG|thumb|right|A living trotting boar, or a dead boar lying on its side? Cave painting from [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]].]]

'''Aberrant decoding''' or '''aberrant reading''' is a concept used in fields such as [[communication studies|communication]] and [[media studies]], [[semiotics]], and [[journalism]] about how messages can be interpreted differently from what was intended by their sender. The concept was proposed by [[Umberto Eco]] in an article published first in 1965 in [[Italian language|Italian]] and in 1972 in English.&lt;ref name=Eco1972&gt;{{cite paper|last=Eco|first=Umberto|others=trans. Paola Splendore|journal=Working Papers in Cultural Studies|title=Towards a Semiotic Inquiry Into the Television Message|year=1972|volume=3|pages=103–21|publisher=University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Every [[communication]] act requires that the messages must be [[Encode (semiotics)|encoded]] into a set of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] by the sender. These signs must then be transmitted and [[Decode (semiotics)|decoded]] by the receiver to understand the contained messages. The [[Code|code system]] must be shared by both the sender and the receiver in order for the communication to succeed. For example, thoughts must be encoded into words, transmitted through air, and then be decoded back to thoughts. Often the sender has a certain meaning to convey with his message, hoping the receiver will interpret it correctly. This right interpretation can be called the ''preferred decoding'' or ''preferred reading''. When the interpretation of the message is different from what was intended, this can be called ''aberrant decoding''.&lt;ref name=Fiske1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John|title=Introduction to Communication Studies|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415046725|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberrant decodings can occur in a more widespread range of situations, as wrong interpretation of a media product or text whose incoming message is not the one intended by the creator of the product or text.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eco, aberrant decodings were rare in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]], when most communication occurred between people who shared the same [[culture]]. He lists four classes of exceptions where aberrant decodings could have happened:&lt;ref name=Hartley2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|title=Communication, Cultural and Media Studies: The key concepts|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415268899|edition=3rd|author2=Rennie, Elinor|author3= Brennan, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*People who did not share the same language.
*People trying to interpret the meanings of past cultures. For example, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people looking at [[Roman art]].
*People who did not share the same [[belief system]]. For example, [[Christian]]s looking at [[Paganism|pagan]] art.
*People who came from different cultures. For example, white [[Europeans]] looking at [[Aboriginal art]].

Eco continues that in contemporary media, instead of being exceptions, aberrant decodings have become the norm. For example, TV broadcasters know beforehand that their messages will be interpreted in various ways. He speculated that because of this freedom of interpretation, the power of media over individuals might be much less influential than is thought.&lt;ref name="Hartley2002" /&gt;

This idea of examining the messages contained in the media and how the audience interprets them has since become one of the core concepts of academic media research. Eco's article influenced, among others, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s [[Hall's Theory|encoding/decoding theory]].&lt;ref name="Hartley2002" /&gt;

[[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] has argued that aberrant decoding occurs mainly with [[Iconography|iconic codes]], referring to visual messages.&lt;ref name="Fiske1990" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Iconic codes'' or ''iconic signs'' in semiotics and communication theory could also refer to a [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs|class of signs]] defined by [[iconicity]] (as in [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s triadic sign theory). But in this case Fiske contrasts iconic signs with "verbal language" (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he explains how prehistoric cave paintings of animals are often seen as graceful and moving. However, in 1960 [[M. L. J. Abercrombie|Margaret Abercrombie]]&lt;ref name=Abercrombie1960&gt;{{cite book|last=Abercrombie|first=Margaret|title=The Anatomy of Judgement: An Investigation into the Processes of Perception and Reasoning|year=1960|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|isbn=978-1299246812}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the paintings are, in fact, depictions of dead animals. Thus if we accept Abercrombie's claim, we can argue that our modern culture, where we value living animals and only rarely encounter dead ones, has led us to aberrant decoding of the paintings.

Thus, when sound passes through an acoustic board, the intensity of sound is decreased. The loss of sound energy is balanced by producing heat energy.

==Uses==
They are used in [[auditoriums]], [[hall]]s, [[seminar rooms]], [[libraries]], [[courts]] and wherever sound insulation is needed. Acoustic boards are also used in speaker boxes.

[[Image:Kufstein Almabtrieb 2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Almabtrieb'' in [[Kufstein]], Austria]]
The '''Almabtrieb''' (in [[Switzerland]]: '''Alpabzug''', '''Alpabfahrt''', or in [[French language|French]] speaking Switzerland: '''Désalpes'''; [[German language]] literally: ''drive from the mountain pasture'') is an annual event in the [[Alps|alpine regions]] in [[Europe]], referring to a [[cattle drive]] that takes place in late September or early October.

During summer, all over the [[Alps|alpine regions]] [[cattle]] herds feed on alpine [[pasture]]s (''Almen'' in Austria or Germany, ''Alpen'' in Switzerland) high up in the mountains, a practice known as [[transhumance]]. In numbers, these amount to about 500,000 in [[Austria]], 380,000 in [[Switzerland]], and 50,000 in [[Germany]].

While there is often some movement of cattle between the ''Almen'' (sing.: ''Alm''), or ''Alpen'' (sing.: ''Alp'') respectively, during the summer, there is usually one concerted cattle drive in the autumn to bring the cattle to their barns down in the valley. If there were no accidents on the ''Alm'' during the summer, in many areas the cattle are decorated elaborately, and the cattle drive is celebrated with music and dance events in the towns and villages. Upon arrival in the valley, joint herds from multiple farmers are sorted in the ''Viehscheid'', and each animal is returned to its owner.

In many places this Alpine custom of ''Almabtrieb'' has today evolved into a major [[tourism|tourist]] attraction, with a public festival, and booths set up along the course for selling agricultural, as well as artisans', products along with alcoholic beverages.

In the spring, the reverse cattle drive moves from the valley barns to the ''Alp'' (in Switzerland: ''Alpaufzug'', ''Alpfahrt'', ''Alpauffahrt''; in Germany/Austria: ''Almauftrieb''). It is celebrated in Switzerland, though less well known. It is not celebrated in Germany and Austria, however.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19947">An '''Assistant Language Teacher''' ('''ALT''') is a foreign national serving as an [[assistant teacher]] ([[paraprofessional educator]]) in a Japanese classroom, particularly for English.

The term was created by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]] at the time of the creation of the [[JET Programme]] as a translation of the term 外国語指導助手 (''gaikokugo shidō joshu'') or literally "foreign language instruction assistant". The terms '''AET''' (Assistant English Teacher), '''ELT''' (English Language Teacher) and '''NESA''' (Native English Speaking Assistant) are also in use. The term is used by the Ministry of Education, local Boards of Education ('''BOE'''s) and schools in Japan primarily to refer to [[English language]] speakers who assist with [[Teaching English as a foreign language|teaching of English]] in [[primary school|elementary]], [[middle school|junior high]] and [[secondary school|senior high school]]s. However, some ALTs help teach languages other than English.

ALTs are required to be [[university]] graduates, but they are usually not certified teachers like their Japanese colleagues.

==Being an ALT==

===Requirements===

The JET Programme set the general prerequisites imposed by [[Immigration to Japan|Japanese immigration]] ([[bachelor's degree]], [[health]], [[nationality]]) and the characteristics that can be considered to be sought by the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]], [[board of education|boards of education]] (BOEs), and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |title=Teach English in Japan |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction |date=December 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207232329/http://dpi.wi.gov/cal/wlcjflyer.html |archivedate=February 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of ALTs from private language teaching companies, further requirements may include items such as [[Teaching English as a foreign language|TEFL]] [[certification]], [[Japanese language]] ability (at least spoken) at a communicative level, teaching experience (both within Japan and in other countries) and other specialized skills ([[foreign language]]s other than English, IT, etc.)  However, as a basic rule, the standards that are expected of JET Programme are still considered as norms among private language teaching companies that provide ALTs to BOEs, although agreements between BOEs and private companies often allow for a relaxing on some of these rules.

===Recruitment===
At one time, the majority of ALTs were recruited through the JET Programme, but now most are hired by private language teaching companies, also known as "dispatch companies", either within Japan or abroad. Once hired, ALTs are sent to work in junior and senior high-schools and, increasingly, in elementary schools throughout Japan. ALTs are either assigned to one main school, or can work at a number of different schools in their area.  ALTs entering on the JET programme are not required to have any prior teaching experience or ESL training. Many ALTs hired privately have prior experience and/or training.

ALTs hired on the JET Programme typically enter either in July or August, but most private ALTs are usually on a contract which runs from April until at least the end of the third school term in March. Some AETs dispatched to City of Nagoya public schools have contracts that begin in mid-May and end in mid-February. Some ALTs also have set, paid holidays during the spring, summer and winter school vacations, in addition to all Japanese public holidays, but some ALTs are not paid between semesters or for national holidays, and do not receive paid vacation leave. By combining the 23 national holidays with the time off during school holidays, the actual number of working days per year is somewhere near 200 through private companies, which is one of the major attractions of the ALT position, however many schools require you to undertake other tasks when not teaching, so the actual hours worked are similar to other jobs in Japan. Most JET Programme ALTs are required to work through the school holidays, receiving the 23 national holidays plus annual leave as holiday time.

===Payment===

The pay for a private ALT is usually less than a full-time [[Eikaiwa]] teacher and far less than a teacher from the [[JET Programme]] (¥3.36 to ¥3.96 million depending on year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://jetprogramusa.org/contract-benefits/ |title=Contract Information |year=2016 |website=[[JET Programme|JET Program]] USA |access-date=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with some of the lowest salaries around ¥180,000 per month (¥2.16 million annually)
The Interac company ALTs/ dispatch staff make approximately ¥3600 (US $32) per hour, BUT, the ALT receives approximately half of that amount ¥1800( US$16 ) per hour before tax. Interac deducts approximately half of the monthly earnings with its justification being that it trains ALTs and incurs other administrative costs.In reality most Interac ALT's receive 5days of actual training before being dispatched to teach at schools. It is therefore a lucrative business for such companies, minimal initial investment, but constant monthly cashflow from the 3000+ active ALTs at Interac in Japan alone.If requested to attend 3 monthly briefing meetings,  the pay is ¥900 per hour( US $7.00).In Japan almost every business which employs a person for 30 hours(or more ), has to pay for the employees monthly health insurance.  Interac dodges having to pay health insurance for workers claiming to the government that its employees work only 29.5 hours per week instead of 30 hours. But in REALITY, employees are actually stuck at a school site or at a desk for 40hours(or more) per week {cn|date=October 16th 2018}}. Benefits and workload also vary.Elementary school ALTs are the most exhausted because they require extra 'Genki' energy to engage students and recently focus has changed with new MEXT ideologies as of March 2018 .  JHS and Highschool are less energy consuming but focus more on grammar and practical use of  English . Some companies pay their ALTs between semesters and some do not. Some provide benefits, such as access to employer subsidized health insurance, paid holidays, paid vacation/sick leave and unemployment insurance, and some do not.

===Job duties===
An ALT's primary duty is to assist Japanese teachers of English to deliver lessons in the classroom, and may be involved in lesson planning and other language teaching tasks.Regarding Elemenary school,  the term ALT is often misleading, in many instances the ALT will solely be responsible for total lesson planning( for the academic year and delivering the lessons). This is mostly the case with Elementary schools outside of the Kanto region. During such lessons, Japanese teachers often act as a support teacher or translator.In those instances the term "Assistant" Language Teacher becomes unsuitable, as the ALT is not "assisting" but actually "leading and facilitating" the entire english class.   However in Junior Highschool and Highschool, the degree to which the Japanese teacher of English actually uses the ALT is usually decided at the discretion of the Japanese teacher. Some allow ALTs to plan and lead language activities in class, sometimes for the entire class period, while others make minimal use of their ALT, such as limiting them to reading new vocabulary words for the students to repeat and having the ALT walk between the rows of students while the students do writing assignments. An ALT also contributes information to teaching advisors on phraseology and pronunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Positions|url=https://jetprogramusa.org/positions/|website=JET Program USA|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ALTs usually take part in three to five classes per day. The classes are usually 45–50 minutes in length. An ALT participates in about 17 to 20 classes per week. Sometimes ALTs are asked to help teach special education classes, which may include students who have barriers to learning. They may also be asked to take part in after/before school club activities (''bukatsudō''), such as sports, calligraphy, music or ikebana, to learn more about the culture alongside their students and to foster international exchange. However, some ALTs choose not to participate, or go from group to group just to visit. The English level of the students varies from school to school, and at some schools the students and teachers are unable to communicate in English in any meaningful way. Higher level high schools sometimes have an English club, which the ALT would attend and assist in the students' planning and preparations for debate contests, speech competitions and English camps.

ALTs may also be asked to perform tasks normally done by Japanese students and teachers, such as cleaning the school, cleaning drainage gutters, and removing snow from parking areas. ALTs at some schools, mostly junior high schools, are expected to eat lunch with the students. These ALTs might not be allowed to leave the school for lunch or to run personal errands during their break. ALTs may be instructed to use non-standard English in front of students.  They are sometimes asked to perform clerical tasks, such as correcting student writing assignments, by the Japanese teachers.

ALTs may be required to read aloud stories about [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombings]] and the lingering deaths of Japanese children to their classes, which omit any mention of [[World War II]] or the Japanese government's [[Japanese war crimes|conduct during the war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[New Horizon (textbook)|New Horizon]] 3|chapter=A Mother's Lullaby|page=36|publisher=Tokyo Shoseki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://akitajet.com/wiki/A_Mother's_Lullaby| title=A Mother's Lullaby| publisher=Akita JET| accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the private ALT system in Japan==
In 1999, Dispatch Law (労働者派遣) was deregulated to allow dispatch companies to enter into other fields of work aside from the traditional industry of manufacturing, including education. Since then more and more local boards of education have turned to private language companies to provide ALTs rather than using the JET Programme.

The business of private language teaching companies providing ALTs is increasing and some with hundreds of ALTs are covering all parts of the country.  There is the impression that the private sector in general continues to grow as The JET Programme loses share in the market. Private dispatch companies vary from large corporations to local firms.

===Differences between JET Programme ALTs and private company ALTs===

*'''Application:''' The JET Programme may be very competitive based on the hiring nation (the US, UK, Canada, Australia being examples) or very lax depending on the needs of the Programme for any fiscal year. Private ALT application processes vary, but tend to be highly competitive for smaller companies and very open with larger companies.
*'''Compensation:''' As of 2016, JET Programme ALTs are compensated between ¥3.36 and ¥3.96 million annually depending on their year in the program&lt;ref name="jetsalary" /&gt;. JET Programme participants will on average receive a higher initial monthly salary than ALTs from most private companies. However, some private companies require ALTs with TEFL certification who may be compensated at a higher level. This is rare, however, with some dispatched ALTs earning as little as ¥2.2 million per annum{{cn|date=April 2018}}.
*'''Support:''' The JET Programme has a nationwide support system for ALTs that tends to vary in utility based on the nature of each case. Private language companies that provide ALTs to BOEs vary in their approaches to supporting ALTs, ranging from a very hands-off approach to an experience more professionally invigorating than the JET Programme. Private ALTs tend to be more experienced and better trained to start, many being ex-JETs. Teacher support and professional development vary with company.
*'''Workload:''' The JET Programme typically follows the request of the BOE regarding the workload of each ALT. A frequent issue with JET Programme ALTs is being required to report to a town office or education center when school is not in session, often when they have no other work to do. In general, ALTs provided by private language teaching companies do not require ALTs to report to the local BOE on days when school is not in session, although they may be required to attend training or asked to take other work during working time. Typically workload and salary are related, in that lower pay is accompanied by fewer required working days or hours.
*'''External Work:''' JET Programme ALTs are generally prohibited from working outside the school. Private companies have differing policies that may or may not allow legal work on the side, however, most tend to either provide supplementary work at their own clients, or allow ALTs to seek extra work if they so choose.
*'''Contractual Term Limits''': JET Programme ALTs have a limited number of years to be contracted (to a maximum of 3 or 5 years, with contract renewals happening yearly), while private companies have no such restriction in most cases.

The above list is by no means comprehensive, and some other categories that vary from situation to situation may include: the ability to transfer (both locationally and between positions), evaluation, reward systems, and professional development opportunities.

==Union Activity and ALTs==

===Education law===

Some of the contracts that school boards have signed with private language teaching companies are illegal ''gyomu itaku'' (service contracts). According to the Japanese Ministry of Education, these contracts violate Japan's General Education Law since the principal must be in charge of all staff at their school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.150m.com/ |title=Gyomu Itaku Contracts are Illegal |date=February 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707055156/http://alt.150m.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with these contracts, the company is actually in charge - not the principal.

The licensed Japanese teacher is normally in charge of junior high school and high school classes regardless of where the ALT originates; however in the case of elementary school classes, the ALT is normally responsible for the entire class, with the Japanese teacher either providing limited input or in some cases not being present in the classroom, and for that reason the continuity of school management is sometimes maintained with the school principal in compliance with any legal requirements, as the product being contracted itself is an abstract, education, and the contract basis for private language teaching corporations is to provide education and educational services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

===29.5 hours per week===

It is common for ALTs to be recruited with job contracts with private language companies such as [[W5 (company)|W5]], [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], [[Borderlink]] and [[WING (company)|WING]] which stipulates ALT working hours as being 29.5 hours per week. In actuality, working hours usually range from 30 to 40 hours due to the fact that transition times between classes and other brief periods of time throughout the working day are scheduled as breaktimes. Employers often have employees sign such contracts in an effort to avoid paying into the employer based Social Insurance program, or [[Social welfare in Japan|Shakai hoken]]. While Social Insurance law states that all regular employees should be enrolled by their employer in Shakai Hoken, companies consistently tell their employees that they are ineligible. Their reasoning is that the 29.5 hours a week working time written into the contracts fall below an erroneous minimum of 3/4 full-time necessary for eligibility. The Social Insurance Agency uses the 3/4 of the hours of a similar full-time as a guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/rss/nn20080105f1.html|author=Kanako Takahara|title=Assistant language teachers in trying times|publisher=The Japan Times Online|date=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Japanese government has recent stated that there is, in fact, no minimum legal work time requirement for enrollment in Shakai Hoken. Furthermore, no company would ever be prohibited from enrolling their employees in the Social Insurance program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interacunion.org/to-interac-info-on-health-insurance/|title=To Interac: Info on Health Insurance|publisher=Nambu Foreign Workers Caucus|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some AETs dispatched to the City of [[Nagoya]] have a 35-hour work week and are not enrolled in Shakai Hoken, receive no paid sick leave, no paid holidays, no paid vacation leave, and are not enrolled in unemployment insurance. They are only paid for days worked and receive no pay between semesters except for a few training sessions.

===Kanagawa Board of Education===

In 2006, ALTs in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] who were previously hired directly as part-time workers rejected the privatization of their jobs to [[Interac (Japan)|Interac]], a nationwide language services dispatch company, and took the Kanagawa Prefecture Board of Education to the Labour Relations Board where the case is still on-going.

As in many cases, the likely cause of the dissolution of the direct-hire situation draws back to Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]] who took a hard-line stance on privatization (e.g. Japan Post) and the idea of allowing local governments more flexibility in deciding how to spend their budgets.

===Other local Boards of Education===

The General Workers Union has been involved with several boards of education in the Kanto area including the Tokyo Board of Education, the Koga Board of Education (in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]) and the Fukaya Board of Education (in [[Saitama Prefecture]]). In the case versus the Tokyo Board of Education, the General Workers Union won a decision stating that the directly hired ALTs were indeed legally classified as "workers" (''rodosha'') and not simply contractors. Further victories were achieved through the private companies that had contracts with the Koga and Fukaya boards of education.

==Biography==
Born in villa ''La Gracieuse'', [[Morges]], [[Switzerland]], to Victor Forel a pious Swiss Calvinist and Pauline Morin, a French Huguenot he was brought up under a protective household. At the age of seven he began to take an interest in insects. He went to school at Morges and Lausanne before joining the medical school at Zurich.  Forel had a diverse and mixed career as a thinker on many subjects. At Zurich he was inspired by the work of Bernhard  Aloys  von  Gudden  (1824-1886). In 1871 he went to Vienna and studied under Theodor  Meynert  (1833-1892) but was disappointed by Meynert. In 1873 he moved to Germany to assist Gudden at his Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt. He improved upon various techniques in neuro-anatomy including modifications to Gudden's microtome design. In 1877 he described the nuclear and fibrillar organization of the [[Ventral tegmental area|tegmental region]] which is now known as ''Campus Foreli.''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parent|first=André|year=2003|title=Auguste Forel on Ants and Neurology|url=http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/chn/docpdf/parent_forel.pdf|journal=Can. J. Neurol. Sci.|volume=30|pages=284–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then became a lecturer at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich while also continuing his researches on ants. His first major work was a 450 page treatise on the ants of Switzerland which was published in 1874 and commended by [[Charles Darwin]]. He was appointed professor of psychiatry in 1879 at the [[University of Zurich]] Medical School. He not only ran the [[Burghölzli]] asylum there, but continued to publish papers on [[insanity]], [[prison reform]], and [[morality|social morality]]. The asylum was very poorly run with corrupt staff and poor standards before Forel took over and converted to be among the best in Europe. Forel named his home as ''La Fourmilière'' —the Ant Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Sleigh, Charlotte (2007) Six legs better : a cultural history of myrmecology. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-8445-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1900 Forel was a [[eugenics|eugenicist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toolan.com/hitler/survive.html The Survival of the Fittest, Chapter II]&lt;/ref&gt; Forel suffered a [[stroke]] that paralyzed his right side in 1912, but he taught himself to write with his left hand and was able to continue his studies. By 1914 he was a good friend of the eminent [[United Kingdom|British]] [[entomologist]] [[Horace Donisthorpe]], with whom he stayed in [[Switzerland]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Entomologist's Record'', vol XXV, Nos 1-2 (1915)&lt;/ref&gt; his ardent [[socialist]] views frequently caused political arguments between the two. After hearing of the religion from his son in law Dr. Arthur Brauns (married to his daughter Martha),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Miss Martha Root |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1929 | page =8 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm | issue = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1920 he became a member of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Forel married Emma Steinheil in August 1883 and they had four daughters and two sons. In 1903 Forel and his family moved to live in his home, ''La Fourmiliere'', in [[Yvorne]] near Lake Geneva. He died there on July 27, 1931 and was cremated in Lausanne
two days later.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

==Scientific work==
[[File:Le Monde Social Des Fourmis.jpg|thumb|The Social World of Ants]]
Forel's prize essay on the ants of Switzerland was published in three parts in a Swiss scientific journal, beginning in 1874.  The work was reissued as a single volume in 1900, at which time it was also translated into English.  His myrmecological five-volume magnum opus, ''Le Monde Social des Fourmis'', was published in 1923.

Forel's predilection for finding in ants the analogs of human social and political behaviors was always controversial.  In the foreword to his 1927 edition of ''British Ants: their life history and classification'', Donisthorpe opined, "I should wish ... to protest against the ants being employed as a supposed weapon in political controversy. In my opinion an entomological work is not the appropriate means for the introduction of political theories of any kind, still less for their glaring advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;''British Ants: their life history and classification'', 2nd Edition (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;  But in 1937, the work was excerpted in Sir [[John Alexander Hammerton|J.A. Hammerton]]'s ''Outline of Great Books'' with praise for its relevance to the study of human psychology and as "the most important contribution to insect psychology ever made by a single student."&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Hammerton, Outline of Great Books, New York, Wise &amp; Co. (1937), p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

Forel realized from experiments that neurons were the basic elements of the nervous system. He found that the neuromuscular junction communicated by mere contact and did not require the anastomosis of fibres. This came to be called the ''Contact Theory of Forel''. The word "neuron" was coined by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Wilhelm von Waldeyer]] who published  a review of the work of Forel and others in 1891. Waldeyer synthesized ideas without actually conducting any research himself and published it in ''Deutsche   medizinische Wochenschrift'' a widely read journal which made him popular. Forel was very bitter about Waldeyer's achievement of fame that it is thought to have contributed to the decline in his interest in neuroanatomy and neurology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Less controversially, Forel first described in 1877 the [[zona incerta]] area in the brain. He gave it this name as it a "region of which nothing certain can be said".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A. | title = Untersuchungen über die Haubenregion und ihre oberen Verknüpfungen im Gehirne des Menschen und einiger Säugethiere, mit Beiträgen zu den Methoden der Gehirnuntersuchung | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten| last1 = Forel | volume = 7| issue = 3 | pages = 393–495 | year = 1877 | doi = 10.1007/BF02041873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''big man''' is a highly influential individual in a [[tribe]], especially in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]. Such a person may not have formal tribal or other authority (through for instance material possessions, or inheritance of rights), but can maintain recognition through skilled persuasion and wisdom. The big man has a large group of followers, both from his [[clan]] and from other clans. He provides his followers with protection and economic assistance, in return receiving support which he uses to increase his status.

==Big man "system"==

The [[United States|American]] anthropologist [[Marshall Sahlins]] has studied the big man phenomenon. In his much-quoted&lt;ref&gt;
James Whitley ("Social Diversity in Dark Age Greece", ''The Annual of the British School at Athens'' '''86''' (1991:341-365) applied Sahlins' ethnographic model to instability in settlement patterns during the [[Greek Dark Age]], 10th-8th centuries BCE.
&lt;/ref&gt; 
1963 article  "Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in [[Melanesia]] and [[Polynesia]]", Sahlins uses analytically constructed ideal-types of hierarchy and equality to compare a larger-scale Polynesian-type hierarchical society of chiefs and sub-chiefs with a Melanesian-type big-man system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |URL=http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf |author=Marshall Sahlins |title=Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief; Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=5 |number=3 |pages=285-303 |date=April 1963 |archive-date=1 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000/http://tapera.info/textos/sahlins,hrhp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter consists of segmented lineage groups, locally held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings (factions). Here, leadership is not ascribed, but rather gained through action and competition "with other ambitious men".

==Position==
{{main|Moka exchange}}
A big man's position is never secured in an inherited position at the top of a hierarchy, but is always challenged by the different big-men who compete with one another in an ongoing process of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] and re-distribution of material and political resources. As such the big man is subject to a [[Transactional analysis|transactional]] order based on his ability to balance the simultaneously opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big man groups (thereby spreading the word of his power and abilities) ''and'' redistributing resources to the people of his own faction (thereby keeping them content followers of his able leadership).

The big man concept is relatively fluid, and formal authority of such figures is very low to nonexistent. His position is not inherently heritable.

In the Island of Malaita in Solomon Islands the big man system is dying away as westernization is influencing the people,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} but the big man system can be seen at the political level. Every four years in [[Solomon Islands]]' National Elections the system can be clearly seen among the people, especially in the Melanesian Islands.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

==System in Papua New Guinea==
The first use of the term may be found in the English-translation of Dreissig Jahre in der Sudsee (1907) by [[Richard Parkinson (explorer)|Richard Parkinson]]. The term may be often found in many historical works dealing with Papua New Guinea. Andrew J. Strathern&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, ''The Rope of Moka: big-men and ceremonial exchange in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea'' (Cambridge, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; applies the concept of big-men to a community in [[Mount Hagen]], Papua New Guinea.

Traditionally, among peoples of non-[[Austronesian]]-speaking communities, authority was obtained by a man (the so-called "big man") recognised as "performing most capably in social, political, economic and ceremonial activities".&lt;ref&gt;Waiko, John D. (1993). ''A Short History of Papua New Guinea'', Melbourne: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-553164-7}}, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; His function was not to command, but to influence his society through his example. He was expected to act as a negotiator with neighbouring groups, and to periodically redistribute food (generally produced by his wives). In this sense, he was seen as ensuring the well-being of his community.

Such a system is still found in many parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], and other parts of [[Melanesia]].

'''Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center''' in [[Rüschlikon]]/ZH is a Research Facility for [[Nanotechnology]] owned by [[IBM]].

This building was named after the two Nanotech-Pioneers and [[Nobelaureates]] [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]], who invented the [[Scanning Tunneling Microscope]] in the year 1986 in the Zurich Research Laboratory next to the Nanotechnology Center.

The Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center is specialized on [[basic research]] but also in [[photonics]] and [[nanotechnology]].  The facility is based on the premise of open collaboration with IBM scientists and external partners.  One of these partners is [[ETH Zurich]], the renowned Swiss university that agreed to rent part of the Center for 10 years. [[Empa|EMPA]] is a third partner.

== Noise-Free-Labs ==
Something special in the new building are the so-called "noise-free" labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Dexter|title=IBM Goes for World Record in "Noise-Free" Labs|url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/nanoclast/semiconductors/nanotechnology/ibm-goes-for-world-record-in-noisefree-labs-|accessdate=11 November 2010|publisher=IEEE|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They protect the experiments against environmental influences (that could influence and falsify the most sensitive experiments) like vibrations or [[Electromagnetic field|electro-magnetic fields]]. Additionally, the labs are optimized to emit as little sound, electro-magnetic fields and vibrations during air-conditioning to achieve stable temperatures and humidity. The experiments are separated from the researcher and associated equipment and are mostly controlled in remote operation. Some rooms fulfil [[ISO 5]] standards for [[cleanrooms]] as some production tools are installed in these ultra-silent rooms dedicated to most accurate fabrication or characterization on the 1 nanometer scale. The labs are unique in the world as all disturbances relevant for nanotechnology are compensated simultaneously and kept at utmost constancy.

==History==
The [[foundation stone]] was laid on 2009 and after two years of construction the building was opened on May 17, 2011 for research.  Swiss government official Didier Burkhalter attended the ceremony and was an official speaker.

One of the indicators of the strength of a [[brand]] in the hearts and minds of customers, '''brand preference''' represents which brands are preferred under assumptions of equality in price and availability.

== Purpose ==

Measures of brand preference attempt to quantify the impact of [[marketing]] activities in the hearts and minds of customers and potential customers. Higher brand preference usually indicates more revenues (sales) and profit, also making it an indicator of company financial performance.

== Construction ==
There are at least three classes of methodologies to measure brand preference directly: 
* [[Statistical survey|Survey]] questions (self-report, unaided preference)
* Brand choice measures (choice of preferred brand from a competitive set of brands)
* Constant sum measures (planned purchases amongst a competitive set of brands)

A '''bridge''' is a [[nonbuilding structure|structure]] built to [[span (engineering)|span]] physical obstacles without closing the way underneath such as a [[body of water]], [[valley]], or [[road]], for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, usually something that can be detrimental to cross otherwise. There are many different designs that each serve a particular purpose and apply to different situations. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the [[terrain]] where the bridge is constructed and anchored, the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it.

Most likely the earliest bridges were fallen trees and [[stepping stones]], while [[Neolithic]] people built [[boardwalk]] bridges across marshland. The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] dating from the 13th century BC, in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.

==Etymology==
[[File:Akashi-kaikyo bridge3.jpg|thumb|The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] in [[Japan]], currently the world's longest suspension span]]
[[File:Sio se pol.jpg|thumb|The [[Siosepol]] bridge over [[Zayanderud|Zayandeh River]] is an example of [[Safavid dynasty]] (1502–1722) bridge design. [[Esfahan]], [[Iran]]]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' traces the origin of the word ''bridge'' to an [[Old English]] word ''brycg'', of the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Fowler|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary|date=1925|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word can be traced directly back to Proto-Indo-European ''*bʰrēw-.'' The word for the [[Contract bridge|card game of the same name]] has a different origin.

==History==
[[File:Pont mycénien de Kazarma 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] in [[Greece]] (13th century BC), one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s in existence]]
[[File:Brug 119 in de Lijnbaansgracht over de Bloemgracht foto 1.jpg|thumb|Bridges in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]]]]
The simplest type of a bridge is [[stepping stones]], so this may have been one of the earliest types. [[Neolithic]] people also built a form of a [[boardwalk]] across marshes, of which the [[Sweet Track]], and the [[Post Track]] are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old.&lt;ref Name="Current_Archaeology_somerset-levels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=The Somerset Levels|pages=139–143|volume=XV (4)|issue=172 (Special issue on Wetlands)|journal=Current Archaeology|date=February 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used [[log bridge]]s; that is a [[timber bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=National Parks Conference| first= Department of the Interior| title=Proceedings of the National parks conference held at Berkeley, California March 11, 12, and 13, 1915| url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsnati01confgoog| accessdate=March 14, 2010| year=1915| publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]| location=Washington, DC| page=60| quote=(A log bridge) is a bridge composed of log beams, the logs being in natural condition or hewn, which are thrown across two abutments, and over which traffic may pass.| ref=NPC}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams.

Among the oldest [[timber bridge]]s is the [[Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden]] crossing upper [[Lake Zürich]] in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the [[Seedamm]] date back to 1523 BC. The first wooden footbridge led across [[Lake Zürich]], followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the [[Roman Empire]] built a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately {{convert|1450|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland.

The [[Arkadiko Bridge]] is one of four Mycenaean [[corbel arch]] bridges part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate [[chariot]]s, between the fort of Tiryns and town of Epidauros in the [[Peloponnese]], in southern Greece. Dating to the Greek [[Bronze Age]] (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest [[arch bridge]]s still in existence and use.
Several intact arched stone bridges from the [[Hellenistic age|Hellenistic era]] can be found in the Peloponnese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kutz, Myer|title=Handbook of Transportation Engineering, Volume II: Applications and Technologies, Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0071614771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest bridge builders of antiquity were the [[Roman Engineering|ancient Romans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icomos.org/studies/bridges.htm |author=DeLony, Eric |title=Context for World Heritage Bridges |publisher=Icomos.org |year=1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221084235/http://www.icomos.org/studies/bridges.htm |archivedate=February 21, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built arch bridges and [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueducts]] that could stand in conditions that would damage or destroy earlier designs.

The Romans also used [[cement]], which reduced the variation of strength found in natural stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubs.asce.org/WWWdisplay.cgi?0103045 |title=Lessons from Roman Cement and Concrete |publisher=Pubs.asce.org |date= |accessdate=January 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210043706/http://www.pubs.asce.org/WWWdisplay.cgi?0103045 |archivedate=February 10, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One type of cement, called [[pozzolana]], consisted of water, [[lime (material)|lime]], sand, and [[volcanic rock]]. [[Brick]] and [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] bridges were built after the Roman era, as the technology for cement was lost (then later rediscovered).

In India, the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' treatise by [[Kautilya]] mentions the construction of dams and bridges.&lt;ref&gt;Dikshitar, V.R.R. Dikshitar (1993).

Although large Chinese bridges of wooden construction existed at the time of the [[Warring States]], the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the [[Zhaozhou Bridge]], built from 595 to 605 AD during the [[Sui Dynasty]]. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest [[Spandrel|open-spandrel]] stone segmental arch bridge. European segmental arch bridges date back to at least the [[Alconétar Bridge]] (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era [[Trajan's Bridge]] (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Inca rope bridge|Rope bridges]], a simple type of [[suspension bridge]], were used by the [[Inca]] civilization in the [[Andes]] mountains of South America, just prior to European colonization in the 16th century.

During the 18th century there were many innovations in the design of timber bridges by [[Hans Ulrich Grubenmann]], [[Johannes Grubenmann]], and others. The first book on bridge engineering was written by [[Hubert Gautier]] in 1716.

A major breakthrough in bridge technology came with the erection of [[the Iron Bridge]] in Shropshire, England in 1779. It used [[cast iron]] for the first time as arches to cross the river Severn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |title= Iron Bridge |author= &lt;!--"ECPK"--&gt; |date= |website= Engineering Timelines |publisher= Engineering Timelines |access-date= November 18, 2016 |quote= |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204815/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=80 |archivedate= March 4, 2016 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the 19th century, [[truss]] systems of [[wrought iron]] were developed for larger bridges, but iron does not have the [[tensile strength]] to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a high tensile strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of [[Gustave Eiffel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}
[[File:West Montrose Covered Bridge (Oct. 2018).jpg|thumb|The covered bridge in [[West Montrose, Ontario]], Canada]]

In Canada and the U.S., numerous timber [[Covered bridges]] were built in the late 1700s to the late 1800s, reminiscent of earlier designs in [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]].

In 1927 [[welding]] pioneer [[Stefan Bryła]] designed the first welded [[road bridge]] in the world, the [[Maurzyce Bridge]] which was later built across the river [[Słudwia River|Słudwia]] at Maurzyce near [[Łowicz]], Poland in 1929. In 1995, the [[American Welding Society]] presented the Historic Welded Structure Award for the bridge to Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/welding/wh_1900-1950.html |title=Welding Timeline 1900–1950 |last=Sapp |first=Mark E. |date=February 22, 2008 |publisher=WeldingHistory.org |accessdate=April 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803060938/http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/welding/wh_1900-1950.html |archivedate=August 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animals===
[[File:Ant bridge.jpg|thumb|''[[Eciton]]'' sp. forming a bridge]]
Before humans, [[ants#Locomotion|ants have been making bridges]] using their own bodies to allow others to cross.

==Types of bridges==
Bridges can be categorized in several different ways. Common categories include the type of structural elements used, by what they carry, whether they are fixed or movable, and by the materials used.

===Structure type===
Bridges may be classified by how the forces of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]], [[compression (physical)|compression]], [[bending]], [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] and [[Shear stress|shear]] are distributed through their structure. Most bridges will employ all of the principal forces to some degree, but only a few will predominate. The separation of forces may be quite clear. In a suspension or cable-stayed span, the elements in tension are distinct in shape and placement. In other cases the forces may be distributed among a large number of members, as in a truss.

|[[Beam bridges]] are horizontal beams supported at each end by substructure units and can be either ''[[simply supported]]'' when the beams only connect across a single span, or ''continuous'' when the beams are connected across two or more spans. When there are multiple spans, the intermediate supports are known as [[bridge pier|piers]]. The earliest beam bridges were simple logs that sat across streams and similar simple structures. In modern times, beam bridges can range from small, wooden beams to large, steel boxes. The vertical force on the bridge becomes a [[Shear stress|shear]] and [[Bending|flexural]] load on the beam which is transferred down its length to the substructures on either side&lt;ref name=beambridge&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | title=Beam bridges | publisher=Design Technology | accessdate=May 14, 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518121256/http://www.design-technology.org/beambridges.htm | archivedate=May 18, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically made of steel, concrete or wood. [[Girder bridge]]s and [[Plate girder bridge]]s, usually made from steel, are types of Beam bridges. [[Box girder bridge]]s, made from steel, concrete, or both are also beam bridges. Beam bridge spans rarely exceed {{convert|250|ft|m}} long, as the flexural stresses increase proportional to the square of the length (and deflection increases proportional to the 4th power of the length).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_bending/beam_bending1.htm Structural Beam Deflection Stress Bending Equations / Calculation Supported on Both Ends Uniform Loading] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130122060213/http://www.engineersedge.com/beam_bending/beam_bending1.htm |date=January 22, 2013 }}.

| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:TrussBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Truss bridge'''{{br}}
| A truss bridge is a bridge whose load-bearing superstructure is composed of a truss. This truss is a structure of connected elements forming triangular units. The connected elements (typically straight) may be stressed from tension, compression, or sometimes both in response to dynamic loads. Truss bridges are one of the oldest types of modern bridges. The basic types of truss bridges shown in this article have simple designs which could be easily analyzed by nineteenth and early twentieth century engineers. A truss bridge is economical to construct owing to its efficient use of materials.
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:CantileverBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Cantilever bridge'''{{br}}
|[[Cantilever bridge]]s are built using [[cantilever]]s—horizontal beams supported on only one end. Most cantilever bridges use a pair of [[continuous span]]s that extend from opposite sides of the supporting piers to meet at the center of the obstacle the bridge crosses. Cantilever bridges are constructed using much the same materials &amp; techniques as beam bridges. The difference comes in the action of the forces through the bridge.

Some cantilever bridges also have a smaller beam connecting the two cantilevers, for extra strength.

The largest cantilever bridge is the {{convert|549|m|adj=on}} [[Quebec Bridge]] in Quebec, Canada.
|-
| style="text-align:center;"|[[File:ArchBridge-diagram.svg|200px]]'''Arch bridge'''{{br}}

|Tied arch bridges have an arch-shaped superstructure, but differ from conventional arch bridges. Instead of transferring the weight of the bridge and traffic loads into thrust forces into the abutments, the ends of the arches are restrained by tension in the bottom chord of the structure. They are also called bowstring arches.

|Suspension bridges are suspended from cables. The earliest suspension bridges were made of ropes or vines covered with pieces of bamboo. In modern bridges, the cables hang from towers that are attached to caissons or cofferdams. The caissons or cofferdams are implanted deep into the bed of the lake, river or sea. Sub-types include the [[simple suspension bridge]], the [[stressed ribbon bridge]], the [[underspanned suspension bridge]], the [[suspended-deck suspension bridge]], and the [[self-anchored suspension bridge]]. There is also what is sometimes called a "semi-suspension" bridge, of which the [[Ferry Bridge, Burton|Ferry Bridge]] in Burton-upon-Trent is the only one of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;A.O.P.

Most bridges are fixed bridges, meaning they have no moving parts and stay in one place until they fail or are demolished. Temporary bridges, such as [[Bailey bridge]]s, are designed to be assembled, and taken apart, transported to a different site, and re-used. They are important in military engineering, and are also used to carry traffic while an old bridge is being rebuilt. [[Movable bridge]]s are designed to move out of the way of boats or other kinds of traffic, which would otherwise be too tall to fit. These are generally electrically powered.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Double-decked (or double-decker) bridges have two levels, such as the [[George Washington Bridge]], connecting [[New York City]] to [[Bergen County]], [[New Jersey]], US, as the world's busiest bridge, carrying 102 million vehicles annually;&lt;ref name="panynj.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abcgwb/&gt; [[truss]] work between the roadway levels provided stiffness to the roadways and reduced movement of the upper level when the lower level was installed three decades after the upper level. The [[Tsing Ma Bridge]] and [[Kap Shui Mun Bridge]] in [[Hong Kong]] have six lanes on their upper decks, and on their lower decks there are two lanes and a pair of tracks for [[MTR]] metro trains. Some double-decked bridges only use one level for street traffic; the [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] in [[Minneapolis]] reserves its lower level for automobile and light rail traffic and its upper level for pedestrian and bicycle traffic (predominantly students at the [[University of Minnesota]]). Likewise, in [[Toronto]], the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] has five lanes of motor traffic, bicycle lanes, and sidewalks on its upper deck; and a pair of tracks for the [[Bloor–Danforth line|Bloor–Danforth]] [[Toronto subway and RT|subway line]] on its lower deck. The western span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]] also has two levels.

[[Robert Stephenson]]'s [[High Level Bridge]] across the [[River Tyne]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], completed in 1849, is an early example of a double-decked bridge. The upper level carries a railway, and the lower level is used for road traffic. Other examples include [[Britannia Bridge]] over the [[Menai Strait]] and [[Craigavon Bridge]] in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[Øresund Bridge|Oresund Bridge]] between [[Copenhagen]] and [[Malmö]] consists of a four-lane highway on the upper level and a pair of railway tracks at the lower level. [[Tower Bridge]] in London is different example of a double-decked bridge, with the central section consisting of a low level [[Bascule bridge|bascule span]] and a high level [[footbridge]].

===Viaducts===

===Bridge types by use===
A bridge can be categorized by what it is designed to carry, such as trains, pedestrian or road traffic ('''road bridge'''), a pipeline or waterway for water transport or barge traffic. An [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] is a bridge that carries water, resembling a viaduct, which is a bridge that connects points of equal height. A road-rail bridge carries both road and rail traffic. Overway is a term for a bridge that separates incompatible intersecting traffic, especially road and rail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170491612 |title=The Mile-End Crossing |newspaper=[[The Observer (Adelaide)|The Observer]] |volume=LXXXI, |issue=6,004 |location=South Australia |date=February 23, 1924 |accessdate=March 26, 2018 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bridge can carry overhead power lines as does the [[Storstrøm Bridge]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Some bridges accommodate other purposes, such as the tower of [[Nový Most]] Bridge in [[Bratislava]], which features a restaurant, or a [[bridge-restaurant]] which is a bridge built to serve as a restaurant. Other suspension bridge towers carry transmission antennas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Bridges are subject to unplanned uses as well. The areas underneath some bridges have become makeshift shelters and homes to homeless people, and the undertimbers of bridges all around the world are spots of prevalent graffiti. Some bridges attract people attempting [[suicide]], and become known as [[suicide bridge]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Bridge types by material===

The materials used to build the structure are also used to categorize bridges. Until the end of the 18th Century, bridges were made out of timber, stone and masonry. Modern bridges are currently built in concrete, steel, fiber reinforced polymers (FRP), stainless steel or combinations of those materials.

==Aesthetics==
[[File:Stari_Most22.jpg|thumb|The World Heritage Site of [[Stari Most]] (Old Bridge) gives its name to the city of [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]]]
Most bridges are utilitarian in appearance, but in some cases, the appearance of the bridge can have great importance. Often, this is the case with a large bridge that serves as an entrance to a city, or crosses over a main harbor entrance. These are sometimes known as ''signature bridges''. Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the [[Taconic State Parkway]] in New York.

To create a beautiful image, some bridges are built much taller than necessary. This type, often found in east-Asian style gardens, is called a [[Moon bridge]], evoking a rising full moon. Other garden bridges may cross only a dry bed of stream washed pebbles, intended only to convey an impression of a stream. Often in palaces a bridge will be built over an artificial waterway as symbolic of a passage to an important place or state of mind. A set of five bridges cross a sinuous waterway in an important courtyard of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The central bridge was reserved exclusively for the use of the Emperor, Empress, and their attendants.

==Bridge maintenance==
[[File:Example HiFIT-treated assembly.jpg|thumb|Highway bridge treated with [[high-frequency impact treatment]]]]
Bridge maintenance consisting of a combination of structural health monitoring and testing. This is regulated in country-specific engineer standards and includes e.g. an ongoing monitoring every three to six months, a simple test or inspection every two to three years and a major inspection every six to ten years. In Europe, the cost of maintenance is higher than spending on new bridges. The lifetime of welded steel bridges can be significantly extended by [[High Frequency Impact Treatment|aftertreatment of the weld transitions]] . This results in a potential high benefit, using existing bridges far beyond the planned lifetime.

==Bridge failures==
&lt;!-- [[bridge failure]] and [[bridge failures]] redirect here; be sure to update them if changing the section title --&gt;
{{see also|List of bridge failures}}

The failure of bridges is of special concern for [[structural engineers]] in trying to learn lessons vital to bridge design, construction and maintenance. The failure of bridges first assumed national interest during the [[Victorian era]] when many new designs were being built, often using new materials.

In the United States, the [[National Bridge Inventory]] tracks the structural evaluations of all bridges, including designations such as "structurally deficient" and "functionally obsolete".

==Bridge monitoring==
There are several methods used to monitor the stress on large structures like bridges. The most common method is the use of an [[accelerometer]], which is integrated into the bridge while it is being built.

Another option for structural-integrity monitoring is "non-contact monitoring", which uses the [[Doppler effect]] (Doppler shift). A [[laser]] beam from a [[Laser Doppler Vibrometer]] is directed at the point of interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to the motion of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|title=Basic Principles of Vibrometry|work=polytec.com|accessdate=January 25, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610192737/http://www.polytec.com/us/solutions/vibration-measurement/basic-principles-of-vibrometry/|archivedate=June 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of this method is that the setup time for the equipment is faster and, unlike an accelerometer, this makes measurements possible on multiple structures in as short a time as possible.  Additionally, this method can measure specific points on a bridge that might be difficult to access.

Snapshots in time of the external condition of a bridge can be recorded using [[Lidar]] to aid bridge inspection.&lt;ref name="omer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Omer | display-authors = et. al. | year = 2018 | title = Performance evaluation of bridges using virtual reality | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325194259 | journal = Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Computational Mechanics (ECCM 6) &amp; 7th European Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics (ECFD 7), Glasgow, Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Commonwealth Club Address''''' (23 September 1932) was a speech made by [[New York Governor]] and Democratic presidential nominee [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] in San Francisco on his [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential campaign.]]&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, pp 353-55&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt said the era of growth and unrestricted entrepreneurship had ended, and the individualism must give way to collective action. He was not at all specific, but he hinted at liberal reforms of the sort that emerged in [[First 100 days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency|The First Hundred  Days]] after his inauguration in March 1933. Scholars rate it among the 100 greatest speeches made by a President in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Houck, ''Commonwealth Club Address: Redefining Individualism, Adjudicating Greatness'' (2004) p 259&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt's argument==
Roosevelt was long on history and short on specifics. He sketched a philosophical foundation for the [[New Deal]], and ultimately for a [[Second Bill of Rights]] that he was committed to achieving over the course of his administration.  Most historians consider it prophetic regarding the actual content of New Deal liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, p 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The great era of rapid economic growth had ended, Roosevelt argued.&lt;ref&gt;Quotes from  Roosevelt, "Commonwealth Club Address," [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=88391 online version]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the days when growth was all-important, he agreed that it had been necessary to turn political and economic power over to entrepreneurs who were building the nation.  But the era of economic growth  was over he said;  the entrepreneurs are now dangerous:
: A mere builder of more industrial plants, a creator of more railroad systems, an organizer of more corporations, is as likely to be a danger as a help. The day of the great promoter or the financial Titan, to whom we granted anything if only he would build, or develop, is over.

Roosevelt said that further growth was unnecessary: "Our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarily producing more goods."  What America instead needed to do:
:Is the soberer, less dramatic business of administering resources and plants already in hand, of seeking to reestablish foreign markets for our surplus production, of meeting the problem of underconsumption, of adjusting production to consumption, of distributing wealth and products more equitably, of adapting existing economic organizations to the service of the people. The day of enlightened administration has come.

Parts of his speech had a gloomy tone: "A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have known it no longer exists." "We are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already."  However he did hint at reforms that would bring about a better world:  "Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living."

Biographer [[Frank Freidel]] emphasizes that Roosevelt wanted government to "act as a regulator for the common good within the existing economic system." Roosevelt believed his philosophy was in accord with the traditions of Thomas Jefferson and Woodrow Wilson, as modified to deal with a much more complex and mature economic order.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, p. 355&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The response to the speech by  the 2000-member luncheon audience and by the national media was tepid. Some thought it too socialistic; others considered it too academic in tone, especially for its long passages on the lessons of American and European history. Roosevelt did not try to rework his material into simpler speeches. He moved on to other topics, and received a rousing reception to the more usual speech he gave that same evening.&lt;ref&gt;Houck, p 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The speech was written by [[Adolf A. Berle]] and his wife Beatrice, who worked on Roosevelt's campaign office.&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''continuing education unit''' ('''CEU''') or '''continuing education credit''' ('''CEC''') is a measure used in [[continuing education]] programs to assist the professional to maintain his or her license in their profession.  Continuing education or professional development is required in many fields, including teachers, insurance professionals, interior designers/interior architects, lighting designers, architects, engineers, [[Emergency management|emergency management professionals]], school administrators, educators, nurses, mental health professionals, psychologists and social workers.  The continuing education unit is described as ten hours of participation in an education program.  

The term CEU is not a trademarked term; therefore, any educational institution may use it to describe their courses.  In this regard, there are no requirements for educator qualifications that are attached to each institutions courses when offering CEUs.  There have been some bodies created which are attempting to standardize and accredit institutions using the term CEU, the International Association for Continuing Education and Training being one of them; however, professions and industries usually regulate their approved continuing education within their bylaws and not one institute or accrediting body has become a standard to accept in this regard.  Professionals should always consult their Association or regulating body prior to embarking on continuing education and not assume a CEU will be accepted as part of their professional development.

'''Cultural depictions of dogs''' extend back thousands of years to when [[dog]]s were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs in art became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As dogs became more domesticated, they were shown as companion animals, often painted sitting on a lady's lap. Throughout the [[art history]] there is an overwhelming presence of dogs as status symbols and pets in painting mainly in the [[Western art]].  The dogs were brought to houses and were allowed to live in the house and cherished as part of the family, and were regarded as mostly in the upper classes who used them for hunting and could afford to feed them. Hunting dogs were generally connected to the aristocracy. Only the nobility were allowed to keep hunting dogs, and this would signal status, and it was the signalment of a noble man. Dog portraits became increasingly popular in the 18th century, and the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', which further encouraged the popularity of dog portraiture.

The walls of caves and tombs dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] have illustrations or statues of dogs. These generally portray dogs used for hunting, and even children's toys and ceramics depicting dogs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-15457|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the prehistoric paintings are found in [[Bhimbetka rock shelters]], these paintings depict dog on a [[leash]] with a man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Animals of India|page=101|first=Nanditha|last=Krishna|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock art of [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] also include depiction of dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost History of the Canine Race: Our 15,000-year Love Affair with Dogs|first=Mary Elizabeth|last=Thurston|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Enduring Treasures: National Parks of the World|publisher=National Geographic Society|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Ancient Greeks and Romans, contrary to the Semitic cultures  favored dogs as pets, and valued them for their faithfulness and courage and were often seen on Greek and Roman reliefs and ceramics as symbols of fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CJ/44/4/Household_Pets*.html|title=Greek and Roman Household Pets |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats were not favoured over dogs, on contrary Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't keep cats as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyforkids.net/greek-pets.html|title=Greek pets|publisher=historyforkids.net|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were given as gifts among lovers and kept them as both  pets, status symbols or kept for guardians and as hunting dogs. Dogs were appreciated by the Greek for their faith and love. [[Homeros]] [[Odyssey]] tells the story of [[Odysseus]] who had a dog called Argos he raised and who was the only one that recognized him when he returned  home after his travels, disguised to conceals his appearance. Only the old dog recognized him instantly. This theme has been often depicted in on ancient Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-3/kitchell.pdf|title=Pets of Ancient Greeks|publisher=www.penn.museum|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans kept three types of dogs. Hunting dogs; especially [[sighthound]]s, Molossus type of dogs like the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]  were often depicted in  reliefs and mosaics with the words Cave Canem; and small companion dogs of [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] type as women's [[lap dog]]s. Greyhounds were often depicted too, often as sculptures. Large dogs were often used in war by the Roman army  in attack formations or for wolf-hunting on horseback,  which was a popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societasviaromana.net/Collegium_VitaQuotidiana/pets.php|title=Pets in Ancient Rome

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jan van Eyck's ''The Arnolfini Wedding'' (1434).]]
Generally, dogs symbolize [[faith]] and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Hall1979"&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first=James|title=Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLjd0fyT0_IC|year=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-430100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of [[fidelity]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. If the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall1979" /&gt;

An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''. An oil painting on [[oak]] [[Panel painting|panel]] dated 1434 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Jan van Eyck]], it is a small full-length double portrait,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] published an article entitled ''Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait'' in the ''[[Burlington Magazine]] 1934&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to represent the Italian merchant [[Giovanni Arnolfini|Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini]] and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; presumably in their home in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Bruges]]. It portrays a wedding scene, where the people invited to witness the ceremony can be seen in the convex mirror at the back, the mirror symbolizing the eye of God. In those times people were not always married in the church, it was enough that two witnesses were present to make a wedding legal. A number of symbols can be found in the picture: the fruit, the symbol of fertility and wealth, the shoes removed (this is a holy place), and the dog. The oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. The little dog symbolizes in the Middle Ages [[iconography]]  faithfulness, devotion or [[loyalty]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  or can be seen as an emblem of [[lust]], signifying the couple's desire to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan Van Eyck: The Play of Realism|pages=20–50|first=Craig|last=Harbison|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the couple, the dog looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}} pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;  The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions. In that case the dog could reflect wealth or social status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, "Sexuality and social standing in Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini double portrait", ''Renaissance Quarterly'', volume 43, issue 2, p. 270, Summer 1990, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2862365 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting scenes===
[[File:Livre de Chasse 40v.jpg|thumb|left|''Livre de Chasse'', French hunting dog book]]

Hunting scenes were common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting in the medieval period was a sport exclusive to the aristocracy and hunting was an essential part of court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were  connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.
[[File:ST. Eustachius.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pisanello]] (1395–1455), hunting scene with dogs (''The Vision of St. Eustachius'')]]
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money on packs of specially bred hounds were not unusual.

[[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Phoebus]] (30 April 1331 – 1391) wrote a manual on hunting and there are several tapestries from the period which depict hunting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and renaissance hunting|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/med-ren-hunting/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if nobility was hunting, hunting has been forbidden to servants, peasants and also the Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting. Thus, hunting dogs are seldom seen depicted in the company of [[cleric]]s, but very often in the company of in the highest social class of that society.

=== In heraldry===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|thumb|150px|left|Coats of arms of the [[House of Tudor]]]]
[[File:Coa Hungary Town Ebes.svg|thumb|120px|Coats of arms of the Hungarian town [[Ebes]]]]

For the same reason, depictions of dogs can be found in heraldry. In monarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people  who either possess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people, and thanks to the specific connection of the aristocrats with the hunting dogs, dogs were often shown as symbols in heraldry. In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], [[heraldry]] became a highly developed discipline. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] and [[supporter]]s in many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], and often symbolise courage, vigilance, loyalty and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224608/http://www.scottish-wedding-dreams.com/heraldic-animals.html ~ Heraldry Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[encaustic tile]]s dating from the 15th century featured a white hound, the Talbot family crest and the inscription "Sir John Talbot" (the [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]). Part of a set of four, the tiles were possibly originally used on a church floor. The term talbot is used in heraldry to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog. The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]] always depicts the Talbot [[coat of arms]] and is the original hound used as an English heraldic symbol. It is portrayed in the family arms of several noble German families and at least seven other English families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waters |first=Nick |title=History of the Talbot tiles |url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-(2) |accessdate=18 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Dog World (newspaper)|Dog World]] |date=5 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MiPuGlGR?url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-%282%29 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th century==
[[File:Ofthedogingeneral.jpg|thumb|150px|A woodcut illustration from ''The history of four-footed beasts and serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]], 1658]]
During the 16th and 17th century, dogs were depicted in hunting scenes, or depicted representing social status, as a lap dog, or sometimes as a personal friend. They may also used as symbols in painting. The Greek philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] (404-323 BC) was  depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme, in the company of dogs that also served as emblems of his "Cynic" (Greek: "kynikos," dog-like) philosophy, which emphasized an austere existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse|page=155|first=David|last=Wiles|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes stated that  "Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher is seated in his [[abode]], the earthenware tub, - also depicted sometimes in sitting in a [[barrel]], -  in the [[Metroon]], Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to go in searching for an honest man.

Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh portrayed probably a scholar noted by its significance to its particular profession,  depicting a book, or a Protestant preacher and theologian with the Bible opened on the table. A dog depicted as a companion to the scholar is a symbol of [[fidelity]], vigilance and regularity in the research due to assigned to dogs natural intelligence and intuition, and the [[parrot]] is a symbol of erudition and [[eloquence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/rudeness.htm "Logical Rudeness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

[[File:Izumiya Tomotada - Netsuke in the Form of a Dog - Walters 711020 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Netsuke]] in the Form of a Dog'']]
Netsuke are Japanese miniature sculptures of great artistic merit that were also serving a practical function as a storage place for kimomos that traditionally had no pockets. These small boxes had a carved, button-like toggle called a ''netsuke''. Most netsuke production was during around 1615&amp;ndash;1868, in the [[Edo period]] in Japan. Among others motifs, netsukes depicted even dogs. 
The tradition of showing dogs in hunting scenes continued through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Secord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian England|url=http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|publisher=William Secord Gallery|accessdate=24 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113235416/http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture entitled ''A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'' depicts a dog that was well known in London at that time.  The dog depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer 1838, was a Newfoundland called "Bob", who was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront, where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty-three times over the course of fourteen years. For this, he was made a distinguished member of the [[Royal Humane Society]], granting him a medal and access to food.&lt;ref name=newfoundlandart&gt;{{cite web|title=The Newfoundland in Art &amp; Literature|url=http://www.ncanewfs.org/history/pages/landseer2.html|publisher=Newfoundland Club of America|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newfoundlanders with white patches are now recognized as a breed of their own,  as a "[[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=George M.|title=Dictionary of Newfoundland English|year=1990|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-5887-4|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C61rTpmOOcu38QOQ4vEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was described by ''[[The Art Journal]]'' 1838 as being "one of the best and most interesting publications of the year", and "Mr Thomas Landseer's first great effort in this department of the art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Journal|year=1839|publisher=The Art Union|location=London|page=173|volume=I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7TlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K6drToKMMsju-gbVsZDMCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th century copy of the painting by [[George Cole (artist)|George Cole]] was sold by auctioneers [[Bonhams]] for £7,200 in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot Details: A Distinguished Member of The Humane Society|url=http://www.bonhams.com/eur/auction/14971/lot/12/|publisher=Bonhams|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Victorian era, the mainly sporting tradition remained but after the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', dog portraits soared in popularity.&lt;ref name="Secord" /&gt; There were differences between the British and European style of depiction; William Secord, a world expert on canine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art  A Muse to Artists and a Delight to Countless Viewers|url=http://www.ralphlaurenhome.com/design/art_gallery_guide/william_secord.aspx|publisher=Ralph Lauren Media|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it by stating: "Belgian, Dutch, Flemish and German artists were more influenced by realism, depicting the dog the way it really looked, with dirt on it’s coat and slobber and that kind of thing. You see Alfred Stevens, who's Belgian, do street dogs and dogs that are suffering, which in England you never see. British depictions were more idealized. They want it pretty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art: The Dog Has Been a Muse to Countless Artists and a Delight to Viewers |url=http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/02/dog-star/ |publisher=Art &amp; Antiques |accessdate=24 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LLfDkUoj?url=http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/02/dog-star/ |archivedate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prices achieved for canine art increased the 1980s–90s and started to gain popularity in established art circles rather than antique markets. Buyers can generally be divided into three dominant categories: hunters; breeders and exhibitors of pedigree dogs; and owners of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=Vanessa|title=Who Let the Dogs Out?|journal=Art Business News|date=May 2001|volume=28|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-74628439/who-let-the-dogs-out|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of dogs have been extended as well to the artform of [[photography]], a noted example being the work of photographer [[Elliott Erwitt]].

'''Denon DL103''' is a MC (moving coil) [[Magnetic cartridge|phono cartridge]] made by [[Denon|DENON]] company.

The DL103 was designed for professional [[Radio broadcasting|broadcast]] use in 1962 using the arms and [[Phonograph|turntables]] of the day. Production has continued uninterrupted since then. There are available different versions upgraded by other companies or individuals involved in [[DIY audio]].

==Technical Specification==
* Stylus: 16.5&amp;nbsp;µm diamond spherical tip
* Cantilever: Aluminum
* Frequency Response: 20 ~ 45&amp;nbsp;[[Hertz|kHz]]
* Output: 0.3&amp;nbsp;mV at 50&amp;nbsp;mm/s
* Output Impedance: 40&amp;nbsp;Ω
* Load Impedance: 100&amp;nbsp;Ω
* Channel Separation: Over 25&amp;nbsp;dB at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz
* Compliance: 5 x 10–6&amp;nbsp;cm/dyne (100&amp;nbsp;Hz)
* Tracking Force: 2.3 ~ 2.7g (± 0.3g)
* Weight: 8.5&amp;nbsp;grams

Despite being designed in the 1960s it is still one of the masterpieces in audio technology and can easily compete with contemporary constructions. Due to its construction, Denon DL-103 is recommended as one of the very few cartridges suitable for heavy tonearms. (like in [[Lenco]] or [[Garrard Engineering and Manufacturing Company|Garrard]] turntables)
As a low-output phono cartridge it requires either a step up transformer for a standard MM phono preamp, or phono preamp with built-in MC input.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">{{jargon|date=March 2017}}'''Digital morphogenesis''' is a type of generative art in which complex shape development, or [[morphogenesis]], is enabled by computation. This concept is applicable in many areas of design, art, architecture, and modeling.  The concept was originally developed in the field of [[biology]], later in [[geology]], [[geomorphology]], and [[architecture]].  

In [[architecture]], it describes tools and methods for creating forms and adapting them to a known environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko (2000). 'Digital Morphogenesis and Computational Architectures', in ''Proceedings of the 4th Conference of Congreso Iberoamericano de Grafica Digital, SIGRADI 2000 - Construindo (n)o Espaço Digital (Constructing the Digital Space)'', Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) 25–28 September 2000, ed. by José Ripper Kós, Andréa Pessoa Borde and Diana Rodriguez Barros, pp. 98-103 [http://cumincad.scix.net/data/works/att/4077.content.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kolarevic, Branko and [[Ali Malkawi]], eds (2005). ''Performative Architecture: Beyond Instrumentality'' (New York; London: Spon Press), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Neil (2009). 'Digital Morphogenesis', ''Architectural Design'', 79, 1, pp. 32-37
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roudavski"&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009). 'Towards Morphogenesis in Architecture', ''International Journal of Architectural Computing'', 7, 3, pp. 345-374, p. 348 [https://www.academia.edu/208933/Towards_Morphogenesis_in_Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;  Stanislav Roudavski describes it as similar to biological morphogenesis: developing gradually, without an explicit definition of the methods of growth or adaptation.  Parallels can be seen in [[emergence|emergent properties]] and [[self-organization]]."&lt;ref&gt;Roudavski, Stanislav (2009), pp. 348, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

Developments in digital morphogenesis have allowed construction and analysis of structures in more detail than could have been put into a blueprint or model by hand, with structure at all levels defined by iterative algorithms.  As fabrication techniques advance, it is becoming possible to produce objects with fractal or other elaborate structures.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}

Some [[North America]]n [[university|universities]] are home to [[academic degree|degree]] programs titled '''Ecology and Evolutionary Biology''', offering integrated studies in the [[academic discipline|disciplines]] of [[ecology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]. The wording is intended as representing the alternative approach from the frequently used pairing of '''Cell and Molecular Biology''', while being more inclusive than the terminology of [[Botany]] or [[Zoology]].  Recently, due to advances in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[molecular biology]], research and education in ecology and evolutionary biology has integrated many molecular techniques.

A program that focuses on the relationships and interactions that range across levels of biological organization based on a scientific study is Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.  The origins and history of ecosystems, species, genes and genomes, and organisms, and how these have changed over time is all part of the studies of how biodiversity has evolved and how it takes place.  Ecology and Evolutionary biology in North America is based on research impact determined by the top 10% of ecology programs.  The interactive web of organisms and environment are all part of what the field of Ecology explores.  There have been studies in evolution that have worked to prove that "modern organisms have developed from ancestral ones." The reason that evolutionary biology is so interesting to learn about is because of the evolutionary processes that is the reason we have such a diversity of life on Earth.There are many processes that make up evolutionary biology that give great insight to how we came to be, some of which include natural selection, speciation, and common descent.

The '''Eden Project''' ({{lang-kw|Edenva}}) is a popular visitor attraction in [[Cornwall]], England, UK. Inside the two biomes are plants that are collected from many diverse climates and environments. The project is located in a reclaimed [[china clay]] [[clay pit|pit]], located {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} from the town of [[St Blazey]] and {{convert|5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the larger town of [[St Austell]].&lt;ref name="osexp1"&gt;Ordnance Survey (2005). ''OS Explorer Map 107 – Fowey, Looe &amp; Lostwithiel''. {{ISBN|0-319-23708-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is dominated by two huge enclosures consisting of adjoining domes that house thousands of plant [[species]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/come-and-visit/whats-here/rainforest-biome/index.php | title = Rainforest Biome | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and each enclosure emulates a natural [[biome]]. The biomes consist of hundreds of [[hexagon]]al and [[pentagon]]al, inflated, plastic cells supported by steel frames. The largest of the two biomes simulates a [[rainforest]] environment and the second, a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean environment]]. The attraction also has an outside [[botanical garden]] which is home to many plants and wildlife native to Cornwall and the UK in general; it also has many plants that provide an important and interesting backstory, for example, those with a prehistoric heritage.

== Design and construction ==
The project was conceived by [[Tim Smit]] and designed by architect [[Nicholas Grimshaw]] and engineering firm Anthony Hunt and Associates (now part of [[Sinclair Knight Merz]]). [[Davis Langdon]] carried out the project management, [[Sir Robert McAlpine]] and [[Alfred McAlpine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/our-history/index.php | title = Our history | publisher = Eden project | accessdate = 27 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; did the construction, [[Mero-Schmidlin|MERO]] designed and built the biomes, and [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] was the services engineer, economic consultant, environmental engineer and transportation engineer. [[Land use]] consultants led the masterplan and landscape design. The project took 2½ years to construct and opened to the public on 17 March 2001.

== Site ==

[[File:Eden Project geodesic domes panorama.jpg|thumb|360px|Panoramic view of the geodesic biome domes at the Eden Project]]

=== Layout ===
[[File:The Bee (Eden Project).JPG|thumb|''The Bee'']]
Once into the attraction, there is a meandering path with views of the two biomes, planted landscapes, including vegetable gardens, and sculptures that include a giant [[bee]] and previously The [[WEEE]] Man (removed in 2016), a towering figure made from old electrical appliances and was meant to represent the average electrical waste used by one person in a lifetime.

=== Biomes ===
At the bottom of the pit are two covered [[biome]]s:

The Tropical Biome, covers {{convert|1.56|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|55|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|100|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It is used for tropical plants, such as fruiting banana plants, [[Coffea|coffee]], rubber and giant [[bamboo]], and is kept at a tropical temperature and moisture level.
[[File:The Tropical Biome.jpg|thumb|The Tropical Biome]]

The [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] Biome covers {{convert|0.654|ha|acre|1|abbr=on}} and measures {{convert|35|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|65|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|135|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long. It houses familiar warm [[temperate]] and [[arid]] plants such as [[olive]]s and grape [[vine]]s and various sculptures.

The Outdoor Gardens represent the temperate regions of the world with plants such as tea, [[lavender]], [[hops]], [[hemp]] and [[sunflower]]s, as well as local plant species.

The covered biomes are constructed from a tubular steel (hex-tri-hex) with mostly hexagonal external cladding panels made from the thermoplastic [[ETFE]]. Glass was avoided due to its weight and potential dangers. The cladding panels themselves are created from several layers of thin [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-transparent ETFE [[Tensile structure|film]], which are sealed around their [[perimeter]] and inflated to create a large cushion. The resulting cushion acts as a thermal blanket to the structure. The ETFE material is resistant to most stains, which simply wash off in the rain. If required, cleaning can be performed by [[abseil]]ers. Although the ETFE is susceptible to punctures, these can be easily fixed with ETFE tape. The structure is completely self-supporting, with no internal supports, and takes the form of a [[geodesic dome|geodesic]] structure. The panels vary in size up to {{convert|9|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} across, with the largest at the top of the structure.

The ETFE technology was supplied and installed by the firm [[Vector Foiltec]], which is also responsible for ongoing maintenance of the cladding. The steel spaceframe and cladding package (with Vector Foiltec as ETFE subcontractor) was designed, supplied and installed by MERO (UK) PLC, who also jointly developed the overall scheme geometry with the architect, Nicholas Grimshaw &amp; Partners.

The entire build project was managed by McAlpine Joint Venture.

=== The Core ===
[[File:The Core, Eden Project.JPG|thumb|The Core]]
The Core is the latest addition to the site and opened in September 2005. It provides the Eden Project with an education facility, incorporating classrooms and exhibition spaces designed to help communicate Eden's central message about the relationship between people and plants. Accordingly, the building has taken its inspiration from plants, most noticeable in the form of the soaring timber roof, which gives the building its distinctive shape.

Grimshaw developed the geometry of the copper-clad roof in collaboration with a sculptor, Peter Randall-Page, and Mike Purvis of structural engineers [[Sinclair Knight Merz|SKM Anthony Hunts]]. It is derived from [[phyllotaxis]], which is the mathematical basis for nearly all plant growth; the "opposing spirals" found in many plants such as the seeds in a sunflower's head, [[pine cone]]s and [[pineapple]]s. The copper was obtained from traceable sources, and the Eden Project is working with [[Rio Tinto Group]] to explore the possibility of encouraging further traceable supply routes for metals, which would enable users to avoid metals mined unethically. The services and [[Acoustics|acoustic]], mechanical and electrical engineering design was carried out by [[Buro Happold]].

==== Art at The Core ====
[[File:The Seed at Eden Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=0.6|''Seed'' by Peter Randall-Page]]
The Core is also home to art exhibitions throughout the year. A permanent installation entitled ''Seed'', by [[Peter Randall-Page]], occupies the anteroom. ''Seed'' is a large, 70 tonne egg-shaped stone installation standing some {{convert|13|ft}} tall and displaying a complex pattern of protrusions that are based upon the [[Fibonacci number#In nature|geometric and mathematical principles that underlie plant growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Granite seed is 'planted' at Eden | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 2007-06-11 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6738783.stm | access-date = 2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edenproject.com/visit/whats-here/seed-sculpture | title = Seed sculpture by Peter Randall-Page | publisher = Eden Project | access-date = 2018-02-25 | quote = Made out of a single piece of granite, its surface has been carved with 1,800 nodes in the pattern of a Fibonacci spiral – the growth pattern found across the natural world in things like sunflowers, pine cones and ammonites}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental aspects ==
[[File:Cornwall, eden project tropical.jpg|thumb|left|Inside the tropical Biome]]
The domes provide diverse growing conditions, and many plants are on display.

The Eden Project includes [[environmental education]] focusing on the interdependence of plants and people; plants are labelled with their medicinal uses. The massive amounts of water required to create the humid conditions of the Tropical Biome, and to serve the toilet facilities, are all sanitised rain water that would otherwise collect at the bottom of the quarry. The only [[Public utility|mains]] water used is for hand washing and for cooking. The complex also uses Green Tariff Electricity – the energy comes from one of the many [[wind turbine]]s in Cornwall, which were among the first in Europe.

Controversially, one of the companies the Eden Project currently partners with is the British mining company Rio Tinto Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/media/mining-book-pr.php|title=New Eden Project book shows what can be done with disused mines|publisher=Eden project}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2017}}

In December 2010 the Eden Project received permission to build a [[geothermal electricity]] plant which will generate approx 4MWe, enough to supply Eden and about 5000 households.&lt;ref name="BBC Geotherm"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-12026753|title=BBC News – Eden Project geothermal plant plans to go ahead |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=18 December 2010|date=18 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grasswoman eden.jpg|thumb|''Eve'', by Sue and Pete Hill, shaped from the soil]]

The clay pit in which the project is sited was in use for over 160 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/about-us/our-story |title=Our Story |publisher=Eden Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712023922/http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/about-us/our-story |archivedate=12 July 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, the pit was used by the BBC as the planet surface of Magrathea in the 1981 TV series of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/hitchhikers-guide-galaxy-douglas-adams | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jenny | last=Turner | title=Does the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy still answer the ultimate question? | date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s the pit was all but exhausted.&lt;ref name="edenproject.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edenproject.com/whats-it-all-about/behind-the-scenes/10th-birthday/10th-birthday-timeline|title=Eden story, educational charity – Eden Project, Cornwall|publisher=Eden Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial idea for the project dates back to 1996, with construction beginning in 1998. The work was hampered by torrential rain in the first few months of the project, and parts of the pit flooded as it sits {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the water table.&lt;ref name="edenproject.com" /&gt;

The first part of the Eden Project, the visitor centre, opened to the public in May 2000. The first plants began arriving in September of that year,&lt;ref name="edenproject.com" /&gt; and the full site opened on 17 March 2001.

The Eden Project was used as a filming location for the 2002 [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Die Another Day]]''. On 2 July 2005 The Eden Project hosted the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|"Africa Calling" concert]] of the [[Live 8]] concert series.  It has also provided some plants for the [[British Museum]]'s Africa garden.

In 2005, the Project launched "A Time of Gifts" for the winter months, November to February. This features an ice rink covering the lake, with a small café/bar attached, as well as a Christmas market. Cornish choirs regularly perform in the biomes.

On 6 December 2007, the Eden Project invited people all over Cornwall to try to break the [[world record]] for the biggest ever [[pub quiz]] as part of its campaign to bring £50 million of [[lottery]] funds to Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edenproject.com/about/3200.html |title=About |publisher=Eden Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226181304/http://www.edenproject.com/about/3200.html |archivedate=26 December 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, the project failed in its bid for £50 million of funding, after the [[Big Lottery Fund]] popular vote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7140621.stm | publisher= BBC News | date= 12 December 2007 | title= Routes scheme tops lottery vote | accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
when it received just 12.07% of the votes, the lowest for the four projects being considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/prog_the_peoples_50_million.htm | publisher= The Big Lottery Fund | title= The People's 50 Million – Sustrans' Connect2 wins £50 million prize | accessdate= 3 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eden wanted the money for Edge, a proposed [[desert]] biome that was going to look at people and plants living on the edge today and the solutions that they have come up with to the challenge of living within limits.&lt;ref name=BigLottery&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk/global-content/press-releases/england/south-west/eden-edges-closer-to-winning-lottery-millions | title=Eden edges closer to winning Lottery millions: Big Lottery Fund |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, much of the project, including both greenhouses, became available to navigate through [[Google Street View]].

The Eden Trust revealed a trading loss of £1.3 million for 2012-13, on a turnover of £25.4 million. The Eden Project had posted a surplus of £136,000 for the previous year. In 2014 Eden accounts showed a surplus of £2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/St-Austell-8217-s-Eden-Project-black/story-21239280-detail/story.html#ixzz3df3N6sV2|title=St Austell’s Eden Project|date=15 June 2014|publisher=[[Cornish Guardian]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923210710/http://www.cornishguardian.co.uk/St-Austell-8217-s-Eden-Project-black/story-21239280-detail/story.html#ixzz3df3N6sV2|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pasty Championships]] have been held at the Eden Project since 2012, an international competition to find the best [[Cornish pasties]] and other pasty-type savoury snacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|World Pasty Championships winners chosen}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10393">[[Image:Circuit elements.svg|right|thumbnail|400px|Common circuit diagram symbols (US symbols)]]
An '''electronic symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] used to represent various [[electrical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] devices or functions, such as [[wire]]s, [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[resistor]]s, and [[transistor]]s, in a [[schematic diagram]] of an electrical or [[electronic circuit]].  These symbols are largely standardized internationally today, but may vary from country to country, or engineering discipline, based on traditional conventions.

==Standards for symbols==
The graphic symbols used for electrical components in circuit diagrams are covered by national and international standards, in particular:
* [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60617 (also known as [[British Standard]] BS 3939).
* [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Y32.2-1975 (also known as IEEE Std 315-1975 or CSA Z99-1975)
* [[IEEE]] Std 91/91a: graphic symbols for logic functions (used in digital electronics). It is referenced in ANSI Y32.2/IEEE Std 315.
* Australian Standard AS 1102. (Withdrawn without replacement)

Symbols usage is sometimes unique to engineering disciplines and national or local variations to international standards exist. For example, lighting and power symbols used as part of architectural drawings may be different from symbols for devices used in electronics.

Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. In 1741, at 53, he entered into a spiritual phase in which he began to experience dreams and visions, beginning on [[Easter]] Weekend, on 6 April 1744. It culminated in a 'spiritual awakening'
in which he received a revelation that he was appointed by the Lord Jesus Christ to write ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' to reform [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;See Swedenborg, E. [http://www.heavenlydoctrines.org/ ''The Heavenly Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Lord had opened Swedenborg's spiritual eyes so that from then on, he could freely visit [[heaven]] and [[hell]] to converse with angels, demons and other spirits and the [[Last Judgment]] had already occurred the year before, in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html Swedenborg, E. ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are at This Day Fulfilled.'' (Swedenborg Foundation 1952, Paragraphs 1–74)] Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the last 28 years of his life, Swedenborg wrote 18 published theological works—and several more that were unpublished. He termed himself a "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ" in ''True Christian Religion'',&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title=The True Christian Religion, Containing the Universal Theology of The New Church Foretold by the Lord in Daniel 7; 13, 14; and in Revelation 21; 1, 2, by Emanuel Swedenborg |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he published himself.&lt;ref name="swedenborgdigitallibrary1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html |title=Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation? |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some followers of ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' believe that of his theological works, only those that were published by Swedenborg himself are fully [[divine revelation|divinely inspired]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;   Others have regarded all Swedenborg's theological works as equally inspired, saying for example that the fact that some works were "not written out in a final edited form for publication does not make a single statement less trustworthy than the statements in any of the other works." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Odhner |first1=Carl Theophilus |title="Diary" and the Spiritual Body |journal=New Church Life |date=1912 |page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General Church of the New Jerusalem is a branch of Christianity that reveres Swedenborg's writings as Divinely inspired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/508967814|title=Reasons for separating from the old church. : In answer to a letter received from certain persons in Manchester, who profess to believe in the heavenly doctrines of the New Jerusalem Church, as contained in the theological writings of the Late Hon.

== Early life ==
[[File:Hornsgatan 43 Emanuel Swedenborg Stockholm 2005-06-17 013.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque at the former location of Swedenborg's house at Hornsgatan on [[Södermalm]], [[Stockholm]].]]

Swedenborg's father, [[Jesper Swedberg]] (1653–1735), descended from a wealthy mining family. The first known paternal ancestor was Otte Persson from Sundborn parish, mentioned 1571.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.riddarhuset.se/att/swedenborg/|title=Riddarhuset - Ätte- och vapendatabas - Swedenborg|last=|first=|date=2017-06-04|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He travelled abroad and studied theology, and on returning home, he was eloquent enough to impress the Swedish king, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], with his sermons in [[Stockholm]]. Through the king's influence, he would later become professor of theology at [[Uppsala University]] and Bishop of [[Skara]].&lt;ref name="Ugglan"&gt;{{sv icon}} [[Nordisk familjebok]], 2nd edition (Ugglan) ''[http://runeberg.org/nfcg/0486.html article Svedberg, Jesper]'' (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enc1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|first=Alexander James |last=Grieve|wstitle=Swedenborg, Emanuel |volume=26 |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesper took an interest in the beliefs of the dissenting Lutheran [[Pietism|Pietist]] movement, which emphasised the virtues of communion with [[God]] rather than relying on sheer faith (''[[sola fide]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Svedberg's pietistic interests are described in Bergquist (1999), pp. 230–232.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sola fide'' is a tenet of the [[Lutheran Church]], and Jesper was charged with being a [[pietist]] [[heresy|heretic]]. While controversial, the beliefs were to have a major impact on his son Emanuel's spirituality. Jesper furthermore held the unconventional belief that [[angels]] and [[spirit]]s were present in everyday life. This also came to have a strong impact on Emanuel.&lt;ref name="Ugglan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=enc1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lamm (1978 [1915]; pp.1–19) notes how all Swedenborg biographies at that draw similarities between the beliefs of Jesper and Emanuel. Lamm himself partially agrees with them, but he maintains that there were marked differences between them too.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1703–1709, Swedenborg lived in [[Erik Benzelius the Younger]]'s house. Swedenborg completed his university course at [[Uppsala]] in 1709, and in 1710, he made his [[grand tour]] through the Netherlands, France and Germany before reaching London, where he would spend the next four years. It was also a flourishing center of scientific ideas and discoveries. Swedenborg studied [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[philosophy]] and read and wrote [[poetry]]. According to the preface of a book by the Swedish critic [[Olof Lagercrantz]], Swedenborg wrote to his benefactor and brother-in-law Benzelius that he believed that Swedenborg might be destined to be a great scientist.&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Delblanc&gt;x&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific period ==
[[File:Swdbg2.jpg|frame|The Flying Machine, sketched in his notebook from 1714. The operator would sit in the middle and paddle himself through the air.&lt;ref&gt;Söderberg, H. ''Swedenborg's 1714 Airplane: A Machine to Fly in the Air'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;32, or on the video clip at 5:48 on its timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-k6HRf0E0g |title = Splendors of the Spirit: Swedenborg's Quest for Insight, Part 1 |publisher = YouTube |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1715 Swedenborg returned to Sweden, where he devoted himself to natural science and engineering projects for the next two decades. A first step was his meeting with King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] in the city of [[Lund]], in 1716. The Swedish inventor [[Christopher Polhem]], who became a close friend of Swedenborg, was also present. Swedenborg's purpose was to persuade the king to fund an [[observatory]] in northern Sweden. However, the warlike king did not consider this project important enough, but did appoint Swedenborg to be assessor-extraordinary on the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (''Bergskollegium'') in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref&gt;The meeting between the King, Polhelm and Swedenborg is described in detail in Liljegren, Bengt, ''Karl XII i Lund : när Sverige styrdes från Skåne'', (Historiska media, Lund, 1999). {{ISBN|91-88930-51-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1716 to 1718, Swedenborg published a scientific periodical entitled ''Daedalus Hyperboreus'' (''"The Northern [[Daedalus]]"''), a record of mechanical and mathematical inventions and discoveries. One notable description was that of a flying machine, the same he had been sketching a few years earlier (see [[Flying Machine (Swedenborg)]]).&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

In 1718, Swedenborg published an article that attempted to explain spiritual and mental events in terms of minute vibrations, or "tremulations".

Upon the death of Charles XII, [[Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden|Queen Ulrika Eleonora]] ennobled Swedenborg and his siblings. It was common in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries for the children of [[bishops]] to receive that honour, as a recognition of the services of their father. The family name was changed from Swedberg to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp.114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1724, he was offered the chair of [[mathematics]] at [[Uppsala University]], but he declined and said that he had dealt mainly with [[geometry]], [[chemistry]] and [[metallurgy]] during his career. He also said that he did not have the gift of eloquent speech because of a stutter, as recognized by many of his acquaintances; it forced him to speak slowly and carefully, and there are no known occurrences of his speaking in public.&lt;ref&gt;Berquist (1999), pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish critic Olof Lagerkrantz proposed that Swedenborg compensated for his impediment by extensive argumentation in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Proposed by Lagercrantz, also mentioned by Bergquist (1999), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== New direction of studies ahead of his time ==
During the 1730s, Swedenborg undertook many studies of [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]]. He had the first known anticipation of the [[neuron]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fodstad, H. The neuron theory ''Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery'' 2001;77:20-4&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until a century later that science recognized the full significance of the nerve cell. He also had prescient ideas about the [[cerebral cortex]], the hierarchical organization of the [[nervous system]], the localization of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]], the functions of the [[pituitary gland]], the perivascular spaces, the [[foramen of Magendie]], the idea of [[somatotopic arrangement|somatotopic organization]], and the association of frontal brain regions with the intellect. In some cases, his conclusions have been experimentally verified in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Gordh, E.

''Handbook Clinical Neurology'' 2010;95:557-70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1730s, Swedenborg became increasingly interested in spiritual matters and was determined to find a theory to explain how matter relates to spirit. Swedenborg's desire to understand the order and the purpose of creation first led him to investigate the structure of matter and the process of creation itself. In the ''[[The Principia (book)|Principia]]'', he outlined his philosophical method, which incorporated experience, geometry (the means by which the inner order of the world can be known) and the power of reason. He also outlined his cosmology, which included the first presentation of his [[nebular hypothesis]]. (There is evidence that Swedenborg may have preceded Kant by as much as 20 years in the development of that hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newchurchhistory.org/articles/glb2007/baker.pdf Baker, Gregory L. (1983) "Emanuel Swedenborg – An 18th century cosmologist" in ''The Physics Teacher'', October 1983, pp. 441–6] Retrieved 15 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1735, in [[Leipzig]], he published a three-volume work, ''Opera philosophica et mineralis'' (''"Philosophical and mineralogical works''") in which he tried to conjoin philosophy and [[metallurgy]]. The work was mainly appreciated for its chapters on the analysis of the [[smelting]] of iron and copper, and it was the work that gave Swedenborg his international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 142–155.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, he also published the small manuscript ''de Infinito'' ("On the Infinite") in which he attempted to explain how the finite is related to the infinite and how the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the body. It was the first manuscript in which he touched upon such matters. He knew that it might clash with established theologies since he presented the view that the soul is based on material substances.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm (1987), pp. 42–43, notes that by assuming that the soul consists of matter, as Swedenborg did, one becomes a [[materialist]]. He further notes that it was also noted by contemporaries.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted dedicated studies of the fashionable philosophers of the time such as [[John Locke]], [[Christian von Wolff]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], and [[Descartes]] and earlier thinkers such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 165–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1743, at the age of 55, Swedenborg requested a leave of absence to go abroad. His purpose was to gather source material for ''Regnum animale'' (''The Animal Kingdom'', or ''Kingdom of Life''), a subject on which books were not readily available in Sweden. The aim of the book was to explain the soul from an anatomical point of view. He had planned to produce a total of 17 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc and Lönnroth, p.325.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Journal of Dreams'' ==
By 1744, Swedenborg had travelled to the Netherlands. Around the time, he began having strange dreams. Swedenborg carried a travel journal with him on most of his travels and did so on this journey. The whereabouts of the diary were long unknown, but it was discovered in the [[Royal Library of Sweden|Royal Library]] in the 1850s and was published in 1859 as ''Drömboken'', or ''Journal of Dreams''.

Swedenborg experienced many different dreams and visions, some greatly pleasurable, others highly disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, pp. 200–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The experiences continued as he traveled to London to progress the publication of ''Regnum animale''. This process, which one biographer has proposed as cathartic and comparable to the [[Catholic]] concept of [[Purgatory]],&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; continued for six months. He also proposed that what Swedenborg was recording in his ''Journal of Dreams'' was a battle between the love of himself and the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis by Bergquist, p. 209. Bergquist has previously published a separate book commenting on the Journal called ''Swedenborgs drömbok : glädjen och det stora kvalet'' (Stockholm, Norstedt, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visions and spiritual insights ===
In the last entry of the journal from 26–27 October 1744, Swedenborg appears to be clear as to which path to follow. He felt that he should drop his current project and write a new book about the worship of God. He soon began working on ''De cultu et amore Dei'', or ''The Worship and Love of God''. It was never fully completed, but Swedenborg still had it published in London in June 1745.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, Swedenborg was dining in a private room at a tavern in London. By the end of the meal, a darkness fell upon his eyes, and the room shifted character. Suddenly, he saw a person sitting at a corner of the room, telling him: "Do not eat too much!". Swedenborg, scared, hurried home. Later that night, the same man appeared in his dreams. The man told Swedenborg that he was the Lord, that he had appointed Swedenborg to reveal the spiritual meaning of the Bible and that he would guide Swedenborg in what to write. The same night, the spiritual world was opened to Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Small Theological Works and Letters" by Emanuel Swedenborg. Edited and published by the Swedenborg Society (London, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptural commentary and writings ==
[[File:Arcana Caelestia 0001.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'', first edition (1749), title page.]]

In June 1747, Swedenborg resigned his post as assessor of the board of mines. He explained that he was obliged to complete a work that he had begun and requested to receive half his salary as a pension.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt; He took up afresh his study of [[Hebrew]] and began to work on the spiritual interpretation of the Bible with the goal of interpreting the spiritual meaning of every verse. From sometime between 1746 and 1747 and for ten years henceforth, he devoted his energy to the task. Usually abbreviated as ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' or under the [[Latin]] variant ''Arcana Caelestia''&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Stephen McNeilly (London: Swedenborg Society, 2002), p. 1. Accessed 2010-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; (translated as ''Heavenly Arcana'', ''Heavenly Mysteries'', or ''Secrets of Heaven'' depending on modern English-language editions), the book became his ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' and the basis of his further theological works.&lt;ref name="AC"&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was anonymous, and Swedenborg was not identified as the author until the late 1750s. It had eight volumes, published between 1749 and 1756. It attracted little attention, as few people could penetrate its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonsson, Inge. ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

His life from 1747 to his death was spent in Stockholm, the Netherlands and [[London]]. During the 25 years, he wrote another 14 works of a spiritual nature; most were published during his lifetime.

One of Swedenborg's lesser-known works presents a startling claim: that the Last Judgment had begun in the previous year (1757) and was completed by the end of that year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/LJ.html ''The Last Judgment and Babylon Destroyed. All the Predictions in the Apocalypse are At this Day Fulfilled from Things Heard and Seen''. From 'De Ultimo Judicio Et De Babylonia Destructa'']&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had witnessed it.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'', #60.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', the Last Judgment took place not in the physical world but in the World of Spirits, halfway between heaven and hell, through which all pass on their way to heaven or hell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/HH.html Swedenborg, E. ''Heaven and Its Wonders From Things Heard and Seen''] (Swedenborg Foundation 1946, #421–535).&lt;/ref&gt; The Judgment took place because the Christian church had lost its charity and faith, resulting in a loss of spiritual free will that threatened the equilibrium between heaven and hell in everyone's life.&lt;ref&gt;''Last Judgment'' #33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For an extensive explanation of the inner spiritual sense of the book of the ''Apocalypse'', see Swedenborg, E. ''The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1928).}}

''The Heavenly Doctrine'' also teaches that the Last Judgement was followed by the [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]], which occurred not by Christ in person but by a revelation from him through the inner, spiritual sense of the Word&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html |title = Swedenborg, E.

In another of his theological works, Swedenborg wrote that eating meat, regarded in itself, "is something profane" and was not practiced in the early days of the human race. However, he said, it now is a matter of conscience, and no one is condemned for doing it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ac&amp;section=1002 ''Arcana Coelestia'' #1002, 1003] (Swedenborg Foundation, 1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the early-days ideal appears to have given rise to the idea that Swedenborg was a [[vegetarian]]. That conclusion may have been reinforced by the fact that a number of Swedenborg's early followers were part of the vegetarian movement that arose in Britain in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ivu.org/history/thesis/bible-christian.html|title=The vegetarian movement in England, 1847–1981: A study in the structure of its ideology |last=Twigg |first=Julia |publisher=University of London |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only reports on Swedenborg himself are contradictory. His landlord in London, Shearsmith, said he ate no meat, but his maid, who served Swedenborg, said that he ate eels and [[pigeon pie]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, C. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epictc.htm ''The Swedenborg Epic: The life and works of Emanuel Swedenborg''] Bookman Associates, 1952, p. 476, # 642).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Earths in the Universe'', it is stated that he conversed with spirits from [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Saturn]], [[Venus]] and the [[Moon]] as well as spirits from planets beyond the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/EU.html ''The Earths in Our Solar System Which are called Planets and the Earths in the Starry Heaven, and Their Inhabitants; Also the Spirits and Angels There From Things Heard and Seen''] 1758. Also Rotch Edition. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1907, in ''The Divine Revelation of the New Jerusalem'' (2012), n. 9-178.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 'encounters', he concluded that the planets of our solar system are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one 'Heaven' derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: "What would this be to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!"&lt;ref&gt;''Arcana Coelestia'' #6698&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Simons K. [http://swedenborgproject.org/2007/09/08/the-life-on-other-planets-question/ The Life on Other Planets Question] The Swedenborg Project 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg published his work in London or the Netherlands because of their freedom of the press.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 477–478.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G. ''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 272).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Swedenborg's grave.jpg|right|thumb|Swedenborg's crypt in [[Uppsala Cathedral]].]]
In July 1770, at the age of 82, he traveled to [[Amsterdam]] to complete the publication of his last work. The book, ''Vera Christiana Religio'' (''The True Christian Religion''), was published there in 1771 and was one of the most appreciated of his works. Designed to explain his teachings to [[Lutherans]], it is the most concrete of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In the summer of 1771, he traveled to London. Shortly before [[Christmas]], he suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed and confined to bed. His health improved somewhat, but he died in 1772. There are several accounts of his last months, made by those with whom he stayed and by Arvid Ferelius, a pastor of the Swedish Church in London, who visited him several times.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 471–476. Accounts of Swedenborg's last days were collected and published in Tafel II:1, pp. 577 ff, 556 ff, 560 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that Swedenborg wrote a letter to [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]], in February. Swedenborg said that he had been told in the world of spirits that Wesley wanted to speak with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5plNwQ4xyfwC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=john+wesley+swedenborg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tv48ELMH0Y&amp;sig=xsFqXKc2uEibBH5YjydRkhEJmvM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K0OgTbjLM5TUgQfBsd3lBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20wesley%20swedenborg&amp;f=false |title = Documents concerning the life and character of Emanuel Swedenborg – Johann Friedrich Immanuel Tafel – Google Books |publisher = Books.google.com |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley, startled since he had not told anyone of his interest in Swedenborg, replied that he was going on a journey for six months and would contact Swedenborg on his return. Swedenborg replied that that would be too late since Swedenborg would be going to the spiritual world for the last time on March 29.&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', pp. 430ff.&lt;/ref&gt; (Wesley later read and commented extensively on Swedenborg's work.)&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. ''True Christianity, Containing a Comprehensive Theology of the New Church That Was Predicted by the Lord in Daniel 7:13–14 and Revelation 21:1, 2'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 2006, Translator's Preface, Vol. 2, p. 36 ff.).&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg's landlord's servant girl, Elizabeth Reynolds, also said that Swedenborg had predicted the date and that he was as happy about it as if he was "going on holiday or to some merrymaking":&lt;ref&gt;''Epic'', p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In Swedenborg's final hours, his friend, Pastor Ferelius, told him some people thought he had written his theology just to make a name for himself and asked Swedenborg if he would like to recant.  Raising himself up on his bed, his hand on his heart, Swedenborg earnestly replied,

"As truly as you see me before your eyes, so true is everything that I have written; and I could have said more had it been permitted. When you enter eternity you will see everything, and then you and I shall have much to talk about".&lt;ref name="Epic 433"&gt;''Epic'', p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

He then died, in the afternoon, on the date he had predicted, March 29.&lt;ref name="Epic 433"/&gt; |}}
[[File:Swedenborg House London.jpg|thumb|Swedenborg House, London]]

He was buried in the [[Nordic churches in London#Swedish Church|Swedish Church]] in Princes Square in [[Shadwell]], London. On the 140th anniversary of his death, in 1912/1913, his remains were transferred to [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in Sweden, where they now rest close to the grave of the [[botanist]] [[Carl Linnaeus]]. In 1917, the [[Swedish Church]] in Shadwell was demolished, and the Swedish community that had grown around the parish moved to [[Marylebone]]. In 1938, Princes Square was redeveloped, and in his honour the local road was renamed Swedenborg Gardens. In 1997, a garden, play area and memorial, near the road, were created in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ukstreetmap.info/map-london-swedenborg-gardens-street.html |title = Street map Swedenborg Gardens, map London with Swedenborg Gardens |publisher=Ukstreetmap.info |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ewan-M Ewan Munro+ Add Contact |url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/55935853@N00/3111893982/ |title = Swedenborg Gardens, London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E1 - Flickr – Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastlondonhistory.com/2011/06/16/history-of-swedenborg-gardens/|title=History of Swedenborg Gardens - eastlondonhistory.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Veracity ==
Swedenborg's transition from scientist to revelator or mystic has fascinated many people ever since it had occurred.

Swedenborg has had a variety of both supporting and critical biographers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html "Who Was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)?"] An article including a list of biographies about Swedenborg, with a brief analysis of each biographer's point of view. Accessed June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some propose that he did not have a revelation at all but developed his theological ideas from sources that ranged from his father to earlier figures in the history of thought, notably [[Plotinus]]. That position was first and most notably taken by the Swedish writer Martin Lamm, who wrote a biography of Swedenborg in 1915 that is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The citation "Bergquist (1999)", which is used here repeatedly, appears to contain mislabelled quotes. See the "Talk" section of this page, under the heading "Bergquist footnote problem".}} [[Olof Lagercrantz]], the Swedish critic and publicist, had a similar point of view, calling Swedenborg's theological writing "a poem about a foreign country with peculiar laws and customs".&lt;ref&gt;''en dikt om ett främmande land med sällsamma lagar och seder''. Largercrantz (1996), backpage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg's approach to demonstrating the veracity of his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]] to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings. His demonstration of the agreement is found throughout his theological writings since he rejected blind faith and declared true faith to be an internal acknowledgement of the truth.

The vast and consistent use of Biblical confirmations in Swedenborg's theological writings led a Swedish Royal Council in 1771 to examine the heresy charges of 1770 against two Swedish supporters of his theological writings: "there is much that is true and useful in Swedenborg's writings".&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt (1952), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]], in Chapter 14 of ''[[Les misérables]]'', felt that Swedenborg had "lapsed into madness".

==Scientific beliefs==
Swedenborg proposed many scientific ideas during his lifetime. In his youth, he wanted to present a new idea every day, as he wrote to his brother-in-law [[Erik Benzelius the Younger|Erik Benzelius]] in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge is not something that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 364–365.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1745, when he considered himself to have entered a spiritual state, he tended to phrase his "experiences" in [[empirical]] terms, to report accurately things he had experienced on his spiritual journeys.

One of his ideas that is considered most crucial for the understanding of his theology is his notion of [[correspondence (theology)|correspondences]]. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in the first volume of ''Regnum Animale'' dealing with the human soul.&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt;

The basis of the correspondence theory is that there is a relationship among the natural ("physical"), the spiritual, and the divine worlds. The foundations of this theory can be traced to [[Neoplatonism]] and the philosopher [[Plotinus]] in particular. With the aid of this scenario, Swedenborg now interpreted the Bible in a different light, claiming that even the most apparently trivial sentences could hold a profound spiritual meaning.&lt;ref name=Korr&gt;Lamm (1987 [1915]), dedicates a chapter to the correspondence theories, pp. 85–109.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedenborg argued that it is the presence of that spiritual sense which makes the Word divine.&lt;ref&gt;(Swedenborg E, ''The True Christian Religion Containing the Universal Theology of the New Church.'' Swedenborg Foundation 1946, # 200)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic accounts==
Four incidents of purported psychic ability of Swedenborg exist in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; There are several versions of each story.

=== Fire anecdotes ===
On Thursday, 19 July 1759 a great and well-documented fire broke out in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.{{efn|The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp. 312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''. The primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]).}}&lt;ref name="brandhistoriska.org"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brandhistoriska.org/olyckor_se.html |title = Årtal och händelser i Jönköping |publisher = Brandhistoriska.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staffan Högberg, ''Stockholms historia'' (Stockholm's history), part 1, p. 342; in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D-IYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR18&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;dq=%22documents+concerning+swedenborg%22+tafel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qu-XD4a3Ry&amp;sig=57fzfakBqB4wjrNlLqYXAZYycjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LLi-SfEuhtYwnN_Qqgg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPR3,M1 For July 19 date see especially Documents 271–273 in ''Documents concerning the Life and Character of Emanuel Swedenborg Collected, Translated and Annotated by Tafel, RL.''

When the fire broke out Swedenborg was at a dinner with friends in [[Gothenburg]], about 400&amp;nbsp;km from Stockholm.  He became agitated and told the party at six o'clock that there was a fire in Stockholm, that it had consumed his neighbor's home and was threatening his own. Two hours later, he exclaimed with relief that the fire had stopped three doors from his home. In the excitement following his report, word even reached the ears of the provincial governor, who summoned Swedenborg that same evening and asked for a detailed recounting.

At that time, it took two to three days for news from Stockholm to reach Gothenburg by courier, so that is the shortest duration in which the news of the fire could reach Gothenburg.  The first messenger from Stockholm with news of the fire was from the Board of Trade, who arrived Monday evening.  The second messenger was a royal courier, who arrived on Tuesday.  Both of these reports confirmed every statement to the precise hour that Swedenborg first expressed the information.  The accounts are fully described in Bergquist, pp.&amp;nbsp;312–313 and in Chapter 31 of ''The Swedenborg Epic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic31.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 31 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2013-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As noted above,  primary source for these accounts is a letter from [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1768 and the Swedenborg collection by Tafel (''Documents'' #271–273)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Swedenborg's biographer Lars Bergquist, however, this event took place on Sunday, July 29 – 10 days after the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Lars Bergquist: Swedenborgs Hemlighet, Stockholm 1999. {{ISBN|91-27-06981-8}}. (In Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

(Bergquist states, but does not document, that Swedenborg confirmed his vision of the fire incident to his good  friend, Consul Christopher Springer, "one of the pillars of the church, ...

[http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic35.html ''The Swedenborg Epic,'' Chapter 35] Bookman 1952&lt;/ref&gt; "and that Swedenborg's innkeeper, Erik Bergström, heard Swedenborg affirming the story.&lt;ref&gt;Berguist, L.

It seems unlikely that the many witnesses to Swedenborg's distress during the fire, and his immediate report of it to the provincial governor,&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist, L, ''Swedenborg's Secret'' (London, The Swedenborg Society, 2005, p. 270).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; would have left room for doubt in the public eye of Swedenborg's report.  If Swedenborg had only received news of the fire by the normal methods there would have been no issue of psychic perception recorded for history.  Instead, "when the news of Swedenborg's extraordinary vision of the fire reached the capital, public curiosity about him was very much aroused."&lt;ref&gt;Sigstedt, Chapter 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A second fire anecdote, similar to the first one, but less cited, is the incident of the mill owner Bolander.  Swedenborg warned him, again abruptly, of an incipient fire in one of his mills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic38.htm |title=The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 38 |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen of Sweden===
The third event was in 1758 when Swedenborg visited Queen [[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia|Louisa Ulrika]] of Sweden, who asked him to tell her something about her deceased brother [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia]]. The next day, Swedenborg whispered something in her ear that turned the Queen pale and she explained that this was something only she and her brother could know about.&lt;ref&gt;''Swedenborg Epic'' pp. 278ff.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), pp. 314–315, There are several different accounts of the events which makes it difficult to conclude the exact details of the event. Carl Robsahm (see [[#Sources|reference]]) reports the story in this way.}}

=== Lost document ===
The fourth incident involved a woman who had lost an important document, and came to Swedenborg asking if a recently deceased person could tell him where it was, which he (in some sources) was said to have done the following night.{{efn|According to Bergquist (1999), p. 316, there are some ten different reports of this event. There are two trustworthy descriptions, one by Robsahm (writing down Swedenborg's own description) and one by a priest who enquired of the woman in a letter fifteen years later.}}

Although not typically cited along with these three episodes, there was one further piece of evidence:  Swedenborg was noted by the seamen of the ships that he sailed between Stockholm and London to always have excellent sailing conditions.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329"&gt;Sigstedt, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked about this by a friend, Swedenborg played down the matter, saying he was surprised by this experience himself and that he was certainly not able to do miracles.&lt;ref name="Sigstedt, p. 329" /&gt;

== Kant's view ==

In 1763, [[Immanuel Kant]], then at the beginning of his career, was impressed by these accounts and made inquiries to find out if they were true.  He also ordered all eight volumes of the expensive ''Arcana Cœlestia'' (''Heavenly Arcana'' or ''Heavenly Mysteries''). One Charlotte von Knobloch wrote Kant asking his opinion of Swedenborg's psychic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This letter is further discussed in Laywine, A., "Kant's Early Metaphysics". ''North American Kant Society Studies in Philosophy'', volume 3 (Atascadero, California: Ridgeview Publishing Company, 1993), pp. 72–74.}}  Kant wrote a very affirmative reply, referring to Swedenborg's "miraculous" gift, and characterizing him as "reasonable, agreeable, remarkable and sincere" and "a scholar," in one of his letters to [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and expressing regret that he (Kant) had never met Swedenborg.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 202, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Green (merchant)|Joseph Green]], his English friend, who investigated the matter for Kant, including by visiting Swedenborg's home, found Swedenborg to be a "sensible, pleasant and openhearted" man and here again, a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, three years later, in 1766, Kant wrote and published anonymously a small book entitled ''Träume eines Geistersehers'' (''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'')&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G., Magee, G. E. (Swedenborg Foundation 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; that was a scathing critique of Swedenborg and his writings. He termed Swedenborg a "spook hunter"&lt;ref&gt;Benz 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt; "without official office or occupation."&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E., Heron, A. (Translator) ''Spiritual Vision and Revelation'', Chapter VI. ''The Mystery of a Date&amp;nbsp;– Fresh light on Kant's Criticism of Swedenborg'', p. 13, reprinted in ''The New Philosophy'' 2001 104:7,&lt;/ref&gt; As rationale for his critique, Kant said he wanted to stop "ceaseless questioning".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; and inquiries about ''Dreams'' from "inquisitive" persons, both known and unknown",&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, G. Did Kant dissemble his interest in Swedenborg? "The New Philosophy" 1999, 102: 531&lt;/ref&gt; Kant's friend [[Moses Mendelssohn]] thought there was a "joking pensiveness" in ''Dreams'' that sometimes left the reader in doubt as to whether ''Dreams'' was meant to make "metaphysics laughable or spirit-seeking credible".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his letters to Mendelssohn, Kant refers to ''Dreams'' less-than-enthusiastically as a "desultory little essay".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2002, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant never closed off the possibility of [[mysticism]] or spirits in ''Dreams of a Spirit-Seer'' and the exact relationship of his thought to Swedenborg's remains unclear, according to contemporary scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 185-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Lutheranism}}
Swedenborg claimed in ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' that the teachings of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ were revealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture''#4, ''True Christian Religion'' # 859, 750, 779&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg considered his [[theology]] a revelation of the true Christian religion that had become obfuscated through centuries of theology. However, he did not refer to his writings as theology since he considered it based on actual experiences, unlike theology,&lt;ref name="Delblanc" /&gt; except in the title of his last work. Neither did he wish to compare it to [[philosophy]], a discipline he discarded in 1748 because, he claimed, it ''"darkens the mind, blinds us, and wholly rejects the faith"''.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Bergquist (1999), p. 178, based on Swedenborg's ''Spiritual Experiences'' (1748), §767 (However, ''Spiritual Experiences'' is not among the works Swedenborg published himself, and thus may not be authoritative revelation. See [http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/books.html "Which of Swedenborg's books are Divine revelation?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of Swedenborg's theology was laid down in ''[[Arcana Cœlestia]]'' (''Heavenly Mysteries''), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In a significant portion of that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in ''Apocalypse Revealed''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AR.html |title=The Apocalypse Revealed Wherein are Disclosed the Arcana Foretold Which Have Hitherto Remained Concealed |publisher=Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the [[creation myth]] was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to [[Jesus Christ]], and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 286–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
One often discussed aspect of Swedenborg's writing is his ideas on marriage. Swedenborg himself remained a bachelor all his life, but that did not hinder him from writing voluminously on the subject. His work on ''Marriage Love'' (''Conjugial Love''{{efn|"[[wiktionary:conjugial|conjugial]]" should not be confused with "[[wiktionary:conjugal|conjugal]]", the general term for marriage.}} in older translations) (1768) was dedicated to this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=1 |title = ML 1 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher = Small Canon Search |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central question with regard to marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement of Jesus' that there is no marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote ''The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven'' as a detailed analysis of what he meant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.swedenborgproject.org/2011/08/22/the-lord-god-jesus-christ-on-marriage-in-heaven// |title = The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven |publisher = The Swedenborg Project |date = |accessdate = 2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of the relationship between husband and wife resumes in the spiritual world in whatever state it was at their death in this world. Thus, a couple in true marriage love remain together in that state in [[heaven]] into eternity. A couple lacking in that love by one or both partners, however, will separate after death and each will be given a compatible new partner if they wish. A partner is also given to a person who loved the ideal of marriage but never found a true partner in this world. The exception in both cases is a person who hates chaste marriage and thus cannot receive such a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=46 |title=Marriage Love 46–50) |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg saw creation as a series of pairings, descending from the Divine love and wisdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=dlw&amp;section=52 |title =Marriage Love #52 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that define [[God]] and are the basis of [[:wikt:creation|creation]]. This duality can be seen in the pairing of good and truth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=84 |title=Marriage Love #84 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; charity and faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=fa&amp;section=1 |title=Marriage Love #1 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; God and the church,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=117 |title = Marriage Love #117 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and husband and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=ml&amp;section=83 |title=Marriage Love #83 |publisher=Smallcanonsearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the goal for these pairs is to achieve [[wiktionary:conjunction|conjunction]] between the two component parts. In the case of marriage, the object is to bring about the joining together of the two partners at the spiritual and physical levels, and the happiness that comes as a consequence.

===Trinity===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
Swedenborg rejected the common explanation of the [[Trinity]] as a Trinity of Persons, which he said was not taught in the [[early Christian]] church. There was, for instance, no mention in the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostolic]] writings of any "Son from eternity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallcanonsearch.com/read.php?book=tcr&amp;section=175 |title=TCR 175 – Small Canon Search – Reading – The Word of God, The Whole Word of God, and Nothing But the Word of God – Searching the Second Advent Christian Bible – The Second Advent Christian Canon of Scripture |publisher=Small Canon Search |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he explained in his theological writings how the Divine Trinity exists in One Person, in One God, the Lord [[Jesus Christ]], which he said is taught in Colossians 2:9. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', Jesus, the  [[Son of God]], came into the world due to the spread of evil here.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/tcrtc.html ''The True Christian Religion'', particularly sections 163–184 ] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/DL.html ''The Doctrine of the Lord'']  (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/AC.htm ''The Arcana Coelestia''] (New York: Swedenborg Foundation, various dates)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E. [http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/njhd.html ''The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine,'' particularly sections 280–310] New York: Swedenborg Foundation, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swedenborg spoke in virtually all his works against what he regarded as the incomprehensible Trinity of Persons concept. He said that people of other religions opposed Christianity because of its doctrine of a Trinity of Persons. He considered the separation of the Trinity into three separate Persons to have originated with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[Athanasian]] Creed. According to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'' the Athanasian Creed is true, however, if the Trinity is understood to mean a Trinity in one person and that person being the Lord God Jesus Christ.

===''Sola Fide'' (Faith Alone)===
''The Heavenly Doctrine'' rejects the concept of salvation through [[faith alone|faith-alone]] (''sola-fide'' in Latin), since he considered both [[faith]] and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] necessary for [[salvation]], not one without the other, whereas the Reformers taught that faith-alone procured justification, although it must be a faith which resulted in obedience. The purpose of faith, according to ''The Heavenly Doctrine'', is to lead a person to a life according to the truths of faith, which is charity, as is taught in 1 Corinthians 13:13 and James 2:20.

In other words, Swedenborg spoke sharply against the faith-alone doctrine of Luther and others.  He held that justification before God was not based solely upon some imputed righteousness before God, and was not achievable merely by a gift of God's grace (''sola gratia''), granted without any basis in a person's actual behavior in life.  ''Sola-fide'' was a doctrine averred by Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ulrich Zwingli and others during the Protestant Reformation, and was a core belief especially in the theology of the Lutheran reformers [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]].

Although the ''sola-fide'' doctrine of the Reformers also emphasized that saving faith was one that effected works&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org/Reformation_faith_works.html |title=Reformation Faith + Works |publisher=Peacebyjesus.witnesstoday.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by faith-alone, but not by a faith which is alone), Swedenborg protested against faith-alone being the instrument of justification, and held that salvation is only possible through the conjunction of faith and charity in a person, and that the purpose of faith is to lead a person to live according to the truths of faith, which is [[Charity (virtue)|charity]]. He further states that faith and charity must be exercised by doing good out of willing good whenever possible, which are good works or good uses or the conjunction perishes. In one section he wrote:

{{quotation|It is very evident from their [[Epistles]] that it never entered the mind of any of the [[apostles]] that the church of this day would separate faith from charity by teaching that [[Sola fide|faith-alone]] justifies and saves apart from the works of the law, and that charity therefore cannot be conjoined with faith, since faith is from God, and charity, so far as it is expressed in works, is from man. But this separation and division were introduced into the Christian church when it divided God into three persons, and ascribed to each equal Divinity.|True Christian Religion, section 355&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblemeanings.info/books/tcr/sect-336ff.html#TCR355 |title=True Christian Religion, sections 336 ff |publisher=Biblemeanings.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Later history ==
Swedenborg made no attempt to found a church.&lt;ref&gt;Block, M.B [https://archive.org/details/newchurchinthene028276mbp ''The New Church in the New World. A Study of Swedenborgianism in America''] (Holt 1932; reprint Octagan 1968), Chapter 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benz, E. ''Emanuel Swedenborg. Visionary Savant in The Age of Reason'' (translated by Goodrick-Clarke (Swedenborg Foundation, 2002, p. 487).&lt;/ref&gt; A few years after his death&amp;nbsp;– 15 by one estimate&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, S. ''Emanuel Swedenborg'' (Chelsea House, 2005, p. 76).&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– for the most part in England, small reading groups formed to study his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As one scholar states, ''The Heavenly Doctrine''  particularly appealed to the various dissenting groups that sprang up in the first half of the 18th century who were "surfeited with revivalism and narrow-mindedness" and found his optimism and comprehensive explanations appealing.&lt;ref&gt;Ahlstrom, S. E. ''A Religious History of the American People'' (Yale 1972, p. 483).&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of important cultural figures, both writers and artists, were influenced by Swedenborg's writings, including [[Robert Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Jeffrey, ''Robert Frost: A Biography'', Houghton Mifflin, 1996, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Johnny Appleseed]], [[William Blake]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Daniel Burnham]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/scottish-authors/arthur-conan-doyle/the-history-of-spiritualism-vol-i/ebook-page-02.asp |title = Arthur Conan Doyle – The History of Spiritualism Vol I Page 02 |publisher=Classic-literature.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

T. Suzuki]], and [[W. B. Yeats]]. His philosophy had a great impact on the Duke of [[Södermanland]], later King [[Carl XIII]], who as the [[Grand Master (Masonic)|Grand Master]] of Swedish [[Freemasonry]] (''Svenska Frimurare Orden'') built its unique system of degrees and wrote its rituals. In contrast, one of the most prominent Swedish authors of Swedenborg's day, [[Johan Henric Kellgren]], called Swedenborg "nothing but a fool".{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' ("''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad''") in 1787. See Jonsson, Inge, ''Swedenborg och Linné'', in Delblanc &amp; Lönnroth (1999). (''[[wikisource:sv:Man äger ej snille för det man är galen|Link to the full poem, in Swedish]]'')}} A [[heresy]] trial was initiated in Sweden in 1768 against Swedenborg writings and two men who promoted them.{{efn|The trial in 1768 was against Gabrial Beyer and Johan Rosén and was essentially concerned whether Swedenborg's theological writings were consistent with Christian doctrine. A royal ordinance in 1770 declared that writings were "clearly mistaken" and should not be taught. Swedenborg then begged the King for grace and protection in a letter from Amsterdam. A new investigation against Swedenborg stalled and was eventually dropped in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), pp. 453–463.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the two and a half centuries since Swedenborg's death, various [[The New Church (Swedenborgian)|interpretations]] of his theology have been made, and he has also been scrutinized in biographies and psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/contets/es.html |title = Who was Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772)? |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = 2006-11-19 |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|See "[[#Sources|Sources]]" and "[[#Further reading|Further reading]]" sections, below.}} Swedenborg, with his claimed new [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], has been considered by some to suffer from [[mental illness]].{{efn|[[Johan Henrik Kellgren]] published an often quoted satirical poem entitled ''Man äger ej snille för det man är galen'' (''You Own Not Genius For That You are Mad'') in 1787.

He mentions an earlier biography by the Swedish physician Emil Kleen who concluded that Swedenborg was blatantly mad, suffering "[[paranoia]] and [[hallucinations]]. A similar conclusion was proposed more recently by [[psychiatrist]] John Johnson in "Henry Maudsley on Swedenborg's messianic psychosis", ''British Journal of Psychiatry'' 165:690–691 (1994), who wrote that Swedenborg suffered hallucinations of "acute [[schizophrenia]] or epileptic [[psychosis]]". Another contemporary critique, Foote-Smith E, Smith TJ. Emanuel Swedenborg. ''Epilepsia'' 1996 Feb; 37(2):211-8, proposed that Swedenborg suffered from [[Temporal Lobe Epilepsy]].

While the insanity explanation was not uncommon during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish [[Riddarhuset]] (The House of the Nobility), the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] (the Swedish parliament), and the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered by some to be remarkably coherent.&lt;ref&gt;Bergquist (1999), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a "kind and warm-hearted man", "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.swedenborgdigitallibrary.org/ES/epic37.htm |title = The Swedenborg Epic: Chapter 37 |publisher = Swedenborgdigitallibrary.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trobridge, G.''Swedenborg, Life and Teaching'' (Swedenborg Foundation, 1976, p. 202.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://archive.org/details/emanuelswedenbor00trobuoft |title = Emanuel Swedenborg : his life, teachings and influence : Trobridge, George, 1851–1909 : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |publisher = Archive.org |date = |accessdate = 2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pleasant and interesting conversation...

White worked for the Swedenborg Society in London and wrote an affirmative biography of Swedenborg.

White's response was the 1867 biography, in which he, in Tafel's words, "turn[ed] a complete somersault in his convictions," and wrote a highly derogatory biography of Swedenborg and his teachings.

{{more footnotes|date=April 2011}}
An '''energy budget''' is a balance sheet of [[energy]] [[income]] against [[expenditure]]. It is studied in the field of [[Energetics]] which deals with the study of energy transfer and transformation from one form to another.  [[Calorie]] is the basic unit of measurement. An [[organism]] in a laboratory experiment is an open [[thermodynamic]] system, exchanging energy with its surroundings in three ways - heat, work and the potential energy of [[biochemical compounds]].

Organisms use ingested food resources (C=consumption) as building blocks in the synthesis of [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] (P=production) and as fuel in the metabolic process that power this synthesis and other physiological processes (R=respiratory loss). Some of the resources are lost as waste products (F=faecal loss, U=urinary loss). All these aspects of metabolism can be represented in energy units.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The basic model of energy budget may be shown as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
P = C - R - U - F or 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
P = C - (R + U + F) or 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
C = P + R + U + F 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the aspects of metabolism can be represented in energy units (e.g. [[joules]] (J);1 [[calorie]] = 4.2 kJ).
Energy used for [[metabolism]] will be

&lt;blockquote&gt;
R = C - (F + U + P) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Energy used in the maintenance will be

&lt;blockquote&gt;
R + F + U = C - P
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


== Endothermy and ectothermy ==
Energy budget allocation varies for endotherms and ectotherms. [[Ectotherm]]s rely on the environment as a heat source while [[endotherm]]s maintain their body temperature through the regulation of metabolic processes. The heat produced in association with metabolic processes facilitates the active lifestyles of endotherms and their ability to travel far distances over a range of temperatures in the search for food.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCallum|first=Kimberly P.|last2=McDougall|first2=Freya O.|last3=Seymour|first3=Roger S.|date=2013-05-08|title=A review of the energetics of pollination biology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-013-0760-5|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|language=en|volume=183|issue=7|pages=867–876|doi=10.1007/s00360-013-0760-5|issn=0174-1578}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ectotherms are limited by the ambient temperature of the environment around them but the lack of substantial metabolic heat production accounts for an energetically inexpensive metabolic rate. The energy demands for ectotherms are generally one tenth of that required for endotherms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''EuroNanoForum''' ('''ENF''') nanotechnology conferences are organised within the framework of national presidencies of the European Council and supported by the European Union, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation.

The first conference EuroNanoForum 2003, held in Trieste during the Italian Presidency, enabled the European Commission to present the key elements for an integrated and responsible approach and a common strategy for the future on nanotechnology research. It brought to the issue of a Commission Communication in 2004, and to the preparation of an Action Plan for Europe for the period 2005–2009. The second conference EuroNanoForum 2005 took place in Edinburgh was focused on “Nanotechnology and the Health of the EU Citizen in 2020”. The aim of the conference was to promote developments in nanotechnology that are leading to innovative solutions for health and healthcare in Europe as part of an integrated and responsible approach presented in Trieste. The third conference EuroNanoForum 2007 took place in Düsseldorf addressing “Nanotechnology in industrial applications”. The aim of the conference was to promote on for the nanotechnology transfer from research into industrial production processes, products and applications that can improve the competitiveness of European industry.

[[EuroNanoForum 2009]] conference, held in Prague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguepost.com/print/897-prague-to-host-nano-forum.html|title=Prague to host nano forum|last=Abdulrehman|first=Shariffa |date=2009-03-26|publisher=[[Prague Post]]|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the frame of the Czech presidency, addressed “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy”. The focus was to grow opportunity and responsibility to leveraging nanotechnology to reduce pollution, conserve resources and, ultimately, build a "clean" environmentally sustainable economy as well as to address concerns for the safe and responsible the development of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name=cordis&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/nanotechnology/src/euronanoforum.htm euronanoforum 2009], Cordis.europa.eu. Retrieved July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[EuroNanoForum 2011]] took place in Budapest during Hungarian EU Presidency. The event explored how nanotechnology could contribute to sustainable solutions for Grand Challenges faced by European society and businesses in several areas, such as global warming, tightening supplies of energy, water and food, ageing societies, public health, pandemics and security with the overarching challenge of turning Europe into an eco-efficient economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronanoforum2011.eu/ EuroNanoForum 2011].

The event was hosted under the auspices of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. The speakers initiated a thriving discussion about the future of nanotechnology, its economic and technological impact on European growth and the commercialisation challenges of nanoproducts.

A '''frame language''' is a technology used for [[knowledge representation]] in [[artificial intelligence]]. Frames are stored as [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] of [[Set theory|sets]] and subsets of the [[Frame (artificial intelligence)|frame concepts]]. They are similar to class hierarchies in [[object-oriented languages]] although their fundamental design goals are different. Frames are focused on explicit and intuitive representation of knowledge whereas objects focus on [[Encapsulation (object-oriented programming)|encapsulation]] and [[information hiding]]. Frames originated in AI research and objects primarily in [[software engineering]]. However, in practice the techniques and capabilities of frame and object-oriented languages overlap significantly.

==Description==
Early work on Frames was inspired by psychological research going back to the 1930s that indicated people use stored stereotypical knowledge to interpret and act in new cognitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=F.C.|title=Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology|year=1932|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term Frame was first used by [[Marvin Minsky]] as a paradigm to understand visual reasoning and natural language processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Minsky|first=Marvin|title=The Psychology of Computer Vision|year=1975|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=211–277|editor=Pat Winston|chapter=A Framework for Representing Knowledge|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6089/AIM-306.pdf?%20sequence=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these and many other types of problems the potential solution space for even the smallest problem is huge. For example, extracting the phonemes from a raw audio stream or detecting the edges of an object. Things which seem trivial to humans are actually quite complex. In fact, how difficult they really were was probably not fully understood until AI researchers began to investigate the complexity of getting computers to solve them.

The initial notion of Frames or Scripts as they were also called is that they would establish the context for a problem and in so doing automatically reduce the possible search space significantly. The idea was also adopted by Schank and Abelson who used it to illustrate how an AI system could process common human interactions such as ordering a meal at a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schank|first=Roger|title=Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding|year=1977|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, New Jersey|author2=R. P. Abelson|url=https://content.taylorfrancis.com/books/download?dac=C2007-0-06021-9&amp;isbn=9781134919666&amp;format=googlePreviewPdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These interactions were standardized as Frames with slots that stored relevant information about each Frame. Slots are analogous to object properties in object-oriented modeling and to relations in entity-relation models. Slots often had default values but also required further refinement as part of the execution of each instance of the scenario. I.e., the execution of a task such as ordering at a restaurant was controlled by starting with a basic instance of the Frame and then instantiating and refining various values as appropriate. Essentially the abstract Frame represented an object class and the frame instances an object instance. In this early work the emphasis was primarily on the static data descriptions of the Frame. Various mechanisms were developed to define the range of a slot, default values, etc. However, even in these early systems there were procedural capabilities. One common technique was to use "triggers" (similar to the database concept of triggers) attached to slots. A trigger was simply procedural code that was attached to a slot. The trigger could fire either before and/or after a slot value was accessed or modified.

As with object classes, Frames were organized in [[Subsumption relation|subsumption]] hierarchies. For example, a basic frame might be ordering at a restaurant. An instance of that would be Joe goes to McDonald's. A specialization (essentially a [[Subclass (computer science)|subclass]]) of the restaurant frame would be a frame for ordering at a fancy restaurant. The fancy restaurant frame would inherit all the default values from the restaurant frame but also would either add more slots or change one or more of the default values (e.g., expected price range) for the specialized frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feigenbaum|first=Edward|title=The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, Volume III|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=0201118114|pages=216–222|url=https://archive.org/stream/handbookofartific01barr#page/156/mode/2up|author2=Avron Barr|date=September 1, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobrow|first=D.G.|author2=Terry Winograd|title=An Overview of KRL: A Knowledge Representation Language|journal=Cognitive Science|year=1977|volume=1|pages=3–46|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the early Frame language research (e.g. Schank and Abelson) had been driven by findings from experimental psychology and attempts to design knowledge representation tools that corresponded to the patterns humans were thought to use to function in daily tasks. These researchers were less interested in mathematical formality since they believed such formalisms were not necessarily good models for the way the average human conceptualizes the world. The way humans use language for example is often far from truly logical.

Similarly, in linguistics, [[Charles J. Fillmore]] in the mid-1970s started working on his theory of [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], which later would lead to computational resources like [[FrameNet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lakoff|first=George|title=Charles Fillmore, Discoverer of Frame Semantics, Dies in SF at 84: He Figured Out How Framing Works|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/george-lakoff/charles-fillmore-discover_b_4807590.html|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=The Huffington Post|date=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frame semantics was motivated by reflections on human language and human cognition.

Researchers such as [[Ron Brachman]] on the other hand wanted to give AI researchers the mathematical formalism and computational power that were associated with Logic. Their aim was to map the Frame classes, slots, constraints, and rules in a Frame language to set theory and logic.  One of the benefits of this approach is that the validation and even creation of the models could be automated using theorem provers and other automated reasoning capabilities. The drawback was that it could be more difficult to initially specify the model in a language with a formal semantics.

This evolution also illustrates a classic divide in AI research known as the "[[neats vs. scruffies]]". The "neats" were researchers who placed the most value on mathematical precision and formalism which could be achieved via [[First Order Logic]] and [[Set Theory]]. The "scruffies" were more interested in modeling knowledge in representations that were intuitive and psychologically meaningful to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crevier|first=Daniel|title=AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence|year=1993|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-02997-3|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable of the more formal approaches was the [[KL-ONE]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brachman|first=Ron|title=A Structural Paradigm for Representing Knowledge|journal=Bolt, Beranek, and Neumann Technical Report|year=1978|issue=3605|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA056524}}&lt;/ref&gt; KL-ONE later went on to spawn several subsequent Frame languages. The formal semantics of languages such as KL-ONE gave these frame languages a new type of automated reasoning capability known as the [[Deductive classifier|classifier]]. The classifier is an engine that analyzes the various declarations in the frame language: the definition of sets, subsets, relations, etc. The classifier can then automatically deduce various additional relations and can detect when some parts of a model are inconsistent with each other. In this way many of the tasks that would normally be executed by forward or backward chaining in an inference engine can instead be performed by the classifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technology is especially valuable in dealing with the Internet. It is an interesting result that the formalism of languages such as KL-ONE can be most useful dealing with the highly informal and unstructured data found on the Internet. On the Internet it is simply not feasible to require all systems to standardize on one data model. It is inevitable that terminology will be used in multiple inconsistent forms. The automatic classification capability of the classifier engine provides AI developers with a powerful toolbox to help bring order and consistency to a very inconsistent collection of data (i.e., the Internet). The vision for an enhanced Internet, where pages are ordered not just by text keywords but by classification of concepts is known as the [[Semantic Web]]. Classification technology originally developed for Frame languages is a key enabler of the Semantic Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |author2=James Hendler |author3=Ora Lassila |title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities |journal=Scientific American |date=May 17, 2001 |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34 |volume=284 |pages=34–43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html |archivedate=2013-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horridge|first=Mathew|title=Protégé OWL Tutorial A step-by-step guide to modelling in OWL using the popular Protégé OWL tools.|url=http://130.88.198.11/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/|work=Manchester University|publisher=Manchester University|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "neats vs. scruffies" divide also emerged in Semantic Web research, culminating in the creation of the [[Linking Open Data]] community—their focus was on exposing data on the Web rather than modeling.

==Example==
A simple example of concepts modeled in a frame language is the [[FOAF (ontology)|Friend of A Friend (FOAF) ontology]] defined as part of the Semantic Web as a foundation for social networking and calendar systems. The primary frame in this simple example is a ''Person''. Example slots are the person's ''email'', ''home page, phone,'' etc. The interests of each person can be represented by additional frames describing the space of business and entertainment domains. The slot ''knows'' links each person with other persons. Default values for a person's interests can be inferred by the web of people they are friends of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FOAF|url=http://semanticweb.org/wiki/FOAF|website=http://semanticweb.org|accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
The earliest Frame based languages were custom developed for specific research projects and were not packaged as tools to be re-used by other researchers. Just as with [[expert system]] [[inference engine]]s, researchers soon realized the benefits of extracting part of the core infrastructure and developing general purpose frame languages that were not coupled to specific applications. One of the first general purpose frame languages was KRL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobrow|first=D.G.|author2=Terry Winograd|title=An Overview of KRL: A Knowledge Representation Language|journal=Cognitive Science|year=1977|volume=1|pages=3–46|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog0101_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most influential early Frame languages was [[KL-ONE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brachman|first=Ron|title=A Structural Paradigm for Representing Knowledge|journal=Bolt, Beranek, and Neumann Technical Report|year=1978|issue=3605|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA056524}}&lt;/ref&gt; KL-ONE spawned several subsequent Frame languages. One of the most widely used successors to KL-ONE was the [[LOOM (ontology)|Loom language]] developed by Robert MacGregor at the [[Information Sciences Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Artificial Intelligence generated a great deal of interest in the business world fueled by expert systems. This led to the development of many commercial products for the development of knowledge-based systems. These early products were usually developed in Lisp and integrated constructs such as IF-THEN rules for logical reasoning with Frame hierarchies for representing data. One of the most well known of these early Lisp knowledge-base tools was the [[Knowledge Engineering Environment]] (KEE) from [[IntelliCorp (software)|Intellicorp]]. KEE provided a full Frame language with multiple inheritance, slots, triggers, default values, and a rule engine that supported backward and forward chaining. As with most early commercial versions of AI software KEE was originally deployed in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] on [[Lisp machine]] platforms but was eventually ported to PCs and Unix workstations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8| issue = 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research agenda of the [[Semantic Web]] spawned a renewed interest in automatic classification and frame languages.  An example is the [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL) standard for describing information on the Internet. OWL is a standard to provide a semantic layer on top of the Internet. The goal is that rather than organizing the web using keywords as most applications (e.g. Google) do today the web can be organized by concepts organized in an ontology.

The name of the OWL language itself provides a good example of the value of a Semantic Web. If one were to search for "OWL" using the Internet today most of the pages retrieved would be on the bird [[Owl]] rather than the standard [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]. With a Semantic Web it would be possible to specify the concept "Web Ontology Language" and the user would not need to worry about the various possible acronyms or synonyms as part of the search. Likewise the user would not need to worry about homonyms crowding the search results with irrelevant data such as information about birds of prey as in this simple example.

In addition to OWL various standards and technologies that are relevant to the Semantic Web and were influenced by Frame languages include [[Ontology Inference Layer|OIL]] and [[DARPA Agent Markup Language|DAML]].  The [[Protégé (software)|Protege]] Open Source software tool from Stanford University provides an ontology editing capability that is built on OWL and has the full capabilities of a classifier. However it ceased to explicitly support frames as of version 3.5 (which is maintained for those preferring frame orientation), the version current in 2017 being 5. The justification for moving from explicit frames being that OWL DL is more expressive and "industry standard". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horridge|first=Mathew|title=Protégé OWL Tutorial A step-by-step guide to modeling in OWL using the popular Protégé OWL tools.|url=http://130.88.198.11/tutorials/protegeowltutorial/|work=Manchester University|publisher=Manchester University|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison of frames and objects==
Frame languages have a significant overlap with [[object-oriented]] languages. The terminologies and goals of the two communities were different but as they moved from the academic world and labs to the commercial world developers tended to not care about philosophical issues and focused primarily on specific capabilities, taking the best from either camp regardless of where the idea began. What both paradigms have in common is a desire to reduce the distance between concepts in the real world and their implementation in software. As such both paradigms arrived at the idea of representing the primary software objects in taxonomies starting with very general types and progressing to more specific types.

The following table illustrates the correlation between standard terminology from the object-oriented and frame language communities:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Frame Terminology !! OO Terminology
|-
| Frame || Object Class
|-
| Slot || Object property or attribute
|-
| Trigger || Accessor and Mutator methods
|-
| Method (e.g. Loom, KEE) || Method
|}

The primary difference between the two paradigms was in the degree that encapsulation was considered a major requirement. For the object-oriented paradigm encapsulation was one of the if not the most critical requirement. The desire to reduce the potential interactions between software components and hence manage large complex systems was a key driver of object-oriented technology. For the frame language camp this requirement was less critical than the desire to provide a vast array of possible tools to represent rules, constraints, and programming logic. In the object-oriented world everything is controlled by methods and the visibility of methods. So for example, accessing the data value of an object property must be done via an accessor method. This method controls things such as validating the data type and constraints on the value being retrieved or set on the property. In Frame languages these same types of constraints could be handled in multiple ways. Triggers could be defined to fire before or after a value was set or retrieved. Rules could be defined that managed the same types of constraints. The slots themselves could be augmented with additional information (called "facets" in some languages) again with the same type of constraint information.

The other main differentiator between frame and OO languages was multiple inheritance (allowing a frame or class to have two or more superclasses). For frame languages multiple inheritance was a requirement.  This follows from the desire to model the world the way humans do, human conceptualizations of the world seldom fall into rigidly defined non-overlapping taxonomies. For many OO languages, especially in the later years of OO, single inheritance was either strongly desired or required. Multiple inheritance was seen as a possible step in the analysis phase to model a domain but something that should be eliminated in the design and implementation phases in the name of maintaining encapsulation and modularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unified Modeling Language|url=http://www.essentialstrategies.com/publications/modeling/uml.htm|work=essentialstrategies.com|publisher=Essential Strategies Inc.|accessdate=10 December 2013|year=1999|quote=In your author’s experience, nearly all examples that appear to require multiple inheritance or multiple type hierarchies can be solved by attacking the model from a different direction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the early frame languages such as KRL did not include message passing, driven by the demands of developers, most of the later frame languages (e.g. Loom, KEE) included the ability to define messages on Frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mettrey|first=William|title=An Assessment of Tools for Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems|journal=AI Magazine|year=1987|volume= 8| issue = 4|url=http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewArticle/625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the object-oriented side, standards have also emerged that provide essentially the equivalent functionality that frame languages provided, albeit in a different format and all standardized on object libraries. For example, the [[Object Management Group]] has standardized specifications for capabilities such as associating test data and constraints with objects (analogous to common uses for facets in Frames and to constraints in Frame languages such as Loom) and for integrating rule engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Macgregor|first=Robert|title=Retrospective on Loom|url=http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/papers/macgregor/Loom_Retrospective.html|work=isi.edu|publisher=Information Sciences Institute|accessdate=10 December 2013|date=August 13, 1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025063241/http://www.isi.edu/isd/LOOM/papers/macgregor/Loom_Retrospective.html|archivedate=25 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMG Formal Specifications|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/|work=omg.org|publisher=Object Management Group|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gag-onc fusion protein''' (also written as '''Gag-v-Onc''', with "v" indicating that the Onc sequence resides in a viral genome)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genes VII |last1=Lewin |first1=Benjamin |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |isbn=978-0198792765 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a general term for a [[fusion protein]] formed from a [[group-specific antigen]] ('gag') gene and that of an [[oncogene]] ('onc'), a gene that plays a role in the development of a cancer. ''Onc'' is a generic placeholder for a given specific oncogene, such as [[C-jun]]. (In the case of a fusion with [[C-jun]], the resulting "gag-jun" protein is known alternatively as [[RELA|p65]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?Db=mesh&amp;Cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;Term=%22Oncogene+Protein+p65(gag-jun)%22%5BMeSH+Terms%5D|title=Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun) - MeSH - NCBI|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gag genes are part of a general architecture for [[Oncovirus#Description of virus|retroviruses]], viruses that replicate through [[reverse transcription]], where the gag region of the [[genome]] encodes proteins that constitute the matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid of the mature virus particles. Like in [[HIV#Replication cycle|HIV's replication cycle]], these proteins are needed for [[Viral shedding#Via budding|viral budding]] from the host cell's plasma membrane, where the fully formed [[virion]]s leave the cell to infect other cells.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Virology'', 3rd edition, Vol. 1, Molecular Biology, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As a specific case, a Gag-v-Onc fusion protein from the [[Rous sarcoma virus]] is useful in illustrating the dual role that the fusion protein plays in both the viral and host cellular life cycle. For example, the viral gene [[Rous sarcoma virus#Src gene|Src]] (as in "sarcoma") is not necessary for viral reproduction, but does affect [[virulence]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subsequent mutations are responsible for the oncogenic capabilities of the virus, as the normal (host) version of the Src gene, [[C-src tyrosine kinase|c-Src]] promotes survival, [[angiogenesis]], [[Cell growth|proliferation]] and invasion pathways. These native pathways are disrupted in the presence of the mutant Src gene (v-Src) such that oncogenesis becomes more likely for the infected host cells, since the v-Src gene is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into a functionally distinct version of its host counterpart.

When a viral gene is introduced into the host cell and is sufficient to induce oncogenesis – the creation of cancerous cells – in the infected cell line, the gene is said to be a "viral transforming gene".&lt;ref name="Amazon-1555814808"&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Virology, Vol. 2: Pathogenesis and Control |isbn=978-1-55581-480-9 |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=ASM Press |edition=3  |first=S. Jane |last=Flint}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this type of gene is [[Translation (biology)|translated]] to a protein, the protein is called a "transforming protein". Note that since the viral oncogenes originated from a host genome, the transformation event is different from [[Transduction (genetics)#More general uses of the term|transduction]], which describes the process of introducing non-native genes to a host organism via a viral infection.

In the case of the [[murine leukemia virus]]es, a species of viruses capable of causing cancer in [[murine]]s (mice), the viral life cycle can also be responsible for oncogenesis through a Gag-v-Onc fusion protein called "Mo-MuLV(src)", which is a Gag-v-Src protein capable of inducing oncogenesis in living mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Glossary ==

{{Term|term= Accuracy }}
{{defn|1=  Producing [[language]] with few errors. }}

{{Term|term= Achievement test }}
{{defn|1=  A test to measure what students have learned or achieved from a program of study; should be part of every language program and be specific to the goals and objectives of a specific language course. These tests must be flexible to respond to the particular goals and needs of the students in a language program. }}

{{Term|term= Activate }}
{{defn|1=  The phase in a lesson where students have the opportunity to practice language forms. See “controlled practice”, “guided practice”, and “free practice”. }}

{{Term|term= Active listening }}
{{defn|1=  A technique whereby the listener repeats (often in other words) what the speaker has said to demonstrate his or her understanding. Active listening is an especially useful alternative to directly correcting a student error. Compare [[active listening]]. }}

{{Term|term= Active vocabulary }}
{{defn|1=  Vocabulary that students actually use in speaking and writing. }}

{{Term|term= Active }}
{{defn|1=  Related to student engagement and participation. For example, listening is perceived to be a passive skill, but is actually active because it involves students in decoding meaning. }}

{{Term|term= Alphabet |content= [[Alphabet]] }}
{{defn|1=  A complete standardized set of letters – basic written symbols – each of which roughly represents a phoneme of a spoken language, either as it exists now or as it may have been in the past. English uses the Roman or Latin alphabet, which consists of vowels and consonants. }}

{{bq|1= {{Term|term= Vowel |content= [[Vowel]] }}
{{defn|1= A sound in spoken language characterized by an open configuration of the voice tract so that there is no build-up of air pressure above the vocal cords. The Roman vowels include the letters “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u” and sometimes “y”. In all languages, vowels form the nucleus of a syllable. A vowel also completes a syllable. }}

{{Term|term= Semivowel |content= [[Semivowel]] }}
{{defn|1= A sound that is much like the vowel, but is not the key (nuclear) sound in a syllable. Examples: the opening sounds in the words “yet” and “wet”.  }}

{{Term|term= Consonant |content= [[Consonant]] }}
{{defn|1= An alphabetic character which represents a sound created by a constriction or closure at one or more points along the vocal tract. Consonants form the onset or end of a syllable, or both. }} }}

{{Term|term= Aptitude |content= [[Aptitude]] }}
{{defn|1=  The rate at which a student can learn a language, based on raw talent. Aptitude does not seem to be related to attitude; a gifted student can have a poor attitude. }}

{{Term|term= Attitude |content= [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitude]] }}
{{defn|1=  A complex mental state involving beliefs, feelings, values and dispositions to act in certain ways. Attitude affects a student’s ability to learn, but is unrelated to aptitude. }}

{{Term|term= Audiolingualism }}
{{defn|1=  A form of language learning based on behaviourist psychology. It stresses the following: listening and speaking before reading and writing; activities such as dialogues and drills, formation of good habits and automatic language use through much repetition; use of target language only in the classroom. }}

{{Term|term= Audio-visual aids }}
{{defn|1=  Teaching aids such as audio, video, overhead projection, posters,pictures and graphics. }}

{{Term|term= Aural }}
{{defn|1=  Related to listening. }}

{{Term|term= Authentic text }}
{{defn|1=  Natural or real teaching material; often this material is taken from newspapers, magazines, radio, TV or podcasts. }}

{{Term|term= Automaticity }}
{{defn|1=  A learner’s ability to recover a word automatically, without straining to fetch it from memory. }}

{{Term|term= Behavioural psychology |content= [[Behavioural psychology]] }}
{{defn|1=   Also called behaviourism, the belief that learning should be based on psychological study of observable and measurable psychology only; psychological theory based on stimulus-response influenced audiolingualism. }}

{{Term|term= Bottom-up information processing }}
{{defn|1=  Students learn partially through bottom-up information processing, or processing based on information present in the language presented. For example, in reading bottom-up processing involves understanding letters, words, and sentence structure rather than making use of the students’ previous knowledge. }}

{{Term|term= Brainstorming }}
{{defn|1=  A group activity where students freely contribute their ideas to a topic to generate ideas. }}

{{Term|term= Burn-out }}
{{defn|1=  Fatigue usually based on either the stress of overwork or boredom with the same task. }}

{{Term|term= Chomsky, Noam |content= [[Chomsky, Noam]] }}
{{defn|1=  The ideas of the American linguistic theorist Noam Chomsky can be very abstract, in contrast to the very practical process of communicative language teaching. Chomsky’s theories of knowledge of language and language acquisition relate as much to the study of human nature as to language teaching. As Steven Pinker explains{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}},
Chomsky’s claim that…all humans speak a single language is based on the hypothesis that the same symbol-manipulating machinery, without exception, underlies the world’s languages. Linguists have long known that the basic design features of language are found everywhere… A common grammatical code, neutral between production and comprehension, allows speakers to produce any linguistic message they can understand, and vice versa. Words have stable meanings, linked to them by arbitrary convention….Languages can convey meanings that are abstract and remote in time or space from the speaker, (and) linguistic forms are infinite in number.  }}

{{Term|term= Chorus }}
{{defn|1=  Speaking together as a group; used in choral speaking and jazz chants. }}

{{Term|term= Classroom climate }}
{{defn|1=  Environment created in the classroom by factors such as the physical environment and also the interrelationship between the teacher and the students, and among the students. }}

{{Term|term= Classroom management }}
{{defn|1=  The management of classroom processes such as how the teacher sets up the classroom and organizes teaching and learning to facilitate instruction. Includes classroom procedures, groupings, how instructions for activities are given, and management of student behaviour. }}

{{Term|term= Cloze |content= [[Cloze]] }}
{{defn|1=  A type of gap fill where the gaps are regular, e.g. every 7th or 9th word. The technique can used to assess students’ reading comprehension or as a practice activity. }}

{{Term|term= Collocation |content= [[Collocation]] }}
{{defn|1=  The way words are often used together. For example, “do the dishes” and “do homework”, but “make the bed” and “make noise”. }}

{{Term|term= Colloquialism |content= [[Colloquialism]] }}
{{defn|1=   A word or phrase used in conversation – usually in small regions of the English-speaking world – but not in formal speech or writing: “Like, this dude came onto her real bad.” }}

{{Term|term= Communicative Competence }}
{{defn|1=  The role of language learning is to achieve communicative competence. Communicative competence has four parts, which we call language competencies.

# '''Grammatical competence''' is how well a person has learned that features and rules of the language. This includes vocabulary, pronunciation, and sentence formation. The main question is: How well does a person understand English grammar?
# '''Sociolinguistic competence''' is how well a person speaks and is understood in various social contexts. This depends on factors such as status of those speaking to each other, the purpose of the interaction, and the expectations of the interaction. The main question is: how socially acceptable is the person’s use of English in different settings?
# '''Discourse competence''' is how well a person can combine grammatical forms and meanings to achieve different types (genres) of speaking or writing. The main question is: How well does one properly combine all the languages elements to speak or write in English?
# '''Strategic competence''' is how well the person uses both verbal forms and non-verbal communication to compensate for lack of knowledge in the other three competencies. The main question is: Can a person find ways to communicate when he or she is lacking some knowledge of English? }}

{{Term|term= Communicative Language Teaching |content= [[Communicative language teaching|Communicative Language Teaching]] {{anchor|CLT|Communicative language teaching}} }}
{{defn|1=  Communicative language teaching (CLT) is an approach to foreign or second language learning which emphasizes that the goal of language learning is communicative competence. The communicative approach has been developed particularly by British applied linguists as a reaction away from grammar-based approaches such as the aural-oral (audio-lingual) approach. Teaching materials used with a communicative approach teach the language needed to express and understand different kinds of functions, such as requesting, describing, expressing likes and dislikes, etc. Also, they emphasize the processes of communication, such as using language appropriately in different types of situations; using language to perform different kinds of tasks, e.g. to solve puzzles, to get information, etc.; using language for social interaction with other people. }}

{{Term|term= Competence learning model }}
{{defn|1=  Especially when we take specialized courses, learning seems to take place in four stages. We begin with unconscious incompetence: we do not know how much we do not know. Once we begin our course of studies, we become consciously incompetent: we know how much we do not know. From there we proceed to conscious competence: we have functional knowledge and can perform competently, but we have to think about what we are doing. Finally, after we have had enough experience, we become unconsciously competent: we know it and we can do it, and we do not much have to think about it. This model applies to a great deal of language learning, to TEFL training and to many other areas of study.  }}

{{Term|term= Comprehensible input }}
{{defn|1=  Language that is understandable to learners. }}

{{Term|term= Content words }}
{{defn|1=  Words that carry meaning; usually nouns, verbs and sometimes adjectives and adverbs. }}

{{Term|term= Context clues }}
{{defn|1=  Clues used when guessing word meanings; clues that provide students with meaning or comprehension based on the environment in which a word is found. }}

{{Term|term= Contrastive analysis |content= [[Contrastive analysis]] }}
{{defn|1=  Comparing two languages to predict where learning will be facilitated and hindered. }}

{{Term|term= Controlled practice }}
{{defn|1=  Language practise where the students are restricted in their choice of language, usually to a single answer, for example a gap fill. (see "Free practise" and "Guided practise") }}

{{Term|term= Creative construction hypothesis }}
{{defn|1=  Hypothesis in language acquisition which states that learners gradually develop their own rule systems for language. }}

{{Term|term= Culture |content= [[Culture]] }}
{{defn|1=  The sum of the beliefs, attitudes, behaviours, habits and customs of a group of people. }}

{{Term|term= Deductive teaching |content= [[Deductive teaching]] }}
{{defn|1=  Also known as deduction, from the verb “to deduce”; a teaching technique in which the teacher presents language rules and the students then practice those rules in activities. Deductive teaching is usually based on grammar-based methodology and proceeds from generalizations about the language to specifics. (See “Inductive teaching”.) }}

{{Term|term= Delayed copying }}
{{defn|1=  The teacher writes a short familiar sentence on the board, gives students time to look at it, erases it, and then they see if they can write it. }}

{{Term|term= Descriptive grammar }}
{{defn|1=  Grammar that is described in terms of what people actually say or write, rather than what grammar books say the grammar of the language should be. See “prescriptive grammar”. }}

{{Term|term= Diagnostic test }}
{{defn|1=  A test to diagnose or discover what language students know and what they need to develop to improve their language abilities; may be used before a course of study and combined with placement test. }}

{{Term|term= Dictation }}
{{defn|1=  A technique in which the teacher reads a short passage out loud and students write down what the teacher reads; the teacher reads phrases slowly, giving students time to write what they hear; the technique is used for practice as well as testing. }}

{{Term|term= Discourse }}
{{defn|1=  See “communicative competence”. }}

{{Term|term= Facilitator |content= [[Facilitator]] }}
{{defn|1=  A concept related to a teacher’s approach to interaction with students. Particularly in communicative classrooms, teachers tend to work in partnership with students to develop their language skills. A teacher who is a facilitator tends to be more student-centred and less dominant in the classroom than in other approaches. The facilitator may also take the role of mentor or coach rather than director. }}

{{Term|term= Feedback }}
{{defn|1=  Reporting back or giving information back, usually to the teacher; feedback can be verbal, written or nonverbal in the form of facial expressions, gestures, behaviours; teachers can use feedback to discover whether a student understands, is learning, and likes an activity. }}

{{Term|term= Fluency }}
{{defn|1=  Natural, normal, native-like speech characterized by appropriate pauses, intonation, stress, register, word choice, interjections and interruptions. }}

{{Term|term= Form-focused instruction }}
{{defn|1=  The teaching of specific language content (lexis, structure, phonology). See “language content”. }}

{{Term|term= Free practice }}
{{defn|1=  Practice-activities that involve more language choice by the learner. The students focus on the content rather than the language.  Used for fluency practice. (see "Controlled practice" and "Guided practice") }}

{{Term|term= Function words |content= [[Function words]] }}
{{defn|1=  Also known as form words, empty words, structure or structural words and grammar words; these words connect content words grammatically; function words have little or no meaning by themselves. Examples include articles, prepositions and conjunctions. }}

{{Term|term= Functional syllabus |content= [[Functional syllabus]] }}
{{defn|1=  Syllabus based on communicative acts such as making introductions, making requests, expressing opinions, requesting information, refusing, apologising, giving advice, persuading; this type of syllabus is often used in communicative language teaching. }}

{{Term|term= Gesture }}

{{Term|term= Grammar |content= [[Grammar]] }}
{{defn|1=  See “descriptive grammar” and “prescriptive grammar”. Also, see “communicative competence”. }}

{{Term|term= Graded reader |content= [[Graded reader]] }}
{{defn|1=  Reading material that has been simplified for language students. The readers are usually graded according to difficulty of grammar, vocabulary, or amount of information presented. }}

{{Term|term= Grammar translation |content= [[Grammar translation]] }}
{{defn|1=  A method of language teaching characterized by translation and the study of grammar rules. Involves presentation of grammatical rules, vocabulary lists, and translation. Emphasizes knowledge and use of language rules rather than communicative competence. }}

{{Term|term= Grammatical syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  A syllabus based on the grammar or structure of a language; often part of the grammar translation method. }}

{{Term|term= Guided practice }}
{{defn|1=  An intermediate stage in language practice - between "controlled practice" (q.v.) and "free practice" (q.v.) activities; this stage features allows for some creativity from the students. }}

{{Term|term= Idiom |content= [[Idiom]] }}
{{defn|1=   A group of words whose meaning is different from the meanings of the individual words: “She let the cat out of the bag” or “He was caught red-handed.” }}

{{Term|term= Inductive teaching }}
{{defn|1=  Also known as induction, from the verb “to induce”; a facilitative, student-centred teaching technique where the students discover language rules through extensive use of the language and exposure to many examples. This is the preferred technique in communicative language teaching. (See “ Deductive teaching”.) }}

{{Term|term= Input hypothesis }}
{{defn|1=  Hypothesis that states that learners learn language through exposure to language that is just beyond their level of comprehension. See “Krashen, Stephen”. }}

{{Term|term= Interference }}
{{defn|1=  A phenomenon in language learning where the first language interferes with learning the target or foreign language. }}

{{Term|term= Interlanguage |content= [[Interlanguage]] }}
{{defn|1=  The language a learner uses before mastering the foreign language; it may contain features of the first language and the target language as well as non-standard features. }}

{{Term|term= Interlocutor |content= [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|Interlocutor]] }}
{{defn|1=  In a conversation, this refers to the person you are speaking to. }}

{{Term|term= Intonation |content= [[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] }}
{{defn|1=  How we change the pitch and sound of our voice when speaking. See “language content”. }}

{{Term|term= Krashen, Stephen |content= [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen, Stephen]] }}
{{defn|1=  Krashen’s Theory of Second Language Acquisition is a highly practical theory for communicative language learning. This notion of second language acquisition consists of five main hypotheses: the Acquisition-Learning hypothesis; the Monitor hypothesis; the Natural Order hypothesis; the Input hypothesis; and the Affective Filter hypothesis. These hypotheses represent practical interpretations of what happens in language acquisition, and they form the basis of a system of language teaching called “The Natural Method.” }}

{{Term|term= Language content }}
{{defn|1=  Language has three components, which are commonly taught as language items.

# '''Structural items''' are grammatical points about the language. CL teachers frequently introduce these as examples or model sentences, and they are often called “patterns”. 
# '''Phonological items''' are features of the sound system of the language, including intonation, word stress, rhythm and register. A common way to teach phonology is simply to have students repeat vocabulary using proper stress and pronunciation. 
# '''A lexical item''' is a new bit of vocabulary. It is sometimes difficult to decide whether an item is structural or lexical. For example, the teacher could teach phrasal verbs like “chop down” and “stand up” as lexis or structure. }}
 
{{Term|term= Language experience approach }}
{{defn|1=  An approach based on teaching first language reading to young children, but adapted for use with adults. Students use vocabulary and concepts already learned to tell a story or describe an event. The teacher writes down the information they provide, and then uses the account to teach language, especially to develop reading skills. }}

{{Term|term= Language learning requirements }}
{{defn|1=  To learn language, students have four needs: They must be exposed to the language. They must understand its meaning and structure. And they must practice it. Teachers should hold their students as able. They should not over-explain or make things too easy. Learning comes through discovery. }}

{{Term|term= Language skills |content= [[Language skills]] }}
{{defn|1=  In language teaching, this refers to the mode or manner in which language is used. Listening, speaking, reading and writing are generally called the four language skills. Speaking and writing are the productive skills, while reading and listening are the receptive skills. Often the skills are divided into sub-skills, such as discriminating sounds in connected speech, or understanding relationships within a sentence.  }}

{{Term|term= Learning burden }}
{{defn|1=  These are the features of the word that the teacher actually needs to be taught, and can differ dramatically from word to word. Especially in lexis, the teacher needs to reduce learning burden by, for example, reducing the number of definitions and uses presented.  }}

{{Term|term= Learning factors }}
{{defn|1=  For EFL teachers, four factors outside aptitude and attitude affect the rate at which a student learns a second language. These are (1) the student’s motivation, including whether it is instrumental or integrative; (2) the amount of time the student spends in class and practicing the language outside class; (3) the teacher’s approach to teaching; and (4) the teacher’s effectiveness and teaching style. The most important of these motivators are the first two, which are also the two the teacher has least control over.  See also “aptitude”, “attitude” and “TEFL vs. TEFL”. }}

{{Term|term= Lesson plan }}
{{defn|1=  An outline or plan that guides teaching of a lesson; includes the following: pre-assessment of class; aims and objectives; warm-up and review; engagement, study, activation of language (controlled, guided and free practice); and assessment of lesson. A good lesson plan describes procedures for student motivation and practice activities, and includes alternative ideas in case the lesson is not long enough or is too difficult. It also notes materials needed. }}

{{Term|term= Lexis |content= [[Lexis (linguistics)|Lexis]] }}
{{defn|1=  See “language content”, and “vocabulary”. }}

{{Term|term= Listening |content= [[Listening]] }}
{{defn|1=  See “language skills”. }}

{{Term|term= Look and say }}
{{defn|1=  Also called the whole-word method, a method to teach reading to children, usually in their first language; has been adapted for second-language reading; words are taught in association with visuals or objects; students must always say the word so the teacher can monitor and correct pronunciation. }}

{{Term|term= Metalanguage |content= [[Metalanguage]] }}
{{defn|1=   Language used to describe, analyse or explain another language. Metalanguage includes, for example, grammatical terms and the rules of syntax. The term is sometimes used to mean the language used in class to give instructions, explain things, etc. – in essence, to refer to all teacher talk that does not specifically include the “target language”. }}
 
{{Term|term= Model/modelling }}
{{defn|1=  To teach by example; for example, a teacher who wants students to do an activity may first demonstrate the activity, often with a student volunteer. }}

{{Term|term= Motivation |content= [[Motivation]] }}
{{defn|1=  In language instruction, the desire to learn. See “TEFL vs. TESL”. }}

{{Term|term= Motivation paradox }}
{{defn|1=  Students’ main motivators are factors the teacher has little control over (integrated versus instrumental motivation, which heavily influence time on task), yet motivation is critical to learning.  }}

{{Term|term= Native speakers }}
{{defn|1=  Those who speak the language in question as their mother tongue. }}

{{Term|term= Needs assessment }}
{{defn|1=  Measurement of what students need in order to learn language and achieve their language learning goals; also may include consideration of the school syllabus. }}

{{Term|term= Non-native speakers }}
{{defn|1=  Those who speak the language in question as an additional language. The language in question is not their mother tongue. }}

{{Term|term= Objectives }}
{{defn|1=  Also called lesson objectives or aims; statements of student learning outcomes based on student needs; objectives state specifically what the students will be able to do in a specified time period; objectives are measurable and therefore involve specific and discrete language skills. }}

{{Term|term= Oral }}
{{defn|1=  Related to speaking. }}

{{Term|term= Over-correction }}
{{defn|1=  Correcting so much that students become reluctant to try out what they have learned. }}

{{Term|term= Paradox of language acquisition }}
{{defn|1=  The limited amount of comprehensible input that children receive is mathematically insufficient for them to determine grammatical principles, yet somehow they are still able to do so.  }}

{{Term|term= Passive vocabulary }}
{{defn|1=  Vocabulary that students have heard and can understand, but do not necessarily use when they speak or write. }}

{{Term|term= Passive }}
{{defn|1=  Opposite of active; the false assumption that the language skills of reading and listening do not involve students in doing anything but receiving information. }}

{{Term|term= Peer correction }}
{{defn|1=  Also known as peer review, peer editing, or [[peer feedback]]; in writing, an activity whereby students help each other with the editing of a composition by giving each other feedback, making comments or suggestions; can be done in pairs or small groups. }}

{{Term|term= Phonemic awareness }}
{{defn|1=  Awareness of the sounds of English and their correspondence to written forms. }}

{{Term|term= Phonology |content= [[Phonology]] }}
{{defn|1=  See “language content”. }}

{{Term|term= Placement tests }}
{{defn|1=  Tests used to place students in a specific language program; such tests should reflect program levels and expectations for students at each proficiency level offered by the language program. }}

{{Term|term= Prescriptive grammar |content= [[Prescriptive grammar]] }}
{{defn|1=  Grammar that is described in terms of grammar rules of what is considered the best usage, often by grammarians; prescriptive grammar may not agree with what people actually say or write. }}

{{Term|term= Proficiency level }}
{{defn|1=  Describes how well a student can use the language (often categorized as beginner, intermediate or advanced). }}

{{Term|term= Proficiency tests }}
{{defn|1=  General tests that provide overall information on a student’s language proficiency level or ability; can be used to determine entry and exit levels of a language program or to adjust the curriculum according to the abilities of the students. }}

{{Term|term= Rapport |content= [[Rapport]] }}
{{defn|1=  Relationship, usually a harmonious one, established within a classroom between teacher and students and among students. }}

{{Term|term= Realia |content= [[Realia (education)|Realia]] }}
{{defn|1=  Real or actual objects used as teaching aids to make learning more natural; can include forms, pictures, tickets, schedules, souvenirs, advertisements and articles from English magazines or newspapers, and so on. }}

{{Term|term= Recycling or spiralling }}
{{defn|1=  Sometimes called the cyclical approach; the purpose is to repeat language items throughout the syllabus; each time a language item is encountered more detail about it is added; this allows students to build on prior knowledge. }}

{{Term|term= Register |content= [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]] }}
{{defn|1=  Level of formality in speech with others; register depends on the situation, location, topic discussed, and other factors. }}

{{Term|term= Scan }}
{{defn|1=  To read quickly for specific information; a reading stratagem. }}

{{Term|term= Skim }}
{{defn|1=  To read quickly for main idea or general information; a reading stratagem. }}

{{Term|term= Social context }}
{{defn|1=  The environment in which meanings are exchanged; can be analysed in terms of the field of discourse, which refers to what is happening, including what is being talked about; the tenor of discourse, which refers to the participants taking part in the exchange of meaning, including who they are and their relationships with each other (for example, teacher and students); and the mode of discourse, which refers to what part the language is playing in the particular situation and what “channel” (writing, speaking or a combination of the two) is being used. }}

{{Term|term= Sociolinguistics }}
{{defn|1=  Aspects of culture that affect communication with others; examples: social class, education level, age, gender, ethnicity. Also, see “communicative competence”. }}

{{Term|term= Strategic competence }}
{{defn|1=  See “communicative competence”. }}

{{Term|term= Student and teacher }}
{{defn|1=  Teachers have eight roles in the classroom. They are authorities and sources of knowledge; entertainers; caregivers; role models; counsellors and sometimes friends; classroom disciplinarians; directors and managers; facilitators, coaches and guides.

The most important person in the classroom is the student. The teacher’s primary focus must be on effective ways to have the student practice using his or her language. Classes should be planned so they enable the student to use just a little more language than they are comfortable with. This is known as “i+1” – an idea popularized by Stephen Krashen. This formula is short for “comprehensible input plus one.” Comprehensible input is language the students can understand. }}

{{Term|term= Student feedback }}
{{defn|1=  Information solicited from students by the teacher to assess the effectiveness of the teaching-learning process. }}

{{Term|term= Student-centred }}
{{defn|1=  Also called learner-centred, a way of teaching that centres on the goals, needs, interests and existing knowledge of the students. Students actively participate in such classrooms and may even be involved in setting learning outcomes. Teachers in student-centred classrooms ask students for input on their goals, needs and interests and on what they know before providing them with study topics or answers to questions (for example, grammar rules). They may also ask students to generate (help produce) materials. The teacher is seen more as a facilitator or helper than the dominant figure in the classroom. }}

{{Term|term= Structure }}
{{defn|1=  See “language content”. }}

{{Term|term= Student-generated material }}
{{defn|1=  Teaching material to which the students have made a major contribution; the language experience approach, for example, uses student-generated material. }}

{{Term|term= Survey }}
{{defn|1=  To quickly read the headlines, subheads, opening and closing paragraphs, photo captions, pull quotes and other key materials in an article to get a sense of meaning; a reading stratagem. }}

{{Term|term= Syllabus |content= [[Syllabus]] or [[curriculum]] {{anchor|Curriculum|curriculum}} }}
{{defn|1=  The longer-term teaching plan; includes topics that will be covered and the order in which they will be covered in a course or program of studies. }}

{{Term|term= Syntax |content= [[Syntax]] }}
{{defn|1=  Sometimes called word order; how words combine to form sentences and the rules governing sentence formation. }}

{{Term|term= Tape script }}
{{defn|1=  A written text which accompanies listening material; may be used to make cloze passages or for student review. }}

{{Term|term= Task-based syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  A syllabus organized around a sect of real, purposeful tasks that students are expected to carry out; tasks may include telephone use, making charts or maps, following instructions, and so on; task-based learning is purposeful and a natural way to learn language. }}

{{Term|term= Teachable moments }}
{{defn|1=  Times in a language class in which the teacher realizes that a point of information not in the lesson plan will help students understand a language point; teachable moments digress for a brief time from the lesson plan and can be valuable in helping student learning and keeping students engaged. }}

{{Term|term= Teacher talk }}
{{defn|1=  The language teachers use when teaching; involves simplifying speech for students; it may be detrimental to learning if it is childish or not close to the natural production of the target language. }}

{{Term|term= TEFL vs. TESL }}
{{defn|1=  TEFL is an [[acronym]] for [[Teaching English as a Foreign Language]]; TESL, for Teaching English as a Second Language. See a fuller description at [[English language learning and teaching]].  TEFL '''usually''' takes place in non-English-speaking countries, while TESL takes place in the English-speaking world. 
When we speak of English as a foreign language (EFL), we are referring to the role of English for learners in a country where English is not spoken by the majority (what [[Braj Kachru]] calls the expanding circle).  English as a second language (ESL) refers to the role of English for learners in an English-speaking country, i.e. usually [[immigrants]]. This difference is very important, because it strongly affects student motivation. In particular, it affects their motivation to learn.

	In non-English speaking countries, students have instrumental motivation, the desire to learn English to accomplish a goal. They may want to improve their job prospects, for example, or to speak to tourists. They
1.	attend English classes with other non-native speakers
2.	can find reasonable work without English; have less economic incentive to learn English.
3.	do not need English in daily life
4.	have both primary and secondary support-networks that function in their native language
5.	have fewer opportunities to practice using their English
They are learning, and their instructors are teaching, English as a [[foreign language]].

	In English-speaking countries, they have integrative motivation, the desire to learn the language to fit into an English-language culture. They are more likely to want to integrate because they
1.	Generally have more friends and family with English language skills.
2.	Have immediate financial and economic incentives to learn English.
3.	Have more opportunities to practice English.
4.	Need it in daily life; often require it for work.
5.	Often attend English classes with students who speak a wide range of mother tongues.
They are learning, and their instructors are teaching, English as a [[second language]]. }}

{{Term|term= Technique }}
{{defn|1=  A way of presenting language. }}

{{Term|term= Thematic syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  Syllabus based on themes or topics of interest to the students. }}

{{Term|term= Top-down information processing }}
{{defn|1=  Students learn partially through top-down information processing, or processing based on how students make sense of language input – for example, through using students’ previous knowledge or schema. }}

{{Term|term= Uninterrupted sustained silent writing }}
{{defn|1=  A technique in writing whereby a specified, relatively short period of time is set aside in class for students to practice their writing without being interrupted. This helps build writing fluency. }}

{{Term|term= Vocabulary |content= [[Vocabulary]], importance of }}
{{defn|1=  Core vocabulary (the most common 2,000-3,000 English words) needs to be heavily stressed in language teaching. There is no point in presenting exotic vocabulary until students have mastered basic, high-frequency words. Learners should be tested on high-frequency word lists for passive knowledge, active production and listening comprehension. Learners cannot comprehend or speak at a high level without these words as a foundation.

Learners need to spend time practicing these words until they are automatic; this is known as building automaticity. Since there is often not enough class time for much word practice, teachers need to present their students with strategies for developing automaticity outside the classroom. }}

{{Term|term= Vocabulary-based syllabus }}
{{defn|1=  Syllabus built around vocabulary; often associated with the grammatical syllabus and the grammar translation method. }}

{{Term|term= Worksheets }}
{{defn|1=  Teacher-developed, paper-based activities to help students comprehend, use, and learn language; can be used in association with all skill levels and in individual and group work. }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17226">The '''Government Law Center''' (GLC) of [[Albany Law School]] is a non-profit law and public policy organization and think tank based in [[Albany, New York]]. The GLC is the oldest government law center in the United States, conducting research and education in law and public policy. The Center's areas of expertise include land use planning and zoning, environment, government ethics, local government, aging, public authorities, Chinese Law, racing and gaming, early stage business support for alternate energy, and civilian police review.&lt;ref name=GLCWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Law Center|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=668|work=Albany Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GLC's principal mission is to conduct programs and research that inform the public policy debate through non-partisan, comprehensive analysis of critical government-related issues. The GLC provides research and technical assistance to public officials and presents instruction for the general public.

The GLC has published a number of reports online at ''Government Law Online''. The Center offers fellowships and internships for students to enhance their academic learning.  The current interim Director of the center is Robert Heverly.  Beginning in August 2013, [[Raymond Brescia]] will take over as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Ray Brescia to Lead Government Law Center at Albany Law School|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/about/news/current/Pages/Professor-Ray-Brescia-to-Lead-Government-Law-Center-at-Albany-Law-School.aspx|publisher=Albany Law School|accessdate=7/3/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
&lt;br&gt;
The Government Law Center was founded in 1978, the product of a grant initiated at the federal level and administered by New York State through the [[New York State Department of State]], under the leadership of [[Mario Cuomo|Mario M. Cuomo]] as then-Secretary of State. Cuomo worked with Albany Law School Professors Sandra Stevenson and Bernard Harvith to secure a grant through the United States Office of Personnel Management and the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawksley|first=Jane|title=Albany's government law center serves as model|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sandra Stevenson served as the GLC's Director for a few months before J. Langdon Marsh became the first full-time director of the GLC on March 1, 1979&lt;ref name=Salkin101&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law &amp; Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=101–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center contracted with the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to prepare its first state legal report in 1980, titled "Selected Legal Problems in the Control of Hazardous Wastes." The Center proceeded to enter into contracts with several New York State agencies, including the [[New York State Department of Family Assistance|New York State Department of Social Services]], [[Adirondack Park Agency]], [[New York State Department of State]], [[New York State Department of Health]], and with the [[New York State Legislature]], to produce reports and offer training. Under Marsh's direction, the Center also focused on issues related to [[hazardous waste]], zoning and planning, environmental quality review, [[economic development]], and local government.

Marsh left the Center in July 1983, and for a brief time following, Joseph W. Bellacosa served as the Center's director. He subsequently was appointed by then-New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo to serve as a Judge on the Court of Claims and Chief Administrative Judge of all State Courts, followed by a fourteen-year term on the [[New York Court of Appeals]].
In 1983, Professor Sandra M. Stevenson was re-appointed Associate Dean and Director of the Government Law Center, assuming the position she had held in the first months of the Center's existence.&lt;ref name="salkin"/&gt; During her tenure, the GLC conducted training programs in [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) and tying ADR to intellectual property. Under Stevenson's leadership in 1989, Albany Law School and the Government Law Center became the official repository for tapes of oral arguments heard before the New York Court of Appeals.
In 1990, Professor George F. Carpinello was appointed Director. Under Carpinello, the Center introduced the ''Warren M. Anderson Legislative Breakfast Seminar Series'', a series focused on topics of interest to legislators and policy makers, named for the former President Pro Tem and [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate]]. The GLC also began producing a newsletter for the County Attorneys Association of New York State (CAASNY), prepared the first edition of ''Legal Careers in New York State Government'' (with later editions published by the [[New York State Bar Association]]), and placed student interns in the counsel's office of various state agencies.

[[Patricia Salkin|Patricia E. Salkin]], Raymond and Ella Smith Distinguished Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Albany Law School, was appointed Director of the GLC in 1992, and served as the Center's Director until her appointment as dean of the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012. In the first years under Salkin's leadership, the GLC began the ''Edgar and Margaret Sandman Fellowship in Aging and Health Law'', and created the Senior Citizen's Law Day, a day-long program providing local seniors with free seminars on important issues related to aging. The ''Aging Law and Policy Program'' was established in 1994 to focus on issues related to aging.&lt;ref name=salkin/&gt;

In 1994, the GLC also received funding through the [[United States Department of Education]] to create the ''Mediation Assistance Program'' to train and state-certify law and non-law students as volunteer mediators for New York's Community Dispute Settlement Program,&lt;ref name=salkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law &amp; Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=102–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the ''Program on Public Policy Dispute Resolution'' to focus on issues emerging in this field.

In the years that followed, a number of additional programs were initiated. ''The Lawrence F. Klepper Legal Assistance Program for Non-Profit Organizations'', helping to place law students with attorneys who provide pro bono or very low-cost services to nonprofits, was established at the GLC in 1994 by friends of the former Executive Director of the [[Legal Aid Society]] and with the support of [[Congregation Beth Emeth]].&lt;ref name=DeMare25&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carol|title=Government Law Center to Mark 25 Years of Service|newspaper=Times Union|date=February 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Edwin L. Crawford Memorial Lecture in Municipal Law'' was launched in 1996 to address issues of state and national importance to municipal officials. In 1998, the GLC's ''Government Law Network'' began as a way for people working in or with government to meet key law and policy makers at exclusive "Networking Breakfast" forums. The Center's ''Alumni Leaders in Government Networking Series'' provided students with an opportunity to interact with notable Albany Law School graduates.

In 1999, the GLC together with the Albany Law Clinic and Justice Center established the ''Semester in Government Program'', offering students full-time internships in government counsel offices in Albany and Washington, D.C. The Center also began producing ''The Government Law &amp; Policy Journal'' for the New York State Bar Association's Committee on Attorneys in Public Service.

In 2000, the GLC started providing services for the City of Albany's newly created ''Citizen's Police Review Board'', established by a law calling upon an academic institution to support the oversight of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Benjamin CPRB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin|first=Elizabeth|title=Albany Law at Heart of Police Oversight|newspaper=Times Union|date=April 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The GLC moved to its new location on the Albany Law School campus in 2001. The same year, the Center hosted the annual "Saratoga Institute on Racing and Gaming Law" as part of its ''Program on Racing and Gaming Law''.&lt;ref name="DeMare Racing"&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carole|title=Law Center Jumps Into Gaming|newspaper=Times Union|date=November 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center also received funding from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to expand mediation services for area housing communities.

In 2002, the GLC and Squire, Sanders and Dempsey began sponsoring the ''William B. Sanders Law and Public Policy Forum''. New York State officials such as former Governor [[David Paterson|David A. Paterson]], then Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]], and Assembly Speaker [[Sheldon Silver]] have participated. The ''Government Lawyer in Residence'' program at the GLC was established in 2002 to give the Center and law students the resources of a former government attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Few Words with James P King|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLC also produced a new edition of the ''Manual for Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers'' published by the New York State Department of Civil Service; a conference on the 30th anniversary of the [[Adirondack Park]]; New York's first conference on "smart growth"; a program to mark the 25th anniversary of the State Environmental Quality Review Act; and a symposium on siting new power plants in New York.

The GLC hosted the inaugural ''Nancy M. Sills '76 Memorial Lecture'', featuring then-Lieutenant Governor [[Mary Donohue|Mary O. Donohue]], at the 10th Annual Senior Citizen's Law Day in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lieutenant Governor Donohue Speaks at Tenth Annual Senior Citizens Law Day|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Winter 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Summer in Government'' was also introduced as a way to provide students with internship placements with government lawyers in Albany.

In 2004 the GLC, in partnership with public television station [[WMHT (TV)|WMHT]], produced "Inside the Inner Circle," focused on the process of state policymaking, featuring former counsels to five New York governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GLC Television Program Takes Viewers "Inside the Inner Circle"|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|volume=Fall 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2005 the Center introduced Graduate and Post-Graduate Fellowships for law and policy research and a Faculty Affiliate program to augment its research capability. Historian and scholar [[Paul Finkelman]] was named Senior Faculty Fellow at the GLC and Albany Law School's President William McKinley Distinguished Professor of Law and Public Policy. The ''Clarence D. "Rapp" Rappleyea Government Lawyer in Residence Program'' was established to recognize the former State Assembly Minority Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clarence D.Rappleyea Appointed Government Lawyer in Residence at the GLC|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 - 2007, the GLC took on a number of new projects: a series of procurement law initiatives to help improve New York State's procurement process and identify potential areas of reform in the 1995 Procurement Stewardship Act; providing technical assistance related to consolidations, mergers, dissolutions, cooperative agreements and shared services as part of the ''Shared Municipal Services Incentive (SMSI) Grant Program'', under a contract with the New York State Department of State; establishing a ''Non-Profit Legal Assistance Program'' with the assistance of then-U.S. Congressman [[Michael R. McNulty]]; and the establishment of the ''Public Authorities Project'', to provide research on legal aspects of public policy issues facing public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GLC Launches Public Authorities Project to Provide|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLC also hosted a number of conferences and programs during 2005 - 2007, including: a [[Cornell University]] co-sponsored invitational series on New York State water resources; a national teleconference on the legal aspects of commercializing hydrogen technology; a forum on the siting of wind facilities in New York, in partnership with the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New York’s Potential for Wind Energy Development|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a national teleconference series on renewable energy, sponsored by the American Council on Renewable Energy; and a symposium on municipal broadband and WiFi policies, in cooperation with the New York State Office for Technology, the New York State Public Service Commission, the New York State Department of State, and the [[Empire State Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=State’s Municipal Broadband Policy|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ''Ethics in Government Act'', the GLC convened a symposium in 2007 keynoted by former Fordham Law School Dean [[John Feerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=20 Years of Ethics Reform - The Ethics in Government Act Revisited|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Government Law Center proceeded to sponsor and co-sponsor numerous conferences in 2008 - 2009, including a 2009 conference on building in the 21st century, co-sponsored with the [[American Institute of Architects]], New York State and the [[New York City Bar Association]]; a symposium on E-FOIL and the impact of technology on accessing records featuring Miriam Nisbet, Director of the Office of Government Information Services, United States National Archives and Records Administration;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Speakers Debate Challenges of|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a symposium on preserving executive records in 2010, with former Governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]] and presidential historian [[Richard Norton Smith]].

In 2010 - 2011, in conjunction with the Albany Law School's ''Albany Law Review'', the GLC held symposia on education reform with Charles Rose, General Counsel for the [[United States Department of Education]]; baseball and the law, featuring [[John Thorn]], Major League Baseball's official Baseball Historian;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Baseball and the Law Conference|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ([[LGBT]]) rights, keynoted by [[Jeh Johnson]], General Counsel for the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In 2009, Albany Law School was awarded a four-year, $250,000 incentive by NYSERDA to help create sustainable networks in New York State that support early-stage companies focused on [[sustainable energy|renewable and clean energy]] product development. In 2010, the GLC received additional funding from NYSERDA to begin providing legal education and early stage business support to New York's [[cleantech]] and alternative energy companies, including a web-based resource, ''Legal Handbook for Early Stage Business''.

In 2010, the GLC introduced the nationwide ''Public Authorities Information Clearinghouse (PAIC)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Public Authority Reform Research Results in On-Line Clearinghouse and Public Clearinghouse and Publication|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to help government officials, public interest groups, and others navigate documents that pertain to the operation of government of public authorities. A blog on public authorities was launched in 2011.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Index Fungorum''}}
'''''Index Fungorum''''' is an international project to index all formal names ([[Binomial nomenclature|scientific name]]s) in the [[Fungus]] [[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]]. {{as of|2015}} the project is based at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], one of three partners along with [[Landcare Research New Zealand Limited|Landcare Research]] and the Institute of Microbiology, [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]].

It is somewhat comparable to the [[International Plant Names Index]] (IPNI), in which the Royal Botanic Gardens is also involved. A difference is that where IPNI does not indicate [[Correct name (botany)|correct name]]s, the ''Index Fungorum'' does indicate the status of a name.  In the returns from the search page a currently correct name is indicated in green, while others are in blue (a few, aberrant usages of names are indicated in red).  All names are linked to pages giving the correct name, with lists of [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]s.

Index Fungorum is one of three nomenclatural repositories recognized by the [[Nomenclature Committee for Fungi]]; the others are ''[[MycoBank]]'' and ''[[Fungal Names]]''.&lt;ref name="Redhead 2013"/&gt;

==Current names in ''Index Fungorum'' (''Species Fungorum'')==
The main part of ''Index Fungorum'' is intended to be a global list of all fungus names which have ever been validly defined, but many of them are conflicting or no longer used.  ''Species Fungorum'' is a closely related project based at the [[w:Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew]] supported by [[w:CABI (organisation)|CABI]] to decide a consistent subset of the ''Index Fungorum'' names which can be recommended as currently valid.  It is possible to search in either the ''Index Fungorum'' or the ''Species Fungorum'' list separately and the ''Index Fungorum'' results also give a cross-reference to ''Species Fungorum'' where an entry is available - names without such a reference are generally only of historical interest and should not be considered reliable for present use.&lt;ref name=IF&gt;See the pop-up "Help with searching" at {{cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp |title=''Index Fungorum'' home page|work=Index Fungorum|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2016-10-25}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/ |title=''Species Fungorum'' home page|work=Species Fungorum |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Kew |accessdate=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs)==
''Index Fungorum'' provides [[LSID|Life Science Identifiers (LSIDs)]] for records in its database.

==Services==
''Index Fungorum'' provides a [[SOAP]] protocol [[web service]] for searching its database and retrieving records. A [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]] file describing the services is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/IXFWebService/Fungus.asmx|title=Fungus Web Service|website=www.indexfungorum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kettle Bottom''''' is a collection of historical poems published in 2004 by [[Perugia Press]] in Florence, Massachusetts and written by [[Diane Gilliam Fisher]]. The collection's deep focus is on the West Virginia labor battles of 1920 and 1921, such as the [[Battle of Matewan]] and [[Battle of Blair Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Diane. Kettle Bottom. Florence, Massachusetts: Perugia Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kettle Bottom'' was named Top Ten Poetry Book for 2005 by American Booksellers Association Book Sense, was winner of the Ohioana Library Association Poetry Book of the Year, was a finalist for the Weatherford Award of the Appalachian Studies Association, and selected for inclusion in [[The Pushcart Prize]] XXX: Best of the Small Presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perugiapress.com/books2004_kettle.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118114434/http://www.perugiapress.com/books2004_kettle.html |archivedate=2009-11-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author's Note ==
In the Author's Note at the beginning of ''Kettle Bottom'', Fisher explains the cause of the conflict between the West Virginia miners and the company owners and operators: "Subsistence wages, the unwillingness of coal operators to slow production for safety reasons, their intransigence with regard to the rights of the miners to organize—these conditions made enemies of the miners and the operators. The situation was aggravated by the organization of life in the camps, which the companies controlled in every respect. Housing was owned by the company; trade was often limited to company-owned stores; the company brought in the doctor, often built the school and brought in the teacher, built the church and supplied the preacher."&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Diane. ''Kettle Bottom''. Florence, Massachusetts: Perugia Press, 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
''Kettle Bottom'' consists of 50 poems, which are divided into three sections: I. Summer ~ Fall, II. Raven Light, and III. Winter ~ Summer. The collection is structured to read as a narrative; the poems written chronologically into one coherent, suspenseful plot.  "Raven's Light," the only poem in the collection's middle section and the longest poem of all the sections, divides the plot between the time before the miners' rebellion (section I, Summer and Fall) and the time after the miners' rebellion (section III, Winter and Summer).

== Language ==
Diane Gilliam Fisher shows a mastery of language in this collection. One of the strongest literary devices she employs in her poems is an acute sense of dialect and voice, which not only matches time and place (early 1920s in West Virginia), but also character. Her collection is crafted using [[persona]] poems. Each is written specifically from one individual's or character's perspective, although the individual who is a particular poem's narrator varies significantly throughout the collection. This unique ability to go outside herself to capture the personalities and viewpoints of others is shown immediately in Diane Gilliam Fisher's opening poem of ''Kettle Bottom'':

Explosion at Winco No. 9

Delsey Salyer knowed Tom Junior by his toes,

which his steel-toed boots had kept the fire off of.

Betty Rose seen a piece of Willy's ear, the little

notched part where a hound had bit him

when he was a young'un, playing at eating its food.

It is true that it is the men that goes in, but it is us 

that carries the mine inside. It is us that listens 

to what all they are scared of and takes

the weight of it from them, like handing off 

a sack of meal. Us that learns by heart

birthmarks, scars, bends of fingers,

how the teeth set crooked or straight.

Us that picks up the pieces.

::::::I didn't have

nothing to patch with but my old blue dress,

and Ted didn't want flowered goods

on his shirt. I told him, ''It's just under your arm,

Ted, it ain't going to show.''

::::::They brung out bodies,

you couldn't tell. I seen a piece of my old blue dress

on one of them bodies, blacked with smoke,

but I could tell it was my patch, up under the arm.

When the man writing in the big black book

come around asking about identifying marks,

I said, ''blue dress''. I told him, ''Maude Stanley, 23''.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Diane. Kettle Bottom. Florence, Massachusetts: Perugia Press, 2004, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theme ==
The powerful message that ''Kettle Bottom'' conveys to its readers is a realization of the horrific history of labor in America and the corruption that circulated during this time, causing dangerous work conditions and inhumane treatment of workers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valpo.edu/vpr/murphyreviewfisher.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
The characters of Diane Gilliam Fisher's poems range from the children, wives, and family of the coal miners, the immigrant works, the company owners and operators, to the news reporters who were brought in to report on the rebellion. One of the most compelling [[persona]] poems in the collection tells the life story of an Italian immigrant who came to America with the dream of becoming an expert stonecutter and architect:

David

At home, in Carrara, Papa he is ''mastro''

''di tagliapietra'', master stonecutter, maker

of beautiful buildings and bridges. Rich men

they knock on our door, asking ''licenza''

to enter our house, to talk with Papa

about a portico, or a piazza.

Papa he love the stone.

He takes me to see the David, for what

is Michelangelo, he tells me, if not a stonecutter.

''La differenza'', he says, is that when Papa

sees a stone he sees inside it the face

of a beautiful building. Michelangelo

he sees a beautiful man.

Then he cuts away from the stone

everything that is not David.

Papa wants to come here because America

is a land of beautiful buildings still

hiding in their stones. He believes

be can uncover those buildings,

''scoprire la belleza nascosta nella pietra''.

When we arrive, he tells the men
with the books -- ''roccia, pietra''—and he makes

the motion of hitting the stone. They point

to a train. When the train stops, they give Papa

not a chisel, but a shovel. He shakes his head, ''no'', 

''no'', ''no''—but already we owe for the train. 

Papa tries to pay, he goes every day

into the mountain, into the stone. It seals

him in. ''Sealed in'', the men from the company

they tell Mamma the roof it fell, they are sorry.

No survivors, too dangerous to try to bring

the bodies out. The rich men here, they see nothing

in the stone but money. ''Non c'e nessuno che vede''

''ill mio papa e gli altri nella pietra''. No Michelangelo

here to cut the stone away from the beautiful men.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Diane. Kettle Bottom. Florence, Massachusetts: Perugia Press, 2004, p. 82-83&lt;/ref&gt; 

By using [[persona]] characters such as the Italian immigrant in ''David'', Diane Gilliam Fisher conveys in ''Kettle Bottom'' the emotional truth of West Virginia's coal mining history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwcc.edu/info/newsarchive/news040706.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''law school''' (also known as a '''law centre''' or '''college of law''') is an institution specializing in [[legal education]], usually involved as part of a process for becoming a [[lawyer]] within a given jurisdiction.
{{TOC limit|limit=4}}

== Law degrees ==

=== Australia ===
To practice in Australia, one needs to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), or Diploma-in-Law issued by the Legal Profession Admission Board, followed by an internship for 12 months or an extra course in practical legal training (PLT) depending on the jurisdiction and university, and be admitted as a lawyer of one of a state's Supreme Court.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil the legal education begins between 1827/28 in Olinda/PE and São Paulo/SP where the first Schools of Law were established by the new Empire using as educational model the Coimbra Faculty of Law.

Nowadays the legal education consists in a 5-year-long course in which, afterwards, the scholar is granted a bachelor´s degree.&lt;ref&gt;portal.mec.gov.br/cne/arquivos/pdf/rces09_04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is considered part of the higher education, hence the educational system is regulated as: i) basic education - primary, middle and high school; and ii) higher education: licentiate, bachelor and vocational ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/educacao/2014/05/saiba-como-e-a-divisao-do-sistema-de-educacao-brasileiro/view|title=Saiba como é a divisão do sistema de educação brasileiro|first=Portal|last=Brasil|website=Governo do Brasil|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173640/http://www.brasil.gov.br/educacao/2014/05/saiba-como-e-a-divisao-do-sistema-de-educacao-brasileiro/view|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of law is conditioned upon admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - OAB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oab.org.br/|title=OAB - Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - Conselho Federal|author=|date=|website=oab.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Public attorneys, public prossecutors and magistrates (judges) admission is made, mainly, through an entrance examination and a constitutional mandatory three years of legal experience. Starting from the second degree courts it is mandatory a 1/5 of its composition to be fulfilled with members of the lawyers/attorneys/barristers association and also from federal/state/labour processcutors (ministério público) regarding the court jurisdiction (it is not applied for electoral and military courts).

After achieving the bachelor´s degree of laws it is possible to follow an i) specialization or follow ii) academically (or both), in either case it is called postgraduation: i) lato sensu; or ii) stricto sensu; respectively.

The postgraduation, stricto sensu, consists in a: a) master´s degree, which is usually a two-year degree; and a b) doctorate´s degree, which can take up another four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capes.gov.br/avaliacao/sobre-a-avaliacao/legislacao-especifica|title=Legislação específica|first=Coordenação de Comunicação Social da|last=Capes|website=www.capes.gov.br|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504090933/http://www.capes.gov.br/avaliacao/sobre-a-avaliacao/legislacao-especifica|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond first year and the minimum requirements for graduation, course selection is elective with various concentrations such as business law, international law, natural resources law, criminal law, Aboriginal law, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian law school concentrations, certificates and joint-degree programs {{cite web |url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Law-Schools/Bachelor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510120805/http://www.canadian-universities.net/Law-Schools/Bachelor.html |archivedate=2017-05-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools, however, have not switched from LL.B. to the J.D. – one notable university that still awards the LL.B is McGill University.

Given that the Canadian legal system includes both the French civil law and the Anglo-American common law, some law schools offer both an LL.B. or J.D. (common law) and a B.C.L., LL.L. or LL.B. (civil law) degree, such as [[McGill University]], [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[Université de Montréal]]. In particular, [[McGill University Faculty of Law]] offers a combined civil law and common law program, which has been called "transsystemic."&lt;ref&gt;Where Law and Pedagogy Meet in the Transsystemic Contracts Classroom {{cite web |url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723233130/http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}. Accessed April 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At other faculties, if a person completes a common law degree, then a civil law degree can be obtained with only an extra year of study. This is also true for civil law graduates who wish to complete a common law degree.

Despite changes in designation, schools opting for the J.D. have not altered their curricula. Neither the J.D. or LL.B. alone is sufficient to qualify for a Canadian license, as each Province's law society requires an apprenticeship and successful completion of provincial skills and responsibilities training course, such as the British Columbia Law Society's Professional Legal Training Course,&lt;ref&gt;Law Society of British Columbia PLTC {{cite web |url=http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/licensing_membership/pltc/intro.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118195103/http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/licensing_membership/pltc/intro.html |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Law Society of Upper Canada's Skills and Responsibilities Training Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocesslawyer/sitemap.jsp|title=Law Society of Upper Canada Law Licensing Process|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110054838/http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocesslawyer/sitemap.jsp|archivedate=2009-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bar of Quebec|École du Barreau du Québec]].

The main reason for implementing the J.D. in Canada was to distinguish the degree from the European counterpart that requires no previous post-secondary education,&lt;ref&gt;University of British Columbia Board of Governors approves request for LL.B to be renamed J.D. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080404181432/http://www.law.ubc.ca/news/2008/march/03_18_2008_LLB-JD.html].&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the eyes of the Canadian educational system, the J.D. awarded by Canadian universities has retained the characteristics of the LL.B. and is considered a second entry program, but not a graduate program.&lt;ref&gt;University of Toronto.

=== England and English common law countries ===
{{Main|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}

=== Finland ===
Law school is usually entered to at the undergraduate level in a university. There is an intermediate bachelor's degree (''oikeusnotaari''), but the target is the master's degree in law (''oikeustieteen maisteri''; until 2005 ''oikeustieteen kandidaatti''). Once university education is complete, the title of ''[[varatuomari]]'' (VT) is obtained with an one-year [[externship]] in a district court. This is the basic qualification to practice law. With further experience, the candidate may be admitted to the Finnish Bar Association and licensed with the legally protected title ''[[Advokat|asianajaja]]'', similar to [[barrister]].

===France===
In France, the legal education is a three tier system. The student may study for a LLB (''licence de droit''), then a LLM (''master de droit'') and, for those interested in Law theory, a PhD in Law (''doctorat de droit'').

Many [[universities in France|French universities]] offers Law courses in department labelled as Research and Education Units (''unité de formation et de recherche'') and/or Faculties of Law or Law Schools.

A LLM-level is a prerequisite for some legal professions, but is combined with vocational education, such as the [[école nationale de la magistrature]] for judges and the ''Certificat d'aptitude aux fonctions d'avocat'' for [[advocate]]s.

===Indonesia===
Law Degree in Indonesia consists of three tier systems. The first tier is the Degree of which carries the title of Sarjana Hukum/S.H. (Bachelor of Law). This can be obtained in 4–7 years after they enter Law School straight from Senior High School.

The second tier varies depending on the legal specialties taken after the first tier. The general title for this tier is Magister Hukum / M.H. (Master in Law). Although it is also common to see other title for secondary tier such as Magister Kenotariatan / M.Kn. (Master in Notary) for Notarial professionals line of work. The second tier can be obtained normally in 1-2 year.

The third tier in Indonesian Law Degree is Doctor / DR. (Doctor in Law).

To work in legal professions of choice in Indonesia, a Bachelor Law Degree (S.H.) is obligatory. Graduates can pursue their career as Legal in-house counsel, Judge profession (requires admission and further training at Supreme Court Educational Center), Public Prosecutor (requires admission and further training at Public Prosecutor Educational and Training Center), other legal-related work and Advocate.

To become an Advocate, Law Graduate should attend an Advocate Special Course (1–2 months) and pass the Bar exam. The title Advocate can be obtained after a graduate passes the Bar exam and fulfill several obligation and requirements created by the Indonesian Advocates Association (PERADI), and is a prerequisite for practicing trial law in Indonesia.

[[Law degree]]s in India are granted and conferred in terms of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |title=Advocates Act, 1961 |publisher=Bar Council of India |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act, the [[Bar Council of India]] is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.

To this regard, the Bar Council of India prescribes the minimum curriculum required to be taught in order for an institution to be eligible for the grant of a law degree. The Bar Council also carries on a periodic supervision of the institutions conferring the degree and evaluates their teaching methodology and curriculum and having determined that the institution meets the required standards, recognizes the institution and the degree conferred by it.

Traditionally the degrees that were conferred carried the title of LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law). The eligibility requirement for these degrees was that the applicant already have a [[Bachelor's degree]] in any subject from a recognized institution. Thereafter the LL.B. / B.L. course was for three years, upon the successful completion of which the applicant was granted either degree.

However, upon the suggestion by the [[Law Commission of India]] and also given the prevailing cry for reform, the Bar Council of India instituted upon an [[National Law School of India University#Experiment in legal education|experiment]] in terms of establishing specialized law universities solely devoted to legal education and thus to raise the academic standards of legal profession in India. This decision was taken somewhere in 1985 and thereafter the first law University in India was set up in [[Bangalore]] which was named as the [[National Law School of India University]] (popularly 'NLS'). These law universities were meant to offer a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to legal education.  It was therefore for the first time that a law degree other than LL.B. or B.L. was granted in India. [[National Law School of India University|NLS]] offered a five-year law course, upon the successful completion of which an integrated degree with the title of "B.A.,LL.B. (Honours)" would be granted.

Thereafter, [[Autonomous Law Schools in India|other law universities]] were set up, all offering five-year integrated law degrees with different nomenclature. The next in line was [[National Law Institute University]] set up in [[Bhopal]] in 1997. It was followed by NALSAR university of law in 1998. The [[Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University]] in [[Delhi]] offered a five-year integrated law degree course of LL.B (Honours) from 1998 and subsequently from 2007 started to award the B.A.,LL.B / B.B.A.LL.B (Honours). The Mysore University School of Justice set up by the [[University of Mysore]] in [[Mysore]] offered a five-year integrated law degree course of B.A.,LL.B (Honours) from 2007. The course for three years LL.B. is also regularized in [[University of Delhi]] as an option for post graduation after the completion of graduation degree. The [[National Law University, Jodhpur]] offered for the first time in 2001 the integrated law degree of "B.B.A, LL.B. (Honours)" which was preceded by the [[West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences]] offering the "B.Sc., LL.B. (Honours)" degree. [[Gujarat National Law University]] established in [[Gandhinagar]] also offers LL.B.

However, despite these [[Autonomous Law Schools in India|specialized law universities]], the traditional three-year degree continues to be offered in India by other institutions and are equally recognized as eligible qualifications for practicing law in India. Another essential difference that remains is that while the eligibility qualification for the three year law degree is that the applicant must already be a holder of a bachelor's degree, for being eligible for the five years integrated law degree, the applicant must have successfully completed Class XII from a recognized [[Boards of Education in India]].

Both the holders of the three-year degree and of the five-year integrated degree are eligible for enrollment with the Bar Council of India upon the fulfillment of eligibility conditions and upon enrollment, may appear before any court in India.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;''Major Legal Systems in the World Today: An Introduction to the Comparative Study of Law'', by René David, John E.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Legal system of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], which generally follows the English common law system, an undergraduate L.L.B. is common, followed by a one or two year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] before one can begin a [[training contract]] (solicitors) or a [[pupillage]] (barristers).

=== Iran ===
In Iran, the legal education has been influenced both by civil law and Islamic Shari'ah law. Like many countries, after high school, one can enter the law school. The first law degree is LL.B. It takes about four years to get LL.B. The first graduate program in law is LL.M. It takes about two to three years to earn an LL.M. The LL.M. is a mix of course work in a specific field of law and a dissertation. The Ph.D. in law is the highest law degree offered by some law schools. It takes about 5–7 years depending on the school as well as the students.

=== Philippines ===
{{main|Legal education in the Philippines}}
Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the [[Philippines]]. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination for practicing lawyers in the country. The bar examination is administered by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] during the month of September every year.

As of 2011 the bar examinations were held during November.

The '''[[University of Santo Tomas]] '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]]''' was the first secular faculty, and hence the oldest law school in the Philippines.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, the primary route for obtaining a legal education to qualify as a practicing lawyer is via a 4-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from either the [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]], or the [[Singapore Management University School of Law]]. A third law school affiliated to the [[Singapore University of Social Sciences]] will commence its first intake in 2017, aimed primarily at producing law graduates focused on family, criminal and community justice law, as there is a pressing need for lawyers practicing in these areas.

Additionally, the SMU School of Law offers the 3-year [[Juris Doctor]] degree for aspiring candidates who have already completed a prior undergraduate course of study and who have been award a bachelor's degree in another field. The SMU J.D. is recognised for qualification to the Singapore Bar.

There are several private law schools in Singapore that are run by private education providers and which also award the Bachelor of Laws degree. These private law schools are neither recognised nor supported by the government and their graduates are, in the vast majority of cases, ineligible for qualification to the [[Admission to practice law#Singapore|Singapore Bar]].

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]] to practice law, one must be admitted and enrolled as an [[Attorneys in Sri Lanka|Attorney-at-Law]] of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]]. This is achieved by passing law exams at the [[Sri Lanka Law College]], which are administered by the Council of Legal Education and spending a period of six months under a practicing attorney of at least 8 years standing. To undertake law exams students must gain admission to the Sri Lanka Law College and study law or directly undertake exams after gaining a [[LL.B.]] from a local or foreign university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm#Admission%20to%20the%20profession|title=SRI LANKA LAW COLLEGE|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829230440/http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm#Admission%20to%20the%20profession|archivedate=2010-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
{{Main|List of law schools in Taiwan}}

In Taiwan, law is primarily studied as an undergraduate program resulting in a Bachelor of Law (B.L.).&lt;ref name="Lo"&gt;Chang-fa Lo, ''Driving an Ox Cart to Catch Up With the Space Shuttle: The Need For and Prospects of Legal Education Reform in Taiwan'', 24 Wis. Int'l L.J. 41 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Students receive academic rather than practical training.&lt;ref name="Lo" /&gt;  Practical training is arranged after the individual passes the lawyer, judge, or prosecutor exams.

A degree in law (bachelor, master or doctor) is a pre-requisite for Taiwan's bar examination. According to Ministry of Examination figures, the pass rate for the 2011 exam was 10.6%.  Since the bar exam is conducted in Chinese, a native level of language fluency is expected.

A non-citizen may take the Attorney Qualification Examination.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=I0020006|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database and The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Articles 5 and 20 of the Regulations on Attorney Qualification Examination (Bar Exam), non-citizens are allowed to participate in the bar examination with a degree in law earned in Taiwan.  Non-citizens are not allowed to sit in the prosecutor or judge examinations unless they are naturalized citizens of Taiwan.  Once a non-citizen is approved to practice law in Taiwan, he or she must abide by all statutes related to the legal practice, Codes of Legal Ethics, and the Articles of Incorporation of the Bar Association to which they are members.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

An unpublished table produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced lawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations.&lt;ref name="Tableau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary|title=Who's Got the Biggest Salary?|date=30 July 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095404/http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BLS data also suggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other occupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the last decade.
 
However, not all recent law graduates work as lawyers.  According to Simkovic and McIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents with law degrees do not practice law.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt;   Law graduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business and government.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt; The National Association for Legal Career Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of recent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of graduation.  Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although from 2009 to 2011, the numbers have been lower, at around 86 to 88 percent.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nalp.org/0712research|title=NALP - National Association for Law Placement - Class of 2011 Has Lowest Employment Rate Since Class of 1994|website=www.nalp.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413114301/http://www.nalp.org/0712research|archivedate=2015-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in non-professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  Approximately 75 to 85 percent work in jobs classified by NALP as "JD required" or "JD preferred", and another 5 percent work in other professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  However, a law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not practice law.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt;

==Postgraduate and professional study==
Some schools offer a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program as a way of specializing in a particular area of law. A further possible degree is the academic [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] in law of [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Juridical Science]] (S.J.D.) (in the U.S or Canada)., or the Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) in Canada or the UK, or the Ph.D. in Law from European or Australasian universities.

In addition to attending law school, many jurisdictions require law school graduates to pass a state or provincial [[bar examination]] before they may practice law. The [[Multistate Bar Examination]] is part of the bar examination in almost all United States jurisdictions. Generally, the standardized, [[common law]] subject matter of the MBE is combined with state-specific [[Essay#Academic essays|essay questions]] to produce a comprehensive bar examination.

In other common law countries the bar exam is often replaced by a period of work with a law firm known as articles of clerkship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Alternative legal education systems ==

===UK and Europe===
While law schools in the U.S. and Canada are typically [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] institutions with considerable autonomy, legal education in other countries is provided within the mainstream educational system from university level and/or in non-degree conferring vocational training institutions.

In countries such as the United Kingdom and most of continental Europe, academic legal education is provided within the mainstream university system starting at the [[undergraduate]] level, and the legal departments of universities are simply departments like any other rather than separate "law schools". In these countries, the term "law school" may be used, but it does not have the same definition as it does in North America. The same is true for private Law Schools, e.g. in Germany two private law schools have been established, [[Bucerius Law School]] in Hamburg and EBS Law School in Wiesbaden which are termed law schools but follow the usual German path of legal education.

There are also sometimes legal colleges that provide vocational training as a post-academic stage of legal education. One example is the [[The University of Law|University of Law]] in the United Kingdom, which provides certain professional qualifications  lawyers in England and Wales must obtain before they may practice as solicitors or barristers.

===Australia===
In Australia, law schools such as the [[Melbourne Law School]], the [[Adelaide Law School]], and the [[Sydney Law School]] have emphasised a combination of the British and American systems. However, other universities such as the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and Monash University are known for their practical work.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the practical training in Australian law schools see Margaret Castles and Anne Hewitt 'Can a law school help develop skilled legal professionals' (2011) ALTERNATIVE LAW JOURNAL; 36 (2) 2011: 90–95. {{cite web |url=http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/17-can-a-law-school-help-develop-skilled-legal-professionals-situational-learning-to-the-rescue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082656/http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/17-can-a-law-school-help-develop-skilled-legal-professionals-situational-learning-to-the-rescue |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a '''local administrative unit (LAU)''' is a low level [[administrative division]] of a country, ranked below a [[province]], [[region]], or [[State (administrative division)|state]].  Not all countries describe their locally governed areas this way, but it can be descriptively applied anywhere to refer to counties, municipalities, etc.

In the [[European Union]], LAUs are basic components of [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) regions. For each [[Member of the European Union|EU member country]], two levels of Local Administrative Units (LAU) are defined: LAU 1 and LAU 2, which were previously called NUTS 4 and NUTS 5 respectively, until the NUTS regulation went into force in July 2003. For some countries, the LAU 1 level is not defined, and thus equivalent to the NUTS 3 level. A similar statistical system is defined for the [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Recognised candidates|candidate countries]] and members of the [[European Free Trade Association]].

'''Media ethics''' is the subdivision of [[applied ethics]] dealing with the specific ethical principles and standards of [[mass media|media]], including [[broadcast media]], [[film]], [[theatre]], the [[arts]], [[print media]] and the internet. The field covers many varied and highly controversial topics, ranging from [[War correspondent|war journalism]] to [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] ad campaigns.

Media ethics involves promoting and defending values such as a universal respect for life and  the rule of law and legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moldovan|first=Gratian|date=|title=Media Ethics in the Ideological Context of the Twentieth Century|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=b975b2a4-ca3c-4480-9425-5f5ed6a3ec10%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice|volume=6|pages=589–593|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature regarding the ways in which specifically the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online is scarce, thereby complicating the idea for a universal code of media ethics.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deuze I, Yeshua II|first=Mark I, Daphna II|date=December 2001|title=Online Journalists Face New Ethical Dilemmas: Lessons From The Netherlands|url=|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|volume=16|pages=273–292|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Media Ethics ==
Research and publications in the field of information ethics has been produced since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Thomas|date=December 2004|title=A Brief History of Information Ethics|url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm|journal=Universitat de Barcelona. Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable figures include and Robert Hauptman (who focused his work specifically on censorship, privacy, access to information, balance in collection development, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics), [[Rafael Capurro]], Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim (who wrote the article "''“Ethics in Information Science”'' , discussing issues as confidentiality of information, bias in information provided to clients or consumers, the quality of data supplied by online vendors, etc).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the term "information ethics" began to be explored by various Computer Science and Information departments in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, textbooks such as Richard Severson's ''The Principles of Information Ethics'' and Marsha Cook Woodbury's ''Computer and Information Ethics'', and Deborah G. Johnson's ''Computer Ethics'' were published.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Areas of Media Ethics ==

Media ethics:  Issues of moral principles and values as applied to the conduct, roles, and *content of the mass media, in particular [[journalism ethics and standards]] and [[marketing ethics]];  also the field of study concerned with this topic. In relation to news coverage it includes issues such as [[impartiality]], [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], [[wikt:balance|balance]], [[bias]], privacy, and the [[public interest]]. More generally, it also includes [[stereotyping]], taste and decency, [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], advertising practices such as [[product placement]], and legal issues such as [[defamation]]. On an institutional level it includes debates over [[media ownership]] and control, [[commercialization]], accountability, the relation of the media to the political system, issues arising from regulation (e.g. [[censorship]]) and [[deregulation]].

=== Ethics of journalism ===
{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}
[[Image:Starlette.jpg|thumb|Photographers crowd around a starlet at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]

The ethics of journalism is one of the most well-defined branches of media ethics, primarily because it is frequently taught in
[[journalism schools|schools of journalism]]. Journalistic ethics tend to dominate media ethics, sometimes almost to the exclusion of other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515000000*/http://smi.curtin.edu.au/netstudies/docs/allen/AllenNCW2001.doc|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics covered by journalism ethics include:
* News manipulation. News can manipulate and be manipulated. Governments and corporations may attempt to manipulate news media; governments, for example, by [[censorship]], and corporations by share ownership. The methods of manipulation are subtle and many. Manipulation may be voluntary or involuntary. Those being manipulated may not be aware of this. See: [[news propaganda]].
* [[Truth]]. Truth may conflict with many other values.
** Public interest. Revelation of military secrets and other sensitive government information may be contrary to the [[public interest]], even if it is true. However, [[public interest]] is not a term which is easy to define.
** Privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. [[Privacy]] is also a [[rights|right]], and one which conflicts with [[free speech]]. See: [[paparazzi]].
** Fantasy. Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Journalism may mix fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. See: [[National Enquirer]], [[Jayson Blair]] scandal, [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy]].
** Taste. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audience's sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth. See [[photojournalism]].
* Conflict with the law. Journalistic ethics may conflict with the law over issues such as the protection of confidential [[news source]]s. There is also the question of the extent to which it is ethically acceptable to break the law in order to obtain news. For example, undercover reporters may be engaging in [[deception]], [[trespass]] and similar [[torts]] and crimes. See [[undercover journalism]], [[investigative journalism]].

=== Online Journalism ===
The Internet has shaped and redefined various ethical and moral issues for both online journalists and journalists  utilizing online resources.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

While some journalists continue to adhere to ethical principles of traditional journalism, many journalists believe that with the absence of a mutually agreed upon code of ethics specifically pertaining to internet ethics, and lack of literature dealing specifically with the ways in which the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online, the online environment poses new threats to the profession.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Core Issues of Media Ethics in Online Journalism ====
Some of the core issues of media ethics in online journalism include commercial pressures, accuracy and credibility (which include he issues dealing with hyperlinks), verification of facts, regulation, privacy, and news-gathering methods.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethics of entertainment media ===
Issues in the ethics of entertainment media include:
* The depiction of violence and sex, and the presence of [[strong language]]. Ethical guidelines and legislation in this area are common and many media (e.g. film, computer games) are subject to ratings systems and supervision by agencies. An extensive guide to international systems of enforcement can be found under [[motion picture rating system]].
* “Fluff or “Celebrity News”: Over the years, print media has been dying out so journalists began to report on what is referred to as “Celebrity News”, or “Fluff.” As more outlets adopt this topic to report on, people become dependent on them. According to Alden Weight, most people know not to completely trust these outlets due to ethical discrepancies, but the issue arises when people who are not as mature or educated find these reports to be completely true.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weight|first=Alden|date=Spring 2011|title=Making A Monkey Look Good: The Case For Consumer Ethics of Entertainment Media|url=|journal=Teaching Ethics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV check inline}}
* [[Product placement]]. An increasingly common [[marketing]] tactic is the placement of products in entertainment media. The producers of such media may be paid high sums to display branded products. The practice is controversial and largely unregulated. Detailed article: [[product placement]].
* Advertising: Attraction and persuasion are currently found in modern journalism. It is found that these methods of advertising may alter an audience’s point of view of what is realistic and falsified information.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypes]]. Both advertising and entertainment media make heavy use of [[stereotypes]]. Stereotypes may negatively affect people's perceptions of themselves or promote socially undesirable behavior. The stereotypical portrayals of [[men]], [[affluence]] and [[ethnic groups]] are examples of major areas of debate
***Women in Media: Entertainment media often exploits female bodies by objectifying and de-humanizing them. By doing so, the concept of female bodies being bought and sold becomes common.
***Media outlets usually use either images or imagery of female bodies to counter negative news that is provided throughout the day.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* Taste and [[taboos]]. Entertainment media often questions of our [[values]] for artistic and entertainment purposes. [[Normative ethics]] is often about moral values, and what kinds should be enforced and protected. In media ethics, these two sides come into conflict. In the name of art, media may deliberately attempt to break with existing norms and shock the audience. That poses ethical problems when the norms abandoned are closely associated with certain relevant moral values or obligations.  The extent to which this is acceptable is always a hotbed of ethical controversy. See: [[Turner Prize]], [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], [[aesthetics]].

=== Media and democracy ===
In democratic countries, a special relationship exists between media and government. Although the freedom of the media may be [[constitution]]ally enshrined and have precise legal definition and enforcement, the exercise of that freedom by individual journalists is a matter of personal choice and ethics.
Modern democratic government subsists in [[Representation (politics)|representation]] of millions by hundreds. For the representatives to be [[accountability|accountable]], and for the process of government to be [[transparency (humanities)|transparent]], effective communication paths must exist to their [[Electoral district|constituents]]. Today these paths consist primarily of the mass media, to the extent that if [[press freedom]] disappeared, so would most political [[accountability]].
In this area, media ethics merges with issues of [[civil rights]] and [[politics]]. Issues include: 
* Subversion of [[media independence]] by financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/media-and-democracy Media and Democracy], [[The Nation]] (Editorial), December 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Government monitoring of media for intelligence gathering against its own people. See, for example, [[NSA call database]].
See: [[freedom of information]], [[media transparency]] [[Right to Information]].

=== Media integrity ===
Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the [[public interest]] and [[democratic process]], making it resilient to institutional [[corruption]] within the media system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.lessig.org/Institutional_Corruption|title = Institutional Corruption|last = Lessig|first = Lawrence|website = wiki.lessig.org|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet: 
* [[Editorial independence|independence]] from private or political interests
* [[Media transparency|transparency]] about own financial interests
* commitment to [[journalism ethics and standards]]
* responsiveness to citizens

The concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of [[Southeast Europe|South East Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_FINAL.pdf|title = Media Integrity Matters: Reclaiming Public Service Values in Media and Journalism: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia|last =|first =|publisher = Peace Institute|year = 2014|isbn =|editor-last = Petković|editor-first = Brankica|location = Ljubljana|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the project [http://mediaobservatory.net/about South East European Media Observatory], gathering organisations which are part of the [http://seenpm.org/about-us/ South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM)].

== Attempts to Develop a Universal Code of Media Ethics ==
Within the last two decades, numerous regional discussions have taken place in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in order to create a universal code of ethics for the information society.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capurro; Britz|first=Rafael; Johannes B.|date=2010|title=In Search of a Code of Global Information Ethics: The Road Travelled and New Horizons|url=http://www.communicationethics.net/journal/v7n2-3/v7n2-3_feat2.pdf|journal=Ethical Space: The International Journal of Communication Ethics|volume=7|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core issues in developing a universal code for media ethics is the difficulty of finding a common ground between ethical principles from one culture to another.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Also, such codes may be interpreted differently according to various moral and legal standards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== UNESCO INFOethics Congresses ===
The ethical facet of the global information society has been on the [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) agenda since 1997, when the organization initiated their first INFOethics Congress.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The objective of this summit was to spark debate on the ethical dimension of the global information society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The UNESCO INFOethics Congresses then met in 1998 and 2000, where specialists coming from a wide range of educational, scientific, and cultural environments addressed the ethical dimensions of global media and information.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== International Symposium on Information Ethics, Karlsuhe, 2004 ===
In 2004, the ICIE, or International Center for Information Ethics, organized the firs international symposium on information ethics in [[Karlsruhe|Karlsuhe, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Experts with varying scientific backgrounds such as computer science, [[information science]], [[media studies]], and economics, gathered from all over the world to discuss the internet from both an ethical and intercultural perspective.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Contexts of media ethics ==

=== Media ethics and the laws ===

=== Media ethics and media economics ===
Media economics where things such as -- [[deregulation]] of media, [[concentration of media ownership]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations in the U.S, media [[trade unions]] and labor issues, and other such worldwide regulating bodies, [[Citizen journalism|citizen media]] ([[Low-power broadcasting|low power FM]], [[community radio]]) -- have ethical implications......

=== Media ethics and public officials ===
The [[mass media|media]] has manipulated the way public officials conduct themselves through the advancement of technology. Constant television coverage displays the legislative proceedings; exposing faster than ever before, unjust rulings throughout the government process. [[Truth]] telling is crucial in media ethics as any opposition of [[truth]] telling is considered [[deception]]. Anything shown by the media whether print or video is considered to be original. When a statement is written in an article or a video is shown of a public official, it is the original “truthful” words of the individual official themselves.

=== Intercultural dimensions of media ethics ===
If values differ interculturally, the issue arises of the extent to which behaviour should be modified in the light of the values of specific cultures. Two examples of controversy from the field of media ethics:
* [[Google China|Google's self-censorship in China]].
* The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark, and subsequently worldwide.

== Meta-issues in media ethics ==
One theoretical question for media ethics is the extent to which media ethics is just another topical subdivision of [[applied ethics]], differing only in terms of case applications and raising no theoretical issues peculiar to itself. The oldest subdivisions of applied ethics are [[medical ethics]] and [[business ethics]]. Does media ethics have anything new to add other than interesting cases?

===Similarities between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===

[[Privacy]] and [[honesty]] are issues extensively covered in medical ethical literature, as is
the principle of harm-avoidance. The trade-offs between economic goals and social values has been
covered extensively in [[business ethics]] (as well as medical and [[environmental ethics]]).

===Differences between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===
The issues of [[freedom of speech]] and aesthetic values (taste) are primarily at home in media ethics. However a number of further issues distinguish media ethics as a field in its own right.

A theoretical issue peculiar to media ethics is the identity of ''observer'' and ''observed''. The press is one of the primary guardians in a democratic society of many of the freedoms, rights and duties discussed by other fields of applied ethics. In media ethics the ethical obligations of the guardians themselves comes more strongly into the foreground. Who guards the guardians? This question also arises in the field of [[legal ethics]].

A further self-referentiality or circular characteristic in media ethics is the questioning of its own values. Meta-issues can become identical with the subject matter of media ethics. This is most strongly seen when artistic elements are considered. [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisements and [[Turner prize]] candidates are both examples of ethically questionable media uses which question their own
questioner.

Another characteristic of media ethics is the disparate nature of its goals. Ethical dilemmas emerge when goals conflict. The goals of media usage diverge sharply. Expressed in a consequentialist manner, media usage may be subject to pressures to maximize: economic profits, entertainment value, information provision, the upholding of democratic freedoms, the development of art and culture, fame and vanity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6028">'''Metaphoric criticism''' is one school of [[rhetoric]]al analysis used in English and speech communication studies. Scholars employing metaphoric criticism analyze texts by locating metaphors within texts and evaluating those metaphors in an effort to better understand ways in which authors appeal to their audiences.

==Origins==
The term "metaphor" can be traced to the trope described by Aristotle in both his ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' as a comparison of two dissimilar objects or concepts in an effort to relate one to the other. James DeMille, in ''The Elements of Rhetoric'', defines metaphor as "an implied comparison between two things of unlike nature, for example, 'The colorful display was a magnet for anybody in the room.'"&lt;ref&gt;DeMille, James. (1878). "The Elements of Rhetoric." New York: Harper and Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt; Using DeMille’s example, a critic studying metaphor would explore how normally "display" and "magnet" are not considered synonyms. However, in using "magnet" as a metaphor, the above sentence implies that the "display" possess properties of a magnet and draws objects—or, in this case, people—in the room toward it.

In a broader sense, metaphoric criticism can illuminate the world in which we live by analyzing the language—and, in particular, the metaphors—that surround us. The notion that metaphors demonstrate worldviews originates in the work of [[Kenneth Burke]] and has been taken up further in the cognitive sciences, particularly by [[George Lakoff]].

==Application==
Metaphoric criticism focuses on analysis of texts that use metaphors effectively or ineffectively as part of their argument structure. For example, in an article entitled "Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor," George Lakoff and Evan Frisch analyze how President Bush’s adoption of a "war" metaphor in order to discuss his approach to dealing with terrorism as opposed to a "crime" metaphor provides a barrier from critics for him to move forward with the War in Iraq. Lakoff illustrates the power of the "war" metaphor: "The war metaphor defined war as the only way to defend the nation. From within the war metaphor, being against war as a response was to be unpatriotic, to be against defending the nation. The war metaphor put progressives on the defensive."&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Evan Frisch. (2006) "[http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 Five Years After 9/11: Drop the War Metaphor.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060927081227/http://www.rockridgeinstitute.org/research/rockridge/fiveyearsafter911 |date=2006-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;" Rhetorical critics would not only make these observations in their own criticism, but would also relate to the effect on the audience, and how the metaphor either enhances or challenges the audience’s worldview.

Critics examining metaphor have in recent years also started to examine metaphor in visual and electronic media. For example, metaphors can be found in rhetorical presidential television ads. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan’s campaign sponsored a commercial showing a grizzly bear as posing a potentially large threat to the United States. The USSR is never named in that ad, however the assumption of the campaign was that Americans would clearly recognize the "enemy" that the bear represents.

==Conduction==
In ''Rhetorical Criticism'',&lt;ref&gt;Foss, Sonja K. (1995). ''Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice.'' 2nd edition. Long Grove, IL: Waveland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonja K. Foss outlines a four-step procedure for applying metaphoric criticism to texts:

# First, the critic reads or views the entire artifact with specific attention to its context.
# Second, to the critic isolates the metaphor(s) within the text, both obvious and more subtle substitutions of meaning. Here Foss invokes Max Black's interaction theory of "tenor" (the principal subject or focus) and "vehicle" (secondary subject or frame for the metaphor), a method to analyze ways in which the related dissimilar objects actually share similar characteristics.
# Third, the critic sorts the metaphors and look for patterns of use within the text. The more comprehensive the text, the longer this step will take.
# The critic analyzes the metaphor(s) or groups of metaphors in the artifact to reveal how their structure may affect the intended audience. Foss writes, "Here, the critic suggests what effects the use of the various metaphors may have on the audience and how the metaphors function to argue for a particular attitude toward the ideas presented."

The '''''Millennium Star Atlas''''' was constructed as a collaboration between 
a team at ''[[Sky &amp; Telescope]]'' led by Roger Sinnott, and the European Space Agency's [[Hipparcos]] project, led by [[Michael Perryman]]. This 1997 work was the first [[uranography|sky atlas]] to include the ''Hipparcos'' and ''Tycho Catalogue'' data, extending earlier undertakings in terms of completeness and uniformity to a magnitude limit of around 10–11 [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]].  It appeared as a stand-alone publication,&lt;ref&gt;

and as three volumes of the 17-volume ''[[Hipparcos Catalogue]]''.

The 1548 charts include one million [[star]]s from the Hipparcos and Tycho-1 Catalogues, three times as many as in any previous all-sky atlas; more than 8000 [[Galaxy|galaxies]] with their orientation; outlines of many [[Bright nebula|bright]] and [[dark nebula]]e; the location of many [[Open cluster|open]] and [[globular cluster]]s; and some 250 of the brightest [[quasar]]s. The non-stellar objects in the atlas are identified by type and designation. The chart scale is 100 arcsec/mm, matching that at the focus of an 8-inch f/10 [[Schmidt-Cassegrain]]. Star magnitudes are essentially [[UBV photometric system|Johnson V]]. Distance labels are given for stars within 200 light-years of the Sun.
Proper motion arrows are given for stars with motions exceeding 0.2 arcsec/yr.  Variable stars are indicated by amplitude and variability type. Many thousands of already known and newly discovered
double stars are depicted with tick marks indicating separation and position angle.

Other major celestial atlases since 1997 have also incorporated the ''Hipparcos'' and ''Tycho Catalogue'' data.  These include ''Sky Atlas 2000.0'' (2nd edition to 8.5 mag),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Giotto di Bondone - Navicella - WGA09363.jpg|thumb|300px|The 1628 full-size copy in oil in the Vatican]]
[[File:Parri spinelli, copia della navicella di giotto, metropolitan museum.jpg|thumb|300px|Drawing of the lost mosaic by [[Parri Spinelli]], about 1420, once owned by [[Vasari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/90005191 Parri Spinelli, "Free Copy of Giotto's Navicella"], Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''''Navicella''''' (literally "little ship") of [[Old Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, was a large and famous [[mosaic]] by [[Giotto di Bondone]] that occupied a large part of the wall above the entrance arcade, facing the main facade of the basilica across the courtyard. It depicted the version from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (Matthew 14:24–32) of [[Jesus' walk on water|Christ walking on the water]], the only one of the three gospel accounts where [[Saint Peter]] is summoned to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts of the miracle appear in three Gospels: [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:22–33]], [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:45|Mark 6:45–52]] and [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#6:16|John 6:16–21]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was almost entirely destroyed during the construction of the new [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in the 17th century, but fragments were preserved from the sides of the composition, and what is effectively a new work, incorporating some original fragments, was restored to a position at the centre of the portico of the new building in 1675.&lt;ref&gt;"St Peter's"; Lubbock, 158; Tomei, 31; Nicholls, 162; [http://www.bridgemanart.com/asset/279736/Giotto-di-Bondone-c.1266-1337-after/The-Navicella-of-St.-Peter-mosaic-bw-photo?search_context={%22url%22%3A%22\%2Fsearch\%2Flocation\%2FSt.-Peter%27s-Vatican-City\%2F3734%22%2C%22num_results%22%3A17%2C%22search_type%22%3A%22location_assets%22%2C%22sort_order%22%3A%22asset_id%22%2C%22location_id%22%3A%223734%22%2C%22item_index%22%3A16} Present image], from Bridgeman Art Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The mosaic, designed to be seen from a distance, was extremely large. A full-scale copy in oil, commissioned by the Vatican from [[Francesco Berretta]] in 1628, after much of the work had already been lost round the edges, measures {{convert|7.4|x|9.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/html/g/giotto/zz_misc/y_mosaic/11navice.html WGA]&lt;/ref&gt; The full mosaic was probably about {{convert|9.4|x|13|m|ft}}, with an inscription in Latin verse running below the image.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The mosaic was commissioned in 1298 by [[Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi]], canon of St. Peter's, whose [[donor portrait]] was to the right of Christ's feet.&lt;ref&gt;Hösl, Ignaz, "Kardinal Jacobus Gaietani Stefaneschi: Ein Beitrag zur Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte des beginnenden vierzehnten Jahrhunderts," Berlin, 1908. &lt;/ref&gt; Giotto's mosaic therefore belonged to the preparations of St. Peters for the [[holy year]] in 1300. The date of the commission is attested by a document copied in the 17th century. There are no indications of a later dating, nor are there indications that Giotto's mosaic replaced an older one. &lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Stefaneschi's obituary of 1347, the work cost 2,200 [[florin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to an official document from 1298,&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Leben: mit einer Sammlung der Urkunden und Texte bis Vasari (Giottus Pictor I) Wien: Böhlau, 2004. Pg. 330-331.&lt;/ref&gt; references to the work as by Giotto are found in a Vatican [[necrology]] entry for Cardinal Stefaneschi recording his death in 1343, and then the Latin chronicle of Giotto's home city [[Florence]] written in the late 14th century by [[Filippo Villani]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 77&lt;/ref&gt;

It was rectangular, and positioned so that those leaving the basilica saw it across the courtyard outside the church, and passed under it if they left by the main route.&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 34; [http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lookandlearn-preview/M/M098/M098735.jpg Later print of the original location]&lt;/ref&gt;  A figure of a man fishing on the shore to the left was thought to be a self-portrait of Giotto, as [[Vasari]]'s ''Life'' records.  The composition was dominated by the fishing boat with its large sail, which represented a metaphor of the "Ship of the Church", whose "captain" on earth was Saint Peter and his successors as [[Pope]].&lt;ref&gt;St Peter's&lt;/ref&gt;  It was commissioned at a very difficult time for the Papacy, who were unable even to control the gangsterish nobility of Rome, and had therefore left the city, but the image promised that both church and Papacy were, with the help of Christ, "unsinkable".&lt;ref&gt;Calvesi, 36; Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the eleven figures still in the boat, it has been suggested that the one holding the [[tiller]] is (anachronistically in terms of the Gospels) [[Saint Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 164, reporting Köhren-Jansen, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; In the sky, two almost naked classical style "wind god" figures blow through horns or funnels, one from each side, below pairs of haloed male figures.&lt;!-- who? anyone? The 4 Evangelists? --&gt;  Giotto would have produced drawings for specialist mosaic workers to recreate on the wall; whether he had any further involvement as the work was created is unknown.

The subject is depicted elsewhere in [[medieval art]] of the period, and later works like [[fresco]]s in the "Spanish Chapel" of [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella#Spanish Chapel|Santa Maria Novella]] in Florence, and in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] by [[Masaccio]] (or perhaps his colleague [[Masolino]]), and one of the [[bronze]] relief panels on [[Ghiberti]]'s north doors of the [[Florence Baptistery]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, 158–160&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also used on Papal coins and medals, though usually with Peter in the boat, often as the only figure.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, 163; [http://www.coinarchives.com/w/results.php?search=Navicella&amp;s=0&amp;results=100 Examples from www.coinarchives.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the only modern (post-classical) work described in [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s ''[[De Pictura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 199; Lubbock, 158&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a large depiction of a maritime scene was unprecedented in [[marine art]], at least since classical times.

The arcade across the courtyard and its mosaic was at first unaffected by the protracted and complicated rebuilding of the main basilica, but in the 17th century the mosaic underwent a complicated series of four moves and restorations or remodellings in 1610, 1618, 1629 and 1674/75 which finally took it to its present size, condition and location above the main door inside the portico of the new church.&lt;ref&gt;See Kleinhenz 749, Capresi 36, Tomei, 31, though none give a coherent account of the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Only two bust-length figures of angels in [[roundel]]s survive from the original;&lt;ref&gt;Tomei, 31;  Moioli et al., 244&lt;/ref&gt; one remains in the Vatican, while the other was given to the church of San Pietro Ispano in [[Boville Ernica]] in 1610, when the mosaic was first removed from its original place. The former is considerably restored (in 1924, 1950 and 1975–80), and was discovered underneath later work in 1911 (or 1924). The Boville Ernica fragment consisted of little original substance and was completely restored between 1888 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Michael Viktor and Theis, Pia, Giottos Werke (Giottus Pictor II) Wien: Böhlau, 2008, Pg. 262-263.
[[File:Bilder-50617-15704-original.tif|thumb|Fragment in Boville Ernica, before restoration.]]
&lt;/ref&gt; Despite none of the copies of the original including these figures it is thought they were part of the original, probably in a border.&lt;ref&gt;Papacy, 6–7; Tomei, 31; Moioli et al., who give the date of discovery of the Vatican fragment as 1924, and the dates of subsequent work&lt;/ref&gt;  There are thought to be some patches of original work remaining in the mosaic still in St Peter's, which is now semi-circular with a straight bottom edge to fit into a [[lunette]]. Areas where original work seems to survive are in "the gilded edge of the ship, the sail blown by the wind, various sections of some apostles".&lt;ref&gt;Vatican&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
The style of the work can now only be judged from the two angel fragments, restored as they are. Vasari's description emphasized the varied reactions of the figures in the boat as they saw Peter sinking below the waves, and the patient expression on the face of the fisherman on the shore, who, like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]'s ploughman in ''[[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus]]'' seems to ignore the dramatic scene on the water in concentrating on his own task.  But, as [[Svetlana Alpers]] has shown, these were the terms in which Vasari tended to describe large [[history painting]]s he admired, though [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]]'s description in ''[[De pictura]]'' also "treats ...[the work] as a psychological narrative".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers, 190–192, 199 (quoted); Lubbock, 158 quotes from Alberti&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars, working from the fragments, emphasize the influence of the major Roman artist of the day, [[Pietro Cavallini]], who was also patronized by Cardinal Stefanesci, and of the Late Antique and Early Medieval works to be seen in Rome.  According to [[John White (art historian)|John White]]: "The relatively schematic, linear quality of much late-thirteenth- and early-fourteenth-century work is wholly absent.  The impressionistic technique and range of colour both derive from the fifth century. It is impossible to say how much this technique reflects the ideas of Giotto himself and how much those of the skilled mosaicists working under him. The two heads are, however, closely related both to the work of Cavallini, whose art still dominated the Roman scene, and to the basic type of physiognomy developed on the walls of the [[Arena Chapel]]."&lt;ref&gt;White, 332 (quoted); see also Calvesi, 40, and Paoletti &amp; Radke, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies==
There are a number of records of the original design in drawings and prints—at least 17 are recorded.  The earliest are a number of drawings attributed to the Florentine artist [[Parri Spinelli]] (c. 1387–1453), of which the most detailed is in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and others are in [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]] and [[Bayonne]]. However, the variations between these, and other drawings by Spinelli of surviving works, show that he was in the habit of making rather loose interpretations of works that he recorded in drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, no. 2 (New York); Dunbar, 104–110 (Cleveland)&lt;/ref&gt; Most later copies date from after parts of the mosaic were already lost, and none form a complete record of the full design. Some prints, like an [[engraving]] by [[Nicolas Beatrizet]] of about 1559, are reversed (mirror-image) copies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/24364447@N05/6559941119/ image on flickr] of the Beatrizet; [http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ Unreversed print of 1567] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130702063243/http://www2.printsanddrawings.hu/search/prints/8875/ |date=2013-07-02 }}, by Mario Labacco, from Budapest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gospel account==
Only in the account in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#14:22|Matthew 14:24–33]] does Peter also leave the boat to walk on the waves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
And he said, Come. And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to Jesus.
But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Vision of St Catherine of Siena==
On the evening of January 29, 1380, at the time of [[Vespers]], Saint [[Catherine of Siena]], who had been contemplating the mosaic for some hours, suddenly felt as if "the ship had fallen off and landed on her shoulders" with "unbearable weight".  She apparently never walked again, and died three months later.&lt;ref&gt;Papetros, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neurohydrodynamics''' is a division of [[neurophysics]] that focuses on the [[hydrodynamics]] of the neurological system.  It applies physical principles and design concepts to neurophysics seeking to close the gap between [[fluid mechanics]] and [[neurosurgical]] and [[neurological]] [[medicine]].  It combines fluid mechanics principles with neuroscience to improve neurological disorder healthcare [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], [[Medical monitor|monitoring]] and [[therapy]].

Neurohydrodynamics investigates the role of intracranial fluid hydrodynamics (e.g. [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[cerebral blood flow]], and [[interstitial fluid]]) in the [[pathophysiology]] of neurological disorders such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[Chiari malformation]], [[syringomyelia]], [[pseudotumor cerebri]], cerebral [[vasospasm]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[multiple sclerosis]] and cerebral [[aneurysm]].

Neurohydrodynamics is an emerging discipline within [[neurophysics]].  Such an evolution is common as a new field transitions from being an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] specialization among already-established fields, to being considered a field in itself. Much of the work in neurohydrodynamics consists of [[clinical research]] and [[in vitro]] or [[computational modeling]], spanning a broad array of subfields. Prominent neurohydrodynamic applications include the development of [[cerebral shunt]]s, [[lumbar-peritoneal shunt]]s, [[intrathecal pump]]s, [[neural drug delivery systems]] and various diagnostic and therapeutic [[medical device]]s ranging from clinical equipment to micro-implants.  Neurohydrodynamics relies heavily on [[neuroimaging]] modalities such as flow sensitized [[MRI]].

* [[Hans Chiari]] (September 4, 1851 − 1916) was an Austrian pathologist who described in 1891 a brain malformation that is characterized by abnormalities in the region where the brain and spinal cord meet, and it causes part of the cerebellum to protrude through the foramen magnum (bottom of the skull) into the spinal canal. This was to be called the Arnold-Chiari malformation, named after Chiari and German pathologist, Julius Arnold (1835 − 1915). The malformation was given its name in 1907 by two of Dr. Arnold's students.

[[File:Clippy-letter.PNG|frame|''Clippit'' (known as Clippy), the default assistant in Office 2000/XP/2003 (after the makeover). Clippit is asking if the user needs help.]]
The '''Office Assistant''' was an [[intelligent user interface]] for [[Microsoft Office]] that assisted users by way of an interactive animated character, which [[user interface|interfaced]] with the Office help content. It was included in [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office for Windows]] (versions 97 to 2003), in [[Microsoft Publisher]] and [[Microsoft Project]] (versions 98 to 2003), and [[Microsoft Office|Microsoft Office for Mac]] (versions 98 to 2004).

The default assistant in the English Windows version was named '''Clippit''' (commonly nicknamed '''Clippy'''), after a [[paperclip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/02/25/you_got_grammar/|title=Finding the grammar checker's frailties|first=Jan|last=Freeman|work=The Boston Globe|date=2007-02-25|accessdate=2007-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=designer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oddisgood.com/pages/cd-clippy.html |title=Clippy |website=Oddisgood.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was designed by Kevan J. Atteberry on a [[Macintosh]] computer.&lt;ref name=designer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyj55a/microsoft-clippy-creator-interview-kevin-atteberry|title=Clippy’s Designer Wants to Know Who Got Clippy Pregnant|date=2017-04-26|work=Motherboard|access-date=2018-08-12|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clippit was the default and by far the most notable Assistant (partly because in many cases the setup CD was required to install the other assistants), which also led to it being called simply the '''Microsoft Paperclip'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newrisingmedia.com/all/2012/6/2/the-microsoft-paperclip-is-back.html |title=The Microsoft Paperclip Is Back |website=Newrisingmedia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Clippit in [[Microsoft Office 97|Office 97]] was given a new look in [[Microsoft Office 2000|Office 2000]].

The feature drew a strongly negative response from many users.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/apr/11/advertising2 |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Microsoft cuts 'Mr Clippy' |first=Claire |last=Cozens |date=2001-04-11 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-05-03-clippy-campaign.htm |work=USA Today |title=Microsoft banks on anti-Clippy sentiment |date=2002-02-06 |accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft turned off the feature by default in [[Microsoft Office XP|Office XP]], acknowledging its unpopularity in an ad campaign spoofing Clippy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Luening |first=Erich |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-255671.html |title=Microsoft tool "Clippy" gets pink slip |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was removed altogether in [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]] and [[Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac|Office 2008 for Mac]], as it continued to draw criticism even from Microsoft employees.

The default assistant Clippit has been heavily mocked in popular culture, being [[parody|parodied]], appearing in [[Internet meme|memes]], and even being made fun of by Microsoft themselves from 2001 onwards.

==Overview==
According to [[Alan Cooper]], the "Father of Visual Basic," the concept of Clippit was based on a "tragic misunderstanding" of research conducted at [[Stanford University]], showing that the same part of the [[brain]] in use while using a [[computer mouse|mouse]] or [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] was also responsible for emotional reactions while interacting with other [[human|human being]]s and thus is the reason people yell at their [[computer monitor]]s.&lt;ref name="AlanCooper"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/g4tv.com-video4080|title=g4tv.com-video4080: Why People Yell at Their Computer Monitors and Hate Microsoft's Clippy|first=|last=G4TV. com|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2016|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft]] concluded that if humans reacted to computers the same way they react to other humans, it would be beneficial to include a human-like face in their software.&lt;ref name="AlanCooper"/&gt; As people already related to computers directly as they do with humans, the added human-like face emerged as an annoying interloper distracting the user from the primary conversation.&lt;ref name="AlanCooper"/&gt;

First introduced in [[Microsoft Office 97]],&lt;ref name="97rtm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.microsoft.com/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/ |title=Microsoft Office 97 Released to Manufacturing |publisher=Microsoft |date=1996-11-19 |accessdate=2016-11-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125060125/http://news.microsoft.com/1996/11/19/microsoft-office-97-released-to-manufacturing/ |archivedate=2014-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Office Assistant was codenamed TFC during development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/techtalk/archive/2005/12/16/504872.aspx |title=PM at Microsoft |author=Steven Sinofsky |publisher=blogs.msdn.com |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared when the program determined the user could be assisted with using Office wizards, searching help, or advising users on using Office features more effectively. It also presented tips and keyboard shortcuts. For example, typing an address followed by "Dear" would cause the Assistant to appear with the message, "''It looks like you're writing a [[Letter (message)|letter]]. Would you like help?''".

===Assistants===
Apart from Clippit, other Office Assistants were also available:
*The Dot (a shape-shifting [[smiley]]-faced red ball)
*Hoverbot (a robot)
*The Genius (a caricature of [[Albert Einstein]], removed in Office XP but available as a downloadable add-on)
*Office Logo (a jigsaw puzzle)
*Mother Nature (a globe)
*Scribble (an origami-esque cat)
*Power Pup (a superhero dog)
*Will (a caricature of [[William Shakespeare]]).

In many cases the Office installation [[Compact Disc|CD]] was necessary to activate a different Office assistant character, so the default character, Clippit, remains widely known compared to other Office Assistants.

In Office 2000, the ''Hoverbot'', ''Scribble'' and ''Power Pup'' assistants were replaced by:
*F1 (a robot)
*Links (a cat)
*Rocky (a dog)

The Clippit and Office Logo assistants were also redesigned. The removed assistants later resurfaced as downloadable add-ons.

The Microsoft Office XP Multilingual Pack had two more assistants, {{Nihongo|''Saeko Sensei''|冴子先生|}}, an animated secretary, and a version of the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]] ({{zh|t=孫悟空}}) for Asian language users in non-Asian Office versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiyou-k.jp/fumiovol14.htm |title=フミオ君のボヤキ 第14回 『ワード』のイルカ |publisher=Kaiyou-k.jp |date=2004-07-18 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native language versions provided additional representations, such as Kairu the [[dolphin]] in Japanese.

[[File:Clippy_Hidden_in_office.png|thumb|right|Clippit, hidden.]]
A small image of Clippit can be found in Office 2013 or newer, which could be enabled by going to Options and changing the theme to "School Supplies". Clippit would then appear on the ribbon.

==Technology==
The Office Assistant used technology initially from [[Microsoft Bob]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watters|first1=Audrey|title=Clippy and the History of the Future of Educational Chatbots|url=http://hackeducation.com/2016/09/14/chatbot|website=Hacked Education|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Microsoft Agent]], offering advice based on [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swartz|first1=Luke|title=Why People Hate the Paperclip: Labels, Appearance, Behavior and Social Responses to User Interface Agents|url=http://xenon.stanford.edu/~lswartz/paperclip/paperclip.pdf|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Office 2000 onwards, [[Microsoft Agent]] (.acs) replaced the [[Microsoft Bob]]-descended Actor (.act) format as the technology supporting the feature. Users can add other assistants to the folder where Office is installed for them to show up in the Office application, or install in the Microsoft Agent folder in [[Special folder#List of special folders|System32]] folder. Microsoft Agent-based characters have richer forms and colors, and are not enclosed within a boxed window. Furthermore, the Office Assistant could use the Lernout &amp; Hauspie TruVoice Text-to-Speech Engine to provide output speech capabilities to Microsoft Agent, but it required SAPI 4.0. The Microsoft Speech Recognition Engine allowed the Office Assistant to accept speech input&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://msagentring.org/setup.aspx|title=Microsoft Agent Ring|last=Bell|first=msagentring.org - Gordon Scott|website=msagentring.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Compatibility===
The [[Microsoft Agent]] components it required were not included in [[Windows 7]] or later; however, they can be downloaded from the Microsoft website. Installation of Microsoft Agent on [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]] is also possible. When desktop compositing with [[Windows_Aero|Aero glass]] is enabled on Windows Vista or 7, or when running on Windows 8 or newer, the normally transparent space around the Office Assistant becomes solid-colored pink, blue, or green.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902074943/http://www.microsoft.com:80/products/msagent/main.aspx|title=Microsoft Agent home page|last=|first=|date=1 May 2009|website=|archive-url=http://www.microsoft.com:80/products/msagent/main.aspx|archive-date=2 September 2012|dead-url=|access-date=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional downloadable assistants==
&lt;!-- Hello. Before adding more assistants here please make sure that they were not included in any Office versions. If they were included as part of Office, list them in the above section. This section is for assistants which were exclusively available via download. Also note that some Office 97 assistants were bundled with later versions. Do not add them here. --&gt;

and was criticized even within Microsoft. Microsoft's internal codename TFC had a derogatory origin: [[Steven Sinofsky]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; states that "C" stood for "clown", while allowing his readers to guess what "TF" might stand for. ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'' called Clippit "one of the worst software design blunders in the annals of computing".&lt;ref&gt;Conniff, Richard. "What's Behind a Smile?" ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]'', August 2007 pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine included Clippit in a 2010 article listing the fifty worst inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991755,00.html |title=The 50 Worst Inventions: Clippy |author=Chris Gentilviso |date=May 27, 2010 |work=Time |accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, the online comic strip ''[[User Friendly]]'' ran a series of panels featuring Clippit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000715 |title=UserFriendly Strip Comments |publisher=Ars.userfriendly.org |date=2000-07-15 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a Microsoft advertising campaign for [[Office XP]] included the (now defunct) website ''officeclippy.com'', which highlighted the disabling of Clippit in the software. It featured the animated adventures of Clippit (voiced by comedian [[Gilbert Gottfried]]) as he learned to cope with unemployment ("X… XP… As in, ex-paperclip?!") and parodied behaviors of the Office assistant. Curiously, one of these ("Clippy Faces Facts") uses the same punchline as one of the User Friendly comic strips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20000721 |title=UserFriendly Strip Comments |publisher=Ars.userfriendly.org |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos can be downloaded from Microsoft's website as self-contained [[Flash Player]] executables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/office/clippy/downloads.asp |title=Clippy downloads |publisher=Microsoft |date=2001-08-06 |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031010223455/http://www.microsoft.com/office/clippy/downloads.asp |archivedate=October 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clippit ends up in an office as a floppy disk ejecting pin.

There is a Clippit parody in the ''Plus! Dancer'' application included in [[Microsoft Plus! Digital Media Edition]] which is later included as ''Windows Dancer'' in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005]]. The dancing character '''Boo Who'''?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/desktop/dancers.mspx |title=Microsoft.com |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2017-09-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214030453/https://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/desktop/dancers.mspx |archivedate=2005-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is wearing a ghost outfit, roughly having the shape of Clippit's body, with a piece of wire visible underneath. Occasionally, the white sheet slips, and reveals the thin curve of steel. The description mentions "working for a short while for a Redmond, WA based software company, where he continued to work until being retired in 2001". Clippit is also included as a player character in ''Microsoft Bicycle Card Games'' and ''Microsoft Bicycle Board Games''. It was also used in the "[[Word Crimes]]" music video by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gv0H-vPoDc&amp;t=119 Word Crimes video, by Weird Al Yankovic]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vigor (software)|Vigor]] is a Clippit-inspired parody software - a version of the [[vi]] text editor featuring a rough-sketched Clippit.

On April 1, 2014, Clippit appeared as an Office assistant in Office Online as part of an [[April Fools' Day]] joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jessica Catcher |url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/01/clippy-is-back/ |title=Clippy Returns in Microsoft Office April Fools' Day Gag |website=Mashable.com |date=2014-04-01 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, an [[easter egg (media)|easter egg]] was found in the then-preview version of [[Windows Phone 8.1]]. When asked if she likes Clippit, the personal assistant [[Microsoft Cortana|Cortana]] would answer "Definitely. He taught me how important it is to listen." or "What's not to like? That guy took a heck of a beating and he's still smiling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.windowscentral.com/cortana/275592-found-clippy-easter-egg-cortana.html |title=Found a Clippy Easter Egg in Cortana! - Windows Central Forums |website=Forums.windowscentral.com |date=2014-04-15 |accessdate=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her avatar occasionally turned into a two-dimensional Metro-style{{clarify|date=February 2016}} Clippit for several seconds. This easter egg is still available in the full release version of the Windows Phone operating system and Windows 10.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

On April 1, 2015, [[Tumblr]] created a parody of Clippit, Coppy, as an April Fools joke. Coppy is an anthropomorphized photocopier that behaved in similar ways to Clippit, asking the user if they want help. Coppy would engage the reader in a series of pointless questions, with a dialogue box written in [[Comic Sans MS]], deliberately designed to be extremely annoying.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the ninth episode of Season 3 of [[HBO]]'s ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'', originally aired in June, 2016, a new animated character called "Pipey", clearly based on Microsoft's Clippit, provides help to users of the Pied Piper platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Caleb |last=Pershan |url=http://sfist.com/2016/06/20/silicon_valley_hbo_season_3_episode_9.php |title=''Silicon Valley'' Ep. 3.9: 'Pipey' |website=sfist |date=June 20, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623092248/http://sfist.com/2016/06/20/silicon_valley_hbo_season_3_episode_9.php |archivedate=June 23, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
After featuring Clippit's tomb in a movie to promote Office 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dennis Liu |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUawhjxLS2I |title=Office 2010: The Movie |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the character was relaunched as the main character of the game ''[[Ribbon Hero 2]]'', which is an [[interactive tutorial]] released by Microsoft in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ribbonhero.com |title=Ribbonhero.com |publisher=Ribbonhero.com |accessdate=2011-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20110703064638/http%3A//www.ribbonhero.com/ |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, Clippy needs a new job and accidentally goes inside a time machine, travelling to different ages solving problems with [[Microsoft Word|Word]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] and [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]]. Other Office Assistant names are also featured during the "Future Age" as planets of the future solar system.

In "[[Search Committee]]," the [[The Office (U.S. season 7)|seventh season]] finale of [[The Office]] aired in May 2011, Darryl calls Microsoft and asks whether they still have Clippy while trying to build a resume.

In 2015 a music video was released for the song "Ghost" (by [[Delta Heavy]]) in which the abandoned Clippit is stuck between the software of the mid-nineties but then travels to the contemporary web and regains his place by hacking himself into any digital system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Bristow |url=http://www.dadhat.com/DELTA-HEAVY-GHOST |title=Delta Heavy - Ghost |publisher=dadhat.com |date=July 2015 |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clippit made a cameo appearance in the ''[[Drawn Together]]'' episode "The One Wherein There Is a Big Twist, Part II", where he offered to help Wooldoor Sockbat with his suicide note.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Clippit is portrayed as a romantic interest in "Conquered by Clippy", a comedic/erotic story by Leonard Delaney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jasper Hamill |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/man-earns-700-month-writing-5677394 |title=This man earns almost 700 pounds a month writing hardcore porn about the Apple Watch and Tetris |publisher=The Mirror UK |date=May 2015 |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of war}}
In the field of [[military theory]], the '''operational level of war''' (also called the '''operational art''', as derived from {{lang-ru|оперативное искусство}}, or the '''operational warfare''') represents the level of command that connects the details of [[military tactics|tactics]] with the goals of [[strategy]].&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Simpkin&lt;/ref&gt;

In Joint U.S. military [[Military doctrine|doctrine]], '''operational art''' is "the cognitive approach by commanders and staffs—supported by their skill, knowledge, experience, creativity, and judgment—to develop strategies, campaigns, and operations to organize and employ military forces by integrating ends, ways, and means."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://armypubs.army.mil/doctrine/DR_pubs/dr_a/pdf/adrp5_0.pdf|title=Army Doctrine Reference Publication (ADRP) 5-0, The Operations Process|last=Department of the Army|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=May 2012|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It correlates political needs and military power. Operational art is defined by its military-political scope, not by force size, scale of operations or degree of effort. Likewise, operational art provides theory and skills, and the operational level permits doctrinal structure and process.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Background==

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, the synonymous term '''grand tactics''' (or, less frequently, ''maneuver tactics''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Earl |title=Civil War Infantry Tactics: Training, Combat, and Small-Unit Effectiveness |date=2015 |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |location=Baton Rouge |isbn=978-0-8071-5937-8 |page=xxi |edition=fourth }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was often used to describe the manoeuvres of troops not tactically [[engagement (military)|engaged]], while in the late 19th century to the [[First World War]] and through the Second World War, the term '''minor strategy''' was used by some military commentators.&lt;ref&gt;p.218, Jablonsky&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p.28, Whitman&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion over terminology was brought up in professional military publications, that sought to identify "...slightly different shades of meaning, such as tactics, major tactics, minor tactics, grand strategy, major strategy, and minor strategy".&lt;ref&gt;p.3, Bundel&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not widely used in the United States or Britain before 1980–1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hLBANX5rTIsC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=The German 1918 Offensives: A Case Study in the Operational Level of War |isbn=9781134252251 |author1=Zabecki |first1=David T |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QTFLUTXixXEC |publisher=DIANE Publishing |page=v |title=The Operational Level of War |isbn=9781428915749}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKGK_t8mYKAC&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;pg=PA175 |page=175 |title=Strategy and History |isbn=9780887380655 |author1=Luttwak |first1=Edward |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it became much discussed and started to enter military doctrines and officer combat training courses.&lt;ref&gt;p. 111, Stone&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Operational art comprises four essential elements: time, space, means and purpose. Each element is found in greater complexity at the operational level than at the tactical or strategic level. This is true, in part, because operational art must consider and incorporate more of the strategic and tactical levels than those levels must absorb from the operational level. Although much can be gained by examining the four elements independently, it is only when they are viewed together that operational art reveals its intricate fabric.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

The challenge of operational art is to establish a four-element equilibrium that permits the optimal generation and application of military power in achieving the political goal. Viewing time, space, means and purpose as a whole requires great skill in organizing, weighing and envisioning masses of complex, often contradictory factors. These factors often exist for extended periods, over great distances and with shifting mixes of players, systems and beliefs, pursuing political goals which may or may not be clear, cogent or settled. Compounding factors, such as the opponent's actions, create further ambiguity.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===Mission analysis===
The operational-level strategist possesses numerous tools to frame and guide their thinking, but chief among these are mission analysis and end state. Mission analysis answers the question "What is to be accomplished?" Through mission analysis, the operational-level planner fuses political aims and military objectives. In so doing, the planner determines what application of military force will create military power to achieve the political purpose. Subordinate processes here include defining objectives and centers of gravity, but excessive dependence on analytical mechanisms can create false security. The final test rewards success, not the quality of the argument. Conversely, the planner cannot hope to "feel" a way to victory—complexity demands an integration of thought and effort.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

===End state===
End state answers the question "What will constitute success?" The campaign end state is not merely a desired status quo of the military goal. It also establishes a touchstone for the tactical, operational and strategic levels. The end state manifests the intended results of military power and exposes any limitations. Indeed, an achievable end state may require the employment of nonmilitary elements of national power. As such, it recognizes that military power alone may not be capable of attaining political success.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

==Skills required==
An operational-level strategy must continually inventory and weigh time, space, means and purpose, extrapolating from them outcomes and likelihood. To accomplish this, practitioners need both skill and theory, experience and knowledge. At the operational level, skills and experience must usually be developed indirectly, through formal training, military history and real-world practicum.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

Success at the tactical level is no guarantee of success at the operational level: mastery of operational art demands strategic skills. Without a strong grounding in the theory and application of operational art, a successful tactician has little hope of making the demanding leap from tactics. The operational level strategist must see clearly and expansively from the foxhole into the corridors of national or coalition authority. They must be aware of the plausibility and coherence of strategic aims, national will and the players who decide them. Successful operational art charts a clear, unbroken path from the individual soldier's efforts to the state or coalition's goals.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

== Role in historiography ==

While the emerging corpus of operational art and the establishment of a specifically operational level of war are relatively new, in practice operational art has existed throughout recorded history. Peoples and commanders have long pursued political goals through military actions, and one can examine campaigns of any period from the [[existential]] perspective of operational art. Current schools of thought on the operational art share the fundamental view that military success can be measured only in the attainment of political-strategic aims, and thus historians can analyze any war in terms of operational art.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

In the case of [[World War II]] analysis, the [[Wehrmacht]] did not use the operational level as a formal doctrinal concept during the campaigns of 1939–1945. While personnel within the German forces knew of operational art, awareness and practice was limited principally to [[German General Staff | general-staff]] trained officers. Nevertheless, the existential nature of operational art means that examining a campaign or an operation against political aims is valid irrespective of the doctrine or structures of the period. Thus the elements of operational art—time, space, means and purpose—can illuminate thoughts and actions of any era, regardless of the prevailing contemporary doctrine or structure.{{sfn|Robinson|1997}}

'''''Partially Buried Woodshed''''' is a work of [[land art]] created by American artist [[Robert Smithson]] in January 1970 at [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/partially.htm|title=Partially Buried Woodshed |website=RobertSmithson.com |access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work consisted of an existing woodshed and earth added by the artist in order to illustrate the concept of entropy. As of 2018, only a large mound of dirt and the structure's concrete foundation remain. The remaining elements, along with an informational plaque, is located in a small wooded area immediately behind the [[Liquid Crystal Institute]] building on the Kent State University main campus.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert I.

== History ==
[[File:Partially Buried Woodshed Remains.jpg|thumb|Stone remains of the Partially Buried Woodshed]]
[[File:Partially Buried Woodshed Plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the site of the Partially Buried Woodshed]]
In January 1970 [[Robert Smithson]] visited Kent State University as part of the School of Art Creative Arts Festival. Initially, he had planned to do a mudflow sculpture, but cold temperatures prevented him from being able to dig the dirt needed for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mudflow sculptor buries woodshed |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19700123-01.2.2 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |date=January 23, 1970 |page=1 |volume=LV |number=47 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he created ''Partially Buried Woodshed'' using an old woodshed from a former farm on the eastern edge of campus that had recently been acquired by the school. Smithson rented a backhoe and transported 20 truck loads of dirt onto the right side of the woodshed until the center beam cracked, marking the beginning of the structure’s decline. He valued the work at $10,000 and donated it to the university, asking that no changes be made and that the structure be allowed to deteriorate naturally. Shortly after the May 4, 1970, [[Kent State shootings]], an anonymous person added the inscription 'MAY 4 KENT 70' with white paint to one of the structure's horizontal beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/partially_det5.htm|title=Partially Buried Woodshed detail |date=1970-1974|website=RobertSmithson.com |access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the message about May 4, 1970 helped make the ''Partially Buried Woodshed'' one of the many memorial sites on campus.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt; 

The work was set on fire by an unknown arsonist on March 28th, 1975, burning much of the left side and causing the structure's major collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Smithson's Partially Buried Woodshed|last=Shinn|first=Dorothy|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Arts Commission recommended in April that the roof and burned portion be removed, mostly citing safety concerns, with the remaining walls, earthen mound, and rafters remaining to continue the natural aging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Natural aging of earth sculpture urged |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750422-01.2.19 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Halfhill, Tom |date=April 22, 1975 |page=5 |volume=XLVIII |number=89 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late April, the university had much of the damaged section removed and planned to landscape the area around the sculpture as a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smithson sculpture removed, memorial plate to be placed |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750430-01.2.23 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |date=April 30, 1975 |page=6 |volume=XLVIII |number=94 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's widow, Nancy Holt, visited the work May 3, 1975, and called for its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earth artwork ‘questions everything,’ says widow |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750509-01.2.30 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Halfhill, Tom |date=May 9, 1975 |page=8 |volume=XLVIII |number=100 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee recommended in June 1975 that the entire sculpture be removed, citing liability concerns, though university president Glenn Olds ultimately decided to keep the remains of the sculpture in 1976.

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}
The '''''Phaedrus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|d|r|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc|Φαῖδρος||Phaidros}}), written by [[Plato]], is a dialogue between Plato's [[protagonist]], [[Socrates]], and [[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]], an interlocutor in [[Plato#Unity and diversity of the dialogues|several dialogues]]. The ''Phaedrus'' was presumably composed around 370 BC, about the same time as Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Symposium (Plato dialogue)|Symposium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cooper (Stuart Professor of Philosophy, Princeton University c.1997), D. S. Hutchinson - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Fv9AKY_DBVYC&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=Plato+works+groupings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7-waVd_NKJPWasapgpAI&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Plato%20works%20groupings&amp;f=false Complete Works - xii] Hackett Publishing, 1997 [Retrieved 2015-3-31](ed. this source was 1st source for criticism of &lt; chronological order &gt;)&lt;/ref&gt; Although ostensibly about the topic of [[love]], the discussion in the dialogue revolves around the art of [[rhetoric]] and how it should be practiced, and dwells on subjects as diverse as [[metempsychosis]] (the Greek tradition of [[reincarnation]]) and [[erotic love]].

==Setting==
Socrates runs into [[Phaedrus (Athenian)|Phaedrus]] on the outskirts of Athens. Phaedrus has just come from the home of [[Epicrates of Athens]], where [[Lysias]], son of [[Cephalus]], has given a speech on love. Socrates, stating that he is "sick with passion for hearing speeches",{{r|group=Note|plato}} walks into the countryside with Phaedrus hoping that Phaedrus will repeat the speech.  They sit by a stream under a [[Oriental Plane|plane tree]] and a [[Vitex agnus-castus|chaste tree]], and the rest of the dialogue consists of oration and discussion.

The dialogue, somewhat unusually, does not set itself as a re-telling of the day's events. The dialogue is given unmediated, in the direct words of Socrates and Phaedrus, without other interlocutors to introduce the story or give it to us; it comes first hand, as if we are witnessing the events themselves. This is in contrast to such dialogues as the ''Symposium'', in which Plato sets up multiple layers between the day's events and our hearing of it, explicitly giving us an incomplete, fifth-hand account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato-dialogues.org/tetra_4/phaedrus/plan_sp3.htm|title=Plato's Phaedrus - Plan of dialogue on rhetoric|last=SUZANNE|first=Bernard F.|website=plato-dialogues.org|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dramatis personæ==
* Socrates
* Phaedrus
* Lysias (in absentia)

Lysias was one of the three sons of Cephalus, the patriarch whose home is the setting for Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''. Lysias was perhaps the most famous ''logographos'' (λογογράφος, lit. "argument writer") in Athens during the time of Plato. Lysias was a rhetorician and a sophist whose best-known extant work is a defense speech, "[[On the Murder of Eratosthenes]]."  The speech is a masterpiece in which a man who murdered his wife's lover claims that the laws of Athens required him to do it. The outcome of this speech is unknown.

==Summary==
The dialogue consists of a series of three speeches on the topic of love that serves as the subject to construct a discussion on the proper use of rhetoric. They encompass discussions of the [[soul]], [[insanity|madness]], [[divinity|divine]] inspiration, and the practice and mastery of an [[art]].

As they walk out into the countryside, Socrates tries to convince Phaedrus to repeat the speech of Lysias which he has just heard. Phaedrus makes several excuses, but Socrates suspects strongly that Phaedrus has a copy of the speech with him. Saying that while Lysias is present, he would never allow himself to be used as a training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak. Phaedrus gives in and agrees to perform Lysias' speech.{{r|group=Note|plato2}}

===Lysias' speech (230e–235e)===
Phaedrus and Socrates walk through a stream and find a seat in the shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with "You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out",{{r|group=Note|plato3}} the speech proceeds to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is "more sick than sound in the head" and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one who needs it most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.

Socrates, attempting to flatter Phaedrus, responds that he is in ecstasy and that it is all Phaedrus' doing. Socrates comments that as the speech seemed to make Phaedrus radiant, he is sure that Phaedrus understands these things better than he does himself, and that he cannot help follow Phaedrus' lead into his [[Bacchanalia|Bacchic frenzy]]. Phaedrus picks up on Socrates' subtle sarcasm and asks Socrates not to joke.{{r|group=Note|plato5}}

Socrates retorts that he is still in awe, and claims to be able to make an even better speech than Lysias on the same subject.{{r|group=Note|plato6}}

Phaedrus and Socrates both note how anyone would consider Socrates a foreigner in the countryside, and Socrates attributes this fault to his love of learning which "trees and open country won't teach," while "men in the town" will. Socrates then proceeds to give Phaedrus credit for leading him out of his native land: "Yet you seem to have discovered a drug for getting me out (''dokei moi tes emes exodou to pharmakon heurekenai''). A hungry animal can be driven by dangling a carrot or a bit of greenstuff in front of it; similarly if you proffer me speeches bound in books (''en bibliois'') I don't doubt you can cart me all around Attica, and anywhere else you please."{{r|group=Note|plato3}}

===First speech of Socrates (237a–241d)===
When Phaedrus begs to hear it however, Socrates refuses to give the speech. Phaedrus warns him that he is younger and stronger, and Socrates should "take his meaning" and "stop playing hard to get".{{r|group=Note|plato7}} Finally, after Phaedrus swears on the plane tree that he will never recite another speech for Socrates if Socrates refuses, Socrates, covering his head, consents.{{r|group=Note|plato8}}

Socrates, rather than simply listing reasons as Lysias had done, begins by explaining that while all men desire beauty, some are in love and some are not. We are all ruled, he says, by two principles: one is our inborn desire for pleasure, and the other is our acquired judgment that pursues what is best (237d). Following your judgment is "being in your right mind", while following desire towards pleasure without reason is "outrage" (''[[hubris]]'').{{r|group=Note|plato9}}

Following different desires leads to different things; one who follows his desire for food is a glutton, and so on. The desire to take pleasure in beauty, reinforced by the kindred beauty in human bodies, is called ''Eros''.{{r|group=Note|plato10}}

Remarking that he is in the grip of something divine, and may soon be overtaken by the madness of the [[nymph]]s in this place,{{r|group=Note|plato11}} he goes on.

The problem, he explains, is that one overcome with this desire will want to turn his boy into whatever is most pleasing to himself, rather than what is best for the boy.{{r|group=Note|plato12}}  The boy's intellectual progress will be stifled, his physical condition will suffer,{{r|group=Note|plato14}} the lover will not wish the boy to mature and take a family,{{r|group=Note|plato15}} all because the lover is shaping him out of desire for pleasure rather than what is best. At some point, "right-minded reason" will take the place of "the madness of love",{{r|group=Note|plato16}} and the lover's oaths and promises to his boy will be broken.

Phaedrus believes that one of the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.

The non-lover, he concludes, will do none of this, always ruled by judgment rather than desire for pleasure. Socrates, fearing that the nymphs will take complete control of him if he continues, states that he is going to leave before Phaedrus makes him "do something even worse".{{r|group=Note|plato17}}

However, just before Socrates is about to leave, he is stopped by the "familiar divine sign", his [[daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]], which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do something he should not. A voice "from this very spot" forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, and seemed to be showing off. Socrates states that he is a "seer". While he is not very good at it, he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him.{{r|group=Note|plato18}} Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the [[Muse]]s, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.{{r|group=Note|plato19}}

===Second speech of Socrates (244a–257b)===

====Madness (244a–245c)====
Socrates begins by discussing madness. If madness is all bad, then the preceding speeches would have been correct, but in actuality, madness given as a gift of the gods provides us with some of the best things we have.{{r|group=Note|plato20}} There are, in fact, several kinds of divine madness (''[[theia mania]]''), of which he cites four examples:&lt;ref&gt;Pappas, N., [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/plato-aesthetics/#Pha "Plato's Aesthetics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]  "Madness comes in two general forms: the diseased state of mental dysfunction, and a divergence from ordinary rationality that a god sometimes brings (see 265a–b). Divine madness in turn takes different forms: love, Dionysian frenzy, oracular prophecy, and poetic composition (244b–245a). In all four cases the possessed or inspired person (enthousiazôn: 241e, 249e, 253a, 263d) can accomplish what is impossible for someone in a sane state"&lt;/ref&gt;
#From [[Apollo]], the gift of prophecy;
#From [[Dionysus]], the mystic rites and relief from present hardship;
#From the Muses, poetry;
#From [[Aphrodite]], love.

As they must show that the madness of love is, indeed, sent by a god to benefit the lover and beloved in order to disprove the preceding speeches, Socrates embarks on a proof of the divine origin of this fourth sort of madness. It is a proof, he says, that will convince "the wise if not the clever".{{r|group=Note|plato21}}

====The soul (245c–249d)====
He begins by briefly proving the immortality of the soul. A soul is always in motion and as a [[self-mover]] has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.{{r|group=Note|plato22}}

Then begins the famous [[Chariot Allegory|chariot allegory]], called by R. Hackworth the "centrepiece" of ''Phaedrus'', and "the famous and moving account of the vision, fall and incarnation of the soul."{{fact|date=October 2017}}  A soul, says Socrates, is like the "natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer". While the gods have two good horses, everyone else has a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.{{r|group=Note|plato24}}

As souls are immortal, those lacking bodies patrol all of heaven so long as their wings are in perfect condition. When a soul sheds its wings, it comes to earth and takes on an earthly body that then seems to move itself.{{r|group=Note|plato25}} These wings lift up heavy things to where the gods dwell and are nourished and grow in the presence of the wisdom, goodness, and beauty of the divine. However, foulness and ugliness make the wings shrink and disappear.{{r|group=Note|plato26}}

In heaven, he explains, there is a procession led by [[Zeus]], who looks after everything and puts things in order. All the gods, except for [[Hestia]], follow Zeus in this procession. While the chariots of the gods are balanced and easier to control, other charioteers must struggle with their bad horse, which will drag them down to earth if it has not been properly trained.{{r|group=Note|plato27}}  As the procession works its way upward, it eventually makes it up to the high ridge of heaven where the gods take their stands and are taken in a circular motion to gaze at all that is beyond heaven.{{r|group=Note|plato28}}

What is outside of heaven, says Socrates, is quite difficult to describe, lacking color, shape, or solidity, as it is the subject of all true knowledge, visible only to intelligence.{{r|group=Note|plato29}}  The gods delight in these things and are nourished. Feeling wonderful, they are taken around until they make a complete circle. On the way they are able to see Justice, Self-control, Knowledge, and other things as they are in themselves, unchanging. When they have seen all things and feasted on them, coming all the way around, they sink back down inside heaven.{{r|group=Note|plato30}}

The immortal souls that follow the gods most closely are able to just barely raise their chariots up to the rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, having to deal with their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while straining to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, [[sophist]]s, and tyrants follow respectively.{{r|group=Note|plato31}}

Souls then begin cycles of [[reincarnation]]. It generally takes 10,000 years for a soul to grow its wings and return to where it came, but philosophers, after having chosen such a life three times in a row, grow their wings and return after only 3,000 years. This is because they have seen the most and always keep its memory as close as possible, and philosophers maintain the highest level of initiation. They ignore human concerns and are drawn towards the divine. While ordinary people rebuke them for this, they are unaware that the lover of wisdom is possessed by a god. This is the fourth sort of madness, that of love.{{r|group=Note|plato32}}

====The madness of love (249d–257b)====
One comes to manifest this sort of love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay no attention to what goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.{{r|group=Note|plato33}}

When one is reminded of true beauty by the sight of a beautiful boy, he is called a lover. While all have seen reality, as they must have to be human, not all are so easily reminded of it. Those that can remember are startled when they see a reminder, and are overcome with the memory of beauty.{{r|group=Note|plato34}}

Beauty, he states, was among the most radiant things to see beyond heaven, and on earth it sparkles through vision, the clearest of our senses. Some have not been recently initiated, and mistake this reminder for beauty itself and only pursue desires of the flesh. This pursuit of pleasure, then, even when manifested in the love of beautiful bodies, is not "divine" madness, but rather just having lost one's head. The recent initiates, on the other hand, are overcome when they see a bodily form that has captured true beauty well, and their wings begin to grow. When this soul looks upon the beautiful boy it experiences the utmost joy; when separated from the boy, intense pain and longing occur, and the wings begin to harden. Caught between these two feelings, the lover is in utmost anguish, with the boy the only doctor for the pain.{{r|group=Note|plato35}}

Socrates then returns to the myth of the chariot. The charioteer is filled with warmth and desire as he gazes into the eyes of the one he loves. The good horse is controlled by its sense of shame, but the bad horse, overcome with desire, does everything it can to go up to the boy and suggest to it the pleasures of [[sex]]. The bad horse eventually wears out its charioteer and partner, and drags them towards the boy; yet when the charioteer looks into the boy's face, his memory is carried back to the sight of the [[Theory of forms|forms]] of beauty and self-control he had with the gods, and pulls back violently on the reins. As this occurs over and over, the bad horse eventually becomes obedient and finally dies of fright when seeing the boy's face, allowing the lover's soul to follow the boy in reverence and awe.{{r|group=Note|plato36}}

The lover now pursues the boy. As he gets closer to his quarry, and the love is reciprocated, the opportunity for sexual contact again presents itself. If the lover and beloved surpass this desire they have won the "true [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Contests]]"; it is the perfect combination of human self-control and divine madness, and after death, their souls return to heaven.{{r|group=Note|plato37}} Those who give in do not become weightless, but they are spared any punishment after their death, and will eventually grow wings together when the time comes.{{r|group=Note|plato38}}

A lover's friendship is divine, Socrates concludes, while that of a non-lover offers only cheap, human dividends, and tosses the soul about on earth for 9,000 years. He apologizes to the gods for the previous speeches, and Phaedrus joins him in the prayer.{{r|group=Note|plato39}}

===Discussion of rhetoric and writing (257c–279c)===
[[File:Papyrus of Plato Phaedrus.jpg|thumb|Fragments of a papyrus roll of the ''Phaedrus'' from the 2nd century AD]]
After Phaedrus concedes that this speech was certainly better than any Lysias could compose, they begin a discussion of the nature and uses of rhetoric itself. After showing that speech making itself isn't something reproachful, and that what is truly shameful is to engage in speaking or writing shamefully or badly, Socrates asks what distinguishes good from bad writing, and they take this up.{{r|group=Note|plato40}}

Phaedrus claims that to be a good speechmaker, one does not need to know the truth of what he is speaking on, but rather how to properly persuade,{{r|group=Note|plato41}} persuasion being the purpose of speechmaking and oration. Socrates first objects that an orator who does not know bad from good will, in Phaedrus's words, harvest "a crop of really poor quality". Yet Socrates does not dismiss the art of speechmaking. Rather, he says, it may be that even one who knew the truth could not produce conviction without knowing the art of persuasion;{{r|group=Note|plato43}} on the other hand, "As the Spartan said, there is no genuine art of speaking without a grasp of the truth, and there never will be".{{r|group=Note|plato44}}

To acquire the art of rhetoric, then, one must make systematic [[diairesis|divisions]] between two different kinds of things: one sort, like "iron" and "silver", suggests the same to all listeners; the other sort, such as "good" or "justice", lead people in different directions.{{r|group=Note|plato47}} Lysias failed to make this distinction, and accordingly, failed to even define what "love" itself is in the beginning; the rest of his speech appears thrown together at random, and is, on the whole, very poorly constructed.{{r|group=Note|plato48}} Socrates then goes on to say,
:''Every speech must be put together like a living creature, with a body of its own; it must be neither without head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and extremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole work.''{{r|group=Note|plato49}}

Socrates's speech, on the other hand, starts with a thesis and proceeds to make divisions accordingly, finding divine love, and setting it out as the greatest of goods. And yet, they agree, the art of making these divisions is [[dialectic]], not rhetoric, and it must be seen what part of rhetoric may have been left out.{{r|group=Note|plato50}}

When Socrates and Phaedrus proceed to recount the various tools of speechmaking as written down by the great orators of the past, starting with the "Preamble" and the "Statement Facts" and concluding with the "Recapitulation", Socrates states that the fabric seems a little threadbare.{{r|group=Note|plato51}} He goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor who knows how to raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or came across some potions knows nothing of the art.{{r|group=Note|plato52}} One who knows how to compose the longest passages on trivial topics or the briefest passages on topics of great importance is similar, when he claims that to teach this is to impart the knowledge of composing [[tragedy|tragedies]]; if one were to claim to have mastered [[harmony]] after learning the lowest and highest notes on the [[lyre]], a musician would say that this knowledge is what one must learn before one masters harmony, but it is not the knowledge of harmony itself.{{r|group=Note|plato53}} This, then, is what must be said to those who attempt to teach the art of rhetoric through "Preambles" and "Recapitulations"; they are ignorant of dialectic, and teach only what is necessary to learn as preliminaries.{{r|group=Note|plato54}}

They go on to discuss what is good or bad in writing. Socrates tells a brief legend, critically commenting on the gift of writing from the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] god [[Thoth|Theuth]] to King [[Amun|Thamus]], who was to disperse Theuth's gifts to the people of Egypt. After Theuth remarks on his discovery of writing as a remedy for the memory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with.{{r|group=Note|plato57}}

No written instructions for an art can yield results clear or certain, Socrates states, but rather can only remind those that already know what writing is about.{{r|group=Note|plato58}}  Furthermore, writings are silent; they cannot speak, answer questions, or come to their own defense.{{r|group=Note|plato59}}

Accordingly, the legitimate sister of this is, in fact, dialectic; it is the living, breathing discourse of one who knows, of which the written word can only be called an image.{{r|group=Note|plato60}} The one who knows uses the art of dialectic rather than writing:
:''The dialectician chooses a proper soul and plants and sows within it discourse accompanied by knowledge—discourse capable of helping itself as well as the man who planted it, which is not barren but produces a seed from which more discourse grows in the character of others. Such discourse makes the seed forever immortal and renders the man who has it happy as any human being can be.''{{r|group=Note|plato61}}

==Interpretations and themes==

===Madness and divine inspiration===

In the ''Phaedrus'', Socrates makes the rather bold claim that some of life's greatest blessings flow from madness; and he clarifies this later by noting that he is referring specifically to madness inspired by the gods. It should be noted that Phaedrus is Plato's only dialogue that shows Socrates outside the city of Athens, out in the country. It was believed that spirits and nymphs inhabited the country, and Socrates specifically points this out after the long [[palinode]] with his comment about listening to the [[cicada]]s. After originally remarking that "landscapes and trees have nothing to teach me, only people do",{{r|group=Note|plato64}} Socrates goes on to make constant remarks concerning the presence and action of the gods in general, nature gods such as [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the nymphs, and the Muses, in addition to the unusually explicit characterization of his own daemon. The importance of divine inspiration is demonstrated in its connection with and the importance of religion, poetry and art, and above all else, love. Eros, much like in the ''[[Symposium (Plato dialogue)|Symposium]]'', is contrasted from mere desire of the pleasurable and given a higher, heavenly function. Unlike in the ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', a dialogue dealing with madness and divine inspiration in poetry and [[literary criticism]], madness here must go firmly hand in hand with reason, learning, and self-control in both love and art. This rather bold claim has puzzled readers and scholars of Plato's work for centuries because it clearly shows that Socrates saw genuine value in the irrational elements of human life, despite many other dialogues that show him arguing that one should pursue beauty and that wisdom is the most beautiful thing of all.

===Derrida on 'pharmakon'===

[[Jacques Derrida]] makes an extensive study on the untranslatable concept of what is at once a "'remedy, 'recipe,' 'drug,' 'philter,' etc.", namely, the ''[[pharmakos|pharmakon]].''&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Derrida|Derrida, Jacques]]. (1972). "La Pharmacie de Platon." ''La dissémination.'' Éditions du Seuil. {{ISBN|2-02-020623-4}}. pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; During this study, Derrida not only divulges the exact instances Socrates or his interlocutors make use of this concept, but he also reveals the relationship between Plato and Socrates, which scholars have kept in secret by questioning the validity of authorship in Plato's letters, where in the [[Second Letter (Plato)|Second Letter]], Socrates writes: "Consider these facts and take care lest you sometimes come to repent of having now unwisely published your views. It is a very great safeguard to learn by heart instead of writing. It is impossible for what is written not to be disclosed (''to me graphein all' ekmanthanein'').&lt;!--314b--&gt;  That is the reason why I have never written anything about these things, and why there is not and will not be any written work of Plato's own (''oud' estin sungramma Platonos ouden oud' estai''). What are now called his are the work of a Socrates embellished and modernized (''Sokratous estin kalou kai neou gegonotos'').&lt;!--314c--&gt;  Farewell and believe. Read this letter now at once many times and burn it." (''Letter II'', 314)&lt;ref&gt;Derrida 1972, pp. 212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesacc.edu/~davpy35701/text/platosoc.html ''Letter II'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pederasty===
The [[pederasty|pederastic]] relationships common to ancient Greek life are also at the fore of this dialogue.  In addition to theme of love discussed in the speeches, seeming [[double entendre]]s and sexual innuendo is abundant; we see the flirtation between Phaedrus and Socrates as Phaedrus encourages Socrates to make his first speech, Phaedrus makes a remark at noon-time that Socrates should not leave as the heat has not passed and it is "straight-up, as they say,"&lt;!--{{rf|65|plato65}}--&gt; Socrates wishes to know what Phaedrus is holding under his cloak, and so on.  The relationships discussed in the speeches are explicitly pederastic.  And yet, this is tempered in various ways; role reversals between lover and beloved are constant, as they are in the ''Symposium''.  Socrates, ostensibly the lover, exhorts Phaedrus to lead the way at various times, and the dialogue ends with Socrates and Phaedrus leaving as "friends"–equals, rather than partaking in the lover/beloved relationship inherent in Greek pederasty.  In the beginning, they sit themselves under a [[vitex|chaste tree]], which is precisely what its name suggests—often known as "monk's pepper", it was used by monks to decrease sexual urges and is believed to be an [[antaphrodisiac]].  Notably, Socrates sees the pederastic relationship as ideally devoid of sexual consummation; rather than being used for sexual pleasure, the relationship is a form of divine madness, helping both lover and beloved to grow and reach the divine.

===Rhetoric, philosophy, and art===
The ''Phaedrus'' also gives us much in the way of explaining how art should be practiced. The discussion of rhetoric, the proper practice of which is found to actually be philosophy, has many similarities with Socrates's role as a "[[midwife]] of the soul" in the ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]''; the dialectician, as described, is particularly resonant. To practice the art, one must have a grasp of the truth and a detailed understanding of the soul in order to properly persuade. Moreover, one must have an idea of what is good or bad for the soul and, as a result, know what the soul should be persuaded towards. To have mastered the tools of an art is not to have mastered the art itself, but only its preliminaries. This is much like the person who claims to have mastered harmony after learning the highest and lowest notes of the lyre. To practice an art, one must know what that art is ''for'' and what it can help one achieve.

The role of divine inspiration in philosophy must also be considered; the philosopher is struck with the fourth kind of madness, that of love, and it is this divine inspiration that leads him and his beloved towards the good—but only when tempered with self-control.

Writing, examined separately but ultimately equated with philosophy and rhetoric, is somewhat deprecated; it is stated that writing can do little but remind those who already know. Unlike dialectic and rhetoric, writing cannot be tailored to specific situations or students; the writer does not have the luxury of examining his reader's soul in order to determine the proper way to persuade. When attacked it cannot defend itself, and is unable to answer questions or refute criticism. As such, the philosopher uses writing "for the sake of amusing himself" and other similar things rather than for teaching others. A writer, then, is only a philosopher when he can himself argue that his writing is of little worth, among other requirements.

This final critique of writing with which the dialogue concludes seems to be one of the more interesting facets of the conversation for those who seek to interpret Plato in general; Plato, of course, comes down to us through his numerous written works, and philosophy today is concerned almost purely with the reading and writing of written texts. It seems proper to recall that Plato's ever-present protagonist and ideal man, Socrates, fits Plato's description of the dialectician perfectly, and never wrote a thing.

There is an echo of this point of view in Plato's [[Seventh Letter (Plato)|Seventh Epistle (Letter)]], wherein Plato says not to write down things of importance. {{r|group=Note|Plato66}}

'''Pivot Legal Society''' is a legal advocacy organization based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]]. Founded in 2000, Pivot's stated aim is to represent and defend the marginalized and disenfranchised.

==Hope in Shadows==

[[Hope in Shadows]] is a photography contest organized by Pivot Legal Society, for residents of the Downtown Eastside since 2003. Every summer, up to 200 residents are given single-use cameras and encouraged to capture their community and their lives through images. The contest is designed to raise awareness about life in the Downtown Eastside, presenting reality from a distinctly personal point of view. Forty photographs are chosen by a panel of Vancouver artists and photographers, which are put on display on the street outside the Carnegie Community Centre. Here, local residents can vote to select the winning entries, which are compiled in an annual calendar, sold by residents on the streets of Vancouver. In 2010 216 local residents received job training to sell the 2011 Hope in Shadows calendar. More than $130,000 was earned by licensed street vendors selling 2011 calendars. The calendar sales were a 10% increase over the previous year. The Hope in Shadows book which won the 2008 City of Vancouver Book Award in October 2008 and has now sold more than 5,000 copies on the streets (if they had been sold in bookstores it would be an official B.C. Best Seller). Many of the calendar and book sellers are photographers in the competition. The 2011 contest will be held June 1–4. The top 40 pictures will be exhibited in the Pendulum Gallery in October, and the 2012 calendar will become available on October 4, 2011. Past Hope in Shadows photographs can be viewed on Flickr via the Hope in Shadows website.

[[File:Helianthus annuus pollen 1.jpg|thumb|right|Helianthus annuus pollen]]
'''Pollen zones''' are a system of subdividing the [[last glacial period]] and [[Holocene]] paleoclimate using the data from [[pollen core]]s. The sequence provides a global chronological structure to a wide variety of researchers, such as [[geology|geologists]], [[climatology|climatologisist]]s, [[geography|geographers]] and [[archaeologist]]s, who study the physical and cultural environment of the last 15,000 years.

==History==
The palynological aspects of the system were first investigated extensively by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[palynology|palynologist]] [[Lennart von Post]] in the years before the [[World War I|First World War]]. By analysing pollen  in [[core sample]]s taken from [[peat]] bogs, von Post noticed that different plant species were represented in bands through the cores.

The differing species and differing quantities of the same species are caused by changes in climate. Von Post was able to confirm the [[Blytt-Sernander]] climatic sequence showing fluctuations between warmer and colder periods across thousands of years. He used local peat sequences combined with [[varve]] dating to produce a regional climatic chronology for [[Scandinavia]].

In 1940 [[Harry Godwin]] began applying von Post's methods to pollen cores from the [[British Isles]] to produce the wider European sequence accepted today. It basically expanded the Blytt-Sernander further into the late [[Pleistocene]] and refined some of its periods. Following the [[World War II|Second World War]], the technique spread to the Americas.

Currently scientists are focusing a repertory of several different methods on [[core sample]]s in peat, ice, lake and ocean bottoms, and sediments to achieve "high resolution" dating not possible to only one method: [[Carbon dating]], [[Dendrochronology]], [[Oxygen isotope ratio cycle|isotope ratios]] on a number of gases, studies of insects and molluscs, and others. While often doubting the utility of the modified Bytt-Sernander, they seem to confirm and expand it all the more.

==Notes on the sequence table==
At present nine main pollen zones, I-IX, are defined, based on the work of [[Johannes Iversen|J. Iversen]], published in 1954. These are matched to period names called "biostratigraphic divisions" in the table, which were defined for Denmark by Iverson based on layers in the peat bogs. They represent climatic and biological zones in the peat. 

Others have used these names in different senses, such as the 1974 chronozones of J. Mangerud. The sequences in Germany and Sweden are not exactly the same as those in Denmark, inviting scientists there to use the names still differently or make other definitions. Moreover, the names are apt to be used interchangeably for glacials, interglacials, stadial, interstadials, or oscillations, leading some scientists to deplore the lack of system.

The system of the table below covers from around 13,000 BC to the modern day. Dates, given in years BC, are best viewed as being based on uncalibrated C-14 dates, which, when calibrated, would result in much earlier BC dates. For example, an Older Dryas start date of 10,000 BC translates roughly into an uncalibrated BP date of 12,000. Calibrated, that becomes 14,000 BP, 12,000 BC. To obtain quick, on-line calibrations, you may use [http://www.calpal-online.de/index.html CalPal].

The dates in the table correspond relatively well to more modern dates for the earlier periods. Larger discrepancies begin at the end of the Boreal. More, and more modern, details on the dating of the periods are given under the article for each one.

The archaeological periods listed only apply to north Europe, and do so approximately. For example, there is no uniform chronozone, "the Bronze Age", which would apply globally or even be of the same dates between north and south Europe.

The geological stages listed are only defined for the British Isles. Scientists use different names for north Europe, south Europe and other regions. However, they are cross-correlated in the articles for the ones listed.

In contrast to glacial periods, these pollen zones are being used to apply globally, with but few exceptions. It is acceptable, for example, to refer to the "Younger Dryas" of [[Antarctica]], which has no pollen of its own. A few scientists disapprove of such uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11508">In [[differential calculus]], the '''Reynolds transport theorem''' (also known as the Leibniz–Reynolds transport theorem), or in short '''Reynolds' theorem''', is a three-dimensional generalization of the [[Leibniz integral rule]] which is also known as [[differentiation under the integral sign]].
The theorem is named after [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1842–1912). It is used to recast derivatives of integrated quantities and is useful in formulating the basic equations of [[continuum mechanics]].

Consider integrating {{math|'''f''' {{=}} '''f'''('''x''',''t'')}} over the time-dependent region {{math|Ω(''t'')}} that has boundary {{math|∂Ω(''t'')}}, then taking the derivative with respect to time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;
If we wish to move the derivative within the integral, there are two issues: the time dependence of {{math|'''f'''}}, and the introduction of and removal of space from {{math|Ω}} due to its dynamic boundary. Reynolds' transport theorem provides the necessary framework.

== General form ==
Reynolds' transport theorem can be expressed as follows:&lt;ref name=LGLp23&gt;[[L. Gary Leal|L. G. Leal]], 2007, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OR14&gt;[[Osborne Reynolds|O. Reynolds]], 1903, Vol. 3, p. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MTp23&gt;[[Jerrold E. Marsden|J.E. Marsden]] and [[Anthony Tromba|A. Tromba]], 5th ed. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV = \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)} \left(\mathbf{v}^b\cdot\mathbf{n}\right)\mathbf{f}\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|'''n'''('''x''',''t'')}} is the outward-pointing unit normal vector, {{math|'''x'''}} is a point in the region and is the variable of integration, {{math|''dV''}} and {{math|''dA''}} are volume and surface elements at {{math|'''x'''}}, and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''',''t'')}} is the velocity of the area element (''not'' the flow velocity). The function {{math|'''f'''}} may be tensor-, vector- or scalar-valued.&lt;ref&gt;H. Yamaguchi, ''Engineering Fluid Mechanics, ''Springer c2008 p23&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the integral on the left hand side is a function solely of time, and so the total derivative has been used.

== Form for a material element ==
In continuum mechanics, this theorem is often used for [[material element]]s.  These are parcels of fluids or solids which no material enters or leaves. If {{math|Ω(''t'')}} is a material element then there is a velocity function {{math|'''v''' {{=}} '''v'''('''x''',''t'')}}, and the boundary elements obey
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{b}\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This condition may be substituted to obtain:&lt;ref name=BLM&gt;[[Ted Belytschko|T. Belytschko]], W. K. Liu, and B. Moran, 2000, '' Nonlinear Finite Elements for Continua and Structures'', John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right) = \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)} (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{f}\,dA.&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="50%" style="text-align:left"
!Proof for a material element
|-
|
Let {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be reference configuration of the region {{math|Ω(''t'')}}. Let
the motion and the [[deformation gradient]] be given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X}, t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''J''('''X''',''t'') {{=}} det '''''F'''''('''X''',''t'')}}. Define
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X}, t) = \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X}, t), t).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integrals in the current and the reference configurations are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV &amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t),t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\,dV_0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

That this derivation is for a material element is implicit in the time constancy of the reference configuration: it is constant in material coordinates. The time derivative of an integral over a volume is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(\int_{\Omega(t + \Delta t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t+\Delta t)\,dV - \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Converting into integrals over the reference configuration, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t) \, dV\right) = 
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(\int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\,dV_0 - \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\, dV_0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is independent of time, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left(\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t) - \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)}{\Delta t} \right)\,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\right)\,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\big)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big(J(\mathbf{X},t)\big)\right) \,dV_0. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of {{mvar|'''F'''}} is given by:
&lt;ref name=Gurtin&gt;[[Morton Gurtin|Gurtin M. E.]], 1981, ''An Introduction to Continuum Mechanics''. Academic Press, New York, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{X},t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\det\boldsymbol{F}) &amp;= (\det\boldsymbol{F})(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \\
&amp;= J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}\big(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t),t\big) \\
&amp;= J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t). \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\right)\,J(\mathbf{X},t)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\right)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,J(\mathbf{X},t) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left(\dot{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{x},t)+ \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,dV.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{f}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[material time derivative]] of {{math|'''f'''}}. The material derivative is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} + \big(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\big)\cdot\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right) =
\int_{\Omega(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} + \big(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\big)\cdot\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t) + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,dV,&lt;/math&gt;

or,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}\right)\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{v}(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{w}) + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

we then have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\mathbf{f}\otimes\mathbf{v})\right)\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[divergence theorem]] and the identity {{math|('''a''' ⊗ '''b''') · '''n''' {{=}} ('''b''' · '''n''')'''a'''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)}(\mathbf{f}\otimes\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dA \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{f}\,dA. \qquad \square
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== A special case ==
If we take {{math|Ω}} to be constant with respect to time, then {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and the identity reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega} f\,dV = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

as expected. (This simplification is not possible if the flow velocity is incorrectly used in place of the velocity of an area element.)

=== Interpretation and reduction to one dimension ===
The theorem is the higher-dimensional extension of [[differentiation under the integral sign]] and reduces to that expression in some cases. Suppose {{mvar|f}} is independent of {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}}, and that {{math|Ω(''t'')}} is a unit square in the {{mvar|yz}}-plane and has {{mvar|x}} limits {{math|''a''(''t'')}} and {{math|''b''(''t'')}}. Then Reynolds transport theorem reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(x,t)\,dx = \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\,dx + \frac{\partial b(t)}{\partial t} f\big(b(t),t\big) - \frac{\partial a(t)}{\partial t} f\big(a(t),t\big) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which, up to swapping {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|t}}, is the standard expression for differentiation under the integral sign.

'''Science Theatre''' is an [[undergraduate student]]-run [[science outreach]] organization at [[Michigan State University]]'s [[East Lansing]] campus.  Science Theatre visits schools and events throughout [[Michigan]] performing interactive science demonstrations for [[K-12]] students on-stage or up-close.  Science Theatre performers are undergraduate and [[graduate student]] volunteers and all performances are made free of charge.

The group's performances consist of arrangements from its catalog of more than seventy demonstrations in biology, chemistry, and physics.  Additionally, Science Theatre performs comprehensive shows in [[Astronomy]], [[Environmental science]], [[Pressure]], the [[Periodic Table]], [[Quantum Mechanics]], and [[FRIB]]-related science.

Science Theatre was founded in April 1991 under a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] and received the 1993 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology.  Science Theatre is a four-time winner of the Outreach Award from the Michigan State University Department of Physics and Astronomy.

'''SiMERR Australia''' is an Australia-wide research body. Its National Centre is located at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]], [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]], NSW, [[Australia]].

SiMERR Australia's main goal is to improve learning outcomes for students in regional and rural areas, particularly in the areas of [[science]], [[mathematics]] and [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The National Centre of Science, ICT, and Mathematics Education for Regional and Rural Australia (SiMERR) grew out of the Centre for Cognition Research into Learning and Teaching (CRiLT), which was part of the School of Education at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CRiLT, SiMERR focused on the curriculum areas of science, mathematics and ICT.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_history.php&lt;/ref&gt;

SiMERR opened its doors on 1 July 2004, with branches, or ''hubs'' opening in each state of Australia in the twelve months that followed in partnership universities, such as the [[University of Tasmania]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simerr.educ.utas.edu.au/launch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deakin University]] in Victoria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deakin.edu.au/arts-ed/education/simerr/launch.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The SiMERR National summit in 2005 brought together educators and other stakeholders for the first national meeting of its kind since the National Centre opening. The two-day summit brought together people from diverse bodies, such as teacher associations, Federal Government departments, universities, parent groups and educational authorities. Delegates discussed ways in which the educational disadvantage experienced by students in rural and regional areas may be addressed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/news/archives/000374.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
SiMERR Australia consists of a series of ''hubs'' located in each state in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/partnerships_hubs.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
SiMERR Australia's vision is to work to improve outcomes for students in science, ICT and mathematics so that:
* Parents can send their children to rural and regional schools and know they will experience equal opportunities for a quality education;
*Students can attend rural or regional schools and realise their academic potential in Science, ICT and Mathematics; and
*Teachers can work in rural and regional schools and be professionally connected and supported.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.une.edu.au/simerr/pages/aboutus_aims.php&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hypro zyklus 1 en 103.svg|thumb|345px|Sample [[hypnogram]] showing one sleep cycle (the first of the night) from NREM through REM]]
The '''sleep cycle''' is an oscillation between the [[slow-wave sleep|slow-wave]] and [[rapid eye movement sleep|REM]] (paradoxical) phases of [[sleep]]. It is sometimes called the '''[[ultradian]] sleep cycle''', '''sleep–dream cycle''', or '''REM-NREM cycle''', to distinguish it from the [[circadian rhythm|circadian]] alternation between sleep and [[wakefulness]]. In humans this cycle takes 1–2 hours.

== Characteristics ==
[[Electroencephalography]] readily shows the timing of sleep cycles by virtue of the marked distinction in [[brainwave]]s manifested during REM and non-REM sleep. [[Delta wave]] activity, correlating with slow-wave (deep) sleep, in particular shows regular oscillations throughout a good night’s sleep. Secretions of various [[hormone]]s, including [[renin]], [[growth hormone]], and [[prolactin]], correlate positively with delta-wave activity, while secretion of [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] correlates inversely.&lt;ref name=GronfierEtAl1999&gt;Claude Gronfier, Chantal Simon, François Piquard, Jean Ehrhart, &amp; Gabrielle Brandenberger, "[https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/8/2686/2864208/Neuroendocrine-Processes-Underlying-Ultradian Neuroendocrine Processes Underlying Ultradian Sleep Regulation in Man]", ''Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism'' 84(8), 1999; [[doi:10.1210/jcem.84.8.5893]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heart rate]] variability, well-known to increase during REM, predictably also correlates inversely with delta-wave oscillations over the ~90-minute cycle.&lt;ref name=BrandenbergerEtAl2001&gt;Gabrielle Brandenberger, Jean Erhart, François Piquard, &amp; Chantal Simon, "[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/db12/f3a46522450060675caad0a86d496434f01d.pdf Inverse coupling between ultradian oscillations in delta wave activity and heart rate variability during sleep]"; ''Clinical Neurophysiology'' 112(6), 2001; [[doi:10.1016/S1388-2457(01)00507-7]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homeostasis|Homeostatic]] functions, especially [[thermoregulation]], occur normally during non-REM sleep, but not during REM sleep. Thus, during REM sleep, body temperature tends to drift away from its mean level, and during non-REM sleep, to return to normal. Alternation between the stages therefore maintains body temperature within an acceptable range.&lt;ref&gt;Pier Luigi Parmeggiani, "Modulation of body core temperature in NREM sleep and REM sleep"; in Mallick et al. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans the transition between non-REM and REM is abrupt; in other animals, less so.&lt;ref name=McCarley2007 /&gt;

Researchers have proposed different models to elucidate the undoubtedly complex rhythm of electrochemical processes that result in the regular alternation of REM and NREM sleep. [[Monoamine]]s are active during NREMS but not REMS, whereas [[acetylcholine]] is more active during REMS. The [[activation-synthesis hypothesis|reciprocal interaction]] model proposed in the 1970s suggested a cyclic give and take between these two systems. More recent theories such as the "flip-flop" model proposed in the 2000s include the regulatory role of in inhibitory neurotransmitter [[gamma-aminobutyric acid]] (GABA).&lt;ref&gt;James T. McKenna, Lichao Chen, &amp; Robert McCarley, "Neuronal models of REM-sleep control: evolving concepts"; in Mallick et al. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Length ==
[[File:Sleep Cycle.svg|thumb|100px|Schematic illustration of a normal sleep cycle]]
The standard figure given for the average length of the sleep cycle in an adult man is 90 minutes. N1 (NREM stage 1) is when the person is drowsy or awake to falling asleep. Brain waves and muscle activity start to decrease at this stage. N2 is when the person experiences a light sleep. Eye movement has stopped by this time. Brain wave frequency and muscle tonus is decreased. The heart rate and body temperature goes down. N3 or even N4 are the most difficult stages to be awakened. Every part of the body is now relaxed, breathing, blood pressure and body temperature are reduced. The National Sleep Foundation discusses the different stages of NREM sleep and their importance. They describe REM sleep as "A unique state, in which dreams usually occur. The brain is awake and body paralyzed." This unique stage is usually when the person is in the deepest stage of sleep and dreams.&lt;ref name="Hartmann1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarley2007&gt;[[Robert W. McCarley]], "Neurobiology of REM and NREM sleep"; ''Sleep Medicine'' 8, June 2007; [[doi:10.1016/j.sleep.2007.03.005]].&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of 90 minutes for the average length of a sleep cycle was popularized by [[Nathaniel Kleitman]] around 1963.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt; Other sources give 90–110 minutes&lt;ref name=GronfierEtAl1999 /&gt; or 80–120 minutes.&lt;ref name=BrandenbergerEtAl2001 /&gt;

[[File:Sleeping asian elephant.jpg|thumb|left|The captive [[Asian elephant]] (pictured) is thought to have a sleep cycle of 72 minutes.&lt;ref name=Tobler1992&gt;Irene Tobler, "Behavioral sleep in the Asian elephant in captivity"; ''Sleep'' 15(1), 1992; {{PMID|1557589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[infant]]s the sleep cycle lasts about 50–60 minutes; average length increases as the human grows into adulthood. In [[cat]]s the sleep cycle lasts about 30 minutes, in [[rat]]s about 12 minutes, and in [[elephant]]s up to 120 minutes. (In this regard the [[ontogeny]] of the sleep cycle appears proportionate with [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes, which vary in proportion with organism size. However, shorter sleep cycles detected in some elephants complicate this theory.)&lt;ref name=McCarley2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobler1992 /&gt;

The cycle can be defined as lasting from the end of one REM period to the end of the next,&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt; or from the beginning of REM, or from the beginning of non-REM stage 2. (The decision of how to mark the periods makes a difference for research purposes because of the unavoidable inclusion or exclusion of the night’s first NREM or its final REM phase if directly preceding [[Wakefulness|awakening]].)&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979&gt;I. Feinberg &amp; T. C. Floyd, "[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22916025_Systematic_Trends_Across_the_Night_in_Human_Sleep_Cycles Systematic Trends Across the Night in Human Sleep Cycles]"; ''Psychophysiology'' 16(3), 1979; {{doi|10.1111/j.1469-8986.1979.tb02991.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 7–8-hour sleep probably includes five cycles, the middle two of which tend to be longer.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt; REM takes up more of the cycle as the night goes on.&lt;ref name=McCarley2007 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Aeschbach, "REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants"; in Mallick et al. (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awakening ==
Unprovoked awakening occurs most commonly during or after a period of REM sleep, as [[body temperature]] is rising.&lt;ref&gt;Torbjorn Åkerstedt, Michel Billiard, Michael Bonnet, Gianluca Ficca, Lucile Garma, Maurizio Mariotti, Piero Salzarulo, &amp; Hartmut Schulz. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hartmut_Schulz/publication/10948058_Awakening_from_sleep/links/0912f4ffde427e5ce9000000.pdf Awakening from sleep]", ''Sleep Medicine Reviews'' 6(4), 2002; [[doi:10.1053/smrv.2001.0202]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continuation during wakefulness ==
[[Ernest Hartmann]] found in 1968 that humans seem to continue a roughly 90-minute ultradian rhythm throughout a 24-hour day, whether they are asleep or awake.&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt; According to this hypothesis, during the period of this cycle corresponding with REM, people tend to [[daydream]] more and show less [[muscle tone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekkehard Othmer, Mary P. Hayden, and Robert Segelbaum, "Encephalic Cycles during Sleep and Wakefulness in Humans: a 24-Hour Pattern" ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/1726608 JSTOR]); ''Science'' 164(3878), 25 April 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Kleitman and others following have referred to this rhythm as the [[basic rest–activity cycle]], of which the "sleep cycle" would be a manifestation.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Kleitman, "[https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/5/4/311/2753285/Basic-Rest-Activity-Cycle-22-Years-Later Basic Rest-Activity Cycle—22 Years Later]"; ''Sleep'' 5(4), 1982; [[doi:10.1093/sleep/5.4.311]].&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty for this theory is the fact that a long non-REM phase almost always precedes REM, regardless of when in the cycle a person falls asleep.&lt;ref name=FeinbergFloyd1979 /&gt;

== Alteration ==
The sleep cycle has proven resistant to systematic alteration by [[drug]]s. Although some drugs shorten REM periods, they do not abolish the underlying rhythm. Deliberate REM deprivation shortens the cycle temporarily, as the brain moves into REM sleep more readily (the "REM rebound") in an apparent correction for the deprivation.&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt;

[[Michel Jouvet]] found that cats with forebrains removed continued to display REM-like characteristics on a 30-minute cycle, despite never entering slow-wave sleep.&lt;ref name=Hartmann1968 /&gt;

In the [[social science]]s there is a standing debate over the primacy of '''structure or agency''' in shaping human behaviour. ''[[Social structure|Structure]]'' is the recurrent patterned arrangements which influence or limit the choices and opportunities available.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=448}} ''[[Agency (sociology)|Agency]]'' is the capacity of individuals to act independently and to make their own free choices.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=448}} The structure versus agency debate may be understood as an issue of [[socialization]] against [[autonomy]] in determining whether an individual acts as a free agent or in a manner dictated by [[social structure]].

== Structure, socialization and autonomy ==
The debate over the primacy of [[social structure|structure]] or of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] relates to an issue at the heart of both classical and contemporary [[sociological theory]]: the question of [[social ontology]]: "What is the social world made of?" "What is a cause of the social world, and what is an effect?" "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?"

[[Structural functionalist]]s such as [[Émile Durkheim]] see structure and hierarchy as essential in establishing the very existence of society. Theorists such as [[Karl Marx]], by contrast, emphasize that the social structure can act to the detriment of the majority of individuals in a society. In both these instances "structure" may refer to something both [[economic materialism|material]] (or "[[economic]]") and [[cultural]] (i.e. related to [[norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Convention (norm)|customs]], [[tradition]]s and [[ideologies]]).

Some theorists put forward that what we know as our social existence is largely determined by the overall structure of society. The perceived agency of individuals can also mostly be explained by the operation of this structure. Theoretical systems aligned with this view include:

* [[structuralism]]
* some forms of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]]
* [[Marxism]]

All of these schools in this context can be seen as forms of [[holism]]&amp;nbsp;– the notion that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts".

On the other hand, other theorists stress the capacity of individual "agents" to construct and reconstruct their worlds. Theoretical systems aligned with this view include:

* [[methodological individualism]]
* social phenomenology
* [[interactionism]]
* [[ethnomethodology]]

Lastly, a third option, taken by many modern social theorists,{{sfnm |1a1=Bourdieu |1y=1977 |2a1=Bourdieu |2y=1990 |3a1=Hurrelmann |3y=1988}} attempts to find a point of balance between the two previous positions. They see structure and agency as complementary forces&amp;nbsp;– structure influences human behaviour, and humans are capable of changing the social structures they inhabit. [[Structuration]] is one prominent example of this view.

The first approach (emphasizing the importance of societal structure) dominated in classical sociology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Theorists saw unique aspects of the social world that could not be explained simply by the sum of the individuals present. Durkheim strongly believed that the collective had [[emergence|emergent]] properties of its own and saw the need for a science which would deal with this emergence.
The second approach (methodological individualism, etc.), however, also has a well-established position in social science. Many theorists still follow this course (economists, for example, tend to disregard any kind of [[holism]]).

The central debate, therefore, pits theorists committed to the notions of methodological holism against those committed to methodological individualism. The first notion, methodological holism, is the idea that actors are [[socialization|socialized]] and embedded into social structures and institutions that constrain, or enable, and generally shape the individuals' dispositions towards, and capacities for, action, and that this social structure should be taken as primary and most significant. The second notion, methodological individualism, is the idea that actors are the central theoretical and ontological elements in social systems, and social structure is an [[epiphenomenon]], a result and consequence of the actions and activities of interacting individuals.

== Major theorists ==

=== Georg Simmel ===
[[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918) was one of the first generation of German [[nonpositivist]] sociologists. His studies pioneered the concepts of social structure and agency. His most famous works today include ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' and ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]''.

=== Norbert Elias ===
[[Norbert Elias]] (1897–1990) was a German sociologist whose work focused on the relationship between power, behaviour, emotion, and knowledge over time. He significantly shaped what is called ''process sociology'' or ''[[figurational sociology]]''.

=== Talcott Parsons ===
[[Talcott Parsons]] (1902–1979) was an American sociologist and the main theorist of [[action theory (sociology)|action theory]] (misleadingly called "structural functionalism") in sociology from the 1930s in the [[United States]]. His works analyze social structure but in terms of voluntary action and through patterns of normative [[institutionalization]] by codifying its theoretical gestalt into a system-theoretical framework based on the idea of living systems and [[cybernetic]] [[High and low level|hierarchy]]. For Parsons there is no structure–agency problem. It is a pseudo-problem.  His development of Max Weber's means-end action structure is summarized in [[Instrumental and value-rational action]]

=== Pierre Bourdieu ===
[[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930–2002) was a French theorist who presented his ''theory of [[practice (social theory)|practice]]'' on the dichotomical understanding of the relation between agency and structure in a great number of publications, beginning with ''[[Esquisse d'une théorie de la pratique, précédé de trois études d'ethnologie kabyle|An Outline of the Theory of Practice]]'' in 1972, where he presented the concept of [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His book ''[[Distinction (book)|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), was named as one of the 20th century's 10 most important works of sociology by the [[International Sociological Association]].{{sfn|Swartz|2004|pp=360–361}}

The key concepts in Bourdieu's work are habitus, [[Field (Bourdieu)|field]], and capital. The agent is [[Socialization|socialized]] in a "field", an evolving set of roles and relationships in a social domain, where various forms of "capital" such as prestige or financial resources are at stake. As the agent accommodates to his or her roles and relationships in the context of his or her position in the field, the agent internalizes relationships and expectations for operating in that domain. These internalized relationships and habitual expectations and relationships form, over time, the ''habitus''.

Bourdieu's work attempts to reconcile structure and agency, as external structures are internalized into the habitus while the actions of the agent externalize interactions between actors into the [[social relation]]ships in the field. Bourdieu's theory, therefore, is a dialectic between "externalizing the internal", and "internalizing the external".

=== Berger and Luckmann ===
[[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in their [[The Social Construction of Reality|''Social Construction of Reality'']] (1966){{sfn|Berger|Luckmann|1966}} saw the relationship between structure and agency as [[dialectic]]al. Society forms the individuals who create society&amp;nbsp;– forming a continuous loop.{{sfn|Jary|Jary|1995|pp=664, 774}}{{verification needed|date=April 2018}}

=== James Coleman ===
The sociologist [[James Samuel Coleman]] famously diagramed the link between macrosociological phenomena and individual behaviour in what is commonly referred to as ''Coleman's Boat''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stoltz |first=Dustin |date=January 25, 2014 |title=Diagrams of Theory: Coleman's Boat |url=http://www.dustinstoltz.com/blog/2014/01/26/diagrams-of-theory-james-colemans-boat-bathtub |work=DustinStoltz.com |publisher=Dustin Stoltz |access-date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A macro-level phenomenon is described as instigating particular actions by individuals, which results in a subsequent macro-level phenomenon. In this way, individual action is taken in reference to a macro-sociological structure, and that action (by many individuals) results in change to that macro-structure.

=== Anthony Giddens ===
Contemporary sociology has generally aimed toward a reconciliation of structure and agency as concepts. [[Anthony Giddens]] has developed [[structuration]] theory in such works as ''The Constitution of Society'' (1984).{{sfn|Giddens|1984}} He presents a developed attempt to move beyond the dualism of structure and agency and argues for the "duality of structure"&amp;nbsp;– where social structure is both the medium and the outcome of [[social action]], and agents and structures as mutually constitutive entities with "equal ontological status".{{sfn|Jary|Jary|1995|pp=664, 774}} For Giddens, an agent's common interaction with structure, as a system of norms, is described as ''structuration''. The term ''[[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]]'' is used to refer to the ability of an agent to consciously alter his or her place in the social structure; thus [[globalization]] and the emergence of the 'post-traditional' society might be said to allow for "greater social reflexivity". Social and political sciences are therefore important because social knowledge, as self-knowledge, is potentially [[emancipation|emancipatory]].{{sfn|Gauntlett|2002|pp=93–96}}{{verification needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Klaus Hurrelmann ===
His access to research on structure and agency is characterized by socialization theory. Central to the theory is the life-long interaction between the individual and his/her longing for freedom and [[autonomy]], and society with its pressure of order and structure. As he states in his "Model of Productive Processing of Reality (PPR)", personality "does not form independently from society any of its functions or dimensions but is continuously being shaped, in a concrete, historically conveyed life world, throughout the entire space of the life span".{{sfn|Hurrelmann|1988|p=42}} The PPR model places the human subject in a social and ecological context that must be absorbed and processed subjectively. The human being as an autonomous subject has the lifelong task to harmonize the processes of social integration and personal individualization. This task is mastered in specific steps that are typical for the respective age and the achieved developmental stage ("developmental tasks").{{sfn|Hurrelmann|1988}}

=== Roberto Unger ===
The social theorist and legal philosopher [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] developed the thesis of [[negative capability]] to address this problem of [[agency (sociology)|agency]] in relation to [[social structure|structure]]. In his work on [[false necessity]]&amp;nbsp;– or anti-necessitarian social theory&amp;nbsp;– Unger recognizes the constraints of structure and its molding influence upon the individual, but at the same time finds the individual able to resist, deny, and transcend their context. The varieties of this resistance are negative capability. Unlike other theories of structure and agency, ''negative capability'' does not reduce the individual to a simple actor possessing only the dual capacity of compliance or rebellion, but rather sees him as able to partake in a variety of activities of self empowerment.{{sfnm |1a1=Lovin |1a2=Perry |1y=1990 |2a1=Unger |2y=2004 |2p=282}}

== Recent developments ==
A recent development in the debate is the critical realist structure/agency perspective embodied in [[Roy Bhaskar]]'s transformational model of social action (TMSA){{sfn|Bhaskar|2014}} which he later expanded into his concept of four-planar social being.{{sfn|Bhaskar|2008}} A major difference between Giddens' structuration theory and the TMSA is that the TMSA includes a temporal element (time). The TMSA has been further advocated and applied in other social science fields by additional authors, for example in [[economics]] by [[Tony Lawson]] and in [[sociology]] by [[Margaret Archer]]. In 2005, the ''Journal of Management Studies'' debated the merits of critical realism.{{sfnm |1a1=Contu |1a2=Willmott |1y=2005 |2a1=Reed |2y=2005a |3a1=Reed |3y=2005b}}

Kenneth Wilkinson in the ''Community in Rural America'' took an interactional/field theoretical perspective focusing on the role of community agency in contributing to the emergence of community.{{sfn|Wilkinson|1991}}

With [[critical psychology]] as a framework, the Danish psychologist Ole Dreier proposes in his book ''Psychotherapy in Everyday Life'' that we may best conceptualize persons as participants in social practices (that constitute social structures) who can either reproduce or change these social practices. This indicates that neither participants, nor social practices can be understood when looked at in isolation (in fact, this undermines the very idea of trying to do so), since practice and structure is co-created by participants and since the participants can only be called so, if they ''participate'' in a social practice.{{sfn|Dreier|2008|loc=ch.&amp;nbsp;2}}

The structure/agency debate continues to evolve, with contributions such as [[Nicos Mouzelis]]'s ''Sociological Theory: What Went Wrong?''{{sfn|Mouzelis|1995}} and Margaret Archer's ''Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach''{{sfn|Archer|1995}} continuing to push the ongoing development of structure/agency theory.  Work in information systems by Mutch (2010) has emphasized Archer's Realist Social Theory {{sfn|Mutch|2010}} as well as Robert Archer's application in the field of education policy.{{sfn|Archer|2002}} In entrepreneurship a discussion between Sarason et al. and Mole and Mole (2010) used Archer's theory to critique structuration by arguing that starting a new business organization needs to be understood in the context of social structure and agency. However, this depends upon one's view of structure, which differs between Giddens and Archer. Hence if strata in social reality have different ontologies, then they must be viewed as a dualism. Moreover, agents have causal power, and ultimate concerns which they try to fallibly put into practice. Mole and Mole propose entrepreneurship as the study of the interplay between the structures of a society and the agents within it.{{sfn|Mole|Mole|2010}}

== Purported differences in approach between European and American thinkers ==
{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}
While the structure–agency debate has been a central issue in social theory, and recent theoretical reconciliation attempts have been made, structure–agency theory has tended to develop more in European countries by European theorists, while social theorists from the United States have tended to focus instead on the issue of integration between [[macrosociology|macrosociological]] and [[microsociology|microsociological]] perspectives. [[George Ritzer]] examines these issues (and surveys the structure agency debate) in greater detail in his book ''Modern Sociological Theory'' (2000).{{sfn|Ritzer|2000}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">A '''system configuration''' ('''SC''') in [[systems engineering]] defines the computers, processes, and devices that compose the system and its boundary. More generally, the system configuration is the specific definition of the elements that define and/or prescribe what a system is composed of.

Alternatively, the term "system configuration" can be used to relate to a ''model'' (declarative) for abstract generalized systems. In this sense, the usage of the configuration information is not tailored to any specific usage, but stands alone as a data set.
A properly-configured system avoids resource-conflict problems, and makes it easier to upgrade a system with new equipment.

== Sample configuration ==
The following is a basic SC [[XML]] System Configuration:

''Description'':
This provides information about a single "site" (MyHouse) and specifies that there is one host with ''user-setup'' and ''mysql-db'' components. The host must have an account on it for a user named ''mysql'', with appropriate parameters. Notice that the configuration ''schema'' requires no [[XML]] tags that are [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]- or [[UNIX]]-specific. It simply presents ''data'' as standalone information – with no pretense for how the data is to be used.

This is the hallmark for a good system configuration model.

== Further extensions ==

The above model can be extended. For example, the ''user'' could have more attributes like "preferences" and "password". The components could depend on other components. Properties can be defined that are passed into sub-elements. The extensions can be endless (WATCHOUT: ''complexity'') and must be managed and well-thought-out to prevent "breaking" the idea of the system configuration.

== Usage ==

The usage for the model in practical terms falls into several categories: [[documentation]], [[system deployment|deployment]] &amp; [[System configuration#Operations|operations]].

=== Documentation ===

One use of the configuration is to simply record what a system ''is''. This documentation could in turn become quite extensive, thus complicating the data model. It is important to distinguish between  ''configuration'' data and ''descriptive'' data. Of course comments can be applied at any level, even in most tools, however the bloating of the data can reduce its usefulness. For example, the system configuration is not a place to record historical changes, or descriptions of design and intent for the various elements. The configuration data is simply to be "what it is" or "what we want it to be".

=== Deployment ===

Deployment involves interpreting a configuration data set and acting on that data to realize the configure the system accordingly. This may simply be a validation of what's there to confirm that the configuration is in effect.

Examples include a Perl library launched from the command line to read the configuration and begin launching processes on the local or remote hosts to install components. Also while the system is running, there may be a ''SystemConfiguration'' service that provides an interface (i.e. [[CORBA]] IDL interfaces) for other system applications to use to access the configuration data, and perform deployment-like actions.

=== Operations ===

When the system is in operation, there may be uses for the configuration data by specific kinds of services in the system. For example, a ''Secnager'' may access the configuration to acquire the MD5 passwords for the user accounts that are allowed to log into hosts remotely. A ''system monitor'' service (see: [[system monitoring]]) may use the data to determine "what to monitor" and "how to monitor" the system elements. A ''PresentationManager'' might use the data to access ''menu-items'' and ''views'' based on user access privileges.

'''Tolerance analysis''' is the general term for activities related to the study of potential accumulated variation in mechanical parts and assemblies. Its methods may be used on other types of systems subject to accumulated variation, such as mechanical and electrical systems. Engineers analyze tolerances for the purpose of evaluating [[geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]] (GD&amp;T).  Methods include 2D tolerance stacks, 3D [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, and datum conversions.

'''Tolerance stackups''' or '''tolerance stacks''' are used to describe the problem-solving process in [[mechanical engineering]] of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]].  Typically these dimensions and tolerances are specified on an engineering drawing. Arithmetic tolerance stackups use the worst-case maximum or minimum values of dimensions and tolerances to calculate the maximum and minimum distance (clearance or interference) between two features or parts. Statistical tolerance stackups evaluate the maximum and minimum values based on the absolute arithmetic calculation combined with some method for establishing likelihood of obtaining the maximum and minimum values, such as Root Sum Square (RSS) or Monte-Carlo methods.

==Modeling==
In performing a tolerance analysis, there are two fundamentally different analysis tools for predicting stackup variation: worst-case analysis and statistical analysis.

===Worst-case===
Worst-case tolerance analysis is the traditional type of tolerance stackup calculation. The individual variables are placed at their tolerance limits in order to make the measurement as large or as small as possible. The worst-case model does not consider the distribution of the individual variables, but rather that those variables do not exceed their respective specified limits. This model predicts the maximum expected variation of the measurement. Designing to worst-case tolerance requirements guarantees 100 percent of the parts will assemble and function properly, regardless of the actual component variation. The major drawback is that the worst-case model often requires very tight individual component tolerances. The obvious result is expensive manufacturing and inspection processes and/or high scrap rates. Worst-case tolerancing is often required by the customer for critical mechanical interfaces and spare part replacement interfaces. When worst-case tolerancing is not a contract requirement, properly applied statistical tolerancing can ensure acceptable assembly yields with increased component tolerances and lower fabrication costs.

===Statistical variation===
The statistical variation analysis model takes advantage of the principles of statistics to relax the component tolerances without sacrificing quality. Each component’s variation is modeled as a statistical distribution and these distributions are summed to predict the distribution of the assembly measurement. Thus, statistical variation analysis predicts a distribution that describes the assembly variation, not the extreme values of that variation. This analysis model provides increased design flexibility by allowing the designer to design to any quality level, not just 100 percent.

There are two chief methods for performing the statistical analysis. In one, the expected distributions are modified in accordance with the relevant geometric multipliers within tolerance limits and then combined using mathematical operations to provide a composite of the distributions. The geometric multipliers are generated by making small deltas to the nominal dimensions. The immediate value to this method is that the output is smooth, but it fails to account for geometric misalignment allowed for by the tolerances; if a size dimension is placed between two parallel surfaces, it is assumed the surfaces will remain parallel, even though the tolerance does not require this. Because the CAD engine performs the variation sensitivity analysis, there is no output available to drive secondary programs such as stress analysis. This software approach is typified in CE-TOL aka TI-TOL, originally from ADCATS at BYU

In the other, the variations are simulated by allowing random changes to geometry, constrained by expected distributions within allowed tolerances with the resulting parts assembled, and then measurements of critical places are recorded as if in an actual manufacturing environment. The collected data is analyzed to find a fit with a known distribution and mean and standard deviations derived from them. The immediate value to this method is that the output represents what is acceptable, even when that is from imperfect geometry and, because it uses recorded data to perform its analysis, it is possible to include actual factory inspection data into the analysis to see the effect of proposed changes on real data. In addition, because the engine for the analysis is performing the variation internally, not based on CAD regeneration, it is possible to link the variation engine output to another program. For example, a rectangular bar may vary in width and thickness; the variation engine could output those numbers to a stress program which passes back peak stress as a result and the dimensional variation be used to determine likely stress variations. The disadvantage is that each run is unique, so there will be variation from analysis to analysis for the output distribution and mean, just like would come from a factory. This approach was used by Variation Systems Analysis from VSA, now owned by Siemens.

While no official engineering standard covers the process or format of tolerance analysis and stackups, these are essential components of good [[product design]]. Tolerance stackups should be used as part of the mechanical design process, both as a predictive and a problem-solving tool. The methods used to conduct a tolerance stackup depend somewhat upon the engineering dimensioning and tolerancing standards that are referenced in the engineering documentation, such as [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME) Y14.5, ASME Y14.41, or the relevant ISO dimensioning and tolerancing standards. Understanding the tolerances, concepts and boundaries created by these standards is vital to performing accurate calculations.

Tolerance stackups serve engineers by:
* helping them study dimensional relationships within an assembly.
* giving designers a means of calculating part tolerances.
* helping engineers compare design proposals.
* helping designers produce complete drawings.

== Concept of Tolerance vector loop ==
The starting point for the tolerance loop; typically this is one side of an intended gap, after pushing the various parts in the assembly to one side or another of their loose range of motion. Vector loops define the assembly constraints that locate the parts of the assembly relative to each other. The vectors represent the dimensions that contribute to tolerance stackup in the assembly. The vectors are joined tip-to-tail, forming a chain, passing through each part in the assembly in succession. A vector loop must obey certain modeling rules as it passes through a part. It must:
# enter through a joint, 
# follow the datum path to the Datum Reference Frame (DRF), 
# follow a second datum path leading to another joint, and
# exit to the next adjacent part in the assembly.
Additional modeling rules for vector loops include: 
# Loops must pass through every part and every joint in the assembly. 
# A single vector loop may not pass through the same part or the same joint twice, but it may start and end in the same part. 
# If a vector loop includes the exact same dimension twice, in opposite directions, the dimension is redundant and must be omitted. 
# There must be enough loops to solve for all of the kinematic variables (joint degrees of freedom). You will need one loop for each three variables.
The above rules will vary on depending on 1D, 2D or 3D tolerance stackup method used.

== Concerns with tolerance stackups ==
A safety factor is often included in designs because of concerns about:
* Operational temperature and pressure of the parts or assembly.
* Wear.
* Deflection of components after assembly.
* The possibility or probability that the parts are slightly out of specification (but passed inspection).
* The sensitivity or importance of the stack (what happens if the design conditions are not met).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26239">'''Transcription activator-like effector nucleases''' ('''TALEN''') are [[restriction enzyme]]s that can be engineered to cut specific sequences of DNA. They are made by fusing a [[TAL effector]] [[DNA-binding domain]] to a DNA cleavage domain (a [[nuclease]] which cuts DNA strands).

==Engineering TALEN constructs==

[[File:TALEN copy.svg|440px|thumb|Workflow of genome editing of Your Favorite Gene (YFG) using TALEN. The target sequence is identified, a corresponding TALEN sequence is engineered and inserted into a plasmid. The plasmid is inserted into the target cell where it is translated to produce the functional TALEN, which enters the nucleus and binds and cleaves the target sequence. Depending on the application, this can be used to introduce an error (to knock out a target gene) or to introduce a new DNA sequence into the target gene.]]

==Transfection==
Once the TALEN constructs have been assembled, they are inserted into [[plasmid]]s; the target cells are then [[Transfection|transfected]] with the plasmids, and the gene products are [[Gene expression|expressed]] and enter the nucleus to access the genome. Alternatively, TALEN constructs can be delivered to the cells as mRNAs, which removes the possibility of genomic integration of the TALEN-expressing protein. Using an mRNA vector can also dramatically increase the level of homology directed repair (HDR) and the success of introgression during gene editing.

==Genome editing==

=== Mechanisms ===
TALEN can be used to edit genomes by inducing double-strand breaks (DSB), which cells respond to with repair mechanisms.

[[Non-homologous end joining]] (NHEJ) directly ligates DNA from either side of a double-strand break where there is very little or no sequence overlap for annealing. This repair mechanism induces errors in the genome via [[indel]]s (insertion or deletion), or chromosomal rearrangement; any such errors may render the gene products coded at that location non-functional.&lt;ref name= Miller2011/&gt;  Because this activity can vary depending on the species, cell type, target gene, and nuclease used, it should be monitored when designing new systems.  A simple heteroduplex cleavage assay can be run which detects any difference between two alleles amplified by PCR. Cleavage products can be visualized on simple agarose gels or slab gel systems.

Alternatively, DNA can be introduced into a genome through NHEJ in the presence of exogenous double-stranded DNA fragments.&lt;ref name= Miller2011/&gt;

[[Homology directed repair]] can also introduce foreign DNA at the DSB as the transfected double-stranded sequences are used as templates for the repair enzymes.&lt;ref name= Miller2011/&gt;

In theory, the genome-wide specificity of engineered TALEN fusions allows for correction of errors at individual genetic loci via homology-directed repair from a correct exogenous template.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;  In reality, however, the ''in situ'' application of TALEN is currently limited by the lack of an efficient delivery mechanism, unknown immunogenic factors, and uncertainty in the specificity of TALEN binding.&lt;ref name="Carlson" /&gt;

Another emerging application of TALEN is its ability to combine with other genome engineering tools, such as [[meganuclease]]s. The DNA binding region of a TAL effector can be combined with the cleavage domain of a meganuclease to create a hybrid architecture combining the ease of engineering and highly specific DNA binding activity of a TAL effector with the low site frequency and specificity of a meganuclease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boissel S, Jarjour J, Astrakhan A, Adey A, Gouble A, Duchateau P, Shendure J, Stoddard BL, Certo MT, Baker D, Scharenberg AM | title = megaTALs: a rare-cleaving nuclease architecture for therapeutic genome engineering | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 2591–601 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24285304 | pmc = 3936731 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt1224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to other genome editing techniques TALEN falls in the middle in terms of difficulty and cost. Unlike [[Zinc finger nuclease|ZFNs]], TALEN recognizes single nucleotides. It's far more straightforward to engineer interactions between TALEN DNA binding domains and their target nucleotides than it is to create interactions with ZNFs and their target nucleotide triplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/jax-blog/2014/march/pros-and-cons-of-znfs-talens-and-crispr-cas|title=Pros and Cons Of ZFNS, TALENS, AND CRISPR/CAS|last=|first=|date=March 2014|website=The Jackson Laboratory|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[CRISPR]] relies on ribonucleotide complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome and they can be cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.

== TAL effector nuclease precision ==
The off-target activity of an active nuclease may lead to unwanted double-strand breaks and may consequently yield chromosomal rearrangements and/or cell death.  Studies have been carried out to compare the relative nuclease-associated toxicity of available technologies.  Based on these studies &lt;ref name="Mussolino2011"/&gt; and the maximal theoretical distance between DNA binding and nuclease activity, TALEN constructs are believed to have the greatest precision of the currently available technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-New-Era-Precision-Gene-Editing-09Sept15.pdf|title = Boston Consulting Group - Report on Gene Editing Precision|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Boglioli|first = Elsy|last2 = Richard|first2 = Magali}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Game''', sometimes called the '''World Peace Game''', is an educational simulation developed by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in 1961 to help create solutions to [[overpopulation]] and the uneven distribution of global resources. This alternative to [[Wargaming|war games]] uses Fuller's [[Dymaxion map]] and requires a group of players to cooperatively solve a set of metaphorical scenarios, thus challenging the dominant nation-state perspective with a more holistic "total world" view. The idea was to "make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Game|url=http://bfi.org/about-bucky/buckys-big-ideas/world-game|publisher=Buckminster Fuller Institute|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing the [[quality of life]] for all people.

Fuller first publicly proposed the concept as the [[core curriculum]] at the (then new) [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]]. He proposed it again in 1964 for the 1967 [[Expo 67|International and Universal Exposition]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.

In a preamble to World Game documents released in 1970, Fuller identified it very closely with his 'Guinea Pig 'B' experiment' and his 'Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science' lifework. He claimed intellectual property rights as well to control what he considered to be misapplication of his idea by others. He also claimed he had been playing it 'longhand' without the assistance of computers since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/buckys-big-ideas/world-game World Game article at the Buckminster Fuller Institute Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1972, the World Game Institute was founded in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] by Fuller, [[Medard Gabel]], [[Howard J. Brown (businessman)|Howard J. Brown]] and others.

In 1980, the World Game Institute and the World Resources Inventory published the World Energy Data Sheet.  The World Energy Data Sheet compiled a nation by nation summary of energy production, resources, and consumption. The information was compiled in tables and map formats. The project was researched by Seth Snyder and overseen by Medard Gabel.  The work was used during a World Game (Philadelphia, summer 1980).

By 1993, the World Game Institute developed and sold an educational software package called Global Recall, which contained global data, maps, an encyclopedia of world problems, and tools for developing solutions to world problems.  The package was a computer-based simulation game intended for use by high school and college students in learning about world problems and how to solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitez|first=Michael|title=Software Provides Opportunity To Think Globally The World Game Institute Has Put Its Ideas On Computer Disk|url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-05-20/news/25966386_1_world-game-global-citizens-software|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=May 20, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a for-profit educational company named o.s. Earth, Inc. purchased the principal assets of the World Game Institute and has been offering a Global Simulation Workshop that is a 'direct descendant of Buckminster Fuller's famous World Game.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osearth.com/ o.s.Earth Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
