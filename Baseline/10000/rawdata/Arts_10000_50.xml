'''Ajoka Theatre''' ([[Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|اجوکا ناٹک}}, literal translation of ''Ajoka'': "today/present") is a [[Pakistan]]i [[not-for-profit arts organization]] based in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], with focus on producing and performing social theatrical stage productions, founded in 1984.&lt;ref name="DSB"&gt;Singh Bajeli, Diwan (2 February 2007) [http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/02/02/stories/2007020201230300.htm ''A voice for peace and amity''], The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed by director, actress and playwright, [[Madeeha Gauhar]] at peak of the tensions during the state of emergency under the regime of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]].&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt; Ajoka Theatre received the prestigious [[Prince Claus Awards|Prince Claus Award]]&lt;ref&gt;(16 December 2003) [http://www.dawn.com/news/223580/madeeha-gauhar-gets-dutch-award ''Madeeha Gauhar gets Dutch awards''], Dawn News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince Claus Awards, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/programmes/awards award winners of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2006 and the [[Theatre Pasta Theatre Awards|International Theatre Pasta Award]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Theatre Pasta (16 July 2008) [http://theatrepasta.com/?p=81 interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219114602/http://theatrepasta.com/?p=81 |date=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the group have staged many popular society critical pieces in theatres, on the streets and in public spaces, as well as in productions for television and on video. Ajoka Theatre has not only performed in Pakistan, but has also in the [[South Asia]]n region, in countries like [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], as well as in [[Europe]] and [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name="PCA"&gt;Prince Claus Fund, [http://princeclausfund.org/en/network/user/id/241 profile]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group focuses on promotion of a [[justice|just]], [[Humanism|humane]], [[Secularity|secular]] and [[Egalitarianism|equal]] society, alongside the subject of [[women's rights]] in a society that is greatly dominated by men.&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

The groups first ever theatrical performance was ''Jaloos (Procession)'' written by veteran Indian playwright [[Badal Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="DSB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Sher (14 May 2014) [http://tribune.com.pk/story/708368/30-years-of-ajoka/ ''30 years of Ajoka''], The Express Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The style of Ajoka's performances can be characterised as an elaboration on the [[oral tradition]] of [[Bhand]] and [[Nautanki]] that found a flourishing base in the area that currently overlaps the province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. In spite of the Western education of Gauhar, she does not limit herself to classical Western theatre techniques. Instead, she mixes authentic Pakistani elements, combining it with contemporary sentiments.&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;

==History==
Gauhar was born in 1956 in [[Karachi]]. After she obtained a [[Master of Arts]] degree in [[English literature]], she moved to [[England]] where she obtained another master's degree, in [[theatre]] sciences at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="DSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;Rashed, Fariha (16 October 2005) [https://archive.is/20130408022347/http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/images/archive/051016/images1.htm ''The Ajoka awakening'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, after returning to [[Lahore]], Gauhar and her husband [[Shahid Nadeem]] founded Ajoka Theatre, the first theatre group of significance there. 
 
In 2007, Ajoka performed a piece that was written and directed by Gauhar, called ''[[Burqavaganza]]'' (''[[Burqa]]-vaganza''), which led to great controversy. Actors dressed in burkas put themes on the stage like sexual discrimination, intolerance and fanaticism. From a Western perspective, the piece was a rather innocent performance on hypocrisy of a society that bathes in corruption. In her own country though, Members of Parliament called for a ban of it, and the Minister of Culture threatened with sanctions when it would be staged any longer. In spite of the ban, [[non-governmental organisation]]s and [[women's rights]] activists had the theatre piece translated into English and staged performances internationally as an sign of support to Ajoka.&lt;ref&gt;Rehman, Sonya (20 June 2008) [http://sonyarehman.wordpress.com/2008/06/20/viva-ajoka/ ''Viva Ajoka!''], Sonya Rehman's Archive ~ Of Most Things Pakistani&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borah, Prabalika M.

'''''An Uncommon Story''''' ({{lang-ru|Необыкнове́нная исто́рия|translit=Neobyknovennaya istoriya}}) is an [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] literary [[memoir]] by [[Ivan Goncharov]], written in 1875&amp;ndash;1876 (with an 1878 addendum) and first published in [[1924 in literature|1924]]. Parts of it were later included into ''The Complete Goncharov'' (1978&amp;ndash;1980, Vol VII).

According to the [[Gale (publisher)|''Gale Encyclopedia of Biography'']], ''An Uncommon Story'' "…confirmed the psychopathic side of [its author's] personality; it is an account of imagined plots against him and imagined attempts by others to plagiarize his work."&lt;ref name="gale"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date=| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/ivan-goncharov| title =Ivan Aleksandrovich Goncharov| publisher  = Gale Encyclopedia of Biography| accessdate = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers disagreed, finding there was much more veracity to Goncharov's claims than had previously been reported.&lt;ref name="feb"&gt;{{cite web | author = Budanova, N.F.| date = | url = http://feb-web.ru/feb/gonchar/critics/gmi/gmi-1842.htm| script-title=The Uncommon Story: The True Facts. Foreword. | publisher  = feb-web.ru|language=Russian| accessdate = 2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''An Uncommon Story'' had one single agenda: to prove that [[Ivan Turgenev]] has not only borrowed  major ideas, character types, and conflicts from Goncharov's ''[[The Precipice (Ivan Goncharov)|The Precipice]]'' to use in his ''[[Home of the Gentry]]'', but also (in the author's words) "infused the best European literature with them." 

''An Uncommon Story'' caused much debate; that it was published at all caused some controversy, for according to its author's special request, these memoirs were to be issued only in case plagiarism accusations were brought against him after his death. Since no such allegations have ever been made, Goncharov's book was formally published contrary to his will. In this same note, however, the author mentioned that he wished for future "historians of Russian literature" to take hold of it. 

It was the latter who deemed the publication advisable since (according to scholar N. F. Budanova) "it shed an important light upon Goncharov and Turgenev's relations," and also provided researchers with "valuable material for making a comparative analysis of both classic novels which, indeed, had striking similarities."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Ivan Goncharov.jpg|thumb|left|Ivan Goncharov]]
In the mid-1850s, Ivan Goncharov and Ivan Turgenev were on friendly terms. Goncharov, who'd launched his career in a spectacular fashion and was declared by some a "true [[Nikolay Gogol]] heir", had no serious rival as a novelist on the Russian literary scene until the late 1850s; [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] was still in exile, [[Leo Tolstoy]] was writing novelets and short stories, and Turgenev was considered a master of miniatures. 

The success of ''[[Home of the Gentry]]'' must have come as a surprise to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: "Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but you seem to be eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama.&lt;ref&gt;Russian: ''Если смею выразить Вам взгляд мой на Ваш талант, то скажу, что Вам дан нежный, верный рисунок и звуки, а Вы порываетесь строить огромные здания... и хотите дать драму.&lt;/ref&gt; Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Literary historians argued later that Turgenev's overnight success might have seemed totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, felt like he was the only master of his field. Goncharov produced one  novel in a decade, but his new rival did it in a seemingly fleeting manner, which must have made the injustice look even more gross. 

Of all the possible explanations for the improbable manner in which Turgenev, a master of miniatures, could have suddenly re-invented himself as a novelist, only one for Goncharov looked plausible: the younger man must have nicked his own ideas, structures, conflicts, and character types, and "with these pearls started to play his own lyre." 

Some commentators later dismissed such claims as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general [[hypochondria]]. Others argued that this would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were not altogether groundless. At least one fact was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;
[[File:Iwan Turgenew.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Turgenev]]]]

In 1887, four years after Turgenev's death, Goncharov attached a note to this novel's original text, which read: "This manuscript contains the material for a novel which in 1869, as ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' was about to publish it, I gave the title ''The Precipice''. Before that I used to refer to is as ''Raisky, the Artist'' and was freely expounding upon it to my fellow writers, mostly to Turgenev. It was to him that in 1855, soon after returning from my around-the-world journey, I recounted in detail, in the course of several meetings, all the details of it [...] because he, being a perceptive and sensitive  man of art, seemed to be most sympathetic to those of my works that he promised a great future for."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two men were very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an impeccable literary taste. In ''An Uncommon Story'' he wrote: "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, ''[[Oblomov]]'' will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes."&lt;ref&gt;An Uncommon Story. P.202.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tellingly, Turgenev even prompted minor detail to ''Oblomov'', namely, in the scene where Olga and Schtoltz converse in [[Switzerland]]. Goncharov acknowledged Turgenev's priority in "discovering nihilism", and admitted there was historical and artistic authenticity to Bazarov's character. In the late 1850s relations between the two apparently deteriorated, and in March 1860 things came to a head.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

===Accusations of plagiarism===
Prior to the publication of ''Home of the Gentry'', Goncharov took an opportunity to get acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from ''The Precipice'', the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: "Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar [to that of mine]; you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied." In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in ''The Precipice''), which, being "a weak one", had been "magnanimously sacrificed" by Turgenev.&lt;ref&gt;''Complete Goncharov'', Moscow, 1978, Vol.VIII, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of ''Home of the Gentry'', but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this  corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, "it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this."&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

On March 29, 1860, in the critic [[Stepan Dudyshkin]]'s flat an "arbitrary court" took place, with [[Pavel Annenkov]], [[Alexander Druzhinin]] and [[Aleksandr Nikitenko]] present. The court's verdict was conciliatory: "Since both Turgenev's and Goncharov's novels have had for their ground the very same soil of Russian reality, similarities and coincidences, in ideas and even phraseology, would only be natural and for both writers excusable."&lt;ref&gt;Annenkov, Pavel. Literature Memoirs. М., 1960. Pp.441—442. //Nikitenko, Vol.2, pp.115—116.&lt;/ref&gt; After that Goncharov and Turgenev stopped communicating. In 1864, at Druzhinin's funeral, they made peace but never became friends again, even if Turgenev in one of his letters mentioned his feeling "very close to Goncharov." As Turgenev's new novels were appearing one after another, Goncharov was becoming more and more resentful, apparently seeing his worst suspicions confirmed.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

====The manuscript====
The original manuscript, a notebook, consisting of 53 pages, held in the Russian National Library, according to N.Budanova, looks very much like a rough copy that's never been revisited by the author, with lots of edits, some fragments blotted out so as to be unreconstructable. The notebook consists of two parts, written in different times. Part 1, ''Uncommon Story (True Facts)'', pages 1–50, is dated December 1875 and January 1876. The author's commentary to it reads: {{quote|Hereby I express my will for my ancestors or whoever get hold of this manuscript, to extract from it and make public whatever they feel necessary [...] but only if, through Turgenev’s efforts, or otherwise, a notion (based on similarities between my novel and those of Turgenev and some West European authors) should become prevalent in the press that it was me who had borrowed from them and not vice versa, and that I was just following other people's steps. [Otherwise]... I would like this manuscript to be burnt down or transferred to the Imperial Public library for the use of future historians of Russian literature.}} 
Part 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, had another note attached to it: "I've sealed the previous fifty pages in an envelope as finished. But in the course of the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue..." There is an inscription on the envelope: "These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883".&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

== Analysis ==
''An Uncommon Story'' was first published in 1924 by the Russian Public Library archives, with a foreword by D. I. Abramovich. It was preceded by the publication in 1923 of the whole of the Goncharov-Turgenev correspondence by Boris Engelgardt, who accompanied it with a thorough analysis of the two authors' relations.&lt;ref&gt;I.A.Goncharov and I.S.Turgenev. From the Unpublished material of the Pushkin House. Foreword and commentaries by B.M. Engelgardt, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; For decades, the issue lay dormant.

Pp.326—349.&lt;/ref&gt; Having drawn the comparative analysis of Turgenev's ''[[On the Eve]]'' and Goncharov's ''The Precipice'', the author came to the conclusion: the former most obviously used "methods of novel-structuring he'd borrowed from other writers, Goncharov included". According to Batyuto, when it came to the art of building up a novel, Turgenev in his early days was certainly taking cues from Goncharov.&lt;ref&gt;Batyuto, p.347.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1976, O. Demikhovskaya in an article called "I.A. Goncharov and I.S. Turgenev" criticized the 'biased approach' to the problem demonstrated by Engelgardt, who in 1923 made an emphasis on Goncharov's personal idiosyncrasies as being the major factor behind the conflict. She presented Turgenev as the guilty party and recounted numerous quarrels he had with [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Materials, 1976. Pp.85—94.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to V. Nezdvedtsky, the reason behind the two writers' conflict was "the typological resemblances of both and Goncharov's jealousy of his more fortunate rival." The author poined out that, while working on a completely new type of Russian novel (and leaving behind Grigorovich and Pisemsky with their traditionalism), both Goncharov (who first came up with the idea of plotline's "poetisation") and Turgenev were up against common challenges and were therefore keenly aware of each other's works. This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in ''An Uncommon Story'' drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences.&lt;ref&gt;Nezdvedtsky, V.A. The Uncommon Story, VII, pp.449—458 // The Turgenev vs Goncharov conflict as an issue for literary historians. // Slavica. Debrecen. 1986. Vol.XXIII. Pp.315—332.&lt;/ref&gt; N. Budanova thought such thing would have been impossible at the time for it would have been perceived by the public as a confession of plagiarism.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt; 

While the fact that ''The Precipice'' and ''Home of the Gentry'' had a lot in common, Goncharov's other allegations have been unanimously dismissed by literary historians as groundless. Parallels he's drawn between ''The Precipice'' and Turgenev's ''[[Fathers and Sons (novel)|Fathers and Sons]]'' were proved to be far-fetched, as was his claim that ''[[Torrents of Spring]]'', was 'an improvisation' on ''The Precipice''{{'}} part I.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt; Goncharov's claims that some European authors started to use his ideas and character types through Turgenev's influence are seen to be void, although Budanova noted that  some contemporary critics might have prompted such an idea to the author who in his later life grew to be highly impressionable and suspicious. For example, [[Aleksey Suvorin]] in his article "The French Society in [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s new novel" suggested that the ''[[Sentimental Education]]''{{'}} main character Frédéric Moreau was "akin to the so-called 'people of the 1840s' in Russia and that he was "similar to Raisky... its just that Flaubert has treated his character more objectively than our respected novelist."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vestnik Evropy]]''. 1870, No.2. P.822.&lt;/ref&gt; Some similarities between Goncharov's characters and those of [[Madame Bovary]] have been mentioned by Russian critics too.&lt;ref name="feb"/&gt;

Goncharov's allegations, made in ''An Uncommon Story'', that Turgenev did a lot of harm to Russian literature in the West, have been proved invalid. On the contrary, Turgenev has been praised by many as an avid a promoter of Russian classics: his own translations of the works by [[Pushkin]], [[Lermontov]] and [[Gogol]] into French did a lot to popularize them in Europe. Several translations of important Russian works have been made through his recommendations. "We have every reason to insist that Turgenev preached Russian literature to the West. Forms and methods of such popularization have been different, and it is upon Turgenev's great authority that Western views on many Russian novels are still being based upon," wrote Soviet scholar Mikhail Alekseev in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Alexeyev, M.P. I.S.Turgenev as the Russian Literature's propagator in the West. The works of the New Russian literature dpt. Moscow, Leningrad, 1948. P.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12229">[[Image:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|Schopenhauer claimed that art provides knowledge of eternal Platonic Ideas and also results in temporary relief from the pressures of willing.]]
'''Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics''' result from his doctrine of the primacy of the [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] as the ''[[thing in itself]]'', the ground of life and all being; and from his judgment that individuation of the Will is [[evil]].  [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] held that [[art]] offers a way for people to temporarily escape the suffering that results from willing.&lt;ref&gt;"…aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when
we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves." (Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. I, § 68, Dover page 390)
&lt;/ref&gt; Basing his doctrine on the dual aspect of the world as will and the world as representation, he taught that if [[consciousness]] or attention is fully engrossed, absorbed, or occupied with the world as painless representations or images, then there is no consciousness of the world as painful willing. Aesthetic pleasure results from being a spectator of "the world as representation" [mental image or idea] without any experience of "the world as will" [need, craving, urge].&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer's Account of Aesthetic Experience. TJ Diffey - ''The British Journal of Aesthetics'', 1990 - Br Soc Aesthetics&lt;/ref&gt; Art, according to Schopenhauer, also provides essential knowledge of the world’s objects in a way that is more profound than science or everyday experience.&lt;ref&gt;"[A]esthetics is at the heart of philosophy for Schopenhauer: art and aesthetic experience not only provide escape from an otherwise miserable existence, but attain an objectivity explicitly superior to that of science or ordinary empirical knowledge." "Knowledge and Tranquility: Schopenhauer on the Value of Art," [[Christopher Janaway]], in Dale Jacquette (ed.), ''Schopenhauer, Philosophy and the Arts'', ch. 2, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==An extension of his philosophy==
For Schopenhauer, the Will is an aimless desire to perpetuate itself, the basis of [[life]].  Desire engendered by the Will is the source of all the sorrow in the world; each satisfied desire leaves us either with boredom, or with some new desire to take its place.  A world in thrall to Will is necessarily a world of suffering.  Since the Will is the source of life, and our very bodies are stamped with its image and designed to serve its purpose, the human intellect is, in Schopenhauer's [[simile]], like a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulders of a blind giant.

Schopenhauer's [[aesthetics]] is an attempt to break out of the [[pessimism]] that naturally comes from this world view.  Schopenhauer believed that what distinguished ''aesthetic experiences'' from other experiences is that contemplation of the object of aesthetic appreciation temporarily allowed the subject a respite from the strife of desire, and allowed the subject to enter a realm of purely mental enjoyment, the world purely as representation or mental image.  The more a person's mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will.&lt;ref&gt;"Schopenhauer&amp;hellip;regards art as the only means of temporarily escaping the fundamentally futile nature of reality. Art’s essential role is&amp;hellip;to enable us to escape what we already intuitively know about the irredeemable nature of what we are." ([[Andrew Bowie]], ''Aesthetics and subjectivity: from Kant to Nietzsche'', Chapter 8, "Nietzsche and the fate of Romantic thought," "Schopenhauer: music as metaphysics," Manchester University Press, 2003, Page 262.)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer analysed [[art]] from its effects, both on the personality of the artist, and the personality of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bryan Magee|Magee, Bryan]], ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'' (Oxford University Press, revised edition, 1977) {{ISBN|0-19-823722-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Schopenhauerian artistic genius==
Schopenhauer believed that while all people were in thrall to the Will, the quality and intensity of their subjection differed:

:Only through the pure contemplation . . . which becomes absorbed entirely in the object, are the Ideas comprehended; and the nature of ''genius'' consists precisely in the preëminent ability for such contemplation. . . . (T)his demands a complete forgetting of our own person.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (v. 1. ss. 185)&lt;/ref&gt;

The aesthetic experience temporarily emancipates the subject from the Will's domination and raises them to a level of pure perception.  "On the occurrence of an aesthetic appreciation, the will thereby vanishes entirely from consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' 2:415&lt;/ref&gt;  Genuine art cannot be created by anyone who merely follows standard artistic rules. A genius is required, that is, a person who creates original art without concern for rules. The personality of the artist was also supposed to be less subject to Will than most: such a person was a Schopenhauerian [[genius]], a person whose exceptional predominance of intellect over Will made them relatively aloof from earthly cares and concerns.  The [[poetry|poet]] living in a [[garret]], the [[absent-minded professor]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] struggling with madness, are all (at least in the popular mind) examples of Schopenhauer's geniuses: so fixed on their art that they neglect the "business of life" that in Schopenhauer's mind meant only the domination of the evil and painful Will.  For Schopenhauer, the relative lack of competence of the artist and the thinker for practical pursuits was no mere [[stereotype]]: it was cause and effect.

Schopenhauer believed that what gives arts such as [[literature]] and [[sculpture]] their value was the extent to which they incorporated pure perceptions.  But, being concerned with human forms (at least in Schopenhauer's day) and human emotions, these art forms were inferior to [[music]], which being a direct manifestation of will, was to Schopenhauer's mind the highest form of art.  Schopenhauer's philosophy of music was influential in the works of [[Richard Wagner]].  Wagner was an enthusiastic reader of Schopenhauer, and recommended the reading of Schopenhauer to his friends.  His published works on [[music theory]] changed over time, and became more aligned with Schopenhauer's thought, over the course of his life. Schopenhauer had stated that music was more important than [[libretto]] in opera. Music is, according to Schopenhauer, an immediate expression of will, the basic reality of the experienced world. Libretto is merely a linguistic representation of transient phenomena. Wagner emphasized music over libretto in his later works after reading Schopenhauer's aesthetic doctrine.

==Influence==
In proposing that art could offer deliverance from the Will, Schopenhauer elevated art from mere [[artisan]]ry or [[Decorative arts|decoration]], and held that art potentially offered temporary deliverance from the aimless strife of the Will in nature.  In effect, Schopenhauer turned art into a substitute religion by offering a doctrine of [[salvation]] through aesthetic experiences.  Artists were not merely skilled hands; they were [[priest]]s or [[prophet]]s of this doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Will Durant]], ''[[The Story of Philosophy]]'', sub. tit. "Arthur Schopenhauer".&lt;/ref&gt;  This teaching goes far to explain Schopenhauer's appeal to members of the creative communities over the second half of the nineteenth century. His doctrine of aesthetics justified artistic work as a matter of highest importance in human society.

Schopenhauer's aesthetics remain influential today, and are perhaps the most lasting part of his [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The aesthetic theories of Kant, Hegel, and Schopenhauer''
I Knox - 1958 - Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;  Their appeal to later generations of [[romanticism|Romantics]], and to all schools of [[bohemianism]], is demonstrated.  Wagner sent Schopenhauer a note expressing deep gratitude for Schopenhauer's discussion of music.  Schopenhauer's philosophy in general left a deep impression on a number of important writers, especially [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé]], [[Thomas Mann]], and [[Ivan Turgenev]].&lt;ref name="Magee 1977"&gt;Magee (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer's aesthetics were directly responsible for the rise of the [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] and their allied movements, and to the general development of the concept of [[art for art's sake]].  It deeply influenced the aesthetics of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], although he ultimately rejected Schopenhauer's conception of Will as evil, whose famous opposition of the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] is a translation of Schopenhauer's opposition of intellect against will in terms of [[Greek mythology]].  When the [[Marxism|Marxist]] critique of [[capitalism]] was stirred into the aesthetic stew, Schopenhauer's essentially [[asceticism|ascetic]] view of the purpose of art laid the foundation for the opposition of [[kitsch]] versus the [[avant-garde]] which is found in such critics as [[Clement Greenberg]].  Contemporary beliefs that artistic creation should not be swayed by financial gains or the demands of patrons or customers, and the belief that the greatest artists are those who create new and entirely unprecedented forms of expression, rather than those who develop already existing forms, all owe a great deal to the influence of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="Magee 1977"/&gt;

[[George Santayana|Santayana]]  praised Schopenhauer's doctrine that [[tragedy]] benefited audiences because it helped them to deny the will&amp;ndash;to&amp;ndash;live and to turn away from life. "He [Schopenhauer] thought tragedy beautiful because it detached us from a
troubled world and did not think a troubled world
good, as those unspeakable optimists did, because it
made such a fine tragedy. It is pleasant to find
that among all these philosophers one at least was
a gentleman."&lt;ref&gt;Santayana, George, [https://archive.org/details/egotismingerman00santuoft Egotism in German Philosophy], Chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
"&amp;hellip;things are certainly beautiful to ''behold'', but to ''be'' them is something quite different." (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVI)

"&amp;hellip;aesthetic pleasure in the beautiful consists, to a large extent, in the fact that, when we enter the state of pure contemplation, we are raised for the moment above all willing, above all desires and cares; we are, so to speak, rid of ourselves." (''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 68)

"Perhaps the reason why common objects in ''still life'' seem so transfigured and generally everything ''painted'' appears in a supernatural light is that we then no longer look at things in the flux of time and in the connection of cause and effect &amp;hellip;. On the contrary, we are snatched out of that eternal flux of all things and removed into a dead and silent eternity. In its individuality the thing itself was determined by time and by the [causal] conditions of the understanding; here we see this connection abolished and only the ''Platonic Idea'' is left." (''Manuscript Remains'', Vol. I, § 80)

[[File:Reliquary Thomas Becket MNMA Cl23296.jpg|thumb|A simpler, slightly later chasse showing scenes of Beckett's life.]]

The '''Becket Casket''' is a [[reliquary]] in [[Limoges enamel]] now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].  It is made of [[gilding|gilt-copper]] round a wooden core, decorated with [[champlevé]] [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and of a shape called a "[[chasse (casket)|chasse]]".  It was made in about 1180–90 in [[Limoges]], France, and depicts one of the most infamous events in [[England|English]] history. On the night of 29 December 1170, [[Archbishop]] [[Thomas Becket]] was murdered in [[Canterbury cathedral]] by four knights obeying the wishes of [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]]. It provoked outrage throughout [[Europe]], and pilgrims flocked to Canterbury to pray at the site of the murder. In 1173 Becket was [[saint|canonized]] and his shrine was one of the most famous in the Christian world, until its total destruction in 1538 during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  It is thought that this particular casket was made to hold the relics of Thomas Becket that were taken to Peterborough Abbey (now [[Peterborough Cathedral]]) by Abbot Benedict in 1177.  Benedict had been Prior at Canterbury Cathedral and therefore saw Becket's assassination. 

[[Relic]]s of St Thomas were widely dispersed in the years following his death. Many were placed in [[casket]]s made in [[Limoges enamel]] in south-west [[France]]. This was the centre for the production of objects in champlevé enamel, which is characterized by brilliant blues, colourful rosettes and boldly engraved figures. This casket is the most elaborate, the largest and possibly the earliest in date, but over 45 medieval chasses survive showing Becket's story and thought to have been made in Limoges.  Another fine example is in the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;Binski, 225, with a catalogue entry on the Burrell chasse.&lt;/ref&gt;   

The scene of the [[martyr]]dom is shown on the front, where one of the knights decapitates Becket in front of the [[altar]], while on the sloping roof the archbishop's funeral is depicted. On the back are four saints and at the one end [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] is seated on a rainbow. The other end, which may have shown [[St Peter]], is missing, as is the floor of the casket and its contents.

The '''W. L. Lyons Brown Theatre''', originally called the '''Brown Theatre''', is a restored theatre dating back to 1925 that seats approximately 1,400 patrons in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. The theatre still stands today and remains a testament to the glory days of Louisville's theatre district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eventful.com/louisville/venues/brown-theatre-on-broadway-/V0-001-000322127-8 Brown Theatre on Broadway]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Luhan, Dennis Domer, David Mohoney, ''The Louisville Guide'' (2004), p. 180-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Theatre opened on October 5, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentuckycenter.org/rent/brown-history.asp The History of the Brown Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; The space was named for [[James Graham Brown]], an [[Indiana]] native and longtime Louisville resident. Modeled after New York's famous [[Music Box Theatre]], the space boasts a 40' x 40' stage.

With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the Brown was leased to the Fourth Avenue Amusement Company in the 1930s as a movie theater.
By 1962 the Brown Theatre was renovated so that it could once again stage live performances.

Another renovation took place in 1971 and afterwards was sold to the Louisville Board of Education, operating under contract to the Louisville Theatrical Association. The theatre was briefly rechristened the [[Macauley's Theatre]].  In 1982, the Broadway-Brown Partnership was formed and purchased the theatre and adjoining hotel in an effort to rejuvenate the southern end of Louisville's downtown business district.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kentuckycenter.org/rent/brown-history.asp The History of the Brown Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

Louisville's [[Fund for the Arts]] acquired the building in 1997, undertaking to finance the remainder of the $4.2 million restoration with the [[Kentucky Center]] for the Performing Arts under contract to manage the theatre. Generous gifts were also received from the W.L. Lyons Brown Foundation, the Brown family of Louisville, and the [[Brown-Forman Corporation]].

In 1998, re-christened the W.L. Lyons Brown Theatre, new stage equipment and rigging, a modernized computer marquee, and new heating and air conditioning systems are put into place making the space a comfortable and state-of-the-art theatre.
Further gifts from Owsley Brown Frazier resulted in the main reception area adjoining the Fifth Third Conference Center being named the Frazier Lobby.

[[File:Doblberg 5 Glonn-3.jpg|thumb|''Bundwerk'' detail on a farmhouse in [[Glonn]]]]
'''''Bundwerk''''' is a carpentry and rural architectural term from the 19th century for a method of  building with timber that was used especially in [[Austria]], [[South Tyrol]] and [[Bavaria]]. After [[log construction]] and [[timber framing]], ''bundwerk'' is one of the most widespread forms of [[framing (construction)|timber building techniques]]. It involved used wooden beams that were arranged partly in a lattice or diagonally over a cross. It often decorated the front and gable sides of agricultural buildings, frequently the grain barn or ''Stadel'' of quadrangular farms (''Vierseithöfen'').

In northeastern [[Upper Bavaria]] ''bundwerk'' is especially varied and colourful. By contrast, in the [[Werdenfelser Land]] and the region around [[Innsbruck]] only a few places exhibit this type of timber building throughout.

''Bundwerk'' had its heyday between 1830 and 1860 when artists and woodcarvers, as well as carpenters, decorated the ''bundwerk'' with paintings and carvings, often with mythical creatures or Christian symbols.

The '''Church of the Holy Saviour in Chora''' ({{lang-el|Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ|}}, {{lang-tr|Kariye Müzesi, Kariye Camii, Kariye Kilisesi}}) is a medieval [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] Greek Orthodox church preserved as the Chora Museum in the [[Edirnekapı, Istanbul|Edirnekapı]] neighborhood of [[Istanbul]].{{sfn|Ousterhout|1988}} The neighborhood is situated in the western part of the [[List of municipalities in İstanbul Province|municipality]] ([[:tr:Belediye|belediye]]) of the [[Fatih]] district. In the 16th century, during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era, the church was converted into a mosque; it became  a museum in 1948. The interior of the building is covered with some of the oldest and finest surviving  Byzantine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es; they were uncovered and restored after the building was secularized and turned into a museum.

The Chora Church was originally built as part of a monastery complex outside the walls of [[Constantinople]], to the south of the [[Golden Horn]]. Literally translated, the church's full name was the '''Church of the Holy Saviour in the Country''':  although "The Church of the Holy Redeemer in the Fields" would be a more natural rendering of the name in English.  ([[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ἡ Ἐκκλησία τοῦ Ἁγίου Σωτῆρος ἐν τῇ Χώρᾳ}}, ''hē Ekklēsia tou Hagiou Sōtēros en tēi Chōrai'').&lt;ref&gt;and therefore sometimes incorrectly referred to as "Saint Saviour"&lt;/ref&gt; The last part of that name, '''Chora''', referring to its location originally outside of the walls, became the shortened name of the church. The original church on this site was built in the early 4th century, and stood outside of the [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Wall_of_Constantine|4th century walls]] of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]]. However, when [[Theodosius II]] built his formidable [[Walls of Constantinople#Theodosian Walls|land walls]] in 413–414, the church became incorporated within the city's defences, but retained the name ''Chora''. The name must have carried symbolic meaning, as the mosaics in the [[narthex]] describe [[Christ]] as the ''Land of the Living'' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Χώρα τῶν ζώντων}}, ''hē Chōra tōn zōntōn'') and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]], as the ''Container of the Uncontainable'' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Χώρα τοῦ Ἀχωρήτου}}, ''hē Chōra tou Achōrētou'').

The majority of the fabric of the current building dates from 1077–1081, when Maria Dukaina, the mother-in-law of [[Alexius I Comnenus]], rebuilt the Chora Church as an [[Cross-in-square|inscribed cross]] or [[quincunx]]: a popular architectural style of the time. Early in the 12th century, the church suffered a partial collapse, perhaps due to an [[earthquake]]. The church was rebuilt by [[Isaac Komnenos (son of Alexios I)|Isaac Comnenus]], Alexius's third son. However, it was only after the third phase of building, two centuries after, that the church as it stands today was completed. The powerful Byzantine statesman [[Theodore Metochites]] endowed the church with many of its fine [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]s. Theodore's impressive decoration of the interior was carried out between 1315 and 1321. The mosaic-work is the finest example of the [[Palaeologus|Palaeologian]] Renaissance. The artists remain unknown. In 1328, Theodore was sent into exile by the usurper [[Andronicus III Palaeologus]]. However, he was allowed to return to the city two years later, and lived out the last two years of his life as a [[monk]] in his Chora Church.

In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the monastery was home to the scholar [[Maximus Planudes]], who was responsible for the restoration and reintroduction of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s [[Ptolemy's Geography|''Geography'']] to the Byzantines and, ultimately, to [[Renaissance Italy]]. During the last [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Icon]] of the [[Theotokos]] [[Hodegetria]], considered the protector of the City, was brought to Chora in order to assist the defenders against the assault of the [[Ottomans]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Millingen&lt;/ref&gt;

Around fifty years after the fall of the city to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], Atık Ali Paşa, the [[Grand Vizier]] of Sultan [[Bayezid II]], ordered the Chora Church to be converted into a [[mosque]] — ''Kariye Camii''. Due to the [[iconoclasm|prohibition against iconic images]] in [[Islam]], the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes in the region have taken their toll on the artwork.

In 1948, Americans [[Thomas Whittemore]] and Paul A. Underwood, from the [[Byzantine Institute of America]] and the [[Dumbarton Oaks]] Center for Byzantine Studies, sponsored a restoration program. From that time on, the building ceased to be a functioning mosque. In 1958, it was opened to the public as a museum — ''Kariye Müzesi''.

== Interior ==
The Chora Church is not as large as some of the other surviving Byzantine churches of Istanbul (it covers 742.5 m²) but it is unique among them, because of its almost completely still extant internal decoration. The building divides into three main areas: the entrance hall or ''[[narthex]]'', the main body of the church or ''[[nave|naos]]'', and the side [[chapel]] or ''[[parecclesion]]''. The building has six [[dome]]s: two in the esonarthex, one in the parecclesion and three in the naos.

=== Narthex ===
The main, west door of the Chora Church opens into the [[narthex]]. It divides north-south into the ''exonarthex'' and ''esonarthex''.

==== Exonarthex ====

[[File:StPeter-mosaic-from-Chora-church-in-Istanbul.jpg|thumb|upright|Saint Peter [[mosaic]]]]

The exonarthex (or outer narthex) is the first part of the church that one enters. It is a transverse corridor, 4 m wide and 23 m long, which is partially open on its eastern length into the parallel esonarthex. The southern end of the exonarthex opens out through the esonarthex forming a western ante-chamber to the parecclesion. The mosaics that decorate the exonarthex include:

# Joseph's dream and journey to Bethlehem;
# Enrollment for taxation;
# Nativity, birth of Christ;
# Journey of the Magi;
# Inquiry of King Herod;
# Flight into Egypt;
# Two frescoes of the massacres ordered by King Herod;
# Mothers mourning for their children;
# Flight of Elizabeth, mother of John the Baptist;
# Joseph dreaming, return of the holy family from Egypt to Nazareth;
# Christ taken to Jerusalem for the Passover;
# John the Baptist bearing witness to Christ;
# Miracle;
# Three more Miracles.
# Jesus Christ;
# Virgin and Angels praying.

==== Esonarthex ====
[[File:HSX Mary genealogy.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the Virgin Mother with child, north dome of the inner narthex]]
[[File:Chora Christ south coupole.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]], south dome of the inner narthex]]

The esonarthex (or inner narthex) is similar to the exonarthex, running parallel to it. Like the exonarthex, the esonarthex is 4 m wide, but it is slightly shorter, 18 m long. Its central, eastern door opens into the naos, whilst another door, at the southern end of the esonarthex opens into the rectangular ante-chamber of the parecclesion. At its northern end, a door from the esonarthex leads into a broad west-east corridor that runs along the northern side of the naos and into the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]]. The esonarthex has two domes. The smaller is above the entrance to the northern corridor; the larger is midway between the entrances into the naos and the pareclession.

# Enthroned Christ with [[Theodore Metochites]] presenting a model of his church;
# [[Saint Peter]];
# [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]];
# [[Deesis]], Christ and the Virgin Mary (without John the Baptist) with two donors below;
# Genealogy of Christ;
# Religious and noble ancestors of Christ.

The mosaics in the first three bays of the inner narthex give an account of the [[Life of the Virgin]], and her parents. Some of them are as follows:
# Rejection of [[Joachim|Joachim's]] offerings;
# Annunciation of [[Saint Anne]], the angel of the Lord announcing to Anne that her prayer for a child has been heard;
# Meeting of Joachim and Anne;
# Birth of the Virgin Mary;
# First seven steps of the Virgin;
# The Virgin given affection by her parents;
# The Virgin blessed by the priests;
# Presentation of the Virgin in the Temple;
# The Virgin receiving bread from an Angel;
# The Virgin receiving the skein of purple wool, as the priests decided to have the attendant maidens weave a veil for the Temple;
# [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] praying, when it was the time to marry for the Virgin, High Priest Zechariah called all the widowers together and placed their rods on the altar, praying for a sign showing to whom she should be given;
# The Virgin entrusted to Joseph;
# Joseph taking the Virgin to his house;
# [[Annunciation]] to the Virgin at the well;
# Joseph leaving the Virgin, Joseph had to leave for six months on business and when he returned the Virgin was pregnant and he is suspicious of that.

[[File:HSX Koimetesis.jpg|thumb|Mosaic of the ''Koimesis'' in the Naos]]

=== Naos ===
The central doors of the esonarthex lead into the main body of the church, the ''naos''. The largest dome in the church (7.7 m diameter) is above the centre of the naos. Two smaller domes flank the modest [[apse]]: the northern dome is over the [[Prothesis (altar)|prothesis]], which is linked by short passage to the [[bema]]; the southern dome is over the [[diaconicon]], which is reached via the parecclesion.
# ''Koimesis'', the [[Assumption of Mary|Dormition of the Virgin]]. Before ascending to Heaven, her last sleep. Jesus is holding an infant, symbol of Mary's soul;
# Jesus Christ;
# ''Theodokos'', the Virgin Mary with child.

[[File:Chora Church Constantinople 2007 010.jpg|thumb|View into the ''[[parecclesion]]'']]

=== Parecclesion ===
To the right of the esonarthex, doors open into the side chapel, or ''parecclesion''. The parecclesion was used as a mortuary chapel for family burials and memorials. The second largest dome (4.5 m diameter) in the church graces the centre of the roof of the parecclesion. A small passageway links the parecclesion directly into the naos, and off this passage can be found a small oratory and a storeroom. The parecclesion is covered in [[fresco]]es:

# [[Resurrection|Anastasis]], the Resurrection. Christ, who had just broken down the gates of hell, is standing in the middle and pulling Adam and Eve out of their tombs. Behind Adam stand John the Baptist, David, and Solomon. Others are righteous kings;
# Second coming of Christ, the last judgment. Jesus is enthroned and on both sides the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist (this trio is also called the Deesis);
# Virgin and Child;
# Heavenly Court of Angels;
# Two panels of Moses.

The '''Church of St Donatus''' is a church located in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]]. Its name refers to [[Donatus of Zadar]], who began construction on this church in the 9th century and ended it on the northeastern part of the [[forum (Roman)|Roman forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.amzd.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=49 Arheološki Muzej Zadar - Sveti Donat]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally named Church of the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inyourpocket.com/croatia/zadar/sightseeing__culture/essentialzadar/venue/4537-St_Donatus_and_39;_Church.html Essential Zadar], inyourpocket.com; accessed 31 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 15th century it was re-dedicated to St Donatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.izaberi.hr/index.php?lang=hr&amp;op=sd&amp;tip=zna&amp;id=0000060 Crkva sv. Donat], izaberi.hr; accessed 31 July 2018.{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church is the largest [[Pre-Romanesque]] building in Croatia. It is also an example of the centralised type of the [[Carolingian]] period in Europe.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==
The beginning of the building of the church was placed to the second half of the 8th century, and it is supposed to be completed in the 9th century. The Zadar bishop and diplomat [[Donatus of Zadar|Donat]] (8th and 9th centuries) is credited with the building of the church. He led the representations of the Dalmatian cities to [[Constantinople]] and [[Charles the Great]], which is why this church bears slight resemblance to Charlemagne's court chapels, especially the one in [[Aachen]] (now [[Aachen Cathedral]]),&lt;ref name="Radovinovič"&gt;{{cite book|last=Radovinovič|first=Radovan|title=The Croatian Adriatic|year=1998|publisher=Naklada Naprijed|location=Zagreb|isbn=953-178-097-8|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raos|first=Ivan|title=Adriatic tourist guide|year=1969|publisher=Spektar|location=Zagreb|OCLC=112865|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=OCGhTcSQCcLt0gH08v22Bg&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=AQgzAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=chirch+of+saint++donatus+zadar&amp;q=%22Vitale%27s+Church+in+Ravenna%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the Pre-Romanesque architectural period.

The circular church, formerly domed, is 27 m high and is characterised by simplicity and technical primitivism. It has three radially situated [[apse]]s and an [[ambulatory]] around the central area, surmounted by circular gallery. The circular shape is typical of the early medieval age in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name=desc/&gt; It was built on the Roman forum, and materials from buildings in the latter were used in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cvitanic|first=Marilyn|title=Culture and Customs of Croatia (Culture and Customs of Europe)|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood; 1st ed|isbn=978-0-313-35117-4|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpPXFbq9vO4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=chirch+of+saint++donatus+zadar&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=Tx6hTZagMqTh0gHm_cj7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the fragments which are built into the foundations it is still possible to distinguish the remains of a sacrificial altar on which is written IVNONI AVGUSTE IIOVI AVGUSTO.&lt;ref name="Radovinovič"/&gt;

The  use of the church has varied during its lifetime; during the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]] it was a warehouse, as well as during the French occupation and under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austrians]]. After the city was annexed to [[Yugoslavia]], it served as an archaeological museum for a short period of time. The building is currently used as the concert venue for the annual International Festival of Medieval Renaissance Music ([[Musical Evenings in St Donatus]]) due to the building's interiors and acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donat-festival.com/default.asp?lang=en Official site of the Donat musical evenings], donat-festival.com; accessed 31 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9642">The aim of '''color calibration''' is to measure and/or adjust the color response of a device (input or output) to a known state. In [[International Color Consortium]] (ICC) terms, this is the basis for an additional color characterization of the device and later profiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = Calibration vs. Characterization | author = Graeme Gill | url = http://www.argyllcms.com/doc/calvschar.html | publisher = Graeme Gill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In non-ICC workflows, calibration refers sometimes to establishing a known relationship to a standard [[color space]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Introduction to color imaging science | author = Hsien-Che Lee | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-521-84388-X | url = https://books.google.com/?id=CzAbJrLin_AC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq=%22color+calibration%22+camera+monitor#PPA388,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in one go. The device that is to be calibrated is sometimes known as a ''calibration source''; the color space that serves as a standard is sometimes known as a ''calibration target''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Color calibration is a requirement for all devices taking an active part of a [[color management|color-managed]] workflow, and is used by many industries, such as television production, gaming, photography, engineering, chemistry, medicine and more.

== Information flow and output distortion ==
Input data can come from device sources like [[digital cameras]], [[image scanner]]s or any other measuring devices. Those inputs can be either monochrome (in which case only the [[Tone reproduction|response curve]] needs to be calibrated, though in a few select cases one must also specify the color or spectral power distribution  that that single channel corresponds to) or specified in [[Additive color|multidimensional]] color - most commonly in the three channel [[RGB color model|RGB]] model. Input data is in most cases calibrated against a [[Color management#Color translation|profile connection space (PCS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper | title = Color Imaging Workflow Primitives | author = Ann L. McCarthy | url = http://www.color.org/primitives.pdf | publisher = International Color Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important factors to consider when dealing with color calibration is having a valid source. If the color measuring source does not match the displays capabilities, the calibration will be ineffective and give false readings.

The main distorting factors on the input stage stem from the amplitude nonlinearity of the channel response(s), and in the case of a multidimensional datastream the non-ideal wavelength responses of the individual color separation filters (most commonly a [[Color filter array|color filter array (CFA)]]) in combination with the [[Light temperature#Spectral power distribution|spectral power distribution]] of the scene illumination.

After this the data is often circulated in the system translated into a [[Color management#Working spaces|working space RGB]] for viewing and editing.

In the output stage when exporting to a viewing device such as a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] or [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen or a digital projector, the computer sends a signal to the computer's graphic card in the form RGB [Red,Green,Blue]. The dataset [255,0,0] signals only a device instruction, not a specific color. This instruction [R,G,B]=[255,0,0] then causes the connected display to show Red at the maximum achievable brightness [255], while the Green and Blue components of the display remain dark [0]. The resultant color being displayed, however, depends on two main factors:

*the [[phosphor]]s or another system actually producing a light that falls inside the red spectrum;
*the overall brightness of the color resulting in the desired [[Color vision|color perception]]: an extremely bright light source will always be seen as white, irrespective of spectral composition.

Hence every output device will have its unique color signature, displaying a certain color according to manufacturing tolerances and material deterioration through use and age.
If the output device is a printer, additional distorting factors are the qualities of a particular batch of paper and ink.

The conductive qualities and standards-compliance of connecting cables, circuitry and equipment can also alter the electrical signal at any stage in the signal flow. (A partially inserted [[VGA connector]] can result in a monochrome display, for example, as some pins are not connected.)

== Color perception ==
Color perception is subject to ambient light levels, and the ambient [[white point]]; for example, a red object looks black in blue light. It is therefore not possible to achieve calibration that will make a device look correct and consistent in all capture or viewing conditions. The [[computer display]] and calibration target will have to be considered in controlled, predefined lighting conditions.

==Calibration techniques and procedures==
[[File:PIA16132-MarsCuriosityRover-CalibrationTarget-20120909.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[Color chart|Calibration Target]]'' of the "[[Curiosity rover#Mars Hand Lens Imager .28MAHLI.29|Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI)]]" on the [[Mars]] [[Curiosity rover]] (September 9, 2012) ([http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/images/MAHLIcaltarget-br2.jpg 3-D image]).]]
The most common form of calibration aims at adjusting cameras, scanners, monitors and printers for photographic reproduction. The aim is that a printed copy of a photograph appear identical in saturation and dynamic range to the original or a source file on a computer display. This means that three independent calibrations need to be performed:

* The camera or scanner needs a device-specific calibration to represent the original's estimated colors in an unambiguous way.
* The computer display needs a device-specific calibration to reproduce the colors of the image color space.
* The printer needs a device-specific calibration to reproduce the colors of the image color space.

These goals can either be realized via direct value translation from source to target, or by using a common known reference color space as middle ground. In the most commonly used color profile system, [[ICC profile|ICC]], this is known as the PCS or "Profile Connection Space".

=== Camera ===
The camera calibration needs a known calibration target to be photographed and the resulting output from the camera to be converted to color values. A correction profile can then be built using the difference between the camera result values and the known reference values.
When two or more cameras need to be calibrated relatively to each other, to reproduce the same color values, the technique of [[color mapping]] can be used.

=== Scanner ===
[[File:IT8target.jpg|right|thumb|350px|An [[IT8]].7 Target by [[LaserSoft Imaging]]]]
For creating a scanner profile it needs a target source, such as an [[IT8]]-target, an original with many small color fields, which was measured by the developer with a [[photometer]]. The scanner reads this original and compares the scanned color values with the target's reference values. Taking the differences of these values into account an [[ICC profile]] is created, which relates the device specific color space ([[RGB color space]]) to a device independent color space ([[Lab color space|L*a*b* color space]]). Thus, the scanner is able to output with color fidelity to what it reads.

=== Display ===
[[File:ColorHug2 - 03.jpg|thumb|Color calibration of a monitor using ColorHug2, an open source colorimeter, placed on the screen.]]
For calibrating the monitor a [[Tristimulus colorimeter|colorimeter]] is attached flat to the display's surface, shielded from all ambient light. The calibration software sends a series of color signals to the display and compares the values that were actually sent against the readings from the calibration device. This establishes the current offsets in color display. Depending on the calibration software and type of monitor used, the software either creates a correction matrix (i.e. an [[ICC profile]]) for color values before being sent to the display, or gives instructions for altering the display's brightness/contrast and RGB values through the [[on-screen display|OSD]].
This tunes the display to reproduce fairly accurately the in-[[gamut]] part of a desired color space. The calibration target for this kind of calibration is that of print stock paper illuminated by [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] light at 120&amp;nbsp;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Printer ===
The ICC profile for a printer is created by comparing a test print result using a photometer with the original reference file. The testchart contains known [[CMYK]] colors, whose offsets to their actual L*a*b* colors scanned by the photometer are resulting in an ICC profile. Another possibility to ICC profile a printer is to use a calibrated scanner as the measuring device for the printed CMYK testchart instead of a photometer. A calibration profile is necessary for each printer/paper/ink combination.

A '''color model''' is an abstract mathematical model describing the way [[color]]s can be represented as [[tuple]]s of numbers, typically as three or four values or color components. When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted (viewing conditions, etc.), the resulting set of colors is called "[[color space]]." This section describes ways in which human [[color vision]] can be modeled.

== Tristimulus color space ==

[[File:gamut full.png|thumb|right|3D representation of the human color space.]]

One can picture this space as a region in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] if one identifies the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' axes with the stimuli for the long-wavelength (''L''), medium-wavelength (''M''), and short-wavelength (''S'') [[Cone cell|light receptors]]. The origin, (''S'',''M'',''L'') = (0,0,0), corresponds to black.  White has no definite position in this diagram; rather it is defined according to the [[color temperature]] or white balance as desired or as available from ambient lighting. The human color space is a horse-shoe-shaped cone such as shown here (see also [[Color_models#CIE_XYZ_color_space|CIE chromaticity diagram]] below), extending from the origin to, in principle, infinity. In practice, the human color receptors will be saturated or even be damaged at extremely high light intensities, but such behavior is not part of the [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] color space and neither is the changing color perception at low light levels (see: [[Kruithof curve]]). 
The most saturated colors are located at the outer rim of the region, with brighter colors farther removed from the origin. As far as the responses of the receptors in the eye are concerned, there is no such thing as "brown" or "gray" light. The latter color names refer to orange and white light respectively, with an intensity that is lower than the light from surrounding areas. One can observe this by watching the screen of an [[overhead projector]] during a meeting: one sees black lettering on a white background, even though the "black" has in fact not become darker than the white screen on which it is projected before the projector was turned on.  The "black" areas have not actually become darker but appear "black" relative to the higher intensity "white" projected onto the screen around it. See also [[color constancy]].

The human tristimulus space has the property that additive mixing of colors corresponds to the adding of vectors in this space. This makes it easy to, for example, describe the possible colors ([[gamut]]) that can be constructed from the red, green, and blue primaries in a computer display.

== CIE XYZ color space ==
{{main article|CIE 1931 color space}}
[[Image:CIE 1931 XYZ Color Matching Functions.svg|thumb|325px|right|[http://www.cie.co.at/framepublications.html CIE] 1931 Standard Colorimetric Observer functions between 380 nm and 780 nm (at 5 nm intervals).]]

One of the first mathematically defined color spaces is the CIE XYZ color space (also known as CIE 1931 color space), created by the [[International Commission on Illumination]] in 1931. These data were measured for human observers and a 2-degree field of view. In 1964, supplemental data for a 10-degree field of view were published.

Note that the tabulated sensitivity curves have a certain amount of arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall [[luminosity function]] (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrarily chosen to produce equal areas under the curves. One could as well define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 xyz color space are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.

Sometimes XYZ colors are represented by the luminance, Y, and chromaticity coordinates ''x'' and ''y'', defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{X}{X + Y + Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = \frac{Y}{X + Y + Z}&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematically, ''x'' and ''y'' are projective coordinates and the colors of the chromaticity diagram occupy a region of the [[projective plane|real projective plane]]. Because the CIE sensitivity curves have equal areas under the curves, light with a flat energy spectrum corresponds to the point (''x'',''y'') = (0.333,0.333).

The values for ''X'', ''Y'', and ''Z'' are obtained by integrating the product of the spectrum of a light beam and the published color-matching functions.

==Additive and subtractive color models==

=== RGB color model ===

{{main|RGB color model}}
[[File:RGBCube a.svg|179px|thumb]]

Media that transmit light (such as television) use [[additive color]] mixing with [[primary color]]s of [[red]], [[green]], and [[blue]], each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye's color receptors with as little stimulation as possible of the other two. This is called "[[RGB]]" color space. Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space and thus produce a large part of human color experiences. This is why [[color television]] sets or color computer monitors need only produce mixtures of red, green and blue light. See [[Additive color]].

Other primary colors could in principle be used, but with red, green and blue the largest portion of the [[human color space]] can be captured. Unfortunately there is no exact consensus as to what loci in the [[chromaticity diagram]] the red, green, and blue colors should have, so the same RGB values can give rise to slightly different colors on different screens.

=== CMYK color model ===

{{main|CMYK color model}}

It is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by combining [[cyan]], [[magenta]], and [[yellow]] transparent dyes/inks on a white substrate. These are the ''[[subtractive color|subtractive]]'' [[primary color]]s. Often a fourth ink, [[black]], is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors. This is called the "CMY" or "CMYK" color space.

The cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue, the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue, and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green. The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer. Because in practice the CMY inks suitable for printing also reflect a little bit of color, making a deep and neutral black impossible, the K (black ink) component, usually printed last, is needed to compensate for their deficiencies. Use of a separate black ink is also economically driven when a lot of black content is expected, e.g. in text media, to reduce simultaneous use of the three colored inks. The dyes used in traditional color photographic prints and [[reversal film|slides]] are much more perfectly transparent, so a K component is normally not needed or used in those media.

==Cylindrical-coordinate color models==
A number of color models exist in which colors are fit into [[conic]], [[cylindrical]] or [[spherical]] shapes, with neutrals running from black to white in a central axis, and hues corresponding to angles around that axis. Arrangements of this type date back to the 18th century, and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models.

}}
{{see also|Color solid}}
Different color theorists have each designed unique [[color solid]]s.  Many are in the shape of a [[sphere]], whereas others are warped three-dimensional ellipsoid figures&amp;mdash;these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly.  The color spheres conceived by [[Phillip Otto Runge]] and [[Johannes Itten]] are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Itten, "The Art of Color", 1961. Trans. Ernst Van Haagen. New York: Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1966. {{ISBN|0-442-24038-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical, and form the basis for the description below.

Pure, saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere.  As in the color wheel, [[Complementary color |contrasting (or complementary) hues]] are located opposite each other.  Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane, colors become less and less saturated, until all colors meet at the central [[Coordinate axis|axis]] as a neutral [[gray]].  Moving vertically in the color sphere, colors become lighter (toward the top) and darker (toward the bottom). At the upper pole, all hues meet in white; at the bottom pole, all hues meet in black.  

The vertical axis of the color sphere, then, is gray all along its length, varying from [[black]] at the bottom to [[white]] at the top.  All pure (saturated) hues are located on the surface of the sphere, varying from light to dark down the color sphere.  All impure (unsaturated hues, created by mixing contrasting colors) comprise the sphere's interior, likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom.

===HSL and HSV===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}
{{multiple image

HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries, with hue, their angular dimension, starting at the [[red]] [[primary color|primary]] at 0°, passing through the [[green]] primary at 120° and the [[blue]] primary at 240°, and then wrapping back to red at 360°. In each geometry, the central vertical axis comprises the ''neutral'', ''achromatic'', or ''gray'' colors, ranging from black at lightness 0 or value 0, the bottom, to white at lightness 1 or value 1, the top.

Most televisions, computer displays, and projectors produce colors by combining red, green, and blue light in varying intensities—the so-called [[RGB color model|RGB]] [[additive color|additive]] [[primary color]]s. However, the relationship between the constituent amounts of red, green, and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive, especially for inexperienced users, and for users familiar with [[subtractive color]] mixing of paints or traditional artists’ models based on tints and shades.

In an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models, computer graphics pioneers at [[PARC (company)|PARC]] and [[New York Institute of Technology|NYIT]] developed{{explain|date=June 2018}} the HSV model in the mid-1970s, formally described by [[Alvy Ray Smith]]&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;[[#Smith|Smith (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the August 1978 issue of [[Computer Graphics (publication)|''Computer Graphics'']]. In the same issue, Joblove and Greenberg&lt;ref name=Joblove&gt;[[#Joblove|Joblove and Greenberg (1978)]]&lt;/ref&gt; described the HSL model—whose dimensions they labeled ''hue'', ''relative chroma'', and ''intensity''—and compared it to HSV. Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in [[color vision|human vision]] in terms of other color-making attributes, such as hue, lightness, and chroma; as well as upon traditional color mixing methods—e.g., in painting—that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter, darker, or less colorful colors.

The following year, 1979, at [[SIGGRAPH]], [[Tektronix]] introduced graphics terminals using HSL for color designation, and the Computer Graphics Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report. These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values, but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute: they could run in real time on the hardware of the 1970s. Consequently, these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then.

===Munsell color system===

{{main|Munsell color system}}
Another influential older cylindrical color model is the early-20th-century [[Munsell color system]]. [[Albert Henry Munsell|Albert Munsell]] began with a spherical arrangement in his 1905 book ''A Color Notation'', but he wished to properly separate color-making attributes into separate dimensions, which he called ''hue'', ''value'', and ''chroma'', and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses, he realized that no symmetrical shape would do, so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Runge |first1=Phillipp Otto |author-link=Philipp Otto Runge |date=1810 |title=Die Farben-Kugel, oder Construction des Verhaeltnisses aller Farben zueinander |location=Hamburg, Germany |publisher=Perthes |language=German |trans-title=The Color Sphere, or Construction of the Relationship of All Colors to Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Henry Munsell]] (1905). ''A Color Notation''. Boston, MA: [[Munsell Color Company]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=upper-alpha |See also [[#Fairchild|Fairchild (2005)]], and [[Munsell Color System]] and its references.}}

Munsell’s system became extremely popular, the de facto reference for American color standards—used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons, but also, e.g., electrical wire, beer, and soil color—because it was organized based on perceptual measurements, specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers, because the color chips sold in the ''Munsell Book of Color'' covered a wide [[gamut]] and remained stable over time (rather than fading), and because it was effectively marketed by [[Munsell Color Company|Munsell’s Company]]. In the 1940s, the [[Optical Society of America]] made extensive measurements, and adjusted the arrangement of Munsell colors, issuing a set of "renotations". The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations, but only via its foundational measurements: effectively a [[lookup table]]. Converting from {{nobr|RGB ↔ Munsell}} requires interpolating between that table’s entries, and is extremely computationally expensive in comparison with converting from {{nobr|RGB ↔ HSL}} or {{nobr|RGB ↔ HSV}} which only requires a few simple arithmetic operations.&lt;ref name=Fairchild&gt;[[#Fairchild|Fairchild (2005)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Edward |last1=Landa |first2=Mark |last2=Fairchild |date=September–October 2005 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/charting-color-from-the-eye-of-the-beholder/5 |title=Charting Color from the Eye of the Beholder |journal=American Scientist |volume=93 |issue=5 |page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dorothy Nickerson |year=1976|title=History of the Munsell Color System|journal=Color Research and Application|volume=1|pages=121–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sidney Newhall |author2=Dorothy Nickerson |author3=Deane Judd |doi=10.1364/JOSA.33.000385|title=Final Report of the OSA Subcommittee on the Spacing of the Munsell Colors|year=1943|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America|volume=33|issue=7|pages=385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preucil hue circle===
In [[densitometry]], a model quite similar to the hue defined above is used for describing colors of [[CMYK color model|CMYK process]] inks. In 1953, Frank Preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue, the "Preucil hue circle" and the "Preucil hue hexagon", analogous to our ''H'' and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, but defined relative to idealized cyan, yellow, and magenta ink colors. The "Preucil ''hue error''" of an ink indicates the difference in the "hue circle" between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color. The ''grayness'' of an ink is {{nobr|''m''/''M''}}, where ''m'' and ''M'' are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan, magenta, and yellow in a density measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Preucil (1953). "Color Hue and Ink Transfer—Their Relation to Perfect Reproduction". ''Proceedings of the 5th Annual Technical Meeting of TAGA''. {{nobr|pp. 102–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural Color System===
The Swedish [[Natural Color System]] (NCS), widely used in Europe, takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bicone at right. Because it attempts to fit color into a familiarly shaped solid based on "[[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]]" instead of photometric or psychological characteristics, it suffers from some of the same disadvantages as HSL and HSV: in particular, its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness, because it forces colorful yellow, red, green, and blue into a plane.&lt;ref name=MacEvoy&gt;[[#MacEvoy|MacEvoy (2010)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Illumination]] (CIE) developed the [[CIE 1931 color space|XYZ model]] for describing the colors of light spectra in 1931, but its goal was to match human visual [[metamerism (color)|metamerism]], rather than to be perceptually uniform, geometrically. In the 1960s and 70s, attempts were made to transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry, influenced by the Munsell system. These efforts culminated in the 1976 [[CIELUV]] and [[CIELAB]] models. The dimensions of these models—{{nobr|(''L''*, ''u''*, ''v''*)}} and {{nobr|(''L''*, ''a''*, ''b''*)}}, respectively—are cartesian, based on the [[opponent process]] theory of color, but both are also often described using polar coordinates—{{nobr|(''L''*, ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and {{nobr|(''L''*, ''C''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''h''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, respectively—where ''L''* is lightness, ''C''* is chroma, and ''h''* is hue angle. Officially, both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their [[color difference]] metrics ∆''E''*&lt;sub&gt;''ab''&lt;/sub&gt; and ∆''E''*&lt;sub&gt;''uv''&lt;/sub&gt;, particularly for use defining color tolerances, but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models, including in computer graphics and computer vision. For example, [[gamut mapping]] in [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] [[color management]] is usually performed in CIELAB space, and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images. CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as RGB, HSL, HSV, YUV/YIQ/YCbCr or XYZ, but are not perceptually perfect, and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions.&lt;ref name=Fairchild/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuehni&gt;[[#Kuehni|Kuehni (2003)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hunt (2004).

The [[HCL color space]] seems to be synonymous with CIELCH.

===CIECAM02===
The CIE’s most recent model, [[CIECAM02]] (CAM stands for "color appearance model"), is more theoretically sophisticated and computationally complex than earlier models. Its aims are to fix several of the problems with models such as CIELAB and CIELUV, and to explain not only responses in carefully controlled experimental environments, but also to model the color appearance of real-world scenes. Its dimensions ''J'' (lightness), ''C'' (chroma), and ''h'' (hue) define a polar-coordinate geometry.&lt;ref name=Fairchild/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacEvoy/&gt;

== Color systems ==

There are various types of color systems that classify color and analyse their effects. The American [[Munsell color system]] devised by [[Albert Henry Munsell|Albert H. Munsell]] is a famous classification that organises various colors into a color solid based on hue, saturation and value. Other important color systems include the Swedish [[Natural Color System]] (NCS), the [[Optical Society of America]]'s [[Uniform Color Space]] (OSA-UCS), and the Hungarian [[Coloroid]] system developed by [[Antal Nemcsics]] from the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]]. Of those, the NCS is based on the [[opponent process|opponent-process]] color model, while the Munsell, the OSA-UCS and the Coloroid attempt to model color uniformity. The American [[Pantone]] and the German [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] commercial color-matching systems differ from the previous ones in that their color spaces are not based on an underlying color model.

== Other uses of "color model" ==
=== Models of mechanism of color vision ===

We also use "color model" to indicate a model or mechanism of color vision for explaining how color signals are processed from visual cones to ganglion cells.  For simplicity, we call these models color mechanism models. The classical color mechanism models are [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]]–[[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]'s [[Young–Helmholtz theory|trichromatic model]] and [[Ewald Hering|Hering]]'s [[opponent process|opponent-process model]]. Though these two theories were initially thought to be at odds, it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for color opponency receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level.&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;Kandel ER, Schwartz JH and Jessell TM, 2000. ''Principles of Neural Science'', 4th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York. pp.&amp;nbsp;577–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebrate evolution of color vision ===

{{main|Evolution of color vision}}

Vertebrate animals were primitively [[tetrachromatic]]. They possessed four types of cones—long, mid, short wavelength cones, and ultraviolet sensitive cones.  Today, fish, amphibians, reptiles and birds are all tetrachromatic. Placental mammals lost both the mid and short wavelength cones. Thus, most mammals do not have complex color vision—they are [[dichromacy|dichromatic]] but they are sensitive to ultraviolet light, though they cannot see its colors. Human trichromatic color vision is a recent evolutionary novelty that first evolved in the common ancestor of the Old World Primates. Our trichromatic color vision evolved by duplication of the long wavelength sensitive [[opsin]], found on the X chromosome. One of these copies evolved to be sensitive to green light and constitutes our mid wavelength opsin. At the same time, our short wavelength opsin evolved from the ultraviolet opsin of our vertebrate and mammalian ancestors.

Human [[red-green color blindness]] occurs because the two copies of the red and green opsin genes remain in close proximity on the X chromosome. Because of frequent recombination during meiosis, these gene pairs can get easily rearranged, creating versions of the genes that do not have distinct spectral sensitivities.

The '''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions''' is a binding international legal instrument&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNESCO]] [[multilateral treaty|convention]] adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 20 October 2005, during the 33rd session of the UNESCO General Conference held in Paris, France on 3–21 October 2005. The convention compliments the previously established provisions of UNESCO including the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity of 2001. "The Convention recognises the rights of Parties to take measures to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions, and impose obligations at both domestic and international levels on Parties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/publications-and-documents/treaty-command-papers-ems/explanatory-memoranda/explanatory-memoranda-2007a/unesco United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention is available in six authoritative texts including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=31038&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2016, the Convention has 146 parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=31038&amp;language=E|title=Conventions|website=www.unesco.org|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which includes 145 states and the [[European Union]].

==Background==
The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a precursor for seven UNESCO conventions which deal with the four core areas of creative diversity; cultural and natural heritage, movable cultural property, intangible cultural heritage and contemporary creativity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; These seven UNESCO conventions include the Universal Copyright Convention (1952, followed by a revision in 1971), the Convention for the Protection and Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (1954/1999), the Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property (1970), the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (1972), the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage (2001), the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage (2003),and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions deals with specific articles in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, Articles 8 through 11. These articles clarify three issues. First, the relationship that identity has with cultural goods and services, which values and meaning should not be treated as economic goods. Second, the States have the responsibility for the protection and promotion for the "diversity of cultural expressions and ensuring the free flow of ideas and works".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Third, there needs to be international co-operation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is a legally binding international agreement that ensures artists, cultural professionals, practitioners and citizens worldwide can create, produce, disseminate and enjoy a broad range of cultural goods, services and activities, including their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural expressions are conveyed by activities, goods and services, which results in an economic and cultural nature. Due to this dual sided nature, cultural expressions cannot be seen purely as objects of trade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions main objective is to strengthen creation, production, distribution/dissemination, access and enjoyment of cultural expressions transmitted by cultural activities, goods and services, with a strong focus on developing countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The promotion of dialogue and creativity of cultural diversity is an necessary element in the goal to achieve peace and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Convention was adopted in response to  "growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; "The international community signalled the urgency to implement an international law that would recognize the distinctive nature of cultural goods, services and activities as vehicles of identity, values and meaning and that while cultural goods, services and activities have important economic value, they are not mere commodities or consumer goods that can only be regarded as objects of trade."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/what-is-the-convention/ UNESCO 2005 Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention's main objective is to provide a legally binding international agreement that reaffirms the sovereign right of States to adopt cultural policies that support their cultural industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention does not want to control and restrict cultural expressions, but to promote and protect them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the diversity of cultural expressions is a "rich asset for individuals and societies, the protection, promotion and maintenance of [[cultural diversity]] are an essential requirement for [[sustainable development]] for the benefit of present and future generations.".&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 2 Paragraph 6 [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/cultural-diversity/2005-convention/the-convention/convention-text/]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention also defines on [[cultural industry]] and [[interculturality]]&lt;ref&gt;''UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions'', Article 4 Paragraph 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Since the late 1980s, a growing number of countries were showing concern that "the proliferation of trade agreements promoting absolute market liberalization dramatically increased the threat to [[cultural industry|cultural industries]]. Countries wishing to retain their right to enforce cultural policies risked being marginalized and unable to maintain their position."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc-ccd.org/IMG/pdf/CDC_LowRez_EN.pdf Coalition for Cultural Diversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 2001, the [[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity|UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]] was adopted&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=35232&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html ''UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity'']&lt;/ref&gt; and 21 May was declared the  [[World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development]]

The preliminary draft was drawn up over a series of two years, 2003–2005. The Director-General of UNESCO assigned fifteen experts to write a draft called the Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions. Meetings were held for suggested improvements and the draft eventually led to the adoption of the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions on 20 October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Custodians and Beneficiaries to the Convention==

All cultural actors are required to participate as custodians to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions. These include States and institutions recognised by the Convention, civil actors and civil society, private actors, such as cultural enterprises and industries, especially in developing nations and minorities and indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The beneficiaries to the Convention are unlimited. The Convention benefits all peoples because the ability to participate and promote cultural diversity is profitable for all individuals and societies. Also, recognition for the creators of cultural expressions and the communities that celebrate their works. A major beneficiary to the Convention are the artists and practitioners of the cultural expressions.
In addition to the broad ranged beneficiaries, the Convention lists several specific groups such as women, indigenous peoples, minorities, and artists and practitioners of developing nations. Countries with the inability to produce and disseminate their own cultural expressions, such as developing nations. The Convention provides such need based nations financial assistance for the artists and practitioners of cultural expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratification and entry into force==

To become parties to the convention, member states of UNESCO must follow the traditional procedure; deposit and instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Director-General of UNESCO. Invited non-member states, and regional economic integration organisations may also accede to the convention. The convention entered into force on 18 March 2007 after it had been ratified by 30 states. As of March 2016, the convention has been ratified by 140 states and by the [[European Union]].

==General objectives to the 2005 Convention==

The main objective for the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions is to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf 30 frequently asked questions concerning the Convention and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention highlights the fact that cultural creativity has been placed upon all of humanity and that aside from economical gains, creative diversity reaps plenty of cultural and social advantages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001495/149502e.pdf Ten Keys to the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions]&lt;/ref&gt; States must also promote "openness to other cultures of the world". Protective measures are also included in the Convention and international co-operation is encouraged in times of need. This Convention works to strengthen economic growth and cultural acceptance.

Additional objectives are as follows:

*To reaffirm the sovereign rights of States to adopt cultural policies while ensuring the free movement of ideas and works.
*To recognise the distinct nature of cultural goods and services as vehicles of values, identity and meaning.

'''''De Proprietatibus Elementorum''''' (English: On the Properties of the Elements) is a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Arabic language|Arabic]] treatise on [[geology]]. It is also known as '''''De Causis Proprietatum Elementorum''''', '''''De Proprietatibus Elementorum et Planetarum''''' or simply '''''De Elementis'''''.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}} It was probably written in the ninth{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}} or tenth century.{{sfn|Crombie|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA133 133]}} The author of the work claimed to be [[Aristotle]], but eventually it was determined that it was an original work by an [[Arabs|Arab]] author. Consequently, the work is now attributed to a [[Pseudo-Aristotle]].{{sfn|Peters|1961|p=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57–58]}}

== History ==
The work did not have a lasting impact on [[science in the medieval Islamic world]], but it became important in Europe after it was translated to [[Latin]] by [[Gerard of Cremona]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Peters|1961|p=[https://books.google.nl/books?id=RswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57 57–58]}} By the thirteenth century, it had become one of the three main sources for medieval knowledge on geology, together with Aristotle's ''[[Meteorology]]'' and [[Avicenna]]'s ''De Mineralibus''. These three treatises were an important influence on the study of geology by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Crombie|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bGDScHy1clsC&amp;pg=PA133 133–135]}} When scholars started to recognize during [[the Renaissance]] that ''De Proprietatibus Elementorum'' was not written by Aristotle, it was removed from the academic curriculum.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324}}

== Content ==
In his work ''Meteorology'', Aristotle explained that the earth as an element was cold and dry. He did not cover phenomena related to terrestrial heat. ''De Proprietatibus Elementorum'' filled this lacuna with its inquiry on [[volcano]]es and [[hot spring]]s. According to the work large quantities of [[sulfur]] in the interior of a mountain caused volcanic eruptions. Winds and waters present at the foot of the mountain could set fire to this sulfur, particularly in the case of [[Mount Etna]].{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=324–325}}

Its explanation of hot springs seems to have been taken by an unknown work from [[Theophrastus]]. Theophrastus or the pseudo-Aristotle first dismisses several explanations provided by [[Democritus]], Mileus and Rentifolus, the latter two possibly [[Thales]] and [[Xenophanes]]. The opinion of the author follows, that water gets heated by beds of sulfur before it emerges on the surface. [[Naphtha]] is associated with this process, because together with sulfur it forms a kind of burner to transport fuel to the fire.{{sfn|Vermij|1998|p=328}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">{{For|the curriculum program|Design and Technology}}'''Design technology''', or D.T., is the study, design, development, application, implementation, support and management of computer and non-computer based technologies for the express purpose of communicating product design intent and constructability. Design technology can be applied to the problems encountered in construction, operation and maintenance of a product.

At times there is cross-over between D.T. and [[Information Technology]], whereas I.T. is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure, hardware &amp; software requirements, and implementation, D.T. is specifically focused on supporting, maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with I.T. to provide necessary infrastructure, for the most effective use of these applications and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Information Technology {{!}} North Dakota ITD|url = https://www.nd.gov/itd/about-us/definition-information-technology|website = www.nd.gov|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the building design, construction and maintenance industry (also known as AEC/O/FM), the product is the building and the role of D.T., is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process. D.T. processes have adopted Building Information Modeling (BIM) to quicken construction, design and facilities management using technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Solutions {{!}} BIM|url = http://www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com/solutions/bim-modeling|website = www.thomasenterprisesolutions.com|access-date = 2016-02-17|first = Thomas Enterprise|last = Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; So though D.T. encompasses [[Building information modeling|BIM]] and Integrated Project Delivery, I.P.D., it is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize C.A.D., Virtual Design &amp; Construction, V.D.C., as well as historical and legacy data and systems.

D.T. is also applicable to industrial and product design and the [[manufacturing]] and [[Metal fabrication|fabrication processes]] therein.

There are formal courses of study in some countries known as [[design and technology]] that focus on particular areas. In this case the above definition still remains valid, if for instance one takes the subject textiles technology and replace product in the above definition with textile.

'''''Evita, vida y obra de Eva Perón''''' ({{lang-es|Evita, life and work of Eva Perón}}) is an Argentine historical comic book by [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Alberto Breccia]], which narrates the biography of [[Eva Perón]]. It was censored at the time of creation and was published after Oesterheld's death.

==Editorial story==
The Argentine comic book authors [[Héctor Germán Oesterheld]] and [[Alberto Breccia]] started in 1968 a number of comic books devoted to the biographies of important people of Latin American history. The first issue was ''[[Vida del Che]]'' ({{lang-es|Life of Che}}), and it was about [[Che Guevara]]. When it was finished and published, they started working in one for Eva Perón. However, when Che's comic book was published, it was removed from distribution and all copies of it were destroyed. Facing such situation, Oesterheld stopped the whole project. Although Oesterheld had finished the script and Breccia the drawings, the production was not finished.&lt;ref&gt;"''Apenas Che apareció a la venta, Oesterheld comenzó a trabajar en el argumento de Evita y consecuentemente Breccia empezó con los dibujos. En medio de esto, Che fue retirado de la venta y los originales destruidos. Esta persecución obligó al editor a considerar abortado el proyecto y los autores, consecuentemente, lo abandonaron''" Doeyo, "Palabras del editor"&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, Breccia received a new offer to draw a comic book about Eva Perón. It had a politically neutral script, whereas the one by Oesterheld had a radical peronist style. The art was the same than in the unpublished comic book, but being coloured, whereas the original was meant to be a black and white comic book.&lt;ref&gt;"''Entre 1969 y 1970 se editó con otro guionista y dibujo de Breccia, en una versión despolitizada, inconseguible hoy por hoy''". Martignone, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Oesterheld was [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]] in 1978 and Breccia died in 1993.

In 2002, the editor [[Javier Doeyo]] found the original script written by Oesterheld at the house of Breccia's widow, while searching for material for another project.&lt;ref&gt;"''en mayo de 2001 [...] me encontraba hurgando entre las carpetas de Breccia en casa de su viuda Irma, en busca del guión faltante de un capítulo de Buscavidas que estaba sin letrear. Para mi sorpresa [...] encuentro el argumento original de Oesterheld con el que Breccia empezó a trabajar y que por la cancelación del proyecto dejó de lado''" Doeyo, "Palabras del editor"&lt;/ref&gt; With this script, he could restore the original unpublished comic book. The art was already published as described, and the colours were removed to restore the originally intended black &amp; white by using image editing software. The script received minor corrections, fixing outdated information.&lt;ref name="panfleto"&gt;"''...actualizadas ciertas partes históricas (se recuperó el cadáver de Eva tras su abominable hurto [...]), la biografía es arrolladora y panfletaria, pero cuenta la historia de nuestro país''". Martignone, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the fate of Evita's corpse was still unknown in 1968, whereas by 2002 it had been recovered and placed at [[La Recoleta cemetery]].&lt;ref name="panfleto"/&gt;

The work was thus published in 2002 by [[Doedytores]]. In 2007 it was edited again by [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]], along with work about Che, as part of a series of reprints of noteworthy comic books.

==Description==
The comic book describes the life of Eva Perón in a biographical manner, from birth to death. It has a strong [[peronist]] point of view, and is highly critical of the military and other political forces.&lt;ref name="panfleto"/&gt; It does not employ the common techniques of the genre, and hasn't any [[speech balloon]]s or [[sequential art]]. The drawings are used merely to illustrate the events being described by the text. Alberto Breccia would explain that "''My work is testimonial, it can't be otherwise, because it includes characters like Goulart, Frondizi, Mao...''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Mi trabajo es testimonial, no podría ser de otra manera porque aparecían personajes como Goulart, Frondizi, Mao..." (Breccia) Doeyo, "Palabras del editor".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pictures are made from famous photos or iconography of the time. For example, the first image (used by Doeyo to design the comic book cover) is based upon the cover of Evita's autobiography, ''[[La Razón de mi Vida]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3047">In [[folklore]], '''fairy-locks''' (or [[elflocks]]) are the result of fairies tangling and knotting the hairs of the sleeping children as they play in and out of their hair at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Batt | first = Tanya Robyn|author2=Gail Newey| title = A child's book of faeries | publisher = Barefoot Books | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 1841489549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==English tradition==
The concept is first attested in English in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' in [[Mercutio]]'s speech of the many exploits of [[Queen Mab]], where he seems to imply the locks are only unlucky if combed out:

:"She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes &lt;br /&gt;
:In shape no bigger than an agate stone....... &lt;br /&gt;

:That plaits the manes of horses in the night &lt;br /&gt;
:And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, &lt;br /&gt;
:Which once untangled, much ''misfortune'' bodes."

Therefore, the appellation of elf lock or fairy lock could be attributed to any various tangles and knots of unknown origins appearing in the manes of beasts or hair of sleeping children.

It can also refer to tangles of elflocks or fairy-locks in human hair.  In King Lear, when Edgar impersonates a madman, "he elfs all his hair in knots."&lt;ref&gt;Shakespear's "Lear"&lt;/ref&gt;(Lear, ii. 3.) What Edgar has done, simply put, is made a mess of his hair.

See also ''Jane Eyre'', Ch. XIX; Jane's description of Rochester disguised as a gypsy: "...elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band..."

==German tradition==
German counterparts of the "elf-lock" are ''alpzopf'', ''drutenzopf'', ''wichtelzopf'', ''weichelzopf'', ''mahrenlocke'', ''elfklatte'', etc. (where [[Alp (folklore)|alp]], [[drude]], [[Mare (folklore)|mare]], and [[wight]] are given as the beings responsible). Grimm, who compiled the list, also remarked on the similarity to [[Holda|Frau Holle]], who entangled people's hair and herself had matted hair.&lt;ref name="Grimm-eng464"&gt;(Stallybrass tr.) {{Harvnb|Grimm|1883|loc=vol. 2, p. 464}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word ''elf'' seems to have declined steadily in English, becoming a rural dialect term, before being revived by translations of fairy tales in the nineteenth century and fantasy fiction in the twentieth.

==French tradition==
Fairy-locks are ascribed in French traditions to the [[lutin]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary R. Butler, ‘The Lutin Tradition in French-Newfoundland Culture: Discourse and Belief’, in ''The Good People: New Fairylore Essays'', ed. by Peter Narváez, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 1376 (New York: Garland, 1991), pp. 5–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eastern European tradition ==
{{main|Polish plait#In folklore}}

In Poland and nearby countries, witches and evil spirits were often blamed for [[Polish plait]].  This can be, however, a serious medical condition or an intentional hairstyle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish plait#As a hairstyle]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

Baron '''Ferenc Hatvany'''  (29 October 1881 – 7 February 1958) was a Hungarian painter and art collector. A son of [[Sándor Hatvany-Deutsch]] and a member of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Hatvany-Deutsch family|hu|3=Hatvany-Deutsch család}}, he graduated in the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris. His collection&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeweb.hu/dialog2000/8.html Inventory of art works which Hatvany placed in the strongrooms of major Budapest banks in 1942] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525162759/http://www.freeweb.hu/dialog2000/8.html |date=2011-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included paintings from [[Tintoretto]], [[Cézanne]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], most notably ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'' and  ''[[Femme nue couchée]]''.

Towards the end of the [[Second World War]] his paintings were looted by Soviet troops but some were ransomed by Hatvany. In 1947 he emigrated to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2008/02/01/the-mysterious-journey-of-an-erotic-masterpiece/ ARTNews; The Mysterious Journey of an Erotic Masterpiece]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 ''L'Origine du monde'' was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs (the buyer was psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]).

Paintings that were looted from Hatvany's collection are still hanging on museum walls in Budapest, Moscow, and Nizhny Novgorod.{{Specify |reason=Add the name of the museums rather than just the cities. |date=August 2016}} [[John Constable]]'s "Beaching A Boat, Brighton" was identified in the collection of [[The Tate]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10728354/Tate-to-return-Constable-painting-looted-by-Nazis.html "Tate to return Constable painting looted by Nazis"] The Telegraph;  28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Hatvany died in [[Lausanne]] in 1958.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6749">'''[[Quebec]]''' has a rich history of [[folklore]], second only to that of the indigenous peoples.

==Folk tales==
Folktales were told by ''Raconteurs'', who could tell tales lasting several hours, or even tell a story over the course of several evenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Canadian Folk-Life and Folk-Lore |last= Greenough |first=William P. |year=1897 |publisher= George H. Richmond| location= New York, NY.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christian beliefs and [[superstitions]] are present in most Quebec folklore. La [[chasse-galerie]] (the flying canoe) is a well-known folktale about a group of lumberjacks who make a pact with the devil. Demons, witches, and werewolves were common folk motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haase|first=Donald|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313334429|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tales themselves were referred to by the name ''contes''. The traditional ''conte'' form of story-telling has been adapted to the modern novel by writers such as [[Roch Carrier]] and [[Joseph Jean Jacques Ferron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New|first=William H.|title=Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada|date=2002|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802007612|pages=354–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some folktales are classified under the traditional genre ''Märchen'' ([[fairy tale]]s).

''The Devil at the Dance'' is an example in which the Devil was used to reinforce Christian ideals.  It is the story of a young couple in love. The girl's parents, who are [[Heretics]], refuse the young man as a suitor after discovering he is Christian. When the daughter protests, her mother announces that she would rather have the Devil himself courting her daughter than the young Christian. The following Sunday afternoon, a stranger comes to call: the Devil himself. The three of them-mother, father and daughter-are converted by a priest, and the young couple are then married.&lt;ref name="Chiasson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Les Légendes des îles de la Madeleine |last= Chiasson |first=Père Anselme |year=1969 |publisher= Éditions des Aboiteaux |location= Moncton, N.-B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various versions of this tale: One paints the young girl as being very disobedient and flirtatious. Although her parents warn her of the evils of selfishness, her actions do not change. Thus, the Devil was able to enter her home because of her Unchristian behavior. She is saved once again by the Priest, and converts to Christianity.  Another version has the tale happening in a remote village in [[New Brunswick]], but with the same basic storyline. Clearly, the tale evolved depending on what message the storyteller was trying to portray. Regardless of the version, the vast influence of the [[Catholic Church]] is clearly noticeable.

===Lumberjack heroes===
A number of lumberjack heroes were made famous through stories told by itinerant lumberjacks throughout Central Canada and the northern United States. These lumberjack heroes were of French-Canadian origin, and became the basis for many [[Paul Bunyan]] stories. They include tales about [[Joseph Montferrand]] ("Joe Muffreau" or "[[Big Joe Mufferaw]]"), [[Julius Neville]], [[Louis Cyr]], and [[Napoleon La Rue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edmonds|first=Michael|title=Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan, With More Than 100 Logging Camp Tales|date=2010|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society|isbn=9780870204715|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Superstitions==
Other aspects of [[Quebec]] folklore include superstitions surrounding objects, events, and dreams. In essence, these stem from the belief in both [[Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path|White Magic]] and [[Black Magic]], where the former is seen to be beneficial and seeks to bring about positive outcomes, and the latter being essentially malicious, sinister, and all-around [[evil]] (sometimes also called [[witchcraft]]).&lt;ref name="Magic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Magie et Sorcellerie Populaires au Québec |last=DesRuisseaux |first=Pierre |year=1976 |publisher= Triptyque |location=Montreal, Quebec}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Christianity had slowly chipped away at most forms of magic, the populace still held on to its various superstitions for generations. Where religion provides Quebec with a societal structure, these beliefs sought to predict the future, to help alleviate fear of the unknown.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;

Listed below are objects along with a brief description of the superstition associated with them.&lt;ref name="Magic"/&gt;

* Age: A woman, regardless of marital status, will experience an important event during the year following her 31st birthday.
* Bonhomme sept-heures: This man is said to kidnap children who are out of bed after seven o'clock at night. He hides underneath balconies and, equipped with a mask and a bag in which to dispose the children, enters a home after the clock strikes seven.
* Freckles: Having freckles on your arms is a sign of sensuality.
* Hairbrush: If a young woman drops her hairbrush, she'll lose her fiancé.
* Needle:
** If you lose your needle, you will also lose your horse.
** If you drop a needle and it sticks itself into the ground, then someone is thinking ill of you.
* Stars: Count nine stars nine nights in a row, and the last star will point towards your future husband.

==Research into Quebec folklore==
Interest in researching and classifying folklore began during the late 19th century. [[Marius Barbeau]] established himself as one of Canada's foremost folklorists during the early 20th century. [[Luc Lacourcière]] founded the Folklore Archives at [[Laval University]] in [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linteau|first=Paul-André|title=Quebec Since 1930|date=1991|publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Co.|isbn=9781550282962|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laval University offers an academic folklore studies program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forum Mondial UNESCO-OMPI Sur la Protection Du Folklore|date=1998|publisher=Unesco, World Intellectual Property Organization|isbn=9789280507553|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Folklore Studies Association of Canada]] has also done extensive work related to preserving Quebec folklore.

The [[Association Québécoise des Loisirs Folkloriques]], based in Montreal, runs a number of programs for the public year-round, as well as publishing literature and recordings of folklore. The [[Canadian Museum of History]] in [[Gatineau]], the [[McCord Museum]] in Montreal, and the [[Musée Québécois de culture populaire]] in [[Trois-Rivières]] have extensive holdings related to Quebec folklore and folk artifacts.

The '''Houston Museum District''' is an association of 19 [[museum]]s, galleries, cultural centers and community organizations located in [[Houston]], [[Texas]], dedicated to promoting art, science, history and culture.

The Houston Museum District currently includes 19 museums that recorded a collective attendance of over 8.7 million visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;Visit Houston Website, https://www.visithoustontexas.com/about-houston/neighborhoods/museum-district/&lt;/ref&gt; All of the museums offer free times or days and 11 of the museums are free all the time.&lt;ref name="Fact_Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |title=HMDA Fact Sheet |format=PDF |publisher=Houston Museum District Association |url=http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/Fact%20Sheet%202008.doc |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175047/http://www.houstonmuseumdistrict.org/default/Fact%20Sheet%202008.doc |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thursdays the Museum District gets particularly crowded because of museum free days.

Houston's Museum District is walkable and bikeable. Sidewalks are wide and well-maintained, and attractions and restaurants are situated near each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.visithoustontexas.com/about-houston/neighborhoods/museum-district/|title=Houston Museum District - About Houston's Neighborhoods|author=|date=|website=Visit Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/Museum-District-becomes-a-place-of-contrasts-8348899.php Neighborhoods: Museum District becomes a place of contrasts]." ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. July 8, 2016. Retrieved on July 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the Museum District specifically refers to the area located within a 1.5-mile radius of the Mecom Fountain in [[Hermann Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About HMDA|url=http://houstonmuseumdistrict.org/about-hmda/|website=Houston Museum District Association|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}} The Museum District Civic Association compared the area to [[Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and to the [[French Quarter]] of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=Mulvaney/&gt;

The Museum District is served by four stops on the [[METRORail]], one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from [[Interstate 69|I-69]]/[[U.S. Route 59|US 59]], [[Texas State Highway 288|State Highway 288]] and Main Street, across from the main entrance to Rice University.

The beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-1980s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter.  Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.

The Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world.

==History==
In the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists.

The Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]], at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core.    In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the [[United States of America|United States]] without [[zoning]], this was fairly progressive.

The Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between [[Allen Parkway]], [[Buffalo Bayou]] and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Boulevard Saint-Germain|St. Germain]] in [[Paris]], and [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]].

Since its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events
	
The Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District.

==Funding==
Originally, funding was completely based on private sources—association member dues and members’ donations. Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources.

Today, total operating budgets for the member museums exceed $80 million, funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes approximately $1.5 million in Hotel Occupancy Tax funds from the City of Houston and the Houston Arts Alliance;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cachh.org |title=cachh.org |publisher=cachh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonendowment.org |title=Houston Endowment |publisher=Houston Endowment |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The John P.

==Public issues==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
The District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations.
The HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area.

One benefit of living at The Circle at Hermann Park, The Mosaic, The Parklane, The Plaza, The Warwick, or new residential communities being built is that residents enjoy easy walking distance to the Houston Zoo, The Children's Museum of Houston, The Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theater, Hermann Park, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and more.

==Parking==
Parking in the Houston Museum District can be tricky if you visit on Thursdays, weekends, HISD Spring/Summer/Winter vacation days, or evenings when Miller Outdoor Theater is hosting a popular show. A parking lot adjacent to the McGovern Centennial Gardens on Hermann Drive was added in 2014. You may park there for free. Parking in the lot across from the Law Building at MFAH is also free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mfah.org/visit/parking/|title=Parking and Transportation Options - The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|author=|date=|website=www.mfah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; You may also park at the zoo or in the lot near the Rice University Light Rail Station for free (there is a 3-hour time limit). You may pay to park along Hermann Drive or on side streets, in the HMNS garage, or in various garages. You may also park along the MetroRail Line and take the light rail train to Rice University or The Museum District stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://houmuse.org/visitor-information/transportation/|title=Transportation|author=|date=|website=houmuse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Houston Public Library]] Clayton Library, Center for Genealogical Research is located in the Museum District. The genealogical collection, originally housed in the [[Julia Ideson Building]] in [[Downtown Houston]], moved to the William Clayton Home, a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian-style]] house built in 1917, in the Museum District in 1968. A site for a new building, adjacent to the Clayton Home, was purchased in 1986. The new building, which was built in 1988, was designed to complement the Clayton Home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonlibrary.org/history-of-clayton-library |title=History of the Clayton Library Houston Public Library Retrieved on March 11, 2010 |publisher=Houstonlibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301210417/http://www.houstonlibrary.org/history-of-clayton-library |archivedate=March 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city implemented a $6.8 million renovation project for the Clayton Home and the guest house and carriage house on the property in the 2000s.

'''Koroghlu fortress''' is a fortress located in the village of Gala of [[Gadabay District|Gadabay district]]. 

==History==
The name of the fortress is connected with the name of [[Koroğlu|Koroglu]], the national hero of [[Azerbaijan]]. Fortresses with this name are encountered in [[Shamkir District|Shamkir]], Gadabay, [[Tovuz District|Tovuz]] and other regions. Generally, common feature of the Koroghlu fortresses are they are mostly built in the XVII century, and in military-strategic position in high-altitude, inaccessible places. Some researchers state that the age of the monument is older. According to them, the age of these monuments dates back farther than Koroglu, who lived in the XVI-XVII centuries.&lt;ref name="sputnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gomap"/&gt;

==Location==
It is located at an altitude of 2,000 meters above sea level. The fortress is located between the villages of Galakand and Miskinli, on the peak of the rocky cliff. The monument can be climbed only by foot.  The western side of the tower is a steep cliff. The thickness of the walls is about 1 meter. Inside the fortress there are the ruins of windmill, [[Tandoor|tandoor]] and water reservoir. According to local residents, there are hidden underground roads that have not yet been explored in the fortress.&lt;ref name="sputnik"&gt;{{cite web|title= Azərbaycanda gizli yeraltı yollar: sakinlər arasında müxtəlif şayiələr gəzir|url= https://sputnik.az/photo/20171024/412458690/sirli-anbar-gizli-yopllar-ve-koroglu-muemmasi.html|publisher= sputnik.az|language= az|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gomap"&gt;{{cite web|title= Koroğlu qalası|url= https://kataloq.gomap.az/az/all-poi/culture/defensive-structure/9600e2c2d56611e0ad4900226424597d|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Sape''', an abbreviation based on the phrase '''Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes Élégantes''' ([[French language|French]]; literally "Society of Ambiance-Makers and Elegant People") and hinting to the French slang word ''sape'' which means "attire", is a [[subculture]] centered on the cities of [[Kinshasa]] and [[Brazzaville]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Republic of Congo]] respectively. An adherent of La Sape is known as a '''''sapeur'''''.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web|title=The Surprising Sartorial Culture Of Congolese 'Sapeurs' |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/pictureshow/2013/05/07/181704510/the-surprising-sartorial-culture-of-congolese-sapeurs |first=Angela |last=Evancie| publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=7 May 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement embodies the elegance in style and manners of colonial predecessor [[dandies]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
''La sape'' can be traced back to the period of colonialism in Africa, and in particular [[Brazzaville]] and [[Kinshasa]]. The French mission was to civilize the "uncouth" and "naked" African people. They brought second hand clothing from Europe as a bargaining tool to gain the loyalty of the chiefs. Brazzaville soon became the "most favored residential area for whites and the seat of colonial government." By the end of the 19th century their "houseboys" were the first to embrace European modernity because they would be given clothing instead of money as compensation for their work. The Congolese elite not only included the houseboys, but also those who held lower positions as clerks in colonial offices and other places.
[[File:Papa Wemba.jpg|thumb|The noted musician [[Papa Wemba]] was an important supporter of La Sape in Congo]]
A major influence on the Congolese elite, present during the 1920s (the so-called [[Roaring Twenties]]), was West African colonial workers who came to the Congo. These Bapopo or Coastmen, as they were called, served as inspiration for the Congolese elite "to combat ingrained charges of inferiority leveled at them" by French and Belgian colonialism. Young Congolese men took the style of their masters’ and made it their own. In the historian Didier Gondola's essay titled "La Sape Exposed!: High Fashion Among Lower-Class Congolese", he says:

{{quote|Captivated by the snobbery and refined elegance of the Coast Men’s attire, Congolese houseboys spurned their masters’ secondhand clothes and became unremitting consumers and fervent connoisseurs, spending their meager wages extravagantly to acquire the latest fashions from Paris.}}

The houseboys used their connections in [[France]] to acquire their clothing. One colonist{{who|date=April 2016}} looked down on the habits her houseboys in Brazzaville because while they may have been half-starved, they would still don their expensive clothing once their monthly wages came in.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

According to Gondola, Camille Diata frontlined the sape movement in Brazzaville in the 1930s, but also had a deep influence in France. He was also part of L'Amicale, "a loosely organized anti-colonial movement," formed in France in 1926 by the imaginative Congolese revolutionary [[André Matsoua]]. The organization mainly helped Africans new to Paris get settled in the city because they were not really welcomed by French, facing imprisonment and deportation. By the time of Matsoua death in 1942, his political developments gained prominence in the Congo and were "hijacked" by the Congolese intellectual elite. They not only adapted the fashion sense but also his anti-colonial views. This movement became a distinctly ethnic [[Bakongo]] and [[Balari]] one characterized by potent political symbolism and ideology that would manifest in postcolonial era.
[[File:Flickr - enric bach - Entrevista a Mangrokoto Bayaya.jpg|thumb|A Brazzaville sapeur being interviewed for Spanish documentary filmmakers (2010)]]
The 1950s gave rise to the cosmopolitan, thus bringing prominence to the music scene. Nightclubs and beer halls made up the venues home to the music and young urbanites of the Congolese townships of Kinshasa and Brazzaville. La Sape was synonymous with the Congolese rumba scene that surfaced and which [[Papa Wemba]], a Congolese musician, made music about the La Sape style. During the postcolonial years, the unique dynamics of La Sape coalesced in 1960 when both Congos were granted independence. Economic chaos ensued and many were left jobless. This caused numerous Congolese people to move abroad to western cities like [[London]] and [[Paris]]. Since they were also not very welcome, La Sape acted as refuge for them to cope with European life.

==Today==

{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Congolese dandies living in Paris and other [[Europe]]an cities were only deemed sapeur once they returned to Brazzaville in the summer to showcase their style before the mid-1990s.

Although war and strife had riddled the Congo over the years, there has been a revival of La Sape in Brazzaville. Whereas before in the early 1980s when campaigns were being prompted to bar La Sape from public spaces, they are now well respected and are "darlings of the regime." They have been raised to a higher status of "cultural heritage" by [[Denis Sassou Nguesso]] by allowing them to participate in public cultural events like the African Exhibit of Fashion and Crafts (Salon africain de la mode et de l’artisanat).

Gondola argues that:

{{quote|Today, with both countries in turmoil, la sape, with its exuberant flamboyance may well serve as a lightning rod for the Congolese disenfranchised youth to map out their itinerary from Third World status to a modern cosmopolitanism and to cope with their social dereliction.}}

==Cultural influences==
In an interview with [[David M. Ewalt]],{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} media theorist [[Henry Jenkins]] described the traditional cosmopolitan as someone who escapes the orbit of their own parochial culture through high culture and absorption of the values attached to that culture. This includes luxuries such as opera, ballet, paintings, etc. However, the pop cosmopolitan is the modern teenager. He used America to illustrate this point through teenagers today who learn, absorb, and interact with various facets of Asian cultures as a means of escaping the limitations of American culture. They use the Internet and technology to connect with other cultures. Social networks are a force toward globalization and it is this very connectivity that allows modern globalization to thrive.

Sapeurs are shown in a film ''35 Cows and a Kalashnikov'' (2014), directed by Oswald von Richthofen.

'''''Landscape with Charon Crossing the Styx''''' is a painting by the Flemish [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Joachim Patinier]]. Dating to c. 1515–1524, it is in the [[Museo del Prado]] of [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

''Landscape with Charon Crossing Styx'' fits into common Northern Renaissance and early Mannerist trends of art. The 16th century witnessed a new era for painting in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] that combined influences from local traditions and foreign influences. Many artists, including Patinier, traveled to [[Italy]] to study and these travels to the south provided new ideas, particular concerning representations of the natural world. Patinier's religious subjects, therefore, incorporate precise observation and naturalism with fantastic landscapes inspired by the northern traditions of Bosch.

==Iconography==
It depicts the classical subject related by [[Virgil]] in his ''Aeneid'' (book 6, line 369) and [[Dante]] in the ''Inferno'' (book 3, line 78) at the centre of the picture within the [[Christian]] traditions of the [[Last Judgment]] and the [[Ars moriendi]]. The larger figure in the boat is [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], who transports the souls of the dead to the gates of [[Hades]]. The passenger in the boat, too minute to distinguish his expressions, is a human soul deciding between [[Heaven]], to his right (the viewer's left), or [[Hell]], to his left. The river [[Styx]] divides the painting down the centre. It is one of the four rivers of the underworld that passes through the deepest part of hell. On the painting's left side is the fountain of [[Paradise]], the spring from which the river [[Lethe]] flows through Heaven.

On the right side of the composition is Patinier's vision of Hell, drawing largely on [[Hieronymus Bosch|Boschian]] influences. He adapts a description of [[Hades]], in which,  according to the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer Pausanias, one of the gates was located at the southern end of the Peloponnesus, in an inlet still visible on the [[Cape Matapan]]. In front of the gates is [[Cerberus]], a three-headed dog, who guards the entrance of the gate and frightens all the potential souls who enter into Hades. The soul in the boat ultimately chooses his destiny by looking toward Hell and ignoring the angel on the river-bank in Paradise that beckons him to the more difficult path to Heaven.

==Composition and colour==
Patinier utilised a ''[[Weltlandschaft]]'' ("world landscape") composition with a three-colour scheme typical of his work, moving from brown in the foreground, to bluish-green, to pale blue in the background). This format, which Patiner is widely acknowledged as popularising, provides a bird's-eye view over an expansive landscape. Furthermore, the painting uses colour to visibly depict heaven and hell, good and evil. To the viewer's left is a heavenly place with bright blue skies, crystal blue rivers with a luminous fountain and angels accenting the grassy hills. On the far right of the painting is a dark sky engulfing Hell and the hanged figures on its gate. Fires blaze in the hills. The foreground of the painting consists of brown rocks in Heaven and brown burnt trees in Hell. 

In the middle-ground is the river and the grasslands in bright hues of blue and green. The background, which is cut off by the horizon line of the darker blue river, is a pale blue sky highlighted with white and gray clouds.  This compositional form is applied here by the crowded left and right sides bracketed by hills, which pushes the viewer's eye into the open space in the middle and reinforces that the men in the boat are the main focus of the painting.

'''Lead Pencil Studio''' is the working name of the art and architecture collaborative founded in 1997 by Annie Han and Daniel Mihalyo in order to cooperatively pursue [[installation art]], [[site-specific art]] and functional [[architecture]]. They are winners of the 2007 Founder's [[Rome Prize]] in Architecture from the [[American Academy in Rome]], and were recognized in 2006 as an 'Emerging Voices' by the [[Architectural League of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Harthorn, Sandy (2008). "After: Effects of Constructed Space", p. 9. [[Boise Art Museum]], Boise. {{ISBN|978-0-295-98934-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their practice is self-described as "architecture in reverse...our projects are everything about architecture with none of its function...spaces with no greater purpose than to be perceived and question the certainty posited by the man-made world."&lt;ref&gt;Harthorn, Aishaz38 Sandy (2008). "After: Effects of Constructed Space", p. 43. [[Boise Art Museum]], Boise. {{ISBN|978-0-295-98934-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Han and Mihalyo met at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1991 while in the architecture program, and their relationship has evolved into a work partnership centered around Lead Pencil Studio. They have also worked in Bellingham, Chicago, Portland, and Seattle, among others. They currently reside in Seattle, Washington.

===Annie Han===
Annie Han was born in [[Pusan, South Korea]] in 1967, and attained an accredited Master's equivalent in Architecture (5-year B. Arch) from the University of Oregon in 1993 before studying sculpture for one year at [[Portland State University]] in 1994.  She is a naturalized US citizen.

===Daniel Mihalyo===
Daniel Mihalyo was born in [[Bellevue, Washington]] in 1970, and attended [[Western Washington University]] for Fine Art before attaining an accredited  Master's equivalent in Architecture (5-year B. Arch) from the University of Oregon in 1994.

==Notable Installations==

=== Maryhill Double===
Built directly across from the [[Maryhill Museum]] on the plateaus that overlook the [[Columbia River Gorge]],  ''Maryhill Double'' was a temporary installation/building  that duplicated the exact interior volume of the museum that it mirrored. Standing from July 5, 2006 through October 1, 2006 and constructed solely from scaffolding and blue construction netting, Maryhill Double re-framed not only the unusual history of the Maryhill Museum, but also the significance of constructing architecture within unadulterated landscapes. Critics have noted that "The museum and its ghost-like Double work as a paired form, operating...to emphasize the scale of their plateau site...and to dramatize the role of human effort and desire to engage nature or subdue it..."&lt;ref&gt;Sangster, Gary (2007). "Double or Nothing: A Translucent Reflection Takes Shape", p.1. [[Creative Capital]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically enough, during its lifespan the Double was classified as a "[[billboard]]" for zoning and legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Gragg, Randy (2006). "'Maryhill Double' shimmers, mirage-like, in gorge", ''[[The Oregonian]]'', 2006-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail/Commercial===
A temporary installation in an aging upscale mall located in [[Rainier Tower]] (designed by architect, [[Minoru Yamasaki]]) in Seattle, WA,&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jen (2009). "Retail/Commercial", p. 1 [[SLOG: News &amp; Arts]], Seattle&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Retail/Commercial'' occupied a former Italian men's clothing boutique by inserting four distinct retail environments stripped of all merchandise and represented at full-scale by architectural section.  In areas where the narrow sections overlapped atop one another, the furniture, finishes and architecture appeared to cross pollinate. Material for the installation was gathered entirely from retail liquidation sales which occurred in early 2009 within a few blocks of the project.  Uniting the project linearly was a brightly lit white section complete with empty shelving, dropped ceiling, shopping carts, surveillance cameras, signage, baskets, pedestals and mannequins.

===Without Room===
''Without Room'' faithfully recreates in exacting detail the entire living room of an apartment dweller in [[Greensboro, NC]]. The piece, on display at the Weatherspoon Art Museum at [[The University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] from January 17 to April 13, 2008, reconstitutes the entirety of a woman’s possessions rendered homogenous with gray acrylic paint.  Paperwork, books, CDs, collectible treasures, furniture and electronic devices lost their biographical specificity and appeared as anonymous shapes.  Unpainted items included piles of clothing and shoes, left as an homage reference to the originating inhabitant.  The [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] installation intended to explore the [[nesting instinct|nesting]] and spatial consequences of human dwelling.  The living room was selected from a pool of volunteers through a museum advertisement searching for respondents who occupy small living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jen. (2008) "Gray Area: Why Does Some Work by Lead Pencil Studio Look So Much Like Work by Other Artists?", p. 2. [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]], Seattle. 2008-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some inspirations for the piece include Margaret Roberts and [[lidar]] surveying technology.

===After===
A two part installation at the [[Boise Art Museum]] from November 8, 2008 to May 3, 2009, ''After'' is an exploration of the modern forces that create and construct space—architecturally, visually, and conceptually.  The project was composed of two large constructions individually titled, ''After: Billboard'', and ''After: Dwelling''.  "After: Billboard" features a roped off pile of rubble with a sign surface made entirely of layered paper and [[real estate]] advertisements, capped with a window-like opening that exposes the crisscrossing two-by-fours that are the [[superstructure]].  Vaguely discernible real estate slogans and window details of this exterior piece were intended to reference the house-sized construction on the interior of the museum.   "After: Dwelling" was composed of a landscape of gravel approximately 25&amp;nbsp;ft x 50&amp;nbsp;ft with a sharply defined rectilinear impression suggesting a building foundation.  Floating above this field were corners of a house made entirely from architectural foam board and skim coated cement.  Taken together the individual pieces describe the perimeter of a house in the uncertain state of construction or demolition and featuring several design clichés identified with an anonymous [[modern architecture]].  "The Boise Weekly" noted that "...The billboard promises, 'Your Own Piece of Blue Sky!' The wall text tells us the artists are exploring the complex systems involved in the production of space. In other words, advertising dominates the view." &lt;ref&gt;Pettinger, E.J. (2008). "Ad Space: Lead Pencil Studio's 'After' Raises Questions", p. 2. [[The Boise Weekly]], Boise. 2008-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing was introduced from Korea to Japan around 400 AD (in the form of Chinese books), with work done in Chinese by immigrant scribes from the mainland.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Korea and China.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p454"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literacy remained at an extremely marginal level in the 5th and 6th centuries, but during the 7th century a small number of Japanese scholar-aristocrats such as [[Prince Shōtoku]] began to write in Chinese for official purposes and in order to promote Buddhism.&lt;ref name="totman-p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Totman|2000|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 7th century, reading and writing had become an integral part of life of some sections of the ruling and intellectual classes, particularly in government and religion.&lt;ref name="seeley-p40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extant large-scale works compiled in Japan are the historical chronicles ''[[Kojiki]]'' (712) and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720).&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"/&gt; Other early Japanese works from the [[Nara period]] include biographies of Prince Shōtoku, cultural and geographical records ([[fudoki]]) and the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'', the first anthology of [[Japanese poetry]]. Necessarily all of these works were either written in Chinese or in a hybrid Japanese-Chinese style and were modeled on Chinese prototypes. The development of a distinct Japanese script ([[kana]]) in the 9th century was the starting point of the classical age of [[Japanese literature]] and led to a number of new, uniquely Japanese genres of literature, such as tales (''[[monogatari]]'') or diaries (''[[Nikki Bungaku|nikki]]''). Because of the strong interest and support in literature of the [[Heian period|Heian]] court, writing activities flourished particularly in the 10th and 11th centuries.

This list contains books of various type that have been compiled in [[Classical Japan|Classical]] and early [[Feudal Japan]]. More than half of the 68 designated treasures are works of poetry and prose. Another large segment consists of historical works such as manuscripts of the ''Kojiki'' and ''Nihon Shoki''; the rest are books of various type such as dictionaries, law books, biographies or music scores. The designated manuscripts date from 9th century Heian period to the [[Edo period]] with most dating to the Heian period. They are housed in [[Buddhist temple|temples]], museums, libraries or archives, universities and in private collections.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"&gt;{{cite web

===Japanese literature===
The adaption of the Chinese script, introduced in Japan in the 5th or 6th century, followed by the 9th century development of a script more suitable to write in the [[Japanese language]], is reflected in ancient and classical [[Japanese literature]] from the 7th to 13th century. This process also caused unique genres of Japanese literature to evolve from earlier works modelled on Chinese prototypes.&lt;ref name="seeley-p6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keally-historic"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest traces of Japanese literature date to the 7th century and consist of Japanese verse ([[Waka (poetry)|waka]]) and poetry written in Chinese by Japanese poets ([[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]).&lt;ref name="kato-p12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p459"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p471"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the latter showed little literary merit compared to the large volume of poems composed in China, waka poetry made great progress in the [[Nara period]] culminating in the [[Man'yōshū]], an anthology of more than 4,000 pieces of mainly [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]] ("short poem") from the period up to the mid-8th century.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p473-460-472"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aston-p33-35"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aston|2001|pp=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kodanshainternat-p119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kodansha International|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 9th century, Japanese language texts were written in [[Chinese character]]s via the [[man'yōgana]] writing system, generally using the [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonetic value]] of the characters. Since longer passages written in this system became unmanageably long, man'yōgana was used mainly for poetry while classical Chinese was reserved for prose.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p460461"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|pp=460–461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p475"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p81"/&gt; Consequently, the prose passages in the Man'yōshū are in Chinese and the [[Kojiki]] (712), the oldest extant chronicle, uses man'yōgana only for the songs and poems.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p460461"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p475"/&gt;

A revolutionary achievement was the development of [[kana]], a true Japanese script, in the mid to late 9th century.&lt;ref name="kodanshainternat-p120"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kodansha International|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new script enabled Japanese authors to write more easily in their own language and led to a variety of vernacular prose literature in the 10th century such as tales ([[monogatari]]) and poetic journals ([[Nikki Bungaku|nikki]]).&lt;ref name="kodanshainternat-p120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p2-113-114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|pp=2, 113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p594"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese waka poetry and Japanese prose reached their highest developments around the 10th century, supported by the general revival of traditional values and the high status ascribed to literature by the [[Heian period|Heian]] court.&lt;ref name="mason-p81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|Caiger|1997|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keene-p23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keene|1955|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiveley-p432-433"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|pp=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Heian period (794 to 1185) is therefore generally referred to as the classical age of Japanese literature.&lt;ref name="aston-p54"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aston|2001|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being the language of scholarship, government and religion, Chinese was still practiced by the male nobility of the 10th century while for the most part aristocratic women wrote diaries, memoirs, poetry and fiction in the new script.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' written in the early 11th century by a noblewoman ([[Murasaki Shikibu]]) is according to [[Helen Craig McCullough]] the "single most impressive accomplishment of Heian civilization".&lt;ref name="shiveley-p444"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another literary genre called [[setsuwa]] ("informative narration") goes back to orally transmitted [[myths]], [[legend]]s, [[Folklore|folktale]]s, and [[anecdote]]s. Setsuwa comprise the oldest Japanese tales, were originally Buddhist influenced, and were meant to be educational.&lt;ref name="mccullough-p7"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCullough|1991|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mccullough-p8"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCullough|1991|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest setsuwa collection is the [[Nihon Ryōiki]] (early 9th century). With a widening religious and social interest of the aristocracy, setsuwa collections were compiled again in the late 11th century starting with the [[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]&lt;ref name="shirane-p116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p595"/&gt; The high quality of the ''Tale of Genji'' influenced the literature into the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref name="frederic-p594"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p595"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=595}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of monogatari and some of the best poetic treatises were written in the early [[Kamakura period]] (around 1200).&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p571"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waka====
[[Waka (poetry)|Waka]] ("Japanese poem") or ''uta'' ("song") is an important genre of Japanese literature. The term originated in the Heian period to distinguish Japanese-language poetry from ''[[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]'', poetry written in Chinese by Japanese authors.&lt;ref name="frederic-p1024"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-p2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waka began as an [[oral tradition]], in tales, festivals and rituals,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Traces of ancient poems of courtship and praise for the ruler survive in the [[Kojiki]], [[Nihon Shoki]] and [[Man'yōshū]].&lt;/ref&gt; and began to be written in the 7th century.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p459"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p466"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and Nara periods, "waka" included a number of poetic forms such as tanka ("short poems"), chōka ("long poems"), [[bussokusekika]], sedōka ("memorized poem") and katauta ("poem fragment"), but by the 10th century only the 31-syllable tanka survived.&lt;ref name="frederic-p1024"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p476"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=476}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p2-6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|pp=2, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Man'yōshū]], of the mid-8th century, is the primary record of early Japanese poetry and the first waka anthology.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p473-460-472"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|pp=460, 472–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carter-p18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the three main forms of poetry at time of compilation: 4,200 tanka, 260 chōka and 60 sedōka; dating from 759 backwards more than one century.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The Man'yōshū also consists of a small amount of Chinese poetry ([[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]) and prose ([[kanbun]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p475"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p473"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 9th century, however, was a period of direct imitation of Chinese models making kanshi the major form of poetry at the time.&lt;ref name="shiveley-p431"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carter-p73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 9th century, waka and the development of [[kana]] script rose simultaneously with the general revival of traditional values, culminating in the compilation of the first [[List of Japanese poetry anthologies|imperial waka anthology]], the [[Kokinshū]], in 905.&lt;ref name="shiveley-p432-433"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p113"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed in 951 by the [[Gosen Wakashū]]; in all seven imperial anthologies were compiled in the Heian period.&lt;ref name="shiveley-p438"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carter-p74"/&gt; The main poetic subjects were love and the four seasons; the standards of vocabulary, grammar and style, established in the Kokinshū, dominated waka composition into the 19th century.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiveley-p433"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-p58-59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|pp=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For aristocrats to succeed in private and public life during the Heian period, it was essential to be fluent in the composition and appreciation of waka, as well as having thorough knowledge of and ability in music, and calligraphy.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-p58"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry was used in witty conversations, in notes of invitation, thanks or condolence, and for correspondence between friends and lovers.&lt;ref name="carter-p74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiveley-p432"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-p57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the finest poetry of the Heian period came from the middle-class court society such as [[Lady-in-waiting|ladies in waiting]] or middle-rank officials.&lt;ref name="carter-p74"/&gt; [[Uta-awase]] poetry contests, in which poets composed poetry on a given theme to be judged by an individual, were held from 885 onwards, and became a regular activity for Heian [[courtiers]] from the 10th century onward.&lt;ref name="carter-p74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-p58-59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p592-593"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|pp=592–593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contest judgments led to works about waka theory and critical studies. Poems from the contents were added to imperial anthologies.&lt;ref name="carter-p74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p593"/&gt; Critical theories, and the poems in the anthologies (particularly the Kokinshū), became the basis for judgments in the contests.&lt;ref name="kato-p59"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utaawase continued to be held through the late-11th century, as social rather than literary events. Held in opulence in a spirit of friendly rivalry, they included chanters, scribes, consultants, musicians, and an audience.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p593"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiveley-p436"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=436}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Heian period, waka were often collected in large anthologies, such as the Man'yōshū or Kokinshū, or smaller private collections of the works of a single poet.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p113"/&gt; Waka also featured highly in all kinds of literary prose works including [[monogatari]], [[Nikki Bungaku|diaries]] and historical works.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p114"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carter-p74"/&gt; ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' alone contains 800 waka.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p2"/&gt;

At the end of the Heian period, the aristocracy lost political and economical power to warrior clans, but retained the prestige as custodians of high culture and literature.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p571"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carter-p145"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nostalgia for the Heian court past, considered then as classical Japanese past (as opposed to Chinese past), created a renaissance in the arts and led to a blossoming of waka in the early [[Kamakura period]].&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p571"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yamamura-p453"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamamura|1990|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carter-p145-146"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|pp=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poets of middle and lower rank, such as [[Fujiwara no Shunzei]], [[Saigyō Hōshi]] and [[Fujiwara no Teika]], analyzed earlier works, wrote critical commentaries, and added new [[Japanese aesthetics|aesthetic]] values such as [[yūgen]] to waka poetry.&lt;ref name="addis-p96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Addiss|Groemer|Rimer (eds.)|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kato-p91-92"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|pp=91–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yamamura-p454"&gt;{{Harvnb|Yamamura|1990|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the best imperial anthologies and best poetic anthologies, such as Shunzei's ''Korai fūteishō'', were created in the early Kamakura period.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p571"/&gt; The audience was extended from the aristocracy to high ranking warriors and priests, who began to compose waka.
&lt;ref name="carter-p146"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p572"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal-p249"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 14th century, linked verse or [[renga]] superseded waka poetry in importance.&lt;ref name="carter-p147"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal-p251"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deal|2007|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 29 National Treasures of 14 collections of [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] and two works on waka style, compiled from between the 8th and the mid-13th century with most from the Heian period. The two works of waka theory are Wakatai jisshu (945) and Korai fūteishō (1197). The collections include the two first imperial waka anthologies: Kokinshū (905, ten treasures) and Gosen Wakashū (951); seven private anthologies: Man'yōshū (after 759, three treasures), Shinsō Hishō (1008), Nyūdō Udaijin-shū (before 1065), Sanjūrokunin Kashū (ca. 1112), Ruijū Koshū (before 1120), Shūi Gusō (1216), Myōe Shōnin Kashū (1248); and five utaawase contents: including one imaginary content (Kasen utaawase), the Konoe edition of the Poetry Match in Ten Scrolls (three treasures), Ruijū utaawase, the Poetry competition in 29 rounds at [[Hirota Shrine]] and the Record of Poetry Match in Fifteen Rounds. The designated manuscripts of these works found in this list date from the Heian and Kamakura periods.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

====Monogatari, Japanese-Chinese poetry, setsuwa====
There are ten National Treasures of six works of Japanese prose and mixed Chinese-Japanese poetry compiled from between the early 9th and the first half of the 13th century. The manuscripts in this list date from between the early 10th to the second half of the 13th century.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; The three volume [[Nihon Ryōiki]] was compiled by the private&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;As opposed to a publicly recognized and certified priest ordained by the [[ritsuryō]] state.&lt;/ref&gt; priest Kyōkai around 822.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p118"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p117"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="keikai-p3"/&gt; It is the oldest collection of Japanese anecdotes or [[folklore|folk stories]] ([[setsuwa]]) which probably came out of an oral tradition.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p118"/&gt;&lt;ref name="keikai-p3"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keikai|Nakamura|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining Buddhism with local folk stories, this work demonstrates [[Karma in Buddhism|karmic]] causality and functioned as a handbook for preaching.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p118"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="keikai-p33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keikai|Nakamura|1996|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;They are the so called Kōfuku-ji and Shinpuku-ji manuscripts covering the first volume and the second to third volume respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; out of four&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The other two manuscripts are the Maeda (vol. 3) and Kōya (fragments of vols. 1 to 3) manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; extant distinct but incomplete manuscripts have been designated as a National Treasures.&lt;ref name="keikai-p9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Keikai|Nakamura|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest [[kana]] materials and one of the oldest extant works of Japanese prose fiction is the ''[[Tosa Diary]]'' written by [[Ki no Tsurayuki]] in 935.&lt;ref name="tsurayuki-p5-7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tsurayuki|Porter|2005|pp=5, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miner-p20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miner|1969|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frellesvig-p175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frellesvig|2010|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the oldest Japanese [[Travel literature|travel diary]], giving an account of a return journey to Kyoto after a four-year term as prefect of [[Tosa Province]].&lt;ref name="tsurayuki-p5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tsurayuki|Porter|2005|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason-p85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Mason|Caiger|1997|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p516"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diary consists of close to 60 poems,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Poetry is used to express personal feelings.&lt;/ref&gt; connected by prose sections that detail the circumstances and the inspiration for the composition of the poems.&lt;ref name="frederic-p594"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccullough-p1670"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCullough|1991|pp=16, 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p62"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varley|2000|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been valued as a model for composition in the Japanese style.&lt;ref name="aston-p75-76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Aston|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original manuscript by Ki no Tsurayuki had been stored at [[Sanjūsangen-dō|Rengeō-in]] palace library, and later was in the possession of [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]], after which its trace is lost.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p93"/&gt; All surviving manuscripts of the Tosa Diary are copies of this Rengeō-in manuscript.&lt;ref name="kornicki-p94"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kornicki|1998|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest extant of these, by [[Fujiwara no Teika]], dates to 1235. One year later his son, [[Fujiwara no Tameie]], produced another copy based on the original. Both transcriptions are complete [[facsimile]]s of the original, inclusive of the text, the layout, orthographical usages, and calligraphy.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Tameie's transcription contains fewer mistakes than Teika's.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kornicki-p94"/&gt; They have been designated as National Treasures.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;

The 984 Sanbō Ekotoba ("The three jewels" or "Tale of the three brothers" or "Notes on the pictures of the three jewels"), was written by [[Minamoto no Tamenori]] in Chinese for the amusement of a young tonsured princess.&lt;ref name="shiveley-p348"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p815"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The work's title is variously translated as
*"Tale of the three brothers": {{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=815}}
*"The three jewels": {{Harvnb|Stone|Walter|2008|p=105}}
*"Notes on the pictures of the three jewels": {{Harvnb|Iyengar|2006|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a collection of Buddhist tales and a guide to important Buddhist ceremonies and figures in Japanese Buddhist history.&lt;ref name="stone-p105"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|Walter|2008|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="groner-p274"&gt;{{Harvnb|Groner|2002|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designated manuscript from 1273 is known as the Tōji Kanchiin&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Named after the Kanchiin subtemple of [[Tō-ji]].&lt;/ref&gt; manuscript and is the second oldest of the Sanbō Ekotoba. It is virtually complete unlike the late Heian period (Tōdaiji-gire) which is a scattered assortment of fragments.&lt;ref name="kamens-p24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kamens|Minamoto|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural interaction between Japan and China is exemplified by the [[Wakan Rōeishū]], a collection of 234 Chinese poems, 353 poems written in Chinese by Japanese poets ([[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]]) and 216 [[Waka (poetry)|waka]], all arranged by topic.&lt;ref name="carter-p125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carter|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p286"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Smits | first = Ivo | title = Song as Cultural History: Reading Wakan Roeishu (Interpretations) | journal = [[Monumenta Nipponica]] | volume = 55 | year = 2000 | issue = 3 | pages = 399–427 | jstor = 2668298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compiled in the early 11th century by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]], it was the first and most successful work of this genre.&lt;ref name="kato-p61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p285"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiveley-p428"/&gt; The English title, "Japanese-Chinese Recitation Collection" indicates that the poems in this collection were meant to be sung.&lt;ref name="kato-p61"&gt;{{Harvnb|Katō|Sanderson|1997|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p285"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shiveley-p428"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shively|McCullough|1999|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wakan Rōeishū has been valued as a source for poetry recitation, waka composition and for its calligraphy, as it displayed kana and kanji.&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p286"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shiraneb-p287"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three manuscripts of the Wakan Rōeishū written on decorated paper have been designated as National Treasures: the two scrolls at the [[Kyoto National Museum]] contain a complete transcription of the work and are a rare and fully developed example of calligraphy on an ''ashide-e''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;A decorative pictorialized style of calligraphy in which characters are disguised in the shape of reeds (''ashi''), streams, rocks, flowers, birds, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; ground;&lt;ref name="jaanus-ashide"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/a/ashide.htm |title=Ashide |publisher= [[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]]|accessdate= 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Konoe edition at Yōmei Bunko is a beautiful example of ''karakami''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;An earth-colored based paper imported from China.&lt;/ref&gt; with five-colored design (''saisen'');&lt;ref name="jaanus-karakami"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/karakami.htm |title=Karakami|publisher= [[Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]]|accessdate= 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Ōtagire is written on dyed paper decorated with gold drawings.&lt;ref name="nakata-p139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nakata|first=Yūjirō|title=The art of Japanese calligraphy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1hQAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2011-05-04|date=May 1973|publisher=Weatherhill|isbn=978-0-8348-1013-6|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knm-wakansho"/&gt;

===History books and historical tales===
The oldest known&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Older texts such as the [[Tennōki]], [[Kokki]], [[Kyūji]] or [[Teiki]] from the 7th century have been lost, while others such as the [[Sangyō Gisho]] or the [[Taihō Code]] are relatively short or only exist as fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Composed in Japan on Japanese topics; most notably, the [[Japanese language]] is not meant here.&lt;/ref&gt; large-scale works are historical books (''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'') or regional cultural and geographical records (''[[fudoki]]'') compiled on imperial order in the early 8th century.&lt;ref name="shirane-p1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p470481"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|pp=470, 481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sakamoto-pxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakamoto|1991|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were written with the aim of legitimizing the new centralized state under imperial rule by linking the origin of [[Japanese emperor|emperors]] to the [[Age of the Gods]].&lt;ref name="shirane-p1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p352"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sakamoto-pxiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakamoto|1991|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these historical books is the Kojiki ("Record of ancient matters") dating from 712 and composed by [[Ō no Yasumaro]] at the request of [[Empress Genmei]].&lt;ref name="seeley-p41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p545"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frédéric|2005|p=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ono-p10"/&gt; Written in ancient Japanese style using Chinese [[Ideogram|ideographs]], it presents the [[Japanese mythology|mythological origin of Japan]] and historical events up to the year 628.&lt;ref name="frederic-p545"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ono-p10"/&gt; Shortly after the completion of the ''Kojiki'', the ''Nihon Shoki'' (or ''Nihongi'') appeared in 720, probably originating to an order by [[Emperor Tenmu]] in 681.&lt;ref name="sakamoto-pxi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shirane-p44"/&gt; It is a much more detailed version of the Kojiki, dating events and providing alternative versions of myths; it covers the time up to 697.&lt;ref name="ono-p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sakamoto-pxixiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakamoto|1991|pp=xi, xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seeley-p4647"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|pp=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the Kojiki, it follows the model of [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese dynastic histories]] more closely in style and language, using orthodox classical Chinese.&lt;ref name="sakamoto-pxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sakamoto|1991|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newhistshinto-p29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Breen|Teeuwen|2010|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these works provide the historical and spiritual basis for [[shinto]].&lt;ref name="ono-p10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ono|Woodard|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p322"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 713, [[Empress Genmei]] ordered provincial governors to compile official reports on the history, geography and local folk customs.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p469"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frellesvig-p25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frellesvig|2010|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewin-p85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1994|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; These provincial [[gazetteer]]s are known as fudoki (lit. "Records of wind and earth") and provide valuable information about economic and ethnographic data, local culture and tales.&lt;ref name="lewin-p85"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shirane-p53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of more than 60 provincial records compiled in the early 8th century only five survived: one, the [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] Fudoki (733), in complete form and four, [[Bungo Province|Bungo]] (730s), [[Harima Province|Harima]] (circa 715), [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]] (714–718) and [[Hizen Province|Hizen]] (730s) as fragments.&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p469"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frellesvig-p25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="shirane-p53"/&gt; The Nihon Shoki is the first official history of Japan and the first of a set of six national histories ([[Rikkokushi]]) compiled over a 200-year period on Chinese models.&lt;ref name="shirane-p44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirane-p45"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirane|2008b|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p6768"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varley|2000|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these six histories, [[Sugawara no Michizane]] arranged historical events chronologically and thematically in the [[Ruijū Kokushi]] which was completed in 892.&lt;ref name="burns-p246"&gt;{{Harvnb|Burns|2003|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="piggot-p300"&gt;{{Harvnb|Piggott|1997|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the cessation of official missions to China and a general trend of turning away from Chinese-derived institutions and behavioral patterns in the latter part of the 9th century, the compilation of such national histories patterned on formal Chinese dynastic histories was abandoned.&lt;ref name="varley-p68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Varley|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of [[kana]] script, new styles of uniquely Japanese literature such as the [[monogatari]] appeared around that time.&lt;ref name="varley-p68"/&gt; The newer style of historic writing that emerged during the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] regency, at the turning point of ancient imperial rule and the classical era, was called historic tale (''rekishi monogatari'') and became influenced by the fictional tale, especially by the ''Tale of Genji'', with which it shared the scene-by-scene construction as fundamental difference to earlier historic writings.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Other differences are: a realistic dialogue, the presentation of more than one viewpoint and the embellishment with a wealth of realistic detail.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varley-p68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brownlee-p42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brownlee|1991|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perkins-p13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Perkins|1998|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest historical tale is the ''[[Eiga Monogatari]]'' ("A Tale of Flowering Fortunes"), giving a eulogistic chronological account of the Fujiwara from 946 to 1027, focusing particularly on [[Fujiwara no Michinaga]].&lt;ref name="mccullough-p11200"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCullough|1991|pp=11, 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="perkins-p1323"&gt;{{Harvnb|Perkins|1998|pp=13, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brownlee-p46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brownlee|1991|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was largely&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;30 out of 40 volumes.&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Akazome Emon]], probably shortly after the death of Michinaga in 1027.&lt;ref name="perkins-p13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mccullough-p11"&gt;{{Harvnb|McCullough|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are eleven National Treasures in the category of historical books including one manuscript of the Kojiki, five manuscripts of the Nihon Shoki, the Harima and Hizen Fudoki, two manuscripts of the Ruijū Kokushi and one of the Eiga Monogatari.
All of these treasures are later copies and with the exception of the Eiga Monogatari, the complete content of the works has to be assembled from several of these (and other) fragmentary manuscripts or be inferred from other sources. The Kojiki, long neglected by scholars until the 18th century, was not preserved as well as the Nihon Shoki which has been studied from soon after its compilation. While being the oldest text in this list, the extant manuscript dating to the 14th century is the earliest entry.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frederic-p545"/&gt;

There are 18 Japanese book National Treasures that do not belong to any of the above categories. They cover 14 works of various types, including biographies, law or rulebooks, temple records, [[Sheet music|music scores]], a medical book and dictionaries.&lt;ref name="bunkacho"/&gt; Two of the oldest works designated are biographies of the [[Asuka period]] regent [[Prince Shōtoku|Shōtoku Taishi]]. The ''Shitennō-ji Engi'', alleged to have been an autobiography by Prince Shōtoku, described [[Shitennō-ji]], and may have been created to promote the temple.&lt;ref name="lee-p40-42"/&gt; The Shitennō-ji Engi National Treasure consists of two manuscripts: the alleged original discovered in 1007 at Shitennō-ji and a later transcription by [[Emperor Go-Daigo]].&lt;ref name="lee-p40-42"/&gt; Written by imperial order in the early 8th century, the ''[[Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu]]'' is the oldest extant biography of Shōtoku.&lt;ref name="lee-p72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|2007|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lee-p141"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|2007|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p482"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|Hall|1993|p=482}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a collection of anecdotes, legendary and miraculous in nature, which emphasize Shōtoku's Buddhist activities for the sake of imperial legitimacy, and stands at the beginning of Buddhist setsuwa literature.&lt;ref name="lee-p72"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHoJ-p482"/&gt; The oldest extant manuscript of the 803 ''Enryaku Kōtaishiki'', a compendium of rules concerned with the change of provincial governors from 782 to 803, has been designated as a National Treasure.&lt;ref name="enryaku-kotaishi"/&gt;

The oldest extant Japanese lexica date to the early Heian period.&lt;ref name="lewin-p248"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1994|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Chinese [[Yupian]], the ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'' was compiled around 830 by [[Kūkai]] and is the oldest extant [[Chinese character|character]] [[Japanese dictionary|dictionary made in Japan]].&lt;ref name="Hausmann1991-p2618"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hausmann|first=Franz Josef|title=Wörterbücher: ein internationales Handbuch zur Lexikographie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kwqc7xso22wC&amp;pg=PA2618|accessdate=2011-05-15|year=1991|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-012421-7|page=2618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kozanji-nt"/&gt; The ''Hifuryaku'' is a massive Chinese dictionary in 1000 fascicles listing the usage of words and characters in more than 1500 texts of diverse genres.&lt;ref name="AdolphsonKamens2007-p182"/&gt; Compiled in 831 by Shigeno Sadanushi and others, it is the oldest extant [[Japanese encyclopedias|Japanese proto-encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name="lewin-p248"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdolphsonKamens2007-p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adolphson|Kamens|Matsumoto (eds.)|2007|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two National Treasures of the [[Ishinpō]], the oldest extant medical treatise of Japanese authorship compiled in 984 by Tanba Yasuyori.&lt;ref name="Leslie1976-p327"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Charles M.|title=Asian medical systems: a comparative study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjDo1Xxj4XUC&amp;pg=PA327|accessdate=2011-05-15|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03511-9|page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ninnaji-cultass5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ishinpo-tnm"/&gt; It is based on a large number of Chinese medical and pharmaceutical texts and contains knowledge about drug prescription, herbal lore, hygiene, acupuncture, [[moxibustion]], alchemy and magic.&lt;ref name="Leslie1976-p327"/&gt; The two associated treasures consist of the oldest extant (partial) and the oldest extant complete manuscript respectively.&lt;ref name="ninnaji-cultass5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ishinpo-tnm"/&gt;

Compiled between 905 and 927 by Tadahira, the [[Engishiki]] is the most respected legal compendium of the [[ritsuryō]] age and an important resource for the study of the Heian period court system.&lt;ref name="totman-p119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Totman|2000|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lu1997-p17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AdolphsonKamens2007-p43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adolphson|Kamens|Matsumoto (eds.)|2007|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Daigo]] commanded its compilation; the Engishiki is according to David Lu an "invaluable" resource and "one of the greatest compilations of laws and precedents".&lt;ref name="Lu1997-p17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lu|first=David John|title=Japan: a documentary history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJxf1W74XSoC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=2011-05-15|year=1997|publisher=M.E.

The designated Kyoto National Museum manuscript of the Hokuzanshō from about 1000 is noted for one of the few early extant examples of [[hiragana]] use and for the oldest extant letters in [[kana]] written on the reverse side of the scroll.&lt;ref name="seeley-p74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Seeley|1991|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hokuzansho-tnm"/&gt; Around the early 12th century a [[Shingon]] Buddhist priest compiled a dictionary with a large number of [[Variant Chinese character|variant form characters]] known as ''[[Ruiju Myōgishō]]''.

The '''Lollybot Collective''' is a multimedia [[art collective]] founded in [[Detroit, MI]].&lt;ref&gt;The Arts - Do-It-Yourself: The Lollybot Collective&lt;{{cite web |url=http://thedetroiter.com/b2evoArt/blogs/index.php?blog=2&amp;c=1&amp;more=1&amp;pb=1&amp;tb=1&amp;title=do_it_yourself_the_lollybot_collective |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828131134/http://thedetroiter.com/b2evoArt/blogs/index.php?blog=2&amp;title=do_it_yourself_the_lollybot_collective&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The collective is made up of over fifty artists dedicated to positive change in a fun environment. Their gallery shows are well known for their laid back atmosphere, live shows and cheap beer. The collective is non-profit, all money is used to support the continuation of the artists' galleries and music. They do not take an independent commission from sold art pieces.

Interaction between the audience and the art is highly encouraged. In their first show about accidents, an artist Curt Greene created a balanced sculpture that would fall apart if touched. In their second show "Feedback" the walls of the gallery were lined with brown paper allowing the audience to write responses to the art on the wall. This notion was used again in their third show "Restrictions". Video has also been used as a way to interact with art, at "Restrictions" there was a camera placed outside the bathroom that fed into a TV placed in the bathroom so that the person inside could see the line outside the bathroom.&lt;ref&gt;Alarm Press Magazine Spotlight &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alarmpress.com/7535/music-interview/diy-venue-spotlight-the-lollybot-collective/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215184232/http://www.alarmpress.com/7535/music-interview/diy-venue-spotlight-the-lollybot-collective/ |archivedate=2009-02-15 |df= }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective was founded in 2007 by college friends Matthew Pritchard and Jeff Nolan who were attending The [[College for Creative Studies]] in Detroit.

==Key Members==

The '''Miami Design District''', historically a part of [[Buena Vista (Miami)|Buena Vista]], is a neighborhood within the city of [[Miami]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], south of [[Lemon City, Florida|Lemon City]] (Little Haiti).  It is roughly bound by [[U.S. Route 27 in Florida|North 36 St (US 27)]] to the south, North 43rd Street to the north, West First Avenue to the west and [[Biscayne Boulevard]] to the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidesigndistrict.net/pdf/MDDLocatorMap.pdf|title=District Design Map|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Design District was made up primarily of old [[low-rise]] [[warehouse]]s that have been converted into retail spaces, art galleries, restaurants and cafés, but now includes a large amount of new construction, primarily for high-end retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/biz-monday/article1955427.html|title=Miami Design District’s transformation into a luxury shopping destination is underway|last=Cordle|first=Ina Paiva|date=2013-09-23|website=Miami Herald|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Design District is in the crossroads of many prominent Miami neighborhoods, with the artsy [[Wynwood]] neighborhood to the south, Lemon City ([[Little Haiti]]) and the historic 1920s [[Buena Vista (Miami)|Buena Vista]] neighborhood to the north, and the wealthy [[Upper East Side (Miami)|Upper East Side]] neighborhoods to the east. After decades of falling to [[urban decay]], the Design District has risen to fame as a destination for the arts, [[design]], and [[fashion]].

It is home to over 130 art galleries, showrooms, creative services, [[architecture firm]]s, luxury fashion stores, antiques dealers, eateries and bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamidesigndistrict.net/browse.php|title=Directory of Fashion, Furniture &amp; Watch Stores {{!}} Miami Design District|website=www.miamidesigndistrict.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-end brands like [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Christian Dior SE|Dior]], [[Prada]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Saint Laurent]] and [[Hermès|Hermes]] are located in the Design District as well as restaurants from award-winning chefs like Michael Schwartz and celebrities like [[Gloria Estefan|Gloria]] and [[Emilio Estefan]]; a public art collection with works from Buckminster Fuller, Marc Newsom and Urs Fischer as well as museums and galleries like the Institute for Contemporary Art, Miami, The [[De la Cruz Collection|de la Cruz Collection of Contemporary Art]] and Locust Projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/gallery/what-to-do-in-the-miami-design-district|title=What to Do in the Miami Design District: Our Guide|last=Wood|first=Sara Liss,Jennifer M.|work=Condé Nast Traveler|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The area of land that is now the Design District was once a pineapple farm in a neighborhood referred to as Buena Vista. Farm owner, T.V. Moore, built the historic Moore Building in the 1920’s for his family furniture business. The Moore Furniture Building was one of the first stores in the U.S. dedicated strictly to furniture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicpreservationmiami.com/pdfs/2011%20designation%20reports%20updates/Buena_Vista_Post_Office_Designation_Report.pdf |title=Buena Vista Post Office Designation Report|last=|first=|date=|website=Historic Preservation Miami|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Today the area today known as the Design District. Signs and names with the name Buena Vista can still be seen throughout the area such as the Buena Vista Post Office, and Buena Vista School.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

By the 1980s and early-1990s, the Design District had fallen to [[urban decay]], and it wasn't until the late 1990s, and early 2000s, that art and design stores began opening up in the Design District. Throughout the 2000s, the Design District continued to grow in popularity, and with heavy public and private investment in the neighborhood, the streets and sidewalks were redone, and new trees were planted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.departures.com/fashion/shopping/bal-harbour-shops-vs-design-district|title=Bal Harbour Shops vs. the Design District|last=Gross|first=Michael|date=2014-09-24|website=Departures|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Credited to starting the district is [[Craig Robins]], who purchased many run-down buildings in the 18 square block area and persuaded many top designers, such as Alison Spear, [[Holly Hunt]] and Peter Page to relocate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oceandrive.com/style/articles/craig-robins-jump-starts-the-design-district|title=Craig Robins Jump-Starts the Design District|last=McGee|first=Suzanne|date=2012-12-03|work=Ocean Drive|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2016, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] issued a travel warning, advising pregnant women not to visit the Design District, [[Wynwood]], and [[Midtown Miami]] areas to avoid getting the [[Zika virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Daniel Chang|author2=Emily Cochrane|title=With 10 new Zika cases in Miami, CDC advises pregnant women to avoid Wynwood|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/health-care/article93057392.html|website=miamiherald.com|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2 August 2016|date=1 August 2016|quote=The advisory extends to all expectant mothers, and women planning on becoming pregnant who have traveled to a one-square-mile area north of downtown Miami — including Wynwood, Midtown and the Design District — on or after June 15, said CDC Director Tom Frieden.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cdc_zika'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/zika/intheus/florida-update.html |title=Advice for people living in or traveling to Wynwood, a neighborhood in Miami, FL |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |access-date=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor Rick Scott lifted the area’s “Zika Zone” designation on September 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://therealdeal.com/miami/2017/06/28/wynwood-businesses-lost-as-much-as-40-in-revenue-due-to-zika-report/|title=Wynwood businesses lost as much as 40% of their revenue due to Zika: report|date=2017-06-28|work=The Real Deal Miami|access-date=2018-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shopping==
The District is home to many flagship luxury stores including [[Hermès]], [[Tom Ford]], [[Louis Vuitton]], [[Christian Louboutin]], [[Prada]], [[Celine]] and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/fashion/in-miami-luxury-know-no-limits.html|title=In Miami, Luxury Knows No Limits|last=Madigan|first=Nick|date=2014-12-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, there are over 70 stores open in the District, with another 60 set to open by mid-2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article19334178.html|title=Redesign of the Design District: New boutiques and restaurants arriving|last=Nehamas|first=Nicholas|date=2015-04-23|work=miamiherald|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the first luxury retailer opened in the Design District, [[Christian Louboutin]], marking a new era for the Design District. Later that year, [[Yohji Yamamoto]] opened in the Design District. In 2011, [[Louis Vuitton]] announced plans to open a Louis Vuitton store in the neighborhood by 2014 after announcing its closure of its [[Bal Harbour Shops]] store (the first Louis Vuitton store to open outside of [[New York City]]), along with opening other brands from the [[LVMH]] company in the Design District, including stores such as [[Sephora]], [[Marc Jacobs]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Fendi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Louis Vuitton moving to Aventura Mall, Design District |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-03-28/business/mh-louis-vuitton-20110328_1_aventura-mall-miami-design-district-miami-s-design-district |author=Walker, Elaine |newspaper=The Miami Herald |date=March 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, [[Hermes]], [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]] and [[Dior]] announced plans to move their stores from [[Bal Harbour Shops]] to the Design District in late 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name="hermes"&gt;{{cite news |title = Hermes moving to Miami Design District|url = http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/10/06/2442328/hermes-moving-to-miami-design.html|author = Walker, Elaine|newspaper = The Miami Herald|date = October 7, 2011|accessdate = October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design Within Reach opened an 11,000-square foot design store in the district on Feb 1st, 2013.
&lt;ref name="Miami Curbed"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miami.curbed.com/archives/2012/12/17/design-within-reach-in-the-design-district.php|title=Design District Drama|last=McCaughan|first=Sean|date=2012-12-17|website=Miami.Curbed.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three-story, 13,000-square-foot [[Hermès]] store opened in November 2015 and is only the third U.S. flagship after [[Madison Avenue]] in [[New York City]] and [[Rodeo Drive]] in [[Beverly Hills]], CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article43208754.html|title=Hermès opens flagship store in Design District; other new tenants announced|last=Nehamas|first=Nicholas|date=2015-11-05|website=miamiherald|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museo de la Estampa''' (Museum of Graphic Arts) is a museum in [[Mexico City]], dedicated to the history, preservation and promotion of Mexican graphic arts. The word “estampa” means “engraving” or “printing” refers to works which have the quality of being reproducible and include seals, [[woodcuts]], [[lithography]] and others.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://travel.latimes.com/destinations/mexico/mexico-city/attractions/museo-nacional-de-la-estampa/review |title= Museo Nacional de la Estampa |publisher=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=March 4, 2010 | first=- | last=Frommer's}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bellasartes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellasartes.gob.mx/INBA/Template12/index.jsp?secc_cve=180 |title=Presentación |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006202327/http://www.bellasartes.gob.mx/INBA/Template12/index.jsp?secc_cve=180 |archivedate=October 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was created in 1986 and located in a 19th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical building]] located in the [[Santa Veracruz Church, Mexico City|Plaza de Santa Veracruz]] in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]] of the city. This building was remodeled both to house the museum and to conserve its original look.&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/2998-Museo-Nacional-de-la-Estampa-(D.F.) |title= Museo Nacional de la Estampa (D.F.)  |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|Image of "La Catrina".]]
The building houses both a permanent and multiple temporary exhibits. The permanent collection includes pre-Hispanic clay seals used for printing designs on fabrics, ceramics and other surfaces, printed material from the colonial period and more recent creations.  More recent works are divided into periods such as the “age of the [[San Carlos Academy]]” (18th -19th century) and the “resurgence of the graphics arts” which covered the decades from the 1920s to the 1960s. The best-known works here are those of [[José Guadalupe Posada]], the creator of “[[La Catrina]]” and numerous satirical comics. It also includes video programs on graphic techniques such as wood cuts, etchings and more.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

The museum works in collaboration with [[Museo Nacional de Arte]], which holds Mexico’s largest collection of graphic arts including those done by Mexican artists José Guadalupe Posada, [[José Clemente Orozco]] and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], as well as foreign artists such as [[Mario Benedetti]] and [[Ilya Kabakov]].&lt;ref name="bellasartes"/&gt; This collection is called the National Collection of Graphic Works (Colección Nacional de Estampas).&lt;ref name="conaculta"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=04012010154159 |title=) El Museo Nacional de la Estampa resguarda el acervo más amplio de estampa en México |author=[[CONACULTA]] |publisher=Artes e Historia |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Museo Nacional de la Estampa exhibits the largest collection of graphic arts in Mexico |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the museum’s space is dedicated to temporary exhibits such as the 2003 exhibit of works from the Centro de Formación y Producción Gráfica del Antiguo Colegio Jesuita located in [[Pátzcuaro]], [[Michoacán]]. This show had works from fifty artists including [[Francisco Castro Leñero]], [[Mario Rangel Faz]], [[Roberto Turnbull]] and [[Mónica Sotos]].&lt;ref name="arteshis"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artesvisuales.com.mx/museos/temporales/museo.php?TMP_CONSECUTIVO=2372 |title= Museo Nacional de la Estampa |publisher=Artes Visuales |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temporary exhibits are part of the museum’s mission to preserve and promote the printed arts in Mexico. Temporary exhibits include works by both national and international artists from diverse periods from the 16th to the 21st century.&lt;ref name="bellasartes"/&gt; The museum hosted ten temporary exhibitions in 2009 and registered 34,578 visitors. These expositions include the collection of [[Alejandro Alvarado]] and an exposition called “Tauromaquia, Mano a Mano” ([[Bullfighting]], hand to hand). The latter exhibition featured works from [[Francisco de Goya y Lucientes]], [[Salvador Dalí]], one work by [[Pablo Picasso]] and filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]].&lt;ref name="conaculta"/&gt;

The museum also supports activities related to research, but most of the space is designed to accommodate the highest number of visitors possible.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt;

'''''Night Train''''' (''Le train de nuit'') is a 1947 painting by Belgian artist [[Paul Delvaux]], famous for his paintings of female nudes. The painting is 153 x 210 centimetres and is currently housed in the [[Museum of Modern Art, Toyama]].&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/drawings-watercolors/paul-delvaux-le-train-de-nuit-5289427-details.aspx#top&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pref.toyama.jp/branches/3042/e_page/e_information.htm The Museum of Modern Art] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102155852/http://www.pref.toyama.jp/branches/3042/e_page/e_information.htm |date=2013-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trapped in a loveless marriage, Delvaux wished "to paint boredom, sadness and the desire to get away from it all... There is this nostalgic aspect about waiting rooms where people pass by briefly before leaving... I tried to capture the beauty of the waiting room in an empty station. People are not necessary, for a station has its own life".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''La Lanterne'', 29 January, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Christie's]], this work is "a powerful poetic expression of the overwhelming sense of paralysis and imprisonment Delvaux was experiencing at the time":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Depicting the stillness and ennui of a station waiting room infused with the languid erotic mystery of a sleeping nude and a lone train pulling into a station, the picture's main subject seems to be the articulation of a terrifying emptiness. The moonlit station clock and the empty gaze of the upright receptionist sitting to attention at her desk, echoed by her reflection in the mirror, seem to emphasize the frozen nature of time and space extending into infinity, while the nude lies bored and restless underneath a bleak sign advertising the endless cycle of arrivals and departures.&lt;ref name="christies"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Oslo City Art Award''' (''Oslo bys kunstnerpris'') is given annually for contributions to the arts by the city of [[Oslo, Norway]].

The Oslo City Art Award has been awarded every year since 1978 with the exception of 1991 when the prize was not awarded due to a lack of funding. Since inception, the prize has been distributed to 4-5 recipients annually. The prize is "awarded to individuals who in the past or in recent years has made an outstanding achievement in Oslo's art world".  The prize consists of a diploma and a monetary amount. The award is most often made simultaneously with the presentation of the [[Oslo City Culture Award]], which consists of a bronze medal and a monetary amount.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oslo.kommune.no/kultur-og-utdanningskomiteen/oslo-bys-kulturpris-og-kunstnerpriser-article17620-4233.html ''Oslo bys kulturpris og kunstnerpriser'' (Oslo commune)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Looking west across Porthmeor beach towards Tate St Ives - geograph.org.uk - 1549481.jpg|thumb|Fishing lofts on Porthmeor Beach]]
The '''Penwith Society of Arts''' is an art group formed in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], [[Cornwall]], England, UK, in early 1949 by [[abstract art]]ists who broke away from the more conservative [[St Ives School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/p/penwith-society-of-arts |title=Penwith Society of Arts &amp;#124; Tate |first= |last= |work=tate.org.uk |year=2014  |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally led by [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]], and included members of the [[Crypt Group]] of the St Ives Society, including [[Peter Lanyon]] and [[Sven Berlin]].  Other early members included: [[Leonard Fuller (artist)|Leonard Fuller]], [[Isobel Heath]], [[Alexander Mackenzie (artist)|Alexander Mackenzie]], [[John Wells (artist)|John Wells]], [[Bryan Wynter]], [[Wilhelmina Barns-Graham]], [[David Haughton]], [[Denis Mitchell (sculptor)|Denis Mitchell]], and the printer [[Latin Press|Guido Morris]].  [[Herbert Read]] was invited to be the first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cornwallartists.org/cornwall-artists/herbert-read |title=Herbert READ &amp;#124; cornwall artists index |first= |last=|work=cornwallartists.org |year=2014 |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The group bought fishing lofts along Porthmeor beach to use as artists' studios, after an acrimonious split from the established St Ives Society of Artists.  Then on 8 February 1949, after a town meeting at the Castle Inn, a dissident group set up shop in Fore street, St Ives.  In 1960 and old pilchard factory was taken over with converted studios above.  After ten years of sincere guidance and deep interest, funds raised by Barbara Hepworth, with the aim of converting adjacent buildings into studios for craft and sculpture as well as painting expanded the project still further at Back Road, St Ives.  In 1967 [[Kathleen Watkins]] was appointed curator and secretary (1967-2013) of the society advising, among other things, clients on potential purchases.

'''''Portrait of Abraham Casteleyn and his Wife, Margaretha van Bancken''''' (1663) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Jan de Bray]]; it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].

This painting by De Bray was acquired in 1939 from the Frans Ernst Blaauw bequest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-3280 SK-A-3280] in the [[Rijksmuseum]]&lt;/ref&gt; It had been in the family since 1834 and because of the globe on the left it was assumed to be a double portrait of [[Joan Blaeu]] (1596-1673) and his wife Geertruid Vermeulen (died 1676).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_boe022198401_01/_boe022198401_01_0055.php Het portret van Abraham Casteleyn en zijn vrouw] by Rudi Ekkart in the [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature|DBNL]]&lt;/ref&gt; The next year it was determined the couple was clearly too old at the time to be the youthful newlyweds portrayed in the painting, and it was speculated that they were therefore the son of Blaeu, Willem Blaeu II (1635-1685) and his wife Anna van Loon (1638-1680), though their ages didn't match either. Since the bust of [[Laurens Janszoon Coster]] features quite prominently above their portraits and De Bray himself was a Haarlem painter whose brother [[Dirck de Bray|Dirck]] made engravings for the Casteleyn printing firm until he left town in 1678, it was finally correctly catalogued upon the discovery of a drawn self-portrait by Casteleyn in the North Holland Archives. The couple Abraham Casteleyn and [[Margaretha van Bancken]] owned the house known as "In de Blije Druck" where they printed publications for the city hall and the first Haarlem newspaper on the [[Grote Markt, Haarlem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">In the fields of [[bibliography]] and [[bookselling]], '''prize books''' (also known as '''prize bindings'''), are a category of finely bound books once given as prizes and awards in educational institutions primarily in [[England]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=John |date= September 1989|title=Reviewed Work: Gold-Tooled Bookbindings Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin in the Eighteenth Century. (Studies in the History of Irish Bookbinding: 1) by Joseph McDonnell and Patrick Healy |url= |journal= The Burlington Magazine  |volume=131  |issue=1038  |pages=656–657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition flourished in Latin schools in continental [[Europe]] from the mid-17th century until the introduction of publishers bindings after about 1830. Books continued to be given as prizes at academic ceremonies, but the only distinguishing feature are typically special inscriptions and/or [[bookplates]].

==History in UK==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the tradition of special prize bindings persisted until the mid-20th century with the demise of traditional hand binding. Most titles consist of classical works in the [[humanities]] published in unbound print runs for this purpose. Schools would contract with a local [[bindery]] to prepare prize editions stamped or [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with the logo of the school. The editions are often made to resemble the fine bindings of the 18th century and are prized by booksellers for their classical appearance. They are often mistaken as ex-school library books but can be distinguished by a prize inscription, lack of [[call number]], and general higher quality of the binding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4541">[[File:Gammel Dok - DAC.jpg|thumb|Danish Architecture Centre in Copenhagen, a project co-developed by Realdania]]

'''Realdania''' is a private association in [[Denmark]] which supports projects in architecture and planning. It was established in 2000 following the sale of [[Realkredit Danmark]] to [[Danske Bank]], when a fund of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;billion kroner (EUR 2.7 billion) was put aside for "philanthropic" purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS208747+22-Aug-2011+BW20110822 "Greylock Capital Receives Investment from Realdania"] (press release), ''Reuters'', 22 August 2011. Accessed 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Realkredit Danmark was owned and controlled by its members (mortgage lenders), and this set-up was kept in Realdania.
 
==Structure==
Realdania is often erroneously called a [[Foundation (non-profit)|private charitable foundation]], but Realdania's legal structure is that of an association operating as a business and not a foundation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Only owners of real estate in Denmark can become members of Realdania and participate in electing members of the board. Realdania has several subsidiaries. Realdania's closed structure has provoked criticism, and the association's funds has been called "stray billions" since they are controlled by a small network of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business.dk/finans/herreloese-milliarder-skal-toejles Jens Chr. Hansen: "Herreløse milliarder skal tøjles"], ''Berlingske.dk'', 25 March 2009 (in Danish).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/kultur/arkitektur/ECE1018820/hvem-holder-oeje-med-realdanias-milliarder/ Jens Lenler &amp; Torben Benner: "Hvem holder øje med Realdanias milliarder?"], ''Politiken.dk'', 17 July 2010 (in Danish).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stated purposes==
Its activity is concentrated on supporting projects in [[architecture]] and the built environment and is focused on three areas: cities, buildings and architectural heritage. The statutes of Realdania state that the association's purpose is to:
# Support non-profit and charitable purposes, primarily in the field of the built environment, and primarily in Denmark,
# Run an investment company,
# Acquire shares in companies that are engaged in activities pertaining to the built environment,
# Provide services related to the built environment, and
# Acquire and construct real property in order to preserve the built heritage and develop Danish building practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realdania.dk/Om-Realdania/~/media/20E9BC8DAD3A49D8B5F07AC37994D41F.ashx Realdania's Statues (in Danish, PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be seen that investment activities predominate other ones, so that the avowed "philanthropic" or "charitable" nature of Realdania does not particularly stand out. At the end of 2011 Realdania's endowment stood at EUR 2.1 billion.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=31 August 2012|url=http://www.realdania.dk/english.aspx|title=Overview|publisher=Realdania|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904041536/http://www.realdania.dk/English.aspx|archivedate=4 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Projects supported by Realdania include ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum in [[Aarhus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aros.dk/?setlanguage=2 ARoS]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Brewery Site in Copenhagen, commissioned from Dutch architect [[Rem Koolhaas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-life/copenhagen-x-gallery/ongoing-or-future-projects/the-brewery-site-project/?cphxredirect=true Brewery Site]&lt;/ref&gt; This last real estate development, the so-called "Blox" building including the [[Danish Architecture Centre]], was inaugurated in 2018. Designed on the assumption that "the city has become too calm and beautified," it has been criticized as a "gloomy glass monolith."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/may/01/blox-danish-architecture-centre-copenhagen&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ringbang''' is variously a [[Caribbean]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[music genre]]s, a philosophy, and an [[aesthetic]]&lt;ref name="rollins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |title=Eddy Grant Talks About Ringbang |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811025314/http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang2.html |archivedate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; propounded by [[Eddy Grant]] in 1994.

In an interview circa 2000, Grant defined ringbang like this:
{{cquote|Ringbang is the thing that makes the soul quiet. That in a musical concept is [[rhythm]]. A child is given ringbang when a mother rocks it in her arms. Ringbang allowed the slaves to communicate. Ringbang is a bridge that allows us to stop being insular; it is a concept predicated on our being able to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;|1.5em|1.5em}}

In applying ringbang to music, Grant attempted to define a meta-style to encompass all Caribbean rhythms; it was to be a musical [[lingua franca]]. He wished this multicultural style to place no restrictions on [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and he said that he wanted no single country or culture to lay claim to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icerecords.com/ringbang.html |title=Welcome to ringbang! |last=Grant |first=Eddy |authorlink=Eddy Grant |date= |work=Ringbang |publisher=[[Ice Records]] |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among ringbang's stylistic influences are [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]], [[soca music|soca]], [[tuk band|tuk]], and [[zouk]].

Grant says that the word ''ringbang'' comes from vocalists [[scat singing]] "Ringa-ringa-ringbang!". He chose the word one day in 1993, while standing in recording engineer Frank Agarrat's backyard in [[Trinidad]].&lt;ref name="rollins" /&gt;

==Ringbang music==
In an attempt to popularize ringbang music and its underlying philosophy, Grant asked various recording artists to apply the word (which he [[trademark]]ed)&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|76245553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US trademark|77388819}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some of their songs. [[Barbadian people|Barbadian]] recording artists [[Grynner]], [[Square One (band)|Square One]], Viking Tundah, and others recorded ringbang tracks for Grant's [[record label]]s, [[Ice Records]] and Blue Wave Records. Among the ringbang albums on these labels were ''Fire in de Wave'' (1994), ''Ringbang Rebel Dance'' (1995), ''Ringbang Souljah'' (1996), and ''Ringbang Revolution'' (1997).

On [[New Year's Eve]] 1999, Grant hosted a concert on [[Tobago]] called Ringbang Celebration 2000, at which he performed with the Frontline Orchestra. The event drew approximately 11,000 people, and featured performances from artists from [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].&lt;ref name="rollins2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeeburgnieuws.nl/kofi/kofi-ringbang.html |title=Kofi Ayivor Goes to Celebrate the New Millenium [sic] |last=Rollins |first=Scott |date= |website=zeeburgnieuws.nl |publisher= |accessdate=23 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso legend [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]]'s brief appearance at the event was his final time onstage, as he died the following February.

In March 2003, Ice Records published ''Ringbang 4 Kids'', a selection of songs intended for children of [[primary school]] age. The songs were performed by Barbadian singer Indra Rudder, who had previously sung backing vocals for several Ice Records tracks.

'''Robert McKee''' (born 1941) is an [[author]], [[lecturer]] and [[story consultant]] who is widely known for his popular "Story [[Seminar]]", which he developed when he was a professor at the [[University of Southern California]]. McKee is the author of ''Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting'', ''Dialogue: the Art of Verbal Action for Stage, Page and Screen'' and ''Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World''. McKee also has the blog and online writers' resource "[https://www.storylogue.com/ Storylogue]".

Robert McKee’s “Story Seminars” have been held around the globe including [[Boston]], [[Moscow]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Beijing]], [[Mumbai]], [[Paris]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and yearly in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[London]]. The 3-day seminar teaches writers the principles of [[storytelling]]. McKee's one-day "[[Genre]] Seminars" teach writers the conventions of different styles of storytelling including [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[Comedy film|comedy]], [[horror film|horror]], [[Romance film|love story]], [[Action (fiction)|action story]], and writing for [[Television program|television]].

Rather than teaching story as a "mechanical" form, McKee gained notoriety for teaching story principles, allowing writers for [[Theatre|theater]], [[Novel|novels]], [[film]] and [[television]] freedom to apply them as they wish provided the story ultimately “works”.

After consulting on business storytelling for various multinational companies including [[Microsoft]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Time Warner]], and [[Siemens]], in the fall of 2013 McKee launched a seminar for the business community in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[Beijing]], and [[Malta]]. In 2018, McKee partnered with digital marketer and Skyword CEO [[Tom Gerace]] to write ''Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World.'' Storynomics, and the accompanying seminar, instructs leaders, managers and marketers how to use story in [[strategic management]], [[brand management]], and [[Business communication|business communications]].

== Early life in the theater ==
Robert McKee began his theater career at the age of 9, playing the title role in a community theater production of 'Martin the Shoemaker'. He continued acting as a teenager in theater productions in his hometown of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Upon receiving the Evans scholarship, he attended the [[University of Michigan]] and earned a Bachelor's degree in [[English Literature]]. While an undergraduate, he acted in and directed over thirty productions. McKee's creative writing professor was the noted [[Kenneth Thorpe Rowe]].

After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, McKee toured with the APA (Association of Producing Artists) Repertory Company, appearing on Broadway alongside [[Helen Hayes]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[Will Geer]]. He then received the Professional Theater Fellowship and returned to [[Ann Arbor|Ann Arbor, Michigan]] to earn his Master's degree in [[Theater|Theater Arts]].

Upon graduating, McKee directed the Toledo Repertory Company, acted with the American Drama Festival, and became Artistic Director of the Aaron Deroy Theater. From there he traveled to London to accept the position of [[Artist-in-residence]] at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] where he studied Shakespearean production at the [[Old Vic]] theatre. He then returned to New York City and spent the next seven years as an actor/director in [[Broadway theater|Broadway]].

== Mid-life in the film industry ==
After deciding to move his career to film, McKee attended Cinema School at the University of Michigan. While there, he directed two short films: ''A Day Off'', which he also wrote, and ''Talk To Me Like The Rain'', adapted from a one-act play by [[Tennessee Williams]]. These two films won the Cine Eagle Award, awards at the Brussels and Grenoble Film Festivals, and various prizes at the Delta, Rochester, Chicago and Baltimore Film Festivals.

In 1979, McKee moved to Los Angeles, where he began to write screenplays and work as a story analyst for [[United Artists]] and [[NBC]]. He sold his first screenplay ''Dead Files'' to AVCO/Embassy Films, after which he joined the WGA ([http://www.wga.org/ Writers Guild of America]). His next screenplay, ''Hard Knocks'', won the National Screenwriting Contest, and since then McKee has had eight feature film screenplays purchased or optioned, including the feature film script ''Trophy'' for [[Warner Bros.]] (Only one of these films, however, was produced). In addition to his screenplays, McKee has had a number of scripts produced for television series such as ''[[Quincy, M.E.]]'' (starring [[Jack Klugman]]), ''[[Columbo#Mrs. Columbo spin-off|Mrs. Columbo]]'' (starring [[Kate Mulgrew]]), ''[[Spenser: for Hire]]'' and ''[[Kojak]]'' (starring [[Telly Savalas]]).

== Starting the STORY seminar ==
In 1983, as [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Scholar]], McKee joined the faculty of the [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinema-Television]] at the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern California (USC)]], where he began offering his famous STORY Seminar class. A year later, McKee opened the course to the public, giving a 3-day, 30-hour intensive class to sold-out audiences around the world.

Since 1984, more than 50,000 students have taken McKee's course, at various cities around the world: Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto, Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Tel Aviv, Auckland, Singapore, Barcelona, Stockholm, São Paulo and more. In March 2011 and again in 2012, he taught a four-day seminar in Bogotá, Colombia. In February 2012 he taught another four-day seminar in the Ramoji film city of Hyderabad in India. He did the same in [[Amsterdam]], March 2014.

McKee's current lecture series includes the 3-day "Story Seminar", 1-day "Genre Seminars" (teaching the conventions of [[Romance film|love Story]], [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[comedy]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Action fiction|action]] and writing for [[television]]) and the 1-day “Storynomics Seminar”, teaching the application of storytelling principles in the business and marketing world (co-lectured with CEO of Skyword [[Tom Gerace]]).

McKee continues to be a project consultant to major film and television production companies, corporations and governments around the world, as well major software firms such as [[Microsoft]]. In addition, several companies such as [[ABC Studios|ABC]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Miramax]], [[PBS]], [[Nickelodeon]] and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] regularly send their creative and writing staffs to his lectures. 

== Life and awards ==
Robert McKee is among the most widely known screenwriting [[lecturers]]. McKee's former students include over 65 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winners, 200 [[Emmy Award]] winners, 100 WGA ([[Writers Guild of America]]) Award winners and 50 DGA ([[Directors Guild of America]]) Award winners (all participated in McKee's course before or after winning their award; not all were awarded for writing), the British Book of the Year Award and the [[Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing]]. Some recent notable former students to win or be nominated for Oscars include [[Akiva Goldsman]] for his screenplay "[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]," [[Peter Jackson]] (writer/director of "[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]] I, II and III”), [[Andrew Stanton]] (“[[WALL-E|Wall*E]],” “[[Finding Nemo]]”) and [[Paul Haggis]] (“[[Million Dollar Baby]],” “[[Quantum of Solace]]”). 

He was profiled by Bob Simon of ''60 Minutes'' for [[CBS News]], and by [[CNN]] who also reviewed the Story Seminar. Notable writers and actors such as [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Paul Haggis]], [[Akiva Goldsman]], [[William Goldman]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Bowie]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[John Cleese]], Tony Kaye, [[Steven Pressfield]], among many others have taken his seminar.&lt;ref name="MT" /&gt;

In 1990, Robert McKee was brought to [[New Zealand]] by the NZ Film Commission, and delivered a three-day seminar on screenplay and story structure in [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]]. In the audience were [[Jane Campion]] and [[Peter Jackson]], the latter of which went on to write and direct ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]''.

In 2000, McKee won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20061207213752/http://www.editor.net/k-k/old/prize99.htm 1999 International Moving Image Book Award] for his book ''Story'' ([[ReganBooks|Regan Books]]/[[HarperCollins]]). The book, currently in its 19th printing in the United States and its 14th printing in the [[UK|United Kingdom]], has become required reading for film and cinema schools at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[UCLA]], [[University of Southern California|USC]] and [[Tulane University|Tulane]] universities.[[Robert McKee#cite note-autogenerated1-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[Robert McKee#cite note-3|&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The book was on the [[Los Angeles Times]] best-seller list for 20 weeks. It is translated into over 20 languages.

In 2017 McKee was inducted into the [https://www.finaldraft.com/company/hall-fame-awards/ Hall of Fame at the Final Draft Awards], an honor that recognizes professionals who have had a "profound influence on the industry"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.finaldraft.com/company/hall-fame-awards/|title=Hall of Fame Awards {{!}} Final Draft®|work=Final Draft®|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining peers such as [[Lawrence Kasdan]] and [[Steven Zaillian]].

McKee's other credits include writing and presenting the [[BBC]] series ''Filmworks'', the [[Channel Four]] series ''Reel Secrets'', the [[BAFTA]] Award-winning ''J'accuse Citizen Kane'' television program which he wrote and presented, and the writing of [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109036 ''Abraham''], the four-hour mini-series on [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) that starred [[Richard Harris]], [[Barbara Hershey]] and [[Maximilian Schell]].

==Criticism==
McKee has been criticized by writer [[Joe Eszterhas]], for teaching screenwriting without ever having a script of his made into a film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/books/review/Queenan.t.html 'Basic Instinct'] — New York Times article by Joe Queenan, September 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/arts/filmprogramme/filmprogramme_20070209.shtml |title=— Film programme interview, 9 February 2007' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=December 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, McKee is credited as writer of the 1994 TV movie ''Abraham''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|571210}}&lt;/ref&gt;) McKee has responded to such criticisms, saying, "The world is full of people who teach things they themselves cannot do", while admitting that even though he sold all of his written screenplays, he still lacks their screen credit since they were only optioned and not ever produced by the studios.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~newsinfo/MT/95/Jun95/mt21j95.html Michigan Today – June 1995] — interview with Brett Forrest&lt;/ref&gt;

While McKee's work might appear to be a fresh approach to story structure, many of the ideas he discusses have been around since [[Aristotle]] and notably appear in the work of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]],&lt;ref name="Archer1912"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Archer|title=Play-making: A Manual of Craftsmanship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5Xs_AAAAYAAJ|accessdate=March 31, 2013|year=1912|publisher=Small, Maynard}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Howard Lawson]] and [[Alexander Mackendrick]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Nevertheless, McKee himself tells his students that Aristotle is the basis for much of what he teaches and he often distributes some of John Howard Lawson's writings at his seminar: he acknowledges his forebears and never claims that he is inventing a brand new approach to story telling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleid=305 | title = Robert McKee – Lessons of a screenwriting guru | author = Ian Parker | date = January 27, 2004 | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130206102146/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleid=305 | archivedate = February 6, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore he claims that much of what he teaches was common knowledge 50 or 60 years ago, but that screenwriters have lost touch with the fundamentals of storytelling. In a CBC interview he said that to give his lecture in the 1930s, 40s or 50s "would have been ludicrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc5QRxZidNQ | title = Robert McKee on The Hour with George Stroumboulopoulos | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | date = July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee also appears and is criticized in several works, for example, ''Missionnaire'' by French author [[Joann Sfar]].

==In popular culture==
In the [[Charlie Kaufman]]-penned film ''[[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation.]]'', McKee's character was portrayed by the [[Emmy Award]]-winning actor [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]. In the Oscar-winning movie, the desperate screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (played by [[Nicolas Cage]]) reluctantly goes to McKee's course, but then – after being "shaken" by McKee's tough-style response to his claim that "nothing happens in the real world" – Kaufman asks McKee to meet in person to discuss his failure to write the [[film adaptation]] he is working on.

Though the story depicts McKee as little more than an amalgam of hack clichés on the subject of screen writing, Charlie's slacker brother Donald uses the knowledge obtained attending the famous seminar to write a [[spec script]] he then sells for a large amount of money through his brother's agent. The film then concludes with the very ending that McKee is ridiculed for recommending, as well as a voice-over epilogue in which — by means of voice-over narration — Cage's Kaufman character admonishes himself for disobeying a cardinal rule of McKee's to avoid voice-over narration.

McKee appeared on the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Caper Chase]]" as himself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/yale-harvard-war-bogs-down-overstuffed-simpsons-253107&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anecdotes ==
* McKee claims in his seminars that he does ''not'' say not to use voice-over narration. There is some truth to the scene in ''Adaptation'' however, as he vehemently teaches that using voice-over to substitute for telling the story via action and dialogue is weak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.storylogue.com/docs/question-answer.html?documentId=1345 | title = Q&amp;A: What did you think of the voice-over in GOODFELLAS? | author = Robert McKee | date = August 10, 2013 | accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas he teaches that voice-over used to counterpoint and enrich the story can be wonderful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://peachseedmonkey.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/mckeevoiceovertechnique.pdf | title = A Study in Voice Over Narration from two recent films, SAVAGES and BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD. | author = Robert McKee | date = August 13, 2012 | accessdate=September 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* McKee is known to object to the French-originated "[[auteur theory]]", which states that the director is the de facto author of a movie.  McKee states otherwise, that the writer/screenwriter is in fact the most important creator of the movie.
* In a ''[[Haaretz]]'' article,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/782893.html | title = וודי אלן לא עשה עלייה (in Hebrew, rough translation "Woody Allen did increase") | date = November 2, 2006 | accessdate = March 31, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110605041310/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/spages/782893.html | archivedate = June 5, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; McKee was quoted as saying in front of a Tel Aviv audience that Israelis have a rough sense of humor, completely different from the known worldwide Jewish one, since Israelis are living in a harsh reality which leads them to lose their sense of humor.

The '''Royal Canadian Academy of Arts''' ('''RCA''') is a Canadian [[art]]s-related organization that was founded in 1880.

==History==
===1880 to 1890===
The title of Royal Canadian Academy of Arts was received from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on 16 July 1880. The [[Governor General of Canada]], the [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|Marquess of Lorne]], was its first patron. The painter [[Lucius Richard O'Brien|Lucius O’Brien]] was its first President.

The objects of the Academy as stated in the 1881 publication of the organization's constitution&lt;ref name=RCA_Act1881&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitution and Laws of the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts|year=1881|publisher=Globe Printing Co., Printer|location=Toronto|page=1|url=http://ebooks.library.ualberta.ca/local/cihm_12893}}&lt;/ref&gt; were three-fold:
*First - the institution of a National Gallery at the seat of Government;
*Second - the holding of Exhibitions in the principal cities of the Dominion;
*Third - the establishment of Schools of Art and Design.

In the same publication, two levels of membership were described: Academicians and Associates. No more than forty individuals could be Academicians at one time, while the number of Associates was not limited. All Academicians were required to give an example of their work to the collection of the [[National Gallery of Canada|National Gallery]]. They were also permitted to show more pieces in Academy-sponsored exhibitions than Associates.&lt;ref name=RCA_Act1881 /&gt;

The inaugural exhibition was held in Ottawa and the first Academicians were inducted, including the first woman Academician, [[Charlotte Schreiber]]. Through the next 10 years, the Academy held annual exhibitions, often in cooperation with regional artists' societies. Exhibitions in Toronto were a joint project of the Academy and the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], while those held in Montreal were held in partnership with the [[Montreal Artists Association]]. Exhibitions were also held in St. John, [[New Brunswick]], and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref name=RCA_Report1886&gt;{{cite book|title=Report and review of financial position and prospective policy of the Academy to His Excellency the Most Hon. the Marquis of Lansdowne, Governor-General, Patron of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1886|year=1886|publisher=Royal Canadian Academy of Arts|location=Ottawa|url=http://ebooks.library.ualberta.ca/local/cihm_45606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional academicians and associates were added each year until the membership had more than doubled by 1890. Members were drawn from all areas of the country and included anglophones and francophones. Men continued to out-number women and those female members were identified as painters not as designers or architects.&lt;ref name=RCA_Founding /&gt;

As Academicians joined, they donated an example of their work to the National Gallery of Canada, building the collection of the as-yet unincorporated institution. A temporary home was found for the collection in a building next to the Supreme Court of Canada and the first curator, John W. H. Watts, RCA was appointed to begin organizing exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History: Pre 1900|url=http://www.gallery.ca/en/about/pre-1900.php|publisher=National Gallery of Canada|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third objective—to encourage the teaching of art and design in Canada—was found to be more challenging to address with the limited financial resources available to them.&lt;ref name=RCA_Report1886 /&gt;

===1891 to present===
Canadian landscape painter [[Homer Watson]] was elected as an associate, became a full member and later became president of the Academy.

The centennial year of the Academy was honoured by a 35 cent, 3 colour postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130116010109/http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2012-07-24T13:57:38Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=2218678&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/collectionscanada.gc.ca:pam&amp;lang=eng Credit: Library and Archives Canada; Copyright: Canada Post Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; The stamp features an image of the original centre block of the [[Parliament Buildings (Canada)|Parliament Buildings]] and the text "Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1880–1980", with the name "[[Thomas Fuller (architect)|Thomas Fuller]]", a member of the Academy and the Dominion Architect of Canada &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/pages/4_thomas-fuller.aspx Dominion Architect]&lt;/ref&gt; who had designed the original building.

==Members==
The Academy is composed of members from across Canada representing over twenty visual arts disciplines. This list is not inclusive. See also [[:Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]].

'''''The Coronation of Inês de Castro in 1361''''' is a c.1849 oil on canvas history painting by the French artist [[Pierre-Charles Comte]], first exhibited at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1849 (his second-ever work exhibited at a Salon) and now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]], which it entered in 1885.

Other painters of the time had also painted works on the life of [[Inês de Castro]] - count Auguste de Forbin in 1812 (he also exhibited an autograph copy at the 1819 Salon), [[Gillot Saint-Evre]] in 1827, [[Eugénie Servières]]'s ''Inês de Castro throwing herself and her children at the feet of Alfonso IV  of Portugal to free don Pedro, her husband'' (exhibited at the 1824 Salon) and ''Inês de Castro Before Her Murder'' (1839).

'''The Law of Conservation of Misery''' is a [[folk wisdom]] that states that the total amount of [[wikt:misery|misery]] in a system is constant.

This implies that when you try to decrease the misery in one aspect of a system, you will increase the misery in some of the other aspects. In other words, for each problem you solve, at least one new problem is created, or as many new problems that together equal the trouble caused by the original problem. This law has particular significance in the realm of fantasy football, where one person's misery appears to correlate inversely with another person's happiness.  &lt;ref&gt;Dealing with Dilemmas, [[Frank Buytendijk]], 2010, Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0470630310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hertzfeld|first=Andy|title=Revolution in the valley|year=2005|publisher=O'Reilly|location=Sebastapol, Calif.|isbn=0-596-00719-1|pages=88|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5798">'''Theater Breaking Through Barriers (TBTB)''', formerly '''[http://tbtb.org/ Theater By the Blind]''', is an [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive]] [[theater company]] in [[New York City]] that strives develop the talents of individuals with disabilities for work onstage, backstage, in the office and in the audience.&lt;ref name="TBTB-intro"/&gt;  It was founded in 1979 by Ike Schambelan(who died of cancer in 2015), with sighted actors recording plays for the blind.  The theater then moved to performances for the blind and then blind performances for the sighted.&lt;ref name="New York Day by Day: Explaining Blindness"/&gt; They recently began doing a short play festival each year.

==Crystal Clear==
''Crystal Clear'' by [[Phil Young (playwright)|Phil Young]] opened in 1986 at the [[Long Wharf Theater]]'s Stage II.  The show starred (George Ashiotis) who played a young actor who is gradually going blind from diabetes and his girlfriend who has been blind from birth (Lucia Puccia) .  ''Crystal Clear'' began as an improvisation on a [[London]] pub stage in 1982.

The production had mixed reviews from critics. Mel Gusso said for The New York Times, "It is diagnostic rather than psychologically probing."&lt;ref name="crystal"/&gt;  Another critic said the play was "a wildly unfocused work that tries to cover too vast a terrain" and that it contained "a cornucopia of cliches".&lt;ref name="sentimental"/&gt;

==A Midsummer Night's Dream==
''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] staged at the Barrow Group Theater in [[Manhattan]], was the first play by TBTB to feature a character in a wheelchair:
{{Quote|text=It holds Ann Marie Morelli, an actress playing Hermia, who at first has the attention of one too many men but later finds herself with the attention of one too few. Hermia, as created by Shakespeare, is short, and her rival in love, Helena (Erin O’Leary), is tall. Through the centuries poor Hermia has always taken a verbal beating for her physique, but here it has a different bite.

"Get you gone, you dwarf, you minimus," barks Lysander, who once doted on her. And Hermia herself laments, "My legs can keep no pace with my desires."
 |sign=Neil Genzlinger&lt;ref name="Actors Who See With More Than Their Eyes"/&gt; |source=New York Times
}}
A note in the theater program said, "Increasingly we feel we must include all disabled people [rather than blind people only] in our work."&lt;ref name="Actors Who See With More Than Their Eyes"/&gt; To reflect this shift in thought and philosophy, 2008 saw the company changing its name from Theater By The Blind to Theater Breaking Through Barriers.&lt;ref name="Theater by the Blind Changes Name"/&gt; Productions, such as Romeo &amp; Juliet, closely followed featuring an actor, Gregg Mozgala,  with Cerebral Palsy, their first in a subsequent line of productions incorporating actors with various disabilities.

A '''vernissage''' (from [[French language|French]], originally meaning “[[varnish]]ing”) is a term used for a preview of an [[art exhibition]], which may be private, before the formal [[Grand opening|opening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vernissage| title=Vernissage | publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] | work=Dictionary | year=2010 | accessdate=18 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the vernissage is not open to the public, but only for invited guests, it is often called a ''[[private view]]''.

At official exhibitions in the nineteenth century, such as the [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]], artists would give a finishing touch to their works by varnishing them. The custom of patrons and the élite of visiting the academies during the varnishing day prior to the formal opening of the exhibition gave rise to the tradition of celebrating the completion of an art work or a series of art works with friends and sponsors. In the twentieth century it became an opportunity to market the works on view to buyers and critics.

There is a comparable ceremonial ending of art exhibitions, called a ''finissage''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Invitation: Finissage in Venice|url=http://www.artelagunaprize.com/index.php/speed-news-premio/227-finissage-in-venice.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from the French word meaning "finishing". Larger art exhibitions may also have an event halfway through their residency called a ''midissage''. These latter terms are rare in English; they are more commonly used in [[German language|German]] but not in French.{{CN|date=August 2014}} 
The term ''finissage'' was first used in this context in 2003 by Walter Hilliger and Sabine Sallarsaïb for Geheimat Multinational Gallery in Berlin, Germany.

The '''Vick Foundation''' was established &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickfoundation.com/en/index.html Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2004 to award an annual prize for best [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[novel]]. There is also a competition for the most popular short-listed book, based on votes cast by the general public. In 2008, the award will celebrate its 5th anniversary, and the foundation is on the path to becoming an institution in Bulgaria.

==History==
Vick's initiative was acclaimed by those who saw in the prize a new opportunity for the Bulgarian literature after almost 15 years of standstill.

A permanent committee, which includes [[Stefan Danailov]], the current Minister of Culture of [[Bulgaria]], elects а jury. Other members in the committee are Raymond Wagenstein, Boyan Biolchev, Nedyalko Yordanov, Hristo Droumev and Ivan Granitski. The jury changes each year and they select a short list of six Bulgarian novels from which the winner is chosen. One of the member making up the 2008 jury is [[Meglena Kuneva]], the current European commissioner in [[Bulgaria]].

The aim of the foundation is also to enable others to gain access into Bulgarian literature, especially for the literary world beyond Bulgaria.

The award ceremony each year is well attended by members of Bulgarian society and journalist, as can be seen by the [http://www.vickfoundation.com/bg/gallery.html photo gallery on the website]. The event is covered by TV channels in Bulgaria and causes quite a media furor annually. [[KariZa]] and other well-known performers have graced the stages during the award ceremony and the ceremonies are known to be of much entertainment value.

The competition is organised with the support of [[Translation Company EVS]]
