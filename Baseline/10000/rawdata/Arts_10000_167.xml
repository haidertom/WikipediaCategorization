      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11606">'''4D BIM''', an acronym for 4D [[Building Information Modeling]] and a term widely used in the [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] industry, refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with time- or schedule-related information.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-01/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mills|first1=Fred|title=What is 4D BIM?|url=http://www.theb1m.com/video/what-is-4d-bim|website=www.TheB1M.com|publisher=The B1M Limited|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;The use of the term 4D is intended to refer to the fourth dimension: time, i.e. 4D is 3D plus schedule (time).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-02/&gt; 

The construction of the 4D models enables the various participants (from architects, designers, contractors to clients) of a construction project, to visualize the entire duration of a series of events and display the progress of construction activities through the lifetime of the project.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-03/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-05/&gt; This BIM-centric approach towards project management technique has a very high potential to improve the project management and delivery of construction project, of any size or complexity.

==History==
In 1998, Sir [[John Egan (industrialist)|John Egan]], in his report ''[[Egan Report|Rethinking Construction]]'',&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;Egan, J. (1998) ''Rethinking Construction: Report of the Construction Task Force'', London: HMSO. (Copy of report available on Constructing Excellence website: [http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/pdf/rethinking%20construction/rethinking_construction_report.pdf report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108223227/http://www.constructingexcellence.org.uk/pdf/rethinking%20construction/rethinking_construction_report.pdf |date=2011-11-08 }}. Accessed: 8 September 2014.)&lt;/ref&gt; argued that certain principles and management techniques could successfully cross-over from other industries like manufacturing to serve the project delivery demands of the construction industry. The Egan Report cited "Technology as a Tool":

:"One area in which we know new technology to be a very useful tool is in the design of buildings and their components, and in the exchange of design information throughout the construction team. There are enormous benefits to be gained, in terms of eliminating waste and rework for example, from using modern CAD technology to prototype buildings and by rapidly exchanging information on design changes. Redesign should take place on computer, not on the construction site."

4D BIM adds a new dimension (time) to 3D CAD or solid modelling, it enables a sequence of events to be depicted visually on a time line that has been populated by a 3D model (augmenting traditional Gantt charts and Critical Path (CPM) schedules often used in project management).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-16/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-17/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-19/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-20/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-21/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-22/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-23/&gt; Construction sequences can be reviewed as a series of problems using 4D BIM, enabling users to explore options, manage solutions and optimize results. It enables construction product development, collaborative and transparent project implementation, partnering with the supply chain and production of components, and is in keeping with Egan's vision: "sustained improvement should then be delivered through use of techniques for eliminating waste and increasing value for the customer."

As an advanced construction management technique, it is increasingly used by project delivery teams working on larger projects.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-07/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-08/&gt; For example, it is used in the construction of projects including tall buildings, bridges, highways, tunnels, university campuses and hospital complexes, luxury residential, residential and infrastructure such as courthouses, levee systems, hydro-electric power generation stations, mining and industrial process facilities. 4D BIM has traditionally been used for higher end projects due to the associated costs, but technologies are now emerging that allow the process to be used by laymen or to drive processes such as manufacture.&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-10/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-14/&gt;

[[File:Vincent van Gogh in Paris Agostina Segatori.webm|{{largethumb}}|[[Van Gogh Museum]]'s senior researcher Louis van Tilborgh talks about the lesser known aspects of this painting.]]
'''''Agostina Segatori Sitting in the Café du Tambourin''''' was painted by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1887.  [[Agostina Segatori]] owned the [[Café du Tambourin]] that Van Gogh knew intimately.  It was a gathering spot for Parisian artists, a place where their work was exhibited. Van Gogh, unable to pay in cash for his meals, exchanged paintings for his fare.  The paintings then adorned the restaurant.  He held a special exhibit of [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|his Japanese prints]] in the café as well.  His connection with Agostina and the cafe came to a sad end when she went bankrupt and van Gogh's paintings were confiscated by creditors.  This painting, however, demonstrates an artistic discovery that culminated in his unique, creative style not quite on the brink of being understood and revered.

==Van Gogh's influence in Paris==
In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands, never to return, for Paris and the guidance of his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]].  He entered Paris as a shy, somber man and while his personality would never change, he emerged artistically into what one critic described as a "singing bird". While van Gogh had been influenced by great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant that he was influenced by [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], [[Symbolists]], [[Pointillism|Pointillists]], and [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese prints]].  His circle of friends included [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]] and others.  The works of Japanese artists [[Hiroshige]] and [[Hokusai]] greatly influenced van Gogh, both for the beautiful subject matter and the style of flat patterns of colors without shadow.  Van Gogh explored the various influences and molded them into a style that was uniquely his own.  In the years 1886 to 1888, van Gogh emerged as a sophisticated, thoughtful and provoking artist. This painting demonstrates his journey of creativity in that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | pages=40, 69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==
In the painting Agostina, a woman in her forties, can be seen smoking a cigarette while having her second glass of beer, evidenced by two saucers under the mug of beer.  In demeanor and style, such as her clothing, make-up and hairstyle, she is a modern woman. She is wearing a fashionable hat.  According to the style at the time, her jacket is a different design than her dress.  A parasol sits on one of the seats next to her.

Van Gogh used the theme of a woman sitting at a small table, introduced by Impressionists, such as [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. The table and stools were in the shape of tambourines, befitting the café's theme. On the wall behind her are [[Japonaiserie (Van Gogh)|van Gogh's Japanese prints]], which he began exhibiting at the café in February 1887.&lt;ref name="VGM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3652&amp;collection=1288&amp;lang=en |title=In the café: Agostina Segatori in Le tambourin, 1887  |author= |date=2005–2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam |accessdate=March 18, 2011 | postscript=See the video on the page for more information about the painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galbally"/&gt;

[[File:Van Gogh - Portrait of Pere Tanguy 1887-8.JPG|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Père Tanguy]],'' 1887]]The brightly colored painting and confident subject represent a shift in Van Gogh's attitude in comparison to his earlier subjects, such as his dark and tragic peasants.  Even more, van Gogh's ''[[Portrait of Père Tanguy]]'' from the fall of the same year further explores his use of color and better promotes his Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The pursuit of spiritual wisdom: the thought and art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin | author=Maurer, N | publisher=Associated University Presses | location=Cranbury | year=1999 | origyear=1998 | page=55 | isbn=0-8386-3749-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf_PoXKhggkC&amp;pg=PA55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Café du Tambourin==
Van Gogh occasionally visited Café du Tambourin run by Agostina Segatori, the subject of this painting. Previously an artist's model&lt;ref name="VGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crispino"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh | author=Crispino, E | publisher=Oliver Press, Inc. | location=Minneapolis, MN | origyear=1996 | year=2008 | page=32 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5gPqjJ9Ws4C&amp;pg=PT18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and others,&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt; the Naples-born Agostina saved the money she earned working as a model and opened the Italian-themed Café du Tambourin in 1885, which particularly catered to artists.&lt;ref name="Galbally"&gt;{{cite book | title=A remarkable friendship: Vincent van Gogh and John Peter Russell | author=Galbally, A | publisher=Melbourne University Publishing | location=Australia | year=2008 | page=153 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXpgapo52p8C&amp;pg=PA153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The café on the [[Boulevard de Clichy]] in Paris was just around the corner from the home that Vincent lived in with his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]]. Besides convenience, the restaurant was notable to Van Gogh as a venue for exhibition of his paintings, a practice initiated by artists such as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Paul-Albert Besnard]] and others.&lt;ref name="Leaf"&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Table: At the Auberge Ravoux | first1=A | last1=Leaf | first2=F | last2=Lebain | publisher=Artisan | location=New York | year=2001 | pages=40, 44 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MBxJtWUz-CoC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;f=false | isbn=1-57965-182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 van Gogh had several meals a week at the café which were paid in paintings to adorn the restaurant's walls.  He fell in love with Agostina who was twelve years older. Soon after, though, Agostina and the establishment fell on hard times.  She became ill and the business, in debt and likely involved in illegal prostitution, failed.  Although assured by Agostina that van Gogh could claim his paintings, according to Émile Bernard's recollection, debtors sold them&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt; "as waste canvas"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Van Gogh (1853-1890) | author=Wallace, R | publisher=Time-Life Books | location=Alexandria, VA, USA | year=1969 | page=70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in batches of 10, ranging in price from 50 [[centimes]] to one [[French franc|franc]] per bundle.&lt;ref name="Leaf"/&gt; Due to the bankruptcy of the cafe van Gogh lost not only the paintings, mostly [[Still life paintings by Vincent van Gogh (Paris)|still life works]] of flowers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Van Gogh's Women: Vincent's Love Affairs and Journey Into Madness | author=Fell, D | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | location=New York | year=2004 | page=80 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqSjxGgvVMMC&amp;pg=PA80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Vincent van Gogh: A Biography   | author=Meier-Graefe, J | publisher=Dover Publications | location=Mineola, New York | year=1987 | page=60 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iw7R8k5GfgMC&amp;pg=PA60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andachtsbilder''' (singular '''Andachtsbild''', [[German language|German]] for '''devotional image''') is a German term often used in English in [[art history]] for [[Christianity|Christian]] devotional images designed as aids for [[prayer]] or [[contemplation]].  The images "generally show holy figures extracted from a narrative context to form a highly focused, and often very emotionally powerful, vignette".&lt;ref&gt;Ross, 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is especially used of Northern [[Gothic art]] around the 14th and 15th centuries, when new subjects such as the ''[[Pietà]]'', ''[[Pensive Christ]]'', ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'', ''[[Arma Christi]]'', ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', the severed head of [[John the Baptist]], and the ''[[Virgin of Sorrows]]'' became extremely popular.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder and, much more fully, Schiller cover these ''passim'', see their indexes. Schiller's translator always translates the German term to "devotional images" etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first devised for a group of mainly [[sculpture|sculptural]] subjects, including the ''Pietà'' and ''Pensive Christ'', that were thought to have emerged in [[convent]]s in south-western Germany in the 14th century, although their history is now believed to be more complicated.&lt;ref name="Hamburger, 3"&gt;Hamburger, 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In churches such images were often given a [[side-chapel]], and sometimes are given special places in the rituals of [[Holy Week]].  For example, [[Sacramental bread|consecrated hosts]] might be stored in the cavity of the [[Holy Wounds|spear wound]] in a sculpted ''Pietà'' between [[Good Friday]] and [[Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional subjects from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] such as the ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' and the ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'' were also treated in the same way.  Though the ''[[Crucifix]]'' had been treated as an intense, isolated image for centuries, at least as far back as the 10th century ''[[Gero Cross]]'' in [[Cologne]], many images showed a new emphasis on graphically depicted streaming blood, wounds and contorted poses.  This process started around 1300, so the influence appears to be from the ''Crucifixion'' to other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 146–148&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional ''Ecce Homo'' is a very crowded scene, in which the figure of Christ is often less prominent than those of his captors, but in the andachtsbilder versions the other figures and complex architectural background have vanished, leaving only Christ, with a plain background in most painted versions (see the example by [[Antonello da Messina]] in the gallery below).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 75–76.  There are other small types with just two or three figures - see the Mantegna in the gallery.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PietaKrivakova.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Early [[Bohemia]]n [[Pietà]] of 1390–1400]]
Andachtsbilder have a strong emphasis on the [[grief]] and suffering of Christ and the figures close to him.  Their use was encouraged by movements such as the [[Franciscan]]s, the [[Devotio Moderna]] and [[German mysticism]] in [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval Europe]], which promoted meditation on the sufferings of Christ by intense mental visualization ("imitation") of them and their physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, 179–180, 190–191, 197–198&lt;/ref&gt;  The most extreme, even gruesome, examples often came from the eastern edge of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and beyond in Poland, [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] and the [[Baltic states]], where large carved [[wikt:gobbet|gobbets]] of congealed blood can cover the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnw.art.pl/index.php/en/collections/pemanent_galleries/the_gallery_of_medieval_art/ Examples] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727210620/http://www.mnw.art.pl/index.php/en/collections/pemanent_galleries/the_gallery_of_medieval_art/ |date=July 27, 2011 }} from the [[National Museum, Warsaw]]&lt;/ref&gt;   But the style spread all over Europe, including Italy, although the extremes of emotionalism were avoided there until the [[Baroque]].

The term is often used specifically for small works intended for personal contemplation in the home.  By the 15th century the emerging urban [[middle class]]es of Northern Europe were increasingly able to afford small paintings or carvings.  The depiction was often very "close-up", with a half-length figure occupying nearly the whole picture space.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, pp. 154–161&lt;/ref&gt;   Andachtsbilder subjects were also very common in [[old master print|prints]].  However larger works for churches or outdoor display are also covered by the term.  By the mid-15th century andachtsbilder were influencing large monumental works, a process James Snyder discusses in relation to major works such as [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Deposition (Rogier van der Weyden)|Prado Deposition]]'', the ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'' of [[Matthias Grünewald]] and the carved ''Altarpiece of the Holy Blood'' by [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] at [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, pp. 128, 348-50, 306 respectively&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Mass of St Gregory]]'', which included a vision of the ''Man of Sorrows'', was a composition often used on [[altarpiece]]s which took a common andachtsbilder subject and expanded it into a subject suitable for more monumental works.

The art historian [[Jeffrey F. Hamburger]] observed that the term has now "lost whatever precision it could ever lay claim to, having been applied to virtually any object that might have been used to stimulate devotional experience".&lt;ref name="Hamburger, 3" /&gt;  Although works in the andachtsbilder tradition remained very popular in [[Art in Roman Catholicism|Catholic art]] for centuries, for example in [[Spanish Baroque art|Baroque Spain]] [[Italian Baroque|and Italy]], the term is less likely to be applied to much later images.  The English term "devotional image" or "picture" etc. can apply to a wide range of images, in all media, included modern commercially printed reproductions or [[prayer card]]s, especially those featuring a portrait-like image rather than a narrative scene.

'''Anegundi''' previously called  Kishkindha is a village in the [[Gangavathi|Gangavathi taluk]], [[Koppal district]] in the [[India]]n state of [[Karnataka]] , &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/22/stories/2006032201370200.htm The Hindu - Anegundi bracing itself to charm tourists]&lt;/ref&gt; It is older than [[Hampi]] situated on the northern bank of [[Tungabhadra River]], Huchappayana matha temple (with black-stone pillars and dance sculptures), [[Pampa Sarovar]], Aramane (a ruined palace), Ranganatha temple, Kamal Mahal, and [[Nava Brindavana]] are the major attractions Nimvapuram, a nearby village, has a mount of ash believed to be the cremated remains of monkey king Vaali.
Anegundi is best visited along with [[Hampi]], it is part of the '''[[world Heritage Site]], [[Hampi]]''', being developed into a world class tourism spot by engaging the locals to sensitise them to their cultural wealth and provide them a means of livelihood. Existing tanks in the village have been redesigned to store clean drinking water and proper drainage facilities developed to keep the surroundings clean and hygienic. The ''Kishkinda Trust'' is working on tourism development in Anegundi.

==Mythology==

[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Vali and Sugriva Fighting Folio from the Dispersed 'Shangri Ramayana'.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brooklyn Museum - ''Vali and Sugriva Fighting Folio'' from the Dispersed ''Shangri Ramayana'']]
Anegundi, believed to be the ''monkey kingdom'' of [[Kishkindha]] (''Kishkinta'' means in local language ''a forest where the monkeys lived'') in the epic of [[Ramayana]], is at a distance of 5&amp;nbsp;km from the historical site of Hampi. Anjanadri hill, the birthplace of monkey-god [[Hanuman]], and the mountain Rishimuka are the other places near Anegundi associated with Ramayana. It is said to have one of the oldest plateaus on the planet, estimated to be 3,000 million years old. So, only local story-tellers refer to Anegundi as the maternal home of Bhoodevi (Mother Earth).

The village, located on the northern side bank of River Tungabhadra, was said to be the legendary Kishkindha, a kingdom of the monkey Prince Sugriva and the cradle place of the historic Krishnadevaraya dynasty of the glorious Vijayanagar empire and falls in the core zone of Hampi.

==History==
{{main article|Vijayanagara Empire| Battle of Talikota}}
[[File:Pampa Sarover.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Pampa Sarovar]] at Anegundi]]

===Pre-historic===
Neolithic history is represented in this region by ''Mourya Mane'', a several-thousand-year-old ''Stone Age Colony''. Several Neolithic dwellings still bear paintings that are clear and intact even to this day at 'Onke Kindi'. This is the rare human settlement where we will find traces of Microlithic, Megalithic and Neolithic age of human life at one same spot. Anegundi area is older than the Vijayanagar empire, and as is old as the planet. As per geologists the Anegundi area is about four billion years old. Till date, this village is a living heritage site in its true sense. The nearest Pre-historic sites are [[Hirebenkal|HireBenekal]], Chikkarampur, Mallapur, Venkatapur and Anjanahalli.
''Pre-historic rock shelters and paintings'' are found in [[Tungabhadra river]] valley.

====Rock art====
At Anegundi there is prehistoric settlement called ''Onake Kindi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boulders with rock art, a rock with some red and white markings had figures of human and bull. on another boulder there is a circular diagram like sun and moon and with some symbolism. Actually the rock painting are belonged to ''Iron Age'', date back to ''1500 BC'' and the faded circular painting a very rare depiction of ''a megalithic style of burial'', also includes a human body in the middle  surrounded by a stone circle and burial goods. The site of ''megalithic dolmens'' located up in the hills locals call it as ''Mourya Mane'' (''morya'' means ''short'' in local language), about five to seven feet high sheet rocks forms four walls and another rock sheet used as roof (Neolithic period), it is about 10&amp;nbsp;km away from Anegundi, the Neolithic dwellings in the ''Elu gudda'' hill range, from Benegal to Indaragi gudda. About 1.5&amp;nbsp;km from Anegundi, there are rock shelters and paintings, paintings found in the hill ranges called locally as ''Elu gudda Salu''.

===Ancient kingdom===
Anegundi the ''ancient town'' [[Kishkindha]] of [[Ramayana]], a lively settlement has mahals and monuments (Gagan Mahal), there are forts and palaces, ruined temples, lush green padi fields.

====Ramayana connection====
[[Pampa Sarovar]] related to Shiva and Parvati featured in [[Ramayana]], Sabari a devotee of Rama met here, the legends of Ramayana including Hanuman, Sugriva all are pervading around Anegundi. The pilgrims consider ''Pampa Sarovara'' a holy place.

===Pre Vijayanagara period===
Aneguni in Kannada means ''Elephant Gorge'', it is older than [[Hampi]], in fact the ''mother kingdom'' (cradle city of Vijayanagara). Anegundi history dates back to 3rd BC century was under [[Ashoka]] Empire. 
Anegundi was ruled by various dynasties like [[Shatavahana]]s, [[Kadambas]], [[Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakutas]], [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Vijayanagara Empire]] and [[Bahamani]]s. Now this place is well-known tourism place.

===Vijayanagara period===
Early 14th century, ''elephant enclosure'' in Kannada known as ''Anegundi'', named because of elephant contingent of  [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first capital of [[Vijayanagar Empire]] and capital of several other dynasties. In 1334, Deva Raya the Chief Minister of Anegundi became ruler of Anegundi. When [[Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultans]] invaded [[Warangal]], ''Harihara and Bukka'' escaped and came to Anegundi, later founded the [[Vijayanagar Empire]] at [[Hampi]]. The Tallarighatta gate(Talwar Ghatta) (erstwhile toll gate) is the entrance to Anegundi from Hampi side, the collapsed modern day bridge under construction between Hampi and Anegundi across the [[Tungabhadra river]]. Crossing the river in a coracle (boat) which is circular basket shaped made of cane, bamboo and wrapped in a plastic sheet. "Coracle was used to ferry people in the Vijayanagar time also", it is mentioned by ''Dominoes Paes'' the Portuguese traveller in the 16th century, there is mention of carrying "about twenty persons and horses and oxen to cross the river."

During 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Anegundi was ruled by Bijapur Sultans, Moghuls, Marathas and Tipu Sultan. According to ''1824 treaty with the British and Hyderabad Nizam'', the king of Vijayanagar who was ruled from Hampi lost his kingdom, provided a monthly pension of Rs 300, forced to leave Hampi and make Anegundi as official residence, ''Rani Lalkumari Bai'' last descendant who received monthly pension.

===Anegundi Fort===
Anegundi has a Fort with many gates; there is a Durga temple and the Fort entrance, there are also tombs laying scattered around. There is a Ganesha cave temple. ''Vijayanagar kings used to pray before every battle at the Durga temple'', then they used to visit [[Pampa Sarovar]] and Shri Lakshmi temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Rural tourism scheme===
Realising that to appreciate and be involved in conserving ancient lineage and historic surroundings, the villagers of Anegundi must be self-sufficient with sustainable economic support, the Union government under its ''rural tourism'' scheme, formed a trust named Kishkindha to build capacity in the villagers to maintain business incubators.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}

The main activities taken up engaging the locals, were improving the village surroundings through landscaping, developing parks and gardens, putting up fences and constructing compound walls, laying roads within the panchayat limits, fixing street lights, managing solid waste and sewerage, procuring equipment required for water sports and adventure sports, introducing eco-friendly modes of transport for moving within the tourism zone and setting up reception centres.

To meet contemporary needs of tourists, traditional houses in the village were converted into guest houses without disturbing their ancient looks. The villagers are earning a handsome amount by renting out these houses to the tourists.

They have also set up a craft shop offering a range of items made locally using banana fibre, an Internet cafe to help visitors keep in touch with the outer world and a restaurant to treat their taste buds. Local art forms have also been revived to entertain the visitors.

'''Art valuation''', an art-specific subset of [[Valuation (finance)|financial valuation]], is the process of estimating either the [[market value]] of [[Work of art|works of art]]. As such, it is more of a financial rather than an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] concern, however, subjective views of cultural value play a part as well. Art valuation involves comparing data from multiple sources such as art [[auction|auction houses]], private and corporate collectors, [[curators]], art dealer activities, [[Art museum|gallerists]] (gallery owners), experienced consultants, and specialized market analysts to arrive at a value.&lt;ref name="Coslor"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coslor|first=Erica|date=April 2016|title=Transparency in an opaque market: Evaluative frictions between "thick" valuation and "thin" price data in the art market|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361368216300307|journal=Accounting, Organizations and Society|volume=50|pages=13–26|doi=10.1016/j.aos.2016.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8035.html|title=Talking Prices|website=Princeton University Press|access-date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ertug|first=Gokhan|last2=Yogev|first2=Tamar|last3=Lee|first3=Yonghoon G.|last4=Hedström|first4=Peter|date=1 February 2016|title=The Art of Representation: How Audience-specific Reputations Affect Success in the Contemporary Art Field|url=http://amj.aom.org/content/59/1/113|journal=Academy of Management Journal|language=en|volume=59|issue=1|pages=113–134|doi=10.5465/amj.2013.0621|issn=0001-4273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art valuation is accomplished not only for collection, investment, divestment, and financing purposes, but as part of [[Estate (law)|estate]] valuations, for charitable contributions, for [[tax planning]], insurance, and loan [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] purposes. This article deals with the valuation of works of [[fine art]], especially [[contemporary art]], at the top end of the international market, but similar principles apply to the valuation of less expensive art and [[antique]]s.

==Historic valuation and contemporary art==
The source of a work's artistic [[charisma]] has long been debated between artists who create and patrons who enable, but the charismatic power of artworks on those who would possess them is historically the initial driver of value.&lt;ref name="balfe"&gt;Balfe, Judith, Ed., Paying the piper: causes and consequences of art patronage, Univ. of Illinois Press, 1993, p.307. {{ISBN|978-0-252-06310-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jeffri"&gt;Jeffri, Joan, Philanthropy and the American artist: A historical overview, ''[[International Journal of Cultural Policy|The European Journal of Cultural Policy]]'', 3(2), 2009, pp. 207-233.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s that charismatic power started edging over to accommodate commercialized culture and a new industry of art, when aesthetic value fell from prominence to parity with [[Pop art]] and [[Andy Warhol]]'s idea of business art, a recognition that art has become a business and making money in business is an art.&lt;ref name="kuspit"&gt;Kuspit, Donald, [http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/kuspit/kuspit3-6-07.asp Art Values or Money Values?], ARTnet.com, 6 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffri, Joan, ''Managing Uncertainty, The visual art market for contemporary art in the United States'', in Robertson, Iain, Understanding international art markets and management, Routledge, 2005, p. 127. {{ISBN|978-0-415-33956-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of many artists to follow Warhol is [[Jeff Koons]], a stockbroker turned artist who also borrowed imagery from popular culture and made millions.&lt;ref name="littlejohn"&gt;Littlejohn, David, Who is Jeff Koons and Why Are People Saying Such Terrible Things About Him? ''Artnews'', April 1993, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inflatable"&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/14941205 Inflatable investments, The volatile art of Jeff Koons], ''[[The Economist]]'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

For collectors, the emotional connection felt toward a work or collection creates subjective personal value.&lt;ref name="htValue"&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/auctions/pages/common/help/howtovalueart.aspx How to Value Art], artnet.com, retrieved 21 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The weight assigned by such a collector to that subjective measure as a portion of a work's overall financial value may be greater than that by an art speculator not sharing the collector's emotional investment, however, non-economic value measures such as "Do I like it?" or "Does it speak to me?" still have economic effect because such measures can be deciding factors in a purchase.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ"&gt;Campbell, R.A.J., [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID978467_code230208.pdf?abstractid=978467&amp;rulid=6936564&amp;mirid=1 Art as a Financial Investment], Erasmus Univ., Rotterdam, Maastricht Univ., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Art Dealer's Association of America (ADAA) suggests that the key issues are authenticity, quality, rarity, condition, provenance and value. &lt;ref&gt;http://artdealers.org/sites/default/files/adaa_guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuing art==
[[File:Art Fair Enough Melbourne.jpg|380px|thumb|An art fair]]
Art valuation activity concerns itself with estimating market demand, estimating [[Market liquidity|liquidity]] capability of lots, works, and artists, the condition and [[provenance]] of works, and with valuation trends such as average sale price and mean estimates.&lt;ref name="artnetTrends"&gt;See artnet.com's [http://www.artnet.com/products/mt_faq.asp Market Trends FAQ].&lt;/ref&gt; As with other markets, the art market uses its own industry-specific [[Technical terminology|terms of art]] or vocabulary, for example, "bought-in", describing the disadvantageous situation occurring when a work or lot at auction is returned to its owner having been passed over, withdrawn or otherwise unsold.&lt;ref name="kendzulak"&gt;Kendzulak, Susan, definition of "[http://fineart.about.com/od/Glossary_B/g/Bought-In.htm Bought-In]", about.com. See also: [http://teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/Buying_in.html Buying in] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504231250/http://www.teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/Buying_in.html |date=2012-05-04 }}, teachmefinance.com. Accessed 20 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Valuing art is also necessary when a piece is to be used as collateral. The art-lending market has expanded to an estimated $15 billion to $19 billion of loans outstanding in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Art &amp; Finance Report 2016 |url=https://www2.deloitte.com/lu/en/pages/art-finance/articles/art-finance-report.html |website=Deloitte |publisher=Deloitte &amp; ArtTactic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shift in Asia towards investment in western art is a factor that has allowed art lending companies to launch offices in Asia as western works are often easier to use as collateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/0b641fea-e17f-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c |website=The Financial Times|title=London-based art fund targets $1bn lending in Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Market demand===
As in the housing market, "[[comparables]]" are used to determine what level of demand similar items have in a current market. The freshness of the comparables is important because the art market is fluid and stale comparables will yield estimates that may have little relation to a work's current value.&lt;ref name="htValue" /&gt; Subject matter and the [[List of artistic media|medium]] of a work also affect market demand, as does rarity.

===Liquidity===
Liquidity in the art market means having artworks in very high demand and being able to sell those works without impediment. Art sales slow in downturns resulting in the market becoming more illiquid. There is a greater degree of liquidity risk facing the art investor than with other financial assets because there is a limited pool of potential buyers, and with artworks not reaching their reserve prices and not being sold, this has an effect on the auction prices.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ" /&gt; In a divorce action between a couple who sought to divide a $102 million collection between them, the couple decided a sale would prove problematic because selling the entire collection and dividing the profit would saturate the market and drive down prices; in reporting on the case, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' described the case as a study on how people measure the value of art, and which counts for more — pragmatism or sentiment.&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;Armstrong, Ken, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018791206_larson29m.html The art of divorce: She gets the Monet, he gets the Renoir] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731233730/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018791206_larson29m.html |date=31 July 2012 }}, Local News &amp;#124; ''The Seattle Times'', seattletimes.nwsource.com, 28 July 2012. Accessed 2012-7-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper reported that one of the two litigants had a more sentimental view of the value of the works, while the other had a more businesslike view, wanting balance and diversification.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; The newspaper attempted to calculate the value of the many artworks at issue in the case by determining a per-square-inch price based on each piece's value divided by its dimension, to end up with a per-square-inch price to apply to the amount of wall space the businesslike litigant wanted to cover with the available art.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; ''The Times'' ultimately concluded that using this formula as between the litigants, [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''Dans les Oliviers à Capri'' was valued at $26,666.67 per square inch, that the sentimental litigant received $3,082 of appraised value per square inch while the businesslike litigant received $1,942 per square inch, but could cover more wall space.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt;

===Valuation trends===
Trends for values from the world's top auction houses are compared for study of market direction and how that direction affects given artists and works.&lt;ref name="higgs"&gt;Higgs, H. and Worthington, A., [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=commpapers Financial Returns and Price Determinants in the Australian Art Market, 1973–2003], ''Economic Record'', 81:113–123, 2005-06. {{doi|10.1111/j.1475-4932.2005.00237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worthington"&gt;Worthington, AC and Higgs, H, [http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=commpapers A Note on Financial Risk, Return and Asset Pricing in Australian Modern and Contemporary Art], ''Journal of Cultural Economics'', 30(3), March 2006, 73-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Valuations for art sold at the market's top houses usually carry more weight than valuations from less established houses, as most of the top houses have hundreds of years of experience.&lt;ref name="worthington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="topHouses"&gt;Kendzulak, Susan, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140412120752/http://fineart.about.com/od/AuctionHouses/tp/Fine-Art-Auction-Houses-Established-Auction-Houses-For-The-Fine-Arts.htm Top 11 Fine Art Auction Houses], About.com lists the top houses (as of April 2014, and this list is volatile) as:
: 1 &amp; 2. Bonhams, and Bonhams &amp; Butterfields (London, New York, Los Angeles, Sydney, Hong Kong, Dubai, and San Francisco)
: 3. Christie's (London, Paris, Milan, New York, Hong Kong and Dubai)
: 4. Dorotheum (Vienna, Brussels, Düsseldorf, Munich, Milan and Rome)
: 5. Heritage Auctions (Dallas, Beverly Hills and New York)
: 6. Phillips de Pury &amp; Company (New York and London)
: 7. Sotheby's (London, Hong Kong, Geneva, Milan, Paris, Zürich, New York, Toronto, Doha)
: 8. Stockholms Auktionsverk (Stockholm)
: 9. Tajan (Paris and Monaco)
: 10. Villa Grisebach Auktionen (Berlin)
: 11. Waddington's (Toronto)&lt;/ref&gt;

Long term economic trends can have a great impact on the valuation of certain types of work. In recent decades the values of historic Russian and Chinese art have greatly benefited from increased wealth in those countries creating new and very rich collectors, as the values of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] and [[Islamic art]] had earlier been boosted by oil wealth in the Arab world.

===Participant activity===
One of many factors in the primary market's price of a living artist's work is a dealer's contract with an artist: many dealers, as stakeholders in their artists' success, agree to buy their own stable of artists' work at auction in order to prevent price drops, to maintain price stability, or to increase perceived value, or all three, thus dealers bidding on their own artists at auction have a direct impact on the selling price for those artists' works and as a result, the valuation of those works.&lt;ref name="castles"&gt;[[Castlestone Management]], [http://i1.exhibit-e.com/collectionofmodernart/ce63a3fb.pdf Major Structural Themes Influencing the Art Market]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ThorntonOnHirst"&gt;Thornton, Sarah, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110615112418/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article6857843.ece The reinvention of artist Damien Hirst], ''The Sunday Times'', 2009-10-04, Retrieved 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research data===
Research data available from art auction houses such as Christie's, Sotheby's, [[Phillips (auctioneers)|Phillips]], [[Bonhams]], and [[Lyon &amp; Turnbull]] are those tracking [[market trend]]s such as yearly lot transactions, bought-in statistics, sales volume, price levels, and pre-auction estimates.&lt;ref name="MondianReport"&gt;For an example see artnet.com's sample report: [http://www.artnet.com/products/MT_sample.pdf Market Performance Report for Piet Mondian].&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also companies such as [[ArtTactic]] utilizing art auction data as providers of art market research analysis.&lt;ref name="arttactic"&gt;For example, arttactic's monthly [http://www.arttactic.com/newsletters.php Rawfacts newsletter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708175114/http://www.arttactic.com/newsletters.php |date=8 July 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Information available from internet-based art sale history databases generally does not include the condition of a work, a very important factor,&lt;ref name="htValue" /&gt; therefore the prices quoted in those databases reflect auction hammer price without other, crucial valuation factors. Additionally, the databases of auctioned work do not cover private sales of works, and thus their use for art valuation is but one source among many needed for determining value.&lt;ref name="campbellRAJ" /&gt;

===General valuation factors===
Valuation estimates by auction houses are typically given in ranges of prices to offset uncertainty. Generally, estimates are made by looking at what a comparable piece of art sold for recently, with estimates given in a range of prices rather than one fixed figure,&lt;ref name="phillips"&gt;de Pury, Simon, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110715074548/http://www.phillipsartexpert.com/ask_simon/ FAQ #13].&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of [[contemporary art]] especially, having few comparables or when an artist is not well known and has no auction history, the risks of incorrect valuation are greatest.

One potential factor in valuation are the seller's reasons for selling a particular work and/or the buyer's reasons for buying, neither of which may have anything to do with the other. For example, a seller may be motivated by financial need, boredom with a particular artwork, or the desire to raise funds for a different purchase.&lt;ref name="nprCornish"&gt;Cornish, Audie, [https://www.npr.org/2012/10/03/162246654/wealthy-use-art-collections-as-way-to-a-better-loan Wealthy Use Art Collections As Way To A Better Loan], [[NPR]], npr.org, 3 October 2012. Accessed 29 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Common motivations include the so-called three D's: death, debt and divorce. Buyers may be motivated by market excitement, may be acting in accord with a collection plan, or buying like buyers of stock: to drive value up or down either for themselves or for another person. 

One method for pricing pieces by new artists of uncertain value is to ignore aesthetics and consider, besides market trends, three semi-commoditized aspects: "scale" - size and level of detail, "intensity" - effort, and "medium" - quality of the materials.&lt;ref name="shark"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630230248/http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=128084948 Why A Dead Shark Costs $12 Million], NPR, npr.org, 25 June 2010. Accessed 2010-07-27. Archived from the original at archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valuing artworks in such a specialized market, therefore, takes into account a wide variety of factors, some indeed in conflict with each other.

==Valuation for tax and other law-related purposes==
In the United States, art bought and sold by collectors is treated as a [[capital asset]] for tax purposes,&lt;ref&gt;Capital asset defined: 26 U.S.C. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1221 § 1221], Legal Information Institute, law.cornell.edu. Accessed 14 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and disputes relating to the valuation of art or the nature of [[Gain (finance)|gain]] on its sale are usually decided by the federal [[United States Tax Court|Tax Court]], and sometimes by other courts applying federal tax law to specific cases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3204">The '''Association for Research into Crimes against Art''' ('''ARCA''') is a research and outreach organization that works to promote research and the study of art crime and cultural heritage protection. ARCA aims to bridge the gap between the practical and theoretical by fostering collaboration between foreign and domestic law enforcement officials, security consultants, academics, lawyers, archaeologists, insurance specialists, criminologists, art historians, conservators, and others. Their goal is to raise public awareness about art related crime and to better preserve the world's collective cultural heritage.

At the grassroots level, ARCA objective is to identify emerging and under-examined trends related to the study of art crime and to develop strategies to advocate for the responsible stewardship of our collective artistic and archaeological heritage. ARCA advances this mission through educational programming, research, publications and public outreach at the national and international level to foster an exchange of knowledge in the field.

As part of this work, ARCA sponsors a [[Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection]] which is held from June to August every year in Italy.  It also publishes the ''Journal of Art Crime'', and hosts an annual academic conference on [http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/interdisciplinary-art-crime-conference/ art crime and cultural heritage at risk.]

Dan Brown mentions ARCA and their blog in his novel ''[[Inferno (Dan Brown novel)|Inferno]]'' (2013).  In chapter 72, Robert Langdon uses the ARCA website to check the history of the Four Horses of the Basilica San Marco, and is startled by the passage:

"''The decorative collars were added to the horses' necks in 1204 by the Venetians to conceal where the heads had been severed to facilitate their transportation by ship from Constantinople to Venice.''"&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Dan.  "Inferno."  Bantam: 2013.  Pg 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

This passage is taken from a series of [http://art-crime.blogspot.it/2011/06/judge-arthur-tompkins-on-four-horses-of.html four articles] discussing the long and tumultuous history of the Four Horses of the Basilica San Marco, the art work with the longest history of crimes against it, written by Judge Arthur Tompkins.  Judge Tompkins is an ARCA trustee and faculty member, who teaches a course on Art Crimes in War as part of ARCA's Postgraduate Certificate Program and includes detailed discussion of the Four Horses as part of his course.

==History==
''See also [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped#History|National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]]''

In 1931, the United States passed the [[Pratt-Smoot Act]] to provide blind adults with access to books.  Before audio recordings, books were made available in [[braille]]. Beginning with 19 libraries in 1931, the network as of March 2018 was 55 regional libraries, 32 subregional libraries, and 14 advisory and outreach centers serving the United States and its territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/network-libraries/about-local-network-libraries/|title=About Local Network Libraries - National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|work=National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was expanded in 1952 to include blind children, in 1962 to include music materials, and in 1966 to include individuals with physical impairments that prevent the reading of standard print.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/nls/reference/factsheets/copyright.html NLS Factsheets: Copyright Law Amendment, 1996: PL 104-197&lt;/ref&gt; The Books for the Blind Program was the model for the effort in the 1950s for captioned films for the deaf leading to the [[Captioned Films Act of 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dcmp.org/learn/379-described-and-captioned-media-program-seventy-years-of-progress|title=Described and Captioned Media Program: Seventy Years of Progress|website=dcmp.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio recordings were first created on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] when [[Pratt-Smoot Act]] was amended in 1933 to include "talking books", and later, in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Information Literacies for the Twenty-First Century |chapter=Something New Has Been Added: Aural Literacy and Libraries |publisher=G.

Currently, books for the blind and visually impaired can be downloaded from the NLS's Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) system, which allows for digital books on desktop computers and some [[mobile device]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loc.gov/nls/about/services/braille-audio-reading-download-bard/|title=Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD) - National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|work=National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS) {{!}} Library of Congress|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a "wi-fi" symbol was added to the NLS's logo to represent the inclusion of wireless connectivity to the programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dbs.myflorida.com/Library/Newsletter/2016-fall-eng.html|title=Florida Division of Blind Services|website=dbs.myflorida.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Catch Me If You Can''''' is the semi-[[autobiography]] of [[Frank Abagnale Jr.]], a former con artist who, as a young man, cashed [[United States dollar|$]]2.5 million worth of bad checks while impersonating a [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] pilot, a doctor, a teacher, and an attorney. The book is co-written by Stan Redding, and was adapted into a [[Catch Me If You Can|2002 film of the same name]] by director [[Steven Spielberg]], starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Abagnale and [[Tom Hanks]] as the FBI agent who pursued him.

== Plot summary ==
{{hatnote|For the movie plot, see [[Catch Me If You Can#Plot]].}}
The book details the life of Frank Abagnale, who was one of the most famous con-artists in the 20th century. It is written in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and describes how he cashed $2.5 million worth of bad checks. He assumed various jobs, such as pretending to be a Pan Am pilot, a doctor, a teacher, and an attorney. Abagnale was eventually caught by the FBI Agents, who had been chasing him the whole way, while living in France and then served approximately five years in prison&amp;nbsp;— six months in France, six months in [[Sweden]], and four years in the United States. The book ends with an epilogue telling the story of Frank Abagnale's final capture and the story of his rehabilitation, which resulted in the creation of his security firm.

== Plot ==
Frank W. Abagnale is devastated when his parents decide to divorce. He runs away from home and starts cashing fake checks. He's only 16 years old but he looks 26. He uses this in his advantage by pretending to be a 26 year old. Soon he decides he can't stay in New York, because the banks in New York start to ask questions about him cashing in checks from an empty bank account. He goes to the airport and does some research. After some time he is able to fake a pilot license. Frank abuses the right pilots have to fly for free. He travels throughout the United States and cashes fraudulent checks everywhere, in every city he passes. During his adventures he makes many friends and girlfriends. In some cities he stays for a few days, in others he stays longer.

Eventually, Abagnale settles in the city of River Bend. Here he has a very curious neighbor, and to avoid questions, he says he's a doctor. This is a mistake: His neighbor is also a doctor. Immediately, he makes a fake doctor's license, which later comes in handy. After some time they become friends and Frank goes to the hospital. There he is welcomed warmly; soon, he begins spending a lot of time in the hospital. In the hospital he meets Brenda Strong, whom he starts dating. His relationship with Brenda is different from other relationships he has had. Frank soon realizes he can't stay in River Bend because the FBI is getting closer every day. He continues his journey in the United States. At a particular moment he also fakes a Harvard diploma to pose as an attorney. A few months later he starts feeling the urge to cross the Atlantic and go to Europe.

Frank forges a passport and flies to France. In Europe, he continues traveling and forging and cashing checks. Later, when he goes back to the United States, he goes to a flight attendant school and makes his own fake crew: He tells the students he needs a new crew to take pictures for advertising. With his crew, he feels confident enough to cash even bigger checks. When his crew leaves and he restarts his con, the police gets closer to finding Frank. When he gets caught by the French police he goes to [[Perpignan|Perpignan's]] prison, where he is held in a very small, dark and inhumane cell. After getting released he is extradited to Sweden, where he gets a very comfortable cell at the [[Malmö]] prison. After staying there for six months he returns to the United States. Once back in the United States he escapes from prison twice, but is caught both times. He serves four years of his 12-year sentence in prison.

After being released, Frank has a hard time finding a job. He figures he should use his talents for a new job and starts his own firm. He now visits banks to teach the personnel how to recognize fraudulent checks.

=== Veracity ===
In 2002, Abagnale addressed the issue of the book's truthfulness with a statement posted on his company's website which said (in part): "I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over-dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography." Specifically he addressed details such as the amount of money he wrote in bad checks, and the years in which his crimes took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Abagnale &amp; Associates, Comments| url=http://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm | access-date=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movie adaptation ==
The 2002 film ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', directed by award-winning director [[Steven Spielberg]], stars [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Abagnale and [[Tom Hanks]] as Hanratty. The film is based upon his life and the autobiography and is mainly true to the source as Abagnale was a consultant to the writers, but some of the details were changed to create a more dramatic narrative for film.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-06-052971-7}} by [[Frank Abagnale]], Jr. and Stan Redding&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical adaptation==
Abagnale's life has been adapted into a musical [[Catch Me If You Can (musical)|of the same name]], which previewed on March 11, 2011, and opened on April 10 at the [[Neil Simon Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  The show stars [[Aaron Tveit]], [[Norbert Leo Butz]], [[Tom Wopat]] and [[Kerry Butler]]. Butz won the [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical]] at the [[65th Tony Awards]] in 2011.

A '''dual narrative''' is a form of [[narrative]] that tells a story in two different perspectives, usually two different people. '''Dual narrative''' is also an effective technique that can be used to tell the story of people (or one person) at two different points in time ([[Postcards from No Man's Land]], [[Great Expectations]]).
It is used to show parallels or emphasise differences in the lifestyles or points-of-view of different places or time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haertsch|first=Gretchen|title=The Dual Narrative- Does it Work?|url=http://birthofanovel.wordpress.com/2011/09/21/the-dual-narrative-does-it-work/|accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Expanded Cinema''''' by [[Gene Youngblood]] (1970), the first book to consider video as an art form, was influential in establishing the field of [[media arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Manovich, Lev. 2002. "Ten Key Texts on Digital Art: 1970–2000". Leonardo. 35 (5): 567–569.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book he argues that a new, expanded cinema is required for a new consciousness. He describes various types of filmmaking utilizing new technology, including film [[special effects]], [[computer art]], [[video art]], multi-media environments and [[holography]].

== "Part One: The Audience and the Myth of Entertainment" ==
In the first part of the book, Youngblood attempts to show how ''expanded cinema'' will unite art and life. "Television's elaborate movie-like subjective-camera ''simulation'' of the first moon landing" (p46) showed a generation that reality was not as real as simulation. He says that he is writing "at the end of the era of cinema as we've known it, the beginning of an era of image-exchange between man and man" (p. 49). The ''[[future shock]]'' of the ''Paleocybernetic Age'' will change fundamental concepts such as intelligence, morality, creativity and the family (pp. 50–53). The ''[[Intermedia]] network'' of the mass media is contemporary man's environment, replacing nature. He uses recent scientific research into [[Body memory|cellular memory]] and inherited memory to support his claim that this network [[Pavlovian conditioning|conditions]] human experience. The ''[[Noosphere]]'' (a term Youngblood borrows from [[Teilhard de Chardin]]) is the organizing intelligence of the planet—the minds of its inhabitants. "Distributed around the globe by the intermedia network, it becomes a new ''technology'' that may prove to be one of the most powerful tools in man's history" (p. 57). He defends the universality of art against the localism of entertainment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The intermedia network has made all of us artists by proxy. A decade of television-watching is equal to a comprehensive course in dramatic acting, writing, and filming...the mystique is gone—we could almost do it ourselves. Unfortunately too many of us do just that: hence the glut of sub-mediocre talent in the entertainment industry.
:— p. 58&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is what forces cinema to expand and become more complex. Mass media entertainment dulls people's minds. It is a closed, [[entropic]] system, adding nothing new. (pp. 59–65) Entertainment dwells on the past. We live in ''future shock'' so art should be an invention of a future (pp. 66–69). New systems need to be designed for old information. The artist is a ''design scientist''.

== "Part Two: Synaesthetic Cinema: The End of Drama" ==
Youngblood describes television as the [[software]] of the planet. It acts as a [[superego]] and shows us global reality. This renders cinema obsolete as a communicator of objective reality, and so frees it (pp. 78–80). He embraces a [[synesthesia|synaesthetic]] synthesis of opposites which are simultaneously perceived. He then goes on to draw a distinction between the [[syncretic]] montage of [[Vsevolod Pudovkin|Pudovkin]] and the [[Sergei Eisenstein|Eisenstein]]'s montage of collision (pp. 84–86). He prefers metamorphosis to cuts (p86). Filmmakers that Youngblood think embody this synesthetic syncretism include: [[Stan Brakhage]] (p. 87), [[Will Hindle]], Pat O'Neill, John Schofill, and [[Ronald Nameth]]. Filmmakers that present ideas of [[polymorphous perversity|polymorphous]] eroticism, the blurring of sexual boundaries, include [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Carolee Schneemann]] (pp. 112–121). [[Michael Snow]]'s ''[[Wavelength (1966 film)|Wavelength]]'' is also an example of synaesthetic cinema's extra-objective reality (pp. 122–127). At the end of the second part of the book Youngblood writes about the rebirth of the cottage industry in the post-mass-audience age. Video tapes can be exchanged freely, films are becoming more personal, specializations are ending (pp. 128–134).

== "Part Three: Toward Cosmic Consciousness" ==
Youngblood analyses [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|''2001: A Space Odyssey'']] to explore the "electronic age [[existentialism]]" (pp. 139–150). He examines [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s use of mechanical processes to create the ''Stargate sequence'' (pp. 151–156) and describes the work of [[Jordan Belson]] as an example of ''cosmic cinema'' (pp. 157–177).

== "Part Four: Cybernetic Cinema and Computer Films" ==
Youngblood defines the ''technosphere'' as a symbiosis between man and machine. The computer liberates man from specialization and amplifies intelligence (pp. 180–182). He draws comparisons between computer processing and human neural processing (pp. 183–184). Logic and intelligence is the brain's software. He predicts that computer software will become more important than [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and that in the future [[super-computers]] will design ever more advanced computers (pp. 185–188). His vision of the future is the ''Aesthetic Machine'': "Aesthetic application of technology is the only means of achieving new consciousness to match our environment" (p189). Creativity will be shared between man and machine. He points to the links between [[computer art]] and [[conceptual art|Conceptualism]], and the growing theoretical basis of art. In his [[cybernetic art]] exploration of ''Cybernetic Cinema'' he gives an account of early experiments using computers to draw and make films. He bemoans the fact that at the time of writing no computer has the power to generate real-time images and that computer art has to be made [[off-line]]. He does, though, foresee a future in which location shooting will become obsolete as all locations will be able to be simulated with computers (pp. 194–2006). Examples of filmmakers using computers, referred to by Youngblood, include: [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], [[James Whitney (filmmaker)|James Whitney]], [[Michael Whitney (filmmaker)|Michael Whitney]], [[John Stehura]], [[Stan VanDerBeek]] and [[Peter Kamnitzer]] (pp. 207–256).

== "Part Five: Television as a Creative Medium" ==
Youngblood describes the ''videosphere'', in which computers and televisions are extensions to man's central nervous system. He is optimistic about technological advances and predicts [[Video on demand|TV-on-demand]] by 1978 (pp. 260–264). He does acknowledge, however, that data retrieval is more complicated than data recording. The various processes involved in [[video synthesizer|video synthesizing]] are described: de-beaming, [[Keying (graphics)|keying]], [[Chroma key|chroma-keying]], [[feedback]], mixing, switching and [[linear video editing|editing]] (pp. 265–280). The work of [[Loren Sears]] is [[neuroesthetics|neuroesthetic]] because it treats television as an extension of the central nervous system (pp. 291–295). The curator [[Jim Newman (Dilexi Gallery, Other Minds)|James Newman]] moved from a traditional gallery to a conceptual gallery with his joint project with [[KQED-TV]], commissioning television work from [[Terry Riley]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[The Living Theater]], [[Robert Frank]] and [[Walter De Maria]] (pp. 292–293). [[Nam June Paik]] has worked creatively with television (pp. 302–308). [[Les Levine]] exploits the potential of [[closed-circuit television]] (pp. 337–344).

== "Part Six: Intermedia" ==
Youngblood sees the artist as an ecologist, involved with the environment rather than with objects (pp. 346–351). By way of example he cites the video displays at world expositions (specifically [[Roman Kroitor]]'s large-scale projections at [[Expo 67]] and [[Expo '70]] (pp. 352–358), and the ''Cerebrum'', an art/nightclub environment.  Artists such as [[Carolee Schneemann]] and [[Robert Whitman]] combine film projection with live performance (pp. 366–371). [[Wolf Vostell]] incorporates video experiments into environmental contexts (p. 383). Light shows are used in concerts and multiple projectors and video screens create complex environments.

== "Part Seven: Holographic Cinema: A New World" ==
Finally, Youngblood explores the creative potential of [[holography]].

'''''Galacidalacidesoxiribunucleicacid''''' (also known as '''''Homage to Crick and Watson (Discoverers of DNA)''''') is a 1963 painting by [[Salvador Dalí]]. The painting's title is a [[portmanteau]] of the name of Dalí's wife, [[Gala Dalí]], and [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA). It is a tribute to [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]], who determined the [[double helix|double helical]] structure of DNA in 1953.

The painting is in the collection of the [[Salvador Dalí Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.thedali.org/mwebcgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=146;type=101]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The painting was commissioned by the [[Bank of New England|New England National Bank of Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Lambro. Close Encounters of the Worst Kind. Lulu.com, 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-4303-0401-2}}. Page 24&lt;/ref&gt; It was exhibited at [[Knoedler]] in 1963 from November 26 to December 26.{{sfn|Keller|1963}} In the exhibition catalogue, Dalí declared that:
{{quotation|At a time when the titles of pictures are rather short (i.e. "Picture No. 1" or "White on White") I call my Hommage to Crick and Watson: GALACIDALACIDESOXIRIBUNUCLEICACID. It is my longest title in one word. But the theme is even longer: long as the genetical persistance of human memory. As announced by the prophet Isaiah—the Saviour contained in God's head from which one sees for the first time in the iconographic history his arms repeating the molecular structures of Crick and Watson and lifting Christ's dead body so as to resuscitate him in heaven.{{sfn|Keller|1963}}}}

==Composition==
Gala Dalí is depicted in the foreground of the painting, with her back to the viewer. 

==Analysis==
In a note describing the work, Dalí mused that the [[double helix]] is "the only structure linking man to [[God]]."&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Anker and Dorothy Nelkin. The Molecular Gaze: Art in the Genetic Age. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2004. AuthorsEdition 2, illustrated. {{ISBN|0-87969-697-4}}. Page XII.&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of 13 large paintings Dali produced. On the right hand side there are riflemen arranged to form "cubes of death". Within each "cube of death" their rifles aim at each other's head, thus if one of them shoots it will trigger the reaction of the other three, and they will all shoot killing each other. According to Dali, these cubes also represent the cubic structure of one of the most familiar substances, table salt or sodium chloride. However, the crystal structure of NaCl is cubic all-face centered rather than cubic primitive, thus there is a scientific inconsistency.

"The prophet Isaiah appears at the top left holding a scroll inscribed with the title
of the painting—Galacidalacidesoxiribunucleicacid. It combines a string of words
that decodes the meaning of the work. The first word in the string is Gala, Dalí‘s
wife and muse. The word ―"cid" refers to a Spanish folklore hero, and [[Allah]] is the
Arabic word for God. The last word in the string is Dalí‘s spelling of the full
scientific name for DNA—desoxiribunucleicacid."[http://thedali.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Antenna-Audio-Adult-Tour.pdf [4&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]

[[Hermeneutics#Modern hermeneutics|Modern hermeneutics]] includes both verbal and non-verbal communication&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;''The Routledge Companion to Philosophy in Organization Studies'', Routledge, 2015, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JMN"&gt;Joann McNamara, ''From Dance to Text and Back to Dance: A Hermeneutics of Dance Interpretive Discourse'', PhD thesis, Texas Woman's University, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[semiotics]], [[presupposition]]s, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology.

Hermeneutics was initially applied to the interpretation, or [[exegesis]], of [[Religious texts|scripture]], and has been later broadened to questions of general interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to  Philosophical Hermeneutics|last=Grondin|first=Jean|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-300-05969-8}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''hermeneutics'' and ''exegesis'' are sometimes used interchangeably. Hermeneutics is a wider discipline which includes written, verbal, and non-verbal&lt;ref name="Routledge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JMN" /&gt; communication. Exegesis focuses primarily upon the word and grammar of texts.

Hermeneutic, as a count noun in the singular, refers to some particular method of interpretation (see, in contrast, [[double hermeneutic]]).

==Etymology==
''Hermeneutics'' is derived from the Greek word {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεύω}} (''hermēneuō'', "translate, interpret"),&lt;ref&gt;Klein, Ernest, ''A complete etymological dictionary of the English language: dealing with the origin of words and their sense development, thus illustrating the history of civilization and culture'', Elsevier, Oxford, 2000, p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεύς}} (''hermeneus'', "translator, interpreter"), of uncertain etymology ([[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] (2009) suggests a [[Pre-Greek]] origin).&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; The technical term {{lang|grc|ἑρμηνεία}} (''hermeneia'', "interpretation, explanation") was introduced into philosophy mainly through the title of [[Aristotle]]'s work {{lang|grc|Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας}} ("Peri Hermeneias"), commonly referred to by its Latin title ''[[De&amp;nbsp;Interpretatione]]'' and translated in English as  ''On Interpretation''. It is one of the earliest (c.&amp;nbsp;360&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;B.C.&lt;/small&gt;) extant philosophical works in the [[Western philosophy|Western tradition]] to deal with the relationship between language and logic in a comprehensive, explicit and formal way.

The early usage of "hermeneutics" places it within the boundaries of the [[sacred]].&lt;ref&gt;Grondin, Jean (1994). Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05969-8}}. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Divinity|divine]] message must be received with implicit uncertainty regarding its truth. This ambiguity is an irrationality; it is a sort of madness that is inflicted upon the receiver of the message. Only one who possesses a rational method of interpretation (i.e., a hermeneutic) could determine the truth or falsity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Grondin, Jean (1994). ''Introduction to Philosophical Hermeneutics''. Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-05969-8}}. pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk etymology===
[[File:Hermes Musei Capitolini MC60.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Hermes]]'', messenger of the gods.]]
[[Folk etymology]] places its origin with [[Hermes]], the mythological Greek [[deity]] who was the 'messenger of the gods'.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy"&gt;Hoy, David Couzen (1981). The Critical Circle. University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0520046399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides being a mediator between the gods and between the gods and men, he led souls to the [[Hades|underworld]] upon death.

Hermes was also considered to be the inventor of language and speech, an interpreter, a liar, a thief and a trickster.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy" /&gt; These multiple roles made Hermes an ideal representative figure for hermeneutics. As Socrates noted, words have the power to reveal or conceal and can deliver messages in an ambiguous way.&lt;ref name="Couzen-Hoy" /&gt; The Greek view of language as consisting of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] that could lead to truth or to falsehood was the essence of Hermes, who was said to relish the uneasiness of those who received the messages he delivered.

These principles ranged from standard rules of logic (e.g., [[A fortiori argument|''a fortiori'' argument]] [known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as קל&amp;nbsp;וחומר&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp; ''kal v'chomer'']) to more expansive ones, such as the rule that a passage could be interpreted by reference to another passage in which the same word appears ([[Talmudical Hermeneutics#Gezerah Shavah|Gezerah Shavah]]). The [[rabbi]]s did not ascribe equal persuasive power to the various principles.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., Rambam Hilkhot Talmud Torah 4:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional Jewish hermeneutics differed from the Greek method in that the rabbis considered the [[Tanakh]] (the Jewish bibilical canon) to be without error. Any apparent inconsistencies had to be understood by means of careful examination of a given text within the context of other texts. There were different levels of interpretation: some were used to arrive at the plain meaning of the text, some expounded the law given in the text, and others found [[Esotericism|secret]] or [[Mysticism|mystical]] levels of understanding.

===Vedic hermeneutics===
{{Main|Mimamsa}}

Vedic hermeneutics involves the exegesis of the [[Vedas]], the earliest holy texts of [[Hinduism]]. The [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa]] was the leading hermeneutic school and their primary purpose was understanding what [[Dharma]] (righteous living) involved by a detailed hermeneutic study of the Vedas. They also derived the rules for the various rituals that had to be performed precisely.

The foundational text is the [[Mimamsa Sutras|Mimamsa Sutra]] of [[Jaimini]] (ca. 3rd to 1st century BCE) with a major commentary by [[Śabara]] (ca. the 5th or 6th century CE). The Mimamsa sutra summed up the basic rules for Vedic interpretation.

===Buddhist hermeneutics===
{{Main|Buddhist hermeneutics}}

Buddhist hermeneutics deals with the interpretation of the vast [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]], particularly those texts which are said to be spoken by the [[Buddha]] ([[Buddhavacana]]) and other enlightened beings. Buddhist hermeneutics is deeply tied to Buddhist spiritual practice and its ultimate aim is to extract [[Upaya|skillful means]] of reaching spiritual enlightenment or [[nirvana]]. A central question in Buddhist hermeneutics is which Buddhist teachings are explicit, representing ultimate truth, and which teachings are merely conventional or relative.

===Biblical hermeneutics===
{{Main|Biblical hermeneutics}}
Biblical hermeneutics is the study of the principles of interpretation of the Bible. While Jewish and Christian biblical hermeneutics have some overlap, they have distinctly different interpretive traditions.

The early [[Church Fathers|patristic]] traditions of biblical [[exegesis]] had few unifying characteristics in the beginning but tended toward unification in later schools of biblical hermeneutics.

[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] offers hermeneutics and [[homiletics]] in his ''[[De doctrina christiana]]''. He stresses the importance of humility in the study of Scripture. He also regards the duplex commandment of love in Matthew 22 as the heart of Christian faith. In Augustine’s hermeneutics, signs have an important role. God can communicate with the believer through the signs of the Scriptures. Thus, humility, love, and the knowledge of signs are an essential hermeneutical presupposition for a sound interpretation of the Scriptures. Although Augustine endorses some teaching of the [[Platonism]] of his time, he corrects and recasts it according to a theocentric doctrine of the Bible. Similarly, in a practical discipline, he modifies the classical theory of oratory in a Christian way. He underscores the meaning of diligent study of the Bible and prayer as more than mere human knowledge and oratory skills. As a concluding remark, Augustine encourages the interpreter and preacher of the Bible to seek a good manner of life and, most of all, to love God and neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woo | first=B. Hoon | title=Augustine’s Hermeneutics and Homiletics in De doctrina christianae | journal= Journal of Christian Philosophy | year=2013 | volume=17 | url=https://www.academia.edu/5228314/_Augustines_Hermeneutics_and_Homiletics_in_De_doctrina_christianae_Humiliation_Love_Sign_and_Discipline_Journal_of_Christian_Philosophy_17_2013_97-117 |pages=97–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are traditionally fourfold sense of biblical hermeneutics: literal, moral, allegorical (spiritual), and anagogical.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/hermeneutics-principles-of-biblical-interpretation Hermeneutics – Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literal====
{{See also|Biblical literalism}}
Encyclopædia Britannica states that literal analysis means “a biblical text is to be deciphered according to the ‘plain meaning’ expressed by its linguistic construction and historical context.” The intention of the authors is believed to correspond to the literal meaning. Literal hermeneutics is often associated with the verbal inspiration of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"&gt;'Hermeneutics' 2014, Encyclopædia Britannica, Research Starters, EBSCOhost, viewed 17 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moral====
Moral interpretation searches for moral lessons which can be understood from writings within the Bible. Allegories are often placed in this category.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

====Allegorical====
Allegorical interpretation states that biblical narratives have a second level of reference that is more than the people, events and things that are explicitly mentioned. One type of allegorical interpretation is known as [[typology (theology)|typological]], where the key figures, events, and establishments of the Old Testament are viewed as “types” (patterns). In the New Testament this can also include foreshadowing of people, objects, and events. According to this theory, readings like Noah’s Ark could be understood by using the Ark as a “type” of the Christian church that God designed from the start.&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

====Anagogical====
This type of interpretation is more often known as mystical interpretation. It purports to explain the events of the Bible and how they relate to or predict what the future holds. This is evident in the [[Kabbalah|Jewish Kabbalah]], which attempts to reveal the mystical significance of the numerical values of [[Hebrew]] words and letters.

In Judaism, anagogical interpretation is also evident in the medieval [[Zohar]]. In Christianity, it can be seen in [[Mariology]].&lt;ref name="Hermeneutics 2014"/&gt;

==Philosophical hermeneutics==

===Ancient and medieval hermeneutics===
{{Main|History of hermeneutics}}

===Modern hermeneutics&lt;!-- 'Epistemological hermeneutics', 'Straussian hermeneutics', 'Radical hermeneutics', 'Romantic hermeneutics', 'Methodological hermeneutics', 'Ontological hermeneutics', 'Hermeneutic idealism', 'Hermeneutic realism', 'Analytic hermeneutics' and 'Engaged hermeneutics' redirect here--&gt;===
The discipline of hermeneutics emerged with the new [[Humanism|humanist]] education of the 15th&amp;nbsp;century as a historical and critical [[methodology]] for analyzing texts. In a triumph of early modern hermeneutics, the Italian humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved in 1440 that the ''[[Donation of Constantine]]'' was a forgery. This was done through intrinsic evidence of the text itself. Thus hermeneutics expanded from its medieval role of explaining the true meaning of the Bible.

However, biblical hermeneutics did not die off. For example, the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought about a renewed interest in the interpretation of the Bible, which took a step away from the interpretive tradition developed during the Middle Ages back to the texts themselves. [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] emphasized ''scriptura sui ipsius interpres'' (scripture interprets itself). Calvin used ''brevitas et facilitas'' as an aspect of [[theological hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;Myung Jun Ahn, "Brevitas et facilitas : a study of a vital aspect in the theological hermeneutics of John Calvin" [http://repository.up.ac.za/handle/2263/26944?show=full]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] led hermeneutists, especially [[Protestant]] exegetists, to view Scriptural texts as secular classical texts. They interpreted Scripture as responses to historical or social forces so that, for example, apparent contradictions and difficult passages in the New Testament might be clarified by comparing their possible meanings with contemporary Christian practices.

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768–1834) explored the nature of understanding in relation not just to the problem of deciphering sacred texts but to all human texts and modes of communication.

The interpretation of a text must proceed by framing its content in terms of the overall organization of the work. Schleiermacher distinguished between grammatical interpretation and psychological interpretation. The former studies how a work is composed from general ideas; the latter studies the peculiar combinations that characterize the work as a whole. He said that every problem of interpretation is a problem of understanding and even defined hermeneutics as the art of avoiding misunderstanding. Misunderstanding was to be avoided by means of knowledge of grammatical and psychological laws.

During Schleiermacher's time, a fundamental shift occurred from understanding not merely the exact words and their objective meaning, to an understanding of the writer's distinctive character and point of view.&lt;ref name="ramberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/|title=Hermeneutics|author1=Bjorn Ramberg|author2=Kristin Gjesdal|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th- and 20th-century hermeneutics emerged as a theory of understanding (''[[Verstehen]]'') through the work of [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] ('''[[Jena Romanticism|Romantic]] hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Mueller-Vollmer]] (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CXY_h9rkUSUC&amp;dq= ''The Hermeneutics Reader''], Continuum, 1988, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''[[Scholarly method|methodological]] hermeneutics'''),&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Joseph Echeverria, ''Criticism and Commitment: Major Themes in Contemporary "Post-Critical" Philosophy'', Rodopi, 1981, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; [[August Böckh]] (methodological hermeneutics),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M.

Regarding the relation of hermeneutics with problems of [[analytic philosophy]], there has been, particularly among analytic Heideggerians and those working on Heidegger’s [[philosophy of science]], an attempt to try and situate Heidegger's hermeneutic project in debates concerning [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[anti-realism]]: arguments have been presented both for Heidegger's '''hermeneutic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the thesis that meaning determines [[reference]] or, equivalently, that our understanding of the being of entities is what determines entities as entities)&lt;ref&gt;Steven Galt Crowell, Jeff Malpas (eds.), ''Transcendental Heidegger'', Stanford University Press, 2007, pp. 116–7.&lt;/ref&gt; and for Heidegger's '''hermeneutic realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hubert L.

Dreyfus, Mark A. Wrathall (eds.), ''Heidegger Reexamined: Truth, realism, and the history of being'', Routledge, 2002, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophers that worked to combine analytic philosophy with hermeneutics include [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] and [[Peter Winch]].  Roy J. Howard termed this approach '''analytic hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Roy J. Howard, ''Three Faces of Hermeneutics: An Introduction to Current Theories of Understanding'', University of California Press, 1982, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary philosophers influenced by the hermeneutic tradition include [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]&lt;ref name="ramberg" /&gt; ('''engaged hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aarde|first=Andries G.

====Dilthey (1833–1911)====
[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] broadened hermeneutics even more by relating interpretation to historical objectification. Understanding moves from the outer manifestations of human action and productivity to the exploration of their inner meaning. In his last important essay, "The Understanding of Other Persons and Their Manifestations of Life" (1910), Dilthey made clear that this move from outer to inner, from expression to what is expressed, is not based on [[empathy]]. Empathy involves a direct identification with the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]. Interpretation involves an indirect or mediated understanding that can only be attained by placing human expressions in their historical context. Thus, understanding is not a process of reconstructing the state of mind of the author, but one of articulating what is expressed in his work.

Dilthey divided sciences of the mind ([[human sciences]]) into three structural levels: experience, expression, and comprehension.

* Experience means to feel a situation or thing personally. Dilthey suggested that we can always grasp the meaning of unknown thought when we try to experience it. His understanding of experience is very similar to that of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] [[Edmund Husserl]].
* Expression converts experience into meaning because the discourse has an appeal to someone outside of oneself. Every saying is an expression. Dilthey suggested that one can always return to an expression, especially to its written form, and this practice has the same objective value as an experiment in science. The possibility of returning makes scientific analysis possible, and therefore the humanities may be labeled as science. Moreover, he assumed that an expression may be "saying" more than the speaker intends because the expression brings forward meanings which the individual consciousness may not fully understand.
* The last structural level of the science of the mind, according to Dilthey, is comprehension, which is a level that contains both comprehension and incomprehension. Incomprehension means, more or less, ''wrong understanding''. He assumed that comprehension produces coexistence: "he who understands, understands others; he who does not understand stays alone."

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Martin Heidegger]]'s philosophical hermeneutics shifted the focus from interpretation to [[Existentialism|existential]] understanding as rooted in fundamental ontology, which was treated more as a direct — and thus more authentic — way of being-in-the-world (''In-der-Welt-sein'') than merely as "a way of knowing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper and Row | last = Heidegger | first = Martin| title = Being and Time | origyear = 1927| year = 1962 }} p. H125&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he called for a "special hermeneutic of empathy" to dissolve the classic philosophic issue of "other minds" by putting the issue in the context of the being-with of human relatedness. (Heidegger himself did not complete this inquiry.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | last = Agosta| first = Lou | title = Empathy in the Context of Philosophy | year = 2010 }} p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of this approach claim that some texts, and the people who produce them, cannot be studied by means of using the same [[scientific method]]s that are used in the [[natural science]]s, thus drawing upon arguments similar to those of [[antipositivism]]. Moreover, they claim that such texts are conventionalized expressions of the experience of the author. Thus, the interpretation of such texts will reveal something about the [[social context]] in which they were formed, and, more significantly, will provide the reader with a means of sharing the experiences of the author.

The reciprocity between text and context is part of what Heidegger called the [[hermeneutic circle]]. Among the key thinkers who elaborated this idea was the [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Max Weber]].

====Gadamer (1900–2002) et al.====
[[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s hermeneutics is a development of the hermeneutics of his teacher, Heidegger. Gadamer asserted that methodical contemplation is opposite to experience and reflection. We can reach the truth only by understanding or mastering our experience. According to Gadamer, our understanding is not fixed but rather is changing and always indicating new perspectives. The most important thing is to unfold the nature of individual understanding.

Gadamer pointed out that prejudice is an element of our understanding and is not ''per se'' without value. Indeed, prejudices, in the sense of pre-judgements of the thing we want to understand, are unavoidable. Being alien to a particular tradition is a condition of our understanding. He said that we can never step outside of our tradition — all we can do is try to understand it. This further elaborates the idea of the [[hermeneutic circle]].

[[Bernard Lonergan]]'s (1904–1984) hermeneutics is less well known, but a case for considering his work as the culmination of the [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] hermeneutical revolution that began with Heidegger was made in several articles by Lonergan specialist [[Frederick G. Lawrence]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick G. Lawrence, "Martin Heidegger and the Hermeneutic Revolution", "Hans-Georg Gadamer and the Hermeneutic Revolution", "The Hermeneutic Revolution and Bernard Lonergan: Gadamer and Lonergan on Augustine's Verbum Cordis – the Heart of Postmodern Hermeneutics", "The Unknown 20th-Century Hermeneutic Revolution: Jerusalem and Athens in Lonergan's Integral
Hermeneutics", ''Divyadaan: Journal of Philosophy and Education'' 19/1–2 (2008) 7–30, 31–54, 55–86, 87–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Ricœur]] (1913–2005) developed a hermeneutics that is based upon Heidegger's concepts. His work differs in many ways from that of Gadamer.

[[Karl-Otto Apel]] (b. 1922) elaborated a hermeneutics based on American [[semiotics]]. He applied his model to [[discourse ethics]] with political motivations akin to those of [[critical theory]].

[[Jürgen Habermas]]  (b. 1929) criticized the conservatism of previous hermeneutists, especially Gadamer, because their focus on tradition seemed to undermine possibilities for social criticism and transformation. He also criticized [[Marxism]] and previous members of the [[Frankfurt School]] for missing the hermeneutical dimension of [[critical theory]].

Habermas incorporated the notion of the [[lifeworld]] and emphasized the importance for social theory of interaction, communication, labor, and production. He viewed hermeneutics as a dimension of critical social theory.

[[Andrés Ortiz-Osés]] (b. 1943) has developed his [[symbolic hermeneutics]] as the [[Southern Europe|Mediterranean]] response to [[Northern Europe]]an hermeneutics. His main statement regarding symbolic understanding of the world is that [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] is a [[symbol]]ic healing of injury.

Two other important hermeneutic scholars are [[Jean Grondin]] (b. 1955) and [[Maurizio Ferraris]] (b. 1956).

Mauricio Beuchot coined the term and discipline of [[analogic hermeneutics]], which is a type of hermeneutics that is based upon interpretation and takes into account the plurality of aspects of meaning. He drew categories both from analytic and continental philosophy, as well as from the [[Thought|history of thought]].

Two scholars who have published criticism of Gadamer's hermeneutics are the Italian jurist [[Emilio Betti]] and the American literary theorist [[E. D. Hirsch]].

====New hermeneutic====
[[New hermeneutic]] is the theory and methodology of interpretation to understand Biblical texts through [[existentialism]]. The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life.&lt;ref&gt;(1999) Dictionary of Biblical Interpretation, R.N. Soulen, "Ernst Fuchs", by John Hayes, 422-423&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the event of language. [[Ernst Fuchs (theologian)|Ernst Fuchs]],&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fuchs, Briefe an&amp;nbsp;Gerhard Ebeling, in: Festschrift aaO 48&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerhard Ebeling]], and [[James M. Robinson]] are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics.

====Marxist hermeneutics&lt;!--'Marxist hermeneutics' redirects here--&gt;====
The method of '''Marxist hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; has been developed by the work of, primarily, [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Fredric Jameson]]. Benjamin outlines his theory of the allegory in his study ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama|Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels]]''&lt;ref name=Erasmus/&gt; ("Trauerspiel" literally means "mourning play" but is often translated as "tragic drama").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Verso | isbn = 978-1844673483 | last = Benjamin | first = Walter | title = Origin of the German Tragic Drama |year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Jameson]] draws on Biblical hermeneutics, [[Ernst Bloch]],&lt;ref name=Kaufmann&gt;David Kaufmann, "Thanks for the Memory: Bloch, Benjamin and the Philosophy of History," in ''Not Yet: Reconsidering Ernst Bloch'', ed. Jamie Owen Daniel and Tom Moylan (London and New York: Verson, 1997), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Northrop Frye]], to advance his theory of Marxist hermeneutics in his influential ''[[The Political Unconscious]]''. Jameson's Marxist hermeneutics is outlined in the first chapter of the book, titled "On Interpretation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 978-0-8014-9222-8 | last = Jameson | first = Fredric | title = The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act |year = 1982 }} p. 17 - 102&lt;/ref&gt; Jameson re-interprets (and secularizes) the fourfold system (or four levels) of Biblical exegesis (literal; moral; allegorical; anagogical) to relate interpretation to the Mode of Production, and eventually, history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cornell University Press | isbn = 978-0801492846| last = Dowling | first = William C | title = Jameson, Althusser, Marx: Introduction to the Political Unconscious |year = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Objective hermeneutics&lt;!--'Objective hermeneutics' redirects here--&gt;====
[[Karl Popper]] first used the term "'''objective hermeneutics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" in his ''Objective Knowledge'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] (ed.), ''Phenomenology of Life – From the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: Book II. The Human Soul in the Creative Transformation of the Mind'', Springer, 2007, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[Association for Objective Hermeneutics]] (AGOH) was founded in [[Frankfurt am Main]] by scholars of various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Its goal is to provide all scholars who use the methodology of objective hermeneutics with a means of exchanging information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.objective-hermeneutics.com Association for Objective Hermeneutics website.] Accessed: January 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the few translated texts of this German school of hermeneutics, its founders declared:

{{quote|Our approach has grown out of the empirical study of family interactions as well as reflection upon the procedures of interpretation employed in our research. For the time being we shall refer to it as objective hermeneutics in order to distinguish it clearly  from  traditional  hermeneutic  techniques  and orientations.  The  general  significance  for  sociological  analysis  of objective hermeneutics issues from the fact that, in the social sciences, interpretive methods constitute the fundamental procedures of measurement and of the generation of research data relevant to theory. From our perspective, the standard, nonhermeneutic  methods of quantitative social research can only be justified because they permit a shortcut in generating data (and research "economy" comes about under specific conditions). Whereas  the conventional methodological attitude in the social sciences justifies qualitative approaches as  exploratory or preparatory activities, to be succeeded by standardized approaches and techniques as the actual scientific procedures (assuring  precision, validity, and objectivity), we regard hermeneutic  procedures as the basic method for gaining precise and valid knowledge in the social  sciences. However, we do not simply reject alternative approaches dogmatically. They are in fact useful wherever the loss in precision and objectivity necessitated by the requirement of research economy can be condoned and tolerated in the light of prior hermeneutically elucidated research experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Oevermann, Ulrich; Tilman Allert, Elisabeth Konau, and Jürgen Krambeck. 1987.

==Applications==

===Archaeology===
{{POV section|date=July 2016}}
In [[archaeology]], hermeneutics means the interpretation and understanding of material through analysis of possible meanings and  social uses.

Proponents argue that interpretation of artifacts is unavoidably hermeneutic because we cannot know for certain the meaning behind them. We can only apply modern values when interpreting. This is most commonly seen in [[stone tool]]s, where descriptions such as "scraper" can be highly subjective and actually unproven until the development of [[microwear analysis]] some thirty years ago.

Opponents argue that a hermeneutic approach is too [[Relativism|relativist]] and that their own interpretations are based on [[Common sense|common-sense]] evaluation.

===Architecture===

There are several traditions of architectural scholarship that draw upon the hermeneutics of [[Heidegger]] and [[Gadamer]], such as [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], and [[Nader El-Bizri]] in the circles of  [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]]. Lindsay Jones examines the way architecture is received and how that reception changes with time and context (e.g., how a building is interpreted by critics, users, and historians).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. 2000. ''The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture: Experience, Interpretation, Comparison'', p.263;''Volume Two: Hermeneutical Calisthenics: A Morphology of Ritual-Architectural Priorities'', Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dalibor Vesely]] situates hermeneutics within a critique of the application of overly scientific thinking to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Vesely, D. 2004. ''Architecture in the Age of Divided Representation: The Question of Creativity in the Shadow of Production'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition fits within a critique of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]&lt;ref&gt;Perez-Gomez, A. 1985. ''Architecture and the Crisis of Modern Science'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and has also informed design-studio teaching. [[Adrian Snodgrass]] sees the study of history and Asian cultures by architects as a hermeneutical encounter with otherness.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', London: Routledge, pp 165–180.&lt;/ref&gt; He also deploys arguments from hermeneutics to explain design as a process of interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A., and Coyne, R. 2006. ''Interpretation in Architecture: Design as a Way of Thinking'', London: Routledge, pp. 29–55&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Richard Coyne]], he extends the argument to the nature of architectural education and design.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, A.B., and Coyne, R.D. 1992. "Models, Metaphors and the Hermeneutics of Designing." ''Design Issues'', 9(1): 56 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
[[Environmental hermeneutics]] applies hermeneutics to environmental issues conceived broadly to subjects including "[[nature]]" and "[[wilderness]]" (both terms are matters of hermeneutical contention), landscapes, ecosystems, built environments (where it overlaps architectural hermeneutics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugerauer|first=Robert|title=Interpreting Environments|year=1995|publisher=University of Texas Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mugerauer|first=Robert|title=Interpretations on Behalf of Place|year=1994|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; ), inter-species relationships, the relationship of the body to the world, and more.

===International relations===
Insofar as hermeneutics is a basis of both [[critical theory]] and [[constitutive theory]] (both of which have made important inroads into the [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] branch of [[international relations theory]] and [[political science]]), it has been applied to international relations.

[[Steve Smith (academic)|Steve Smith]] refers to hermeneutics as the principal way of grounding a [[Foundationalism (international relations)|foundationalist]] yet postpositivist theory of international relations.

Radical [[postmodernism]] is an example of a postpositivist yet [[Anti-foundationalism (international relations)|anti-foundationalist]] [[paradigm]] of international relations.

===Law===
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
Some scholars argue that law and theology are particular forms of hermeneutics because of their need to interpret legal tradition or scriptural texts. Moreover, the problem of interpretation has been central to [[Law#Legal theory|legal theory]] since at least the 11th&amp;nbsp;century.

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Italian Renaissance]], the schools of ''[[glossator]]es'', ''commentatores'', and ''usus modernus'' distinguished themselves by their approach to the interpretation of "laws" (mainly [[Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]). The [[University of Bologna]] gave birth to a "legal Renaissance" in the 11th&amp;nbsp;century, when the Corpus Juris Civilis was rediscovered and systematically studied by men such as [[Irnerius]] and [[Decretum Gratiani#Author|Johannes Gratian]]. It was an interpretative Renaissance. Subsequently, these were fully developed by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Alberico Gentili]].

Since then, interpretation has always been at the center of legal thought. [[Friedrich Carl von Savigny]] and [[Emilio Betti]], among others, made significant contributions to general hermeneutics. [[Interpretivism (legal)|Legal interpretivism]], most famously [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s, may be seen as a branch of philosophical hermeneutics.

===Political philosophy===
Italian philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]'', when discussing contemporary capitalist regimes, stated that, "A politics of descriptions does not impose power in order to dominate as a philosophy; rather, it is functional for the continued existence of a society of dominion, which pursues truth in the form of imposition (violence), conservation (realism), and triumph (history)."&lt;ref&gt;Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala. ''Hermeneutic Communism: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vattimo and Zabala also stated that they view [[Epistemological anarchism|interpretation as anarchy]] and affirmed that "existence is interpretation" and that "hermeneutics is weak thought."

=== Psychoanalysis ===
{{see also|Freud and Philosophy}}
Psychoanalysts have made ample use of hermeneutics since [[Sigmund Freud]] first gave birth to their discipline. In 1900 Freud wrote that the title he chose for ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' 'makes plain which of the traditional approaches to the problem of dreams I am inclined to follow...[''i.e.''] "interpreting" a dream implies assigning a "meaning" to it.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Interpretation of Dreams|last=Freud|first=Sigmund|publisher=The Hogarth Press|year=1900|isbn=|volume=Standard Edition, Vols. IV and V|location=London|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] later extended Freudian hermeneutics into other psychical realms. His early work from the 1930s–50s is particularly influenced by Heidegger, and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]'s hermeneutical phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.swingtradesystems.com/lacan/lacan-and-meaning-p51.html|title=Lacan and Meaning: Sexuation, Discourse Theory, and Topology in the Age of Hermeneutics.|last=Urban|first=William J.|publisher=|year=2015|isbn=978-1530345502|location=New York|pages=51–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Postcognitivism}}

[[Psychology|Psychologists]] and [[Computer science|computer scientists]] have recently become interested in hermeneutics, especially as an alternative to [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]].

[[Hubert Dreyfus]]'s critique of conventional [[artificial intelligence]] has been influential among psychologists who are interested in hermeneutic approaches to meaning and interpretation, as discussed by philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] (cf. [[Embodied cognition]]) and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (cf. [[Discursive psychology]]).

Hermeneutics is also influential in [[humanistic psychology]].&lt;ref name=Rennie&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Hermeneutics and Humanistic Psychology|author= David L. Rennie |journal = The Humanistic Psychologist |year=2007 |volume=35|issue=1 |url= http://www.apa.org/divisions/div32/pdfs/hermeneutics.pdf|accessdate= 2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and theology===
{{See also|Exegesis|Biblical hermeneutics|Talmudical hermeneutics|Quranic hermeneutics}}
The understanding of a [[Theology|theological]] [[Literature|text]] depends upon the reader's particular hermeneutical viewpoint. Some theorists, such as [[Paul Ricœur]], have applied modern philosophical hermeneutics to theological texts (in Ricœur's case, the Bible).

[[Mircea Eliade]], as a hermeneutist, understands religion as 'experience of the sacred', and interprets the sacred in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian scholar underlines that the relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, having interpreted the profane as a [[hierophany]].&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2002), ''Introducere în hermeneutică'' (''Introduction to Hermeneutics''), Brașov: Orientul latin, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The hermeneutics of the myth is a part of the hermeneutics of religion. Myth should not be interpreted as an illusion or a lie, because there is truth in myth to be rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2007), ''The Hermeneutics of the Myth'', in ''Lumină lină'', number 3, New York, pages 33-49. {{ISSN|1086-2366}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Myth is interpreted by Mircea Eliade as 'sacred history'. He introduces the concept of 'total hermeneutics'.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1978), ''La nostalgie des origines. Méthodologie et histoire des religions'', Paris: Editions Gallimard, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safety science===
In the field of [[safety science]], and especially in the study of [[human reliability]], scientists have become increasingly interested in hermeneutic approaches.

It has been proposed by [[Human factors and ergonomics|ergonomist]] Donald Taylor that [[Mechanical philosophy|mechanist]] models of human behaviour will only take us so far in terms of accident reduction, and that safety science must look at the meaning of accidents for human beings.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1080/00140138108924870|title= The hermeneutics of accidents and safety|author= Donald Taylor |journal = Ergonomics |year=1981 | volume=24 |issue=6| pages=487–495 |url= http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/678312573-78650925/content~content=a775985337~db=all~order=page|accessdate= 2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars in the field have attempted to create safety [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] that make use of hermeneutic concepts in terms of their categorisation of [[qualitative data]].&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1177/0018726703056005004|title= Applied Hermeneutics and Qualitative Safety Data|author= Wallace,B., Ross, A., &amp; Davies, J.B. |journal = Human Relations |year=2003| volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=587–607 |url= http://hum.sagepub.com/content/56/5/587.abstract=page|accessdate= 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
In [[sociology]], hermeneutics is the interpretation and understanding of social events through analysis of their meanings for the human participants in the events. It enjoyed prominence during the 1960s and 1970s, and differs from other interpretive schools of sociology in that it emphasizes the importance of both context&lt;ref&gt;Willis, W. J., &amp; Jost, M. (2007). Foundations of qualitative research; Interpretive and critical approaches. London: Sage. Page 106&lt;/ref&gt; and form within any given social behaviour.

The central principle of sociological hermeneutics is that it is only possible to know the meaning of an act or statement within the context of the discourse or [[world view]] from which it originates. Context is critical to comprehension; an action or event that carries substantial weight to one person or culture may be viewed as meaningless or entirely different to another. For example, giving the "thumbs-up" gesture is widely accepted as a sign of a job well done in the United States, while other cultures view it as an insult.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacada.ksu.edu/Resources/Clearinghouse/View-Articles/body-speaks.aspx Kris Rugsaken, "Body Speaks: Body language around the world"]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, putting a piece of paper into a box might be considered a meaningless act unless it is put into the context of democratic elections (the act of putting a [[Ballot|ballot paper]] into a box).

[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], widely regarded as the father of sociological hermeneutics believed that, in order for an interpreter to understand the work of another author, they must familiarize themselves with the historical context in which the author published their thoughts. His work led to the inspiration of Heidegger's "[[hermeneutic circle]]" a frequently referenced model that claims one's understanding of individual parts of a text is based on their understanding of the whole text, while the understanding of the whole text is dependent on the understanding of each individual part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schleiermacher/#4 |title= Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher |last= Forster |first= Michael |publisher= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermeneutics in sociology was also heavily influenced by German philosopher [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Pressler, Fabio B. Dasilva, ''Sociology and Interpretation: From Weber to Habermas'', SUNY Press, 1996, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Jürgen Habermas]] criticizes [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] hermeneutics as being unsuitable for understanding society because it is unable to account for questions of social reality, like labor and domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendelson|first=Jack|date=1979-01-01|title=The Habermas-Gadamer Debate|jstor=487850|journal=New German Critique|issue=18|pages=44–73|doi=10.2307/487850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Hans Hermann-Hoppe]], both economists of the [[Austrian school]], have criticized the hermeneutical approach to economics.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. 1989. "The Hermeneutical Invasion of Philosophy and Economics", in ''Economic Controversies'', pp. 119-136.

'''''Hitchcock/Truffaut''''' is a 1966 book by [[François Truffaut]] about [[Alfred Hitchcock]], originally released in French as '''''Le Cinéma selon Alfred Hitchcock'''''.&lt;ref name="Truffaut"&gt;{{cite book|work=[[Google Books]]|authorlink=François Truffaut|title=Hitchcock/Truffaut|author=Truffaut, François|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnE_sPb3XBQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=1983|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First published by [[Éditions Robert Laffont]], it is based on a 1962 exchange between Hitchcock and Truffaut, in which the two directors spent a week in a room at Universal Studios talking about movies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9325">{{Art of Italy}}
From the second half of the 18th century through the 19th century, Italy went through a great deal of socio-economic changes, several foreign invasions and the turbulent [[Risorgimento]], which resulted in the [[Italian unification]] in 1861. Thus, Italian art went through a series of minor and major changes in style.

The '''Italian Neoclassicism''' was the earliest manifestation of the general period known as [[Neoclassicism]] and lasted more than the other national variants of neoclassicism. It developed in opposition to the [[Baroque]] style around c.1750 and lasted until c.1850. Neoclassicism began around the period of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and spead all over Europe as a generation of art students returned to their countries from the [[Grand Tour]] in Italy with rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. It first centred in Rome where artists such as [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Jacques-Louis David]] were active in the second half of the 18th century, before moving to Paris. Painters of [[Vedute]], like [[Canaletto]] and [[Giovanni Paolo Panini]], also enjoyed a huge success during the Grand Tour. [[Neoclassical architecture]] was inspired by the Renaissance works of [[Palladio]] and saw in [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] and [[Filippo Juvarra]] the main interpreters of the style.

Classicist literature had a great impact on the [[Risorgimento]] movement: the main figures of the period include [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Giuseppe Parini]], [[Vincenzo Monti]] and [[Ugo Foscolo]], [[Giacomo Leopardi]] and [[Alessandro Manzoni]] (nephew of [[Cesare Beccaria]]), who were also influenced by the [[French Enlightenment]] and [[German Romanticism]]. The [[virtuoso]] violinist [[Paganini]] and the operas of [[Rossini]], [[Donnizetti]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]] and, later, [[Verdi]] dominated the scene in Italian classical and romantic music.

The art of [[Francesco Hayez]] and especially that of the [[Macchiaioli]] represented a break with the classical school, which came to an end as Italy unified (see [[Italian modern and contemporary art]]). Neoclassicism was the last Italian-born style, after the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]], to spread to all Western Art.

==History and influences==
Just like in other parts of [[Europe]], Italian Neoclassical art was mainly based on the principles of [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] art and architecture, but also by the Italian [[Renaissance architecture]] and its basics, such as in the [[Villa Capra "La Rotonda"]]. Classicism and Neoclassicism in Italian art and architecture developed during the [[Italian Renaissance]], notably in the writings and designs of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and the work of [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]. It places emphasis on [[symmetry]], [[Principles of art#Proportion|proportion]], geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the  architecture of Classical antiquity and in particular, the architecture of [[Roman Architecture|Ancient Rome]], of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of [[column]]s, [[pilaster]]s and [[lintel]]s, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical [[dome]]s, [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s and [[aedicule]]s replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of [[Gothic architecture|medieval]] buildings. This style quickly spread to other Italian cities and later to the rest of continental Europe.

In the [[visual art]]s the European movement called "neoclassicism" began in Italy around 1750 in [[Rome]],&lt;ref name="cartage.org.lb"&gt;http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/arts/scultpurePlastic/SculptureHistory/NeoclassicisminSculpture/ItalianNeoclassicism/ItalianNeoclassicism/ItalianNeoclassicism.htm&lt;/ref&gt; as a reaction against both the surviving [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] styles, and as a desire to return to the perceived "purity" of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the more vague perception ("ideal") of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] arts, and, to a lesser extent, 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]].
Indoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], which had started in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]].''

[[Napoleon Bonaparte]], who ruled most of Italy in the early 19th century hired [[Antonio Canova]], one of the most influential Italian neoclassical sculptors and plastic artists to make sculptures for him, one of the most famous being that of [[Venus Victrix]], an allegory of [[Pauline Bonaparte]].&lt;ref name="cartage.org.lb"/&gt;

Italy also developed several other artistic movements in the 19th century, like the [[Macchiaioli]], who influenced French [[impressionism]]. The city of [[Milan]] later emerged as a major centre of 19th-century Romantic art.  The city became a major European artistic centre during the [[Romantic period]], when Milanese Romantic was influenced by the [[Austria]]ns, who ruled Milan at the time. Probably the most notable of all Romantic works of art held in Milan is "''[[The Kiss (Hayez painting)|The Kiss]]''", by [[Francesco Hayez]], which is held in the [[Brera Academy]].&lt;ref name="aboutmilan.com"&gt;http://www.aboutmilan.com/art-and-culture-of-milan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent artistic movements==

===I Macchiaioli===
[[Image:Haystacks painting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Hay Stacks'' by [[Giovanni Fattori]], a leading artist in the Macchiaioli movement.]]
The [[Macchiaioli]] were a group of  [[Italy|Italian]] [[artist|painters]] from [[Tuscany]], active in the second half of the  19th century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, painted outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. The Macchiaioli were forerunners of the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s who, beginning in the 1860s, would pursue similar aims in [[France]]. The most notable artists of this movement were [[Giovanni Fattori]], [[Silvestro Lega]] and [[Telemaco Signorini]].

The movement grew from a small group of artists, many of whom had been revolutionaries in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Italian states|uprisings of 1848]].  The artists met at the [[Caffè Michelangiolo]] in Florence throughout the 1850s to discuss art and politics. These idealistic young men, dissatisfied with the art of the academies, shared a wish to reinvigorate Italian art by emulating the bold tonal structure they admired in such old masters as [[Rembrandt]], [[Caravaggio]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Broude3&gt;Broude, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; They also found inspiration in the paintings of their French contemporaries of the [[Barbizon school]].

They believed that areas of light and shadow, or "[[:wikt:macchia|macchie]]" (literally patches or spots) were the chief components of a work of art. The word macchia was commonly used by Italian artists and critics in the 19th century to describe the sparkling quality of a drawing or painting, whether due to a sketchy and spontaneous execution or to the harmonious breadth of its overall effect.

A hostile review published on November 3, 1862 in the journal ''[[Gazzetta del Popolo]]'' marks the first appearance in print of the term Macchiaioli.&lt;ref name=Broude96&gt;Broude, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The term carried several connotations: it mockingly implied that the artists' finished works were no more than sketches, and recalled the phrase  "darsi alla macchia", meaning, idiomatically, to hide in the bushes or scrubland. The artists did, in fact, paint much of their work in these wild areas. This sense of the name also identified the artists with outlaws, reflecting the [[tradition]]alists' view that new school of artists was working outside the rules of art, according to the strict laws defining artistic expression at the time.

In its early years the new movement was ridiculed. Many of its artists died in penury, only achieving fame towards the end of the 19th century. Today the work of the Macchiaioli is much better known in Italy than elsewhere; much of the work is held, outside the public record, in private collections there.

[[Image:Sernesi Pratone alle Cascine.jpg|thumb|A Macchiaioli painting of a meadow.]]

===Purismo===
[[Purismo]] was an [[Italy|Italian]] cultural movement which began in the 1820s. The group intended to restore and preserve language through the study of medieval authors, and such study extended to the visual arts.

Inspired by the [[Nazarene movement|Nazarenes]] from Germany, the artists of Purismo reject [[Neoclassicism]] and emulated the works of [[Raphael]], [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] and [[Fra Angelico]].

The group's ideals were iterated in their manifesto ''Del purismo nelle arti'', in 1842–43 which was written by [[Antonio Bianchini]] and co-signed by [[Tommaso Minardi]] (1787–1871), the major proponent of Purismo, Nazarene co-founder [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck|Friedrich Overbeck]] and [[Pietro Tenerani]].

'''Kurt Walter Bachstitz''' (4 October 1882 – 1949 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[art dealer]]. He died shortly before his naturalization to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="libmma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Bachstitz_records_b18041048.pdf|title=Bachstitz, Inc. records, 1923-1937|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.2|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==

===Until Emigration 1938===
Bachstitz was born as the child of the Jewish couple Liber Jacob Bachstitz and Mathilde Markowitz. His place of birth is arguable. All contemporary sources mention the formerly German [[Breslau]] (the present-day Polish [[Wrocław]]) as his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189; Central Bureau for Genealogy, The Hague, Calmery archive, Bachstitz file&lt;/ref&gt; But Bachstitz requested for himself the Austrian village Raipoltenbach as his place of birth when he claimed at the U.S. Department of Labor for an extension of his temporary stay in 1931.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt; He studied architecture in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Vienna]] where he finished his studies with a diploma. On the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was called up for military service and served between 1914 and 1918 as an officer, lastly in the rank of a troop captain. He served actively in the field until 1916, when he was severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elfriede Pesé (died in 1918) with whom he had two children – a son Walter Werner Michael who died in 1943 by tuberculosis in [[Switzerland]] and a daughter, Margit Martha&lt;ref&gt;File RC 1.78, estate inventory (via Ministry of Finance, inheritance tax returns)&lt;/ref&gt; who died in [[South Africa]] in 1982. On 19 December 1918 he married his second wife Elisa ("Lilly") Emma Hofer. Lilly was a [[Protestant]]. Because of her Bachstitz converted to the evangelic faith.&lt;ref&gt;NA, SNK 178, Bachstitz file, draft letter from Bogisch to Weyma, undated&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he apparently lived and traded in Munich. In his diary [[Thomas Mann]] wrote about a meeting in Bachstitz' Munich apartment, where Mann bought a work from Bachstitz. He described him quite prerogatively as a "blond-Jewish" example of an "international culture-capitalistic profiteer".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann Tagebücher, 1918–1921, herausgegeben von Peter de Mendelssohn, Frankfurt/M. 1979, {{ISBN|978-3-10-048192-4}}, S. 143 – 145 '"Der Mensch, blond-jüdisch und elegant, Mitte dreißig, mit Monokel und fetten, weißen, manikürten Händen, in gesteppter Hausjacke und Lackhausschuhen, wunderbar als Typus des international-kultur-kapitalistischen Schiebertums."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he established an art dealership in the Hague named Kunsthandel K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Gallery N.V.). Surinamestraat 11, He lived in Vienna and in [[Berlin]] and he created an internationally known company with art galleries in The Hague, [[New York City]] and Berlin. Lilly was the sister of art dealer [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]] who had managed the Gallery in The Hague for a while and subsequently became an art buyer for [[Hermann Göring]].

In 1937 Bachstitz waived his Austrian citizenship. In 1938 the couple moved to The Hague.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;

===World War II===

Between the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 and 1941 Bachstitz sold a number of paintings to the "[[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sondernauftrag Linz]]" that was run by [[Hitler]]'s Special Representative of the planned '[[Führermuseum]]' in Linz,&lt;ref&gt;Looted Art Commission.

Among the works sold to the Sonderauftrag were the following:

In February 1941 Bachstitz officially resigned as supervisory director of the Bachstitz Gallery and his wife became the managing director. Together with his wife, he continued to provide a clandestine management role. In this way, they avoided having the Gallery placed under the forced administration for the duration of the war. According to the documents in the file concerning his successful application to become a Dutchman after the war&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, ministerie van justitie (1915–1955), inv. No. 13533 (1646)&lt;/ref&gt; the couple provided undercover protection for Jews trying to escape the authorities.

In 1942 Bachstitz was summoned by the occupation authority (the "Wirtschaftsamt") as he had failed to register the gallery as "non-Aryan property". Proceedings were commenced against him and he was arrested by the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in July 1943 and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague. Due to an intervention of Göring initiated by Bachstitz' brother-in-law Hofer, he was released from prison. He was then also exempted from wearing the Star of David. Furthermore, the couple had their marriage dissolved in September 1943 to prevent the confiscation of the gallery by the occupying authority.

Between 1942 und 1944 Bachstitz sold a number of works to the museums that were run by [[Kurt Martin]], the head of the Museums of the Upper Rhine (Alsace and Baden) under [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/SucheMeldungDetail.html?resourceId=4348&amp;input_=4340&amp;pageLocale=de&amp;person=&amp;titelbesch=&amp;datierung=&amp;objektart=-1&amp;objektart.GROUP=1&amp;mattech=&amp;provsamml=kurt+martin&amp;institution=&amp;ort=&amp;id=&amp;type=DetailVerlust&amp;type.GROUP=1&amp;suche_typ=MeldungDetail&amp;suche_typ.HASH=01c6e21bb090266af660&amp;suchen=Suchen  10 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Bachstitz managed to obtain permission to leave the Netherlands and he emigrated to Switzerland, again with the help of Andreas Hofer.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.6|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a bribe for the exit visa Bachstitz had to hand over art to Hermann Göring, namely a painting with the Samson and Delilah motive by [[Jan Steen]],&lt;ref&gt;US-NARA, RG 260, M1946. Roll 127. Restitution Research Records. Göring, Hermann: Notes on Purchases. Page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well two antique necklaces.&lt;ref name="lootedart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/aliu-long_print;Y|title=Post-War Reports: Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|publisher=lootedart.com|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After The War - Successful and Unsuccessful Restitution Efforts===

After the war the Allies returned most of the art that the gallery had sold to German authorities to the Netherlands. The Netherlands restituted the painting by Jan Steen&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK), 2.08.42.&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected an application for the restitution of the other works. They became part of the Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK). Kurt Walter Bachsitz and Lilly Bachstitz-Hofer were again registered as officially married. Kurt Walter Bachstitz died in 1949. In 1951 his widow liquidated the Bachstitz Gallery N.V. with a high deficit.&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA 2.09.16, Nederlands Beheers Instituut NBI, inv.no. 2168, Note Kesselaar NBI 16 December 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery's art library was auctioned off.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/artlibrary00inte|title=Art library of the late K.W.

In 2009 the Dutch government restituted the painting "Roman Capriccio" by [[Pietro Capelli]] from the stock of the SNK to Kurt Walter Bachstitz' grandchildren.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.18|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Restitution Committee of the Netherlands denied though a restitution claim concerning a number of other works, among them the works sold to Hitler (Sonderauftrag Linz). In view of most of these works the Committee argued that these sales had not been made under duress because Kurt Walter Bachstitz had been left "undisturbed" in 1940 and 1941.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.5|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grandchildren applied in 2013 for the re-opening of the case in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Act RC 4.138&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the Prussian Heritage Foundation restituted a Tyrolean gothic wall-mounted writing slate (c. 1500) and a large 16th-century Italian bronze mortar.&lt;ref name="preussischer-kulturbesitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussischer-kulturbesitz.de/pressemitteilung/news/2013/07/09/berliner-kunstgewerbemuseum-restituiert-zwei-werke-an-die-erben-des-kunsthaendlers-bachstitz.html|title=Berliner Kunstgewerbemuseum restituiert zwei Werke an die Erben des Kunsthändlers Bachstitz - Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz|publisher=preussischer-kulturbesitz.de|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7181">There have been 39 '''''[[FoxTrot]]'' books''' published so far, all by [[Andrews McMeel Publishing, LLC|Andrews McMeel Publishing]]. Of the 39 books, 27 are collections and 12 are anthologies. The anthologies are composed of the two or three previous collections, and include Sunday strips in color.

==Collections==
Beginning with ''Death by Field Trip'', the size and shape of the regular collections changed to accommodate a new Sunday strip layout. The books also became shorter (and much cheaper) to create a larger gap between [[anthology|anthologies]].

* With ''You Only Live Twice'' and ''Licence to Kill'' being notable  see, James Bond is almost always seen at the HQ of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] (referred to as MI7 in ''Dr. No'') in [[central London|central]] [[London in film|London]]. This has been the actual headquarters of MI6: the [[SIS building|Vauxhall Cross]] building on the [[Thames]] from ''GoldenEye'' (1995) onwards. Prior to that it was a nondescript building near [[Whitehall]], sometimes (''Dr. No'', ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', ''The Living Daylights'') ostensibly the HQ of [[Universal Exports]], the Secret Service's front company.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22856">A '''literature circle''' is equivalent of an adult [[Book discussion club|book club]], but with greater structure, expectation and rigor. The aim is to encourage thoughtful discussion and a love of reading in young people.  The true intent of literature circles is "to allow students to practice and develop the skills and strategies of good readers" (DaLie, 2001).

==Background of literature circles==
Literature circles were first implemented in 1982 by Karen Smith, an elementary school teacher in Phoenix, Arizona.  Handed a box of odd-and-end novels by a fellow teacher, Karen took them and promptly forgot about them.  Later that year, some of her fifth grade students expressed an interest in reading them, organized themselves loosely into groups, and started to discuss the novels.  Smith was surprised at the degree of their engagement with the books and the complexity of their discussions, they had no outside help or instruction from their teacher (Daniels, 1994). From here literature circles evolved into reading, study and discussion groups based around different groupings of students reading a variety of different novels.  They differ from traditional English instruction where students in classroom all read one “core” novel, often looking to the teacher for the answers and the meaning and literary analysis of the text.  They highlight discussion, student response, free choice, and collaboration, "providing a way for students to engage in critical thinking and reflection" ([http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center] Schlick Noe, 2004).  Well-run literature circles highlight student choice; occur over an extended period of time as part of a [[Balanced Literacy]] program; involve numerous structured and unstructured opportunities for student response and interpretation; and incorporate assessment and evaluation that includes self-assessment and numerous extension projects.  Research on literature circles is conducted primarily by [[Harvey Daniels]] (1994, 2002, 2004), [[Katherine L. Schlick Noe]] (1995, 1999, 2001, 2003), Bonnie Campbell Hill (1995, 2001, 2003), and Nancy J. Johnson (1995, 1999, 2001);  they are credited with most of the research and teacher resources around this approach to student choice and reading; however, numerous other researchers, including Kathy Short and Kathryn Mitchell Pierce (1990), Jerome Harste, Kathy Short and Carolyn Burke (1988), Katherine Samway (1991), Suzi Keegan and Karen Shrake (1991)  have conducted research and classroom-based studies.  This approach to reading and learning looks to some of the best practices and theory from [[collaborative learning]] and [[scaffolding theory]].  [[Reader-response criticism]], [[independent reading]], and [[student-centered learning]]  comprise most of the theoretical underpinning of literature circles.

Literature circles combine the best practices of collaborative learning and student-directed learning.  They are not to be confused with [[book discussion club]]s, currently popular in some circles.  While both book clubs and literature circles focus on discussion of books in small group settings, book clubs have a more loosely structured agenda for discussions and are not usually tied into literary analysis such as thematic or symbolic analysis.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  Furthermore, literature circles are the domain of the classroom, both at the elementary and secondary level, and involve various types of [[Educational assessment|assessment]] (including [[self-assessment]], observations and conferences) and [[evaluation]] ([[Career portfolio|portfolios]], projects and student artifacts) by both the teacher and the student. Literature circles are a pedagogically sound alternative to teacher-centered discourse.{{cn|date=April 2014}}  They can be used at all grade and ability levels, and are often credited{{who|date=April 2014}} with instilling a love of reading and discussion in students.  Furthermore, current research indicates that peer collaboration has a positive effect on student learning and performance in Language Arts (Fall ''et al''., 2000), increases student learning, and also improves reading comprehension and content-knowledge (Klinger, Vaugn and Schumm, 1998, cited in Daniels, 2002).

==Key features of literature circles==
#Children choose their own reading materials.
#Small temporary groups are formed, based on book choice.
#Different groups read different books
#Groups meet on a regular predictable schedule.
#Students use written or drawn notes to guide both their reading and discussion.
#Discussion topics come from the students
#Group meetings aim to be open, natural conversations.  Often the conversations digress to topics relating to the students or loosely to the books, but should eventually return to the novel.
#The teacher serves as a facilitator, observer, listener and often a fellow reader, alongside the students.  The teacher is not an instructor.
#Students are given roles or jobs to complete for each group meeting.
#The teacher should model how students should facilitate each role or job.
#Evaluation is by teacher observation and student self-evaluation and should also include extension projects.
#A spirit of playfulness and fun pervades the room.
#New groups form around new reading choices.
(Daniels, 1994)

Discussion prompts can be given by the teacher to encourage a direction for the students' responses, such as "How does the setting affect the characters?"  "What are alternative solutions to the character's conflicts in the text?" "What connections can you make with regard to the character's situation(s)?"

==Implementation considerations==
Students begin literature circles by participating in mini-lessons on how to participate in a discussion group. To begin with they may be given role sheets to assist them in taking notes on their reading and preparing for the discussion.

Sticky notes (e.g. PostIt notes) are often distributed by teachers to assist students in recording their thoughts about text elements, as they make access easy to various pages in the book.  Clip boards may assist children in using their role sheets when groups use floor space to conduct their discussions. 

As group discussions evolve and improve, ideally the role sheets should eventually be used only for redirecting the discussion when students get off-track.  In fact, Daniels notes that "the goal of role sheets is to make the role sheets obsolete" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  What he means by this is that role sheets help students stay on task and focus their discussions.  As students become more comfortable in their groups and learn the level of discourse and response that is expected of them, ideally they will no longer need the role sheets at all: "In many classrooms, the role sheets are abandoned as soon as groups are capable of lively, text-centered, multifaceted discussions" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;75).  Schlick Noe and Johnson note that role sheets take focus and energy away from group discussions:  "Students can learn collaborative and individual accountability strategies to make their discussions work without the constraints of role sheets" (Schlick Noe and Johnson, 1999, cited from [http://www.litcircles.org/Discussion/discussion.html Literature Circles Resource Center)] Most teachers starting out may, however, wish to assign roles to students to help them learn some of the structures of Literature Circles and to aid in classroom management.

==Roles in literature circles==
The following is a list of roles which give a thinking task to each group member.  Students divide the tasks among themselves in each group.  As the groups reconvene each session, students switch roles, so that by the end of the literature circles "unit," each student will have the opportunity to participate in each role.  Again, the ideal is to eventually do away with the roles, although many teachers opt to continue using the roles to assist group on-task behaviour.  One thing to keep in mind:  Readers who are deeply engaged with a book and eager to talk about it with others may not need the structure of roles.  Many teachers discover that the roles feel restrictive to some students and can become a disincentive to take part in literature circles.  Harvey Daniels always intended roles to be a temporary scaffold to support students as they learn to talk about books in small groups.

===Discussion facilitator===
This role involves developing a list of questions that the group might discuss about the section of the novel to be discussed for that meeting.  Questions should be designed to promote lively conversation and insights about the book; they should be [[open questions]].   A person with this task asks these questions of the group to prompt discussion; overall, the job is to keep the group talking and on-task.  Questions that a student might ask could be:  "What was going through your mind when you read this passage?" or "How did the main character change as a result of this incident?"{{sfrac|
|}}{{frac|{{frac|{{mvar|{{math|}}}}|}}|}}

===Commentator===

This role involves locating a few significant passages of text that are thought-provoking, funny, interesting, disturbing, or powerful.  The quotations are copied down with properly cited page numbers.  A student with this task can read the passages out loud him/herself or ask other group members to read as well.  Commentary and discussion will be generated from these passages.
and also draw a part of the scene that locates where the person took place

===Illustrator===

As the term implies, this job entails drawing, sketching, or painting a picture, portrait or scene relating to the appropriate section of the novel.  Collages from magazines, images from the internet, and other media can also be used.  The student with this role then shares the artwork with the group, explaining the passage(s) that relate to the art.  Often students who do not like to write do very well with this role.  The pictures usually generate interesting group conversations.

===Connector or Reflector===

This role involves locating several significant passages in the novel and connecting these passages to real life.  The connections might relate to school, friends or family, home, the community, or they might relate to movies, celebrities, the media etc.  Students should also feel free to connect incidents or characters with other books that they have read.  Of all the roles, this role is often the most personal in its focus.

===Summarizer===

This role involves preparing a brief summary of the reading that was assigned for that day's meeting.  The summary should include the main ideas or events to remember, major characters, symbols or other significant highlights of the passage.  Good summarizers are important to literature circles, as they can help their peers see the overall picture (DaLie, 2001). Also include important events and details.

===Vocabulary Enricher===

Also called the Word Master or Word Wizard, this role is to record important words for that day's reading.  Words that are unusual, unknown, or that stand out in some way are usually chosen by the student.  Their page number and definition is also recorded.  Often students do not see this role as particularly stimulating; however, it can be a role suited to students who are still developing confidence in English classes or textual analysis.

===Travel Tracer===

This role involves recording where the major shifts in action or location take place in the novel for the reading section.  Keeping track of shifts in place, time, and characters helps students keep track of important shifts in the novel.  Artistic students also are drawn to this role, as artwork can be incorporated into this role as well.  The student's role is to describe each setting in detail, using words or maps that illustrate the action.

===Investigator===

This role includes investigative work where background information needs to be found on any topic relating to the book.  Historical, geographical, cultural, musical or other information that would help readers connect to the novel is often researched and shared with the group.  The research is informal in nature, providing small bits of information in order that others can better understand the novel.

===Figurative Language Finder===

This role includes identification of various types of figurative language, including but not limited to simile, metaphor, personification, hyperbole, and idiom.  This may lead to discussion about the author's craft - why the author chose to use those particular words or phrases, and whether or not they were effective.  This in-context identification can be more relevant and memorable than isolated instruction by the teacher of these types of tools.

==Assessment and evaluation of literature circles==
Most teachers assess and evaluate what students do in Literature Circles. This may involve one or several of the following assessment(s) and evaluation(s):
*'''[[Self-Assessment]]'''
**Students should be involved in monitoring and recording their own level of response and engagement with their book and participation with their group as they meet each session. Often formal checklists are used for students to keep track of their progress.
*'''[[Peer group|Peer Assessment]]'''
**Students can also be empowered to assess their fellow group members over the course of their book talks.  As with self-assessment, checklists or other rubrics can provide structure.
*'''Observations'''
**On-going teacher observation and active participation in group discussions is critical in assessing student progress both individually and in whole group.  Daniels (1994) notes that most assessment should be formative, ensuring that students are provided with timely feedback to learn more effectively.  Observations can meet such formative assessment criteria.
*'''Conferences'''
**Face-to-face conversations between student and teacher can help to "access, track and monitor student growth" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;160).
*'''[[Career portfolio|Portfolios]]'''
**Collections of student products, collected and assembled in a meaningful fashion, provide the opportunity for reflection, discussion, response to the book, and displaying a student's best work.  Portfolios can take on many forms, ranging from writing, art, video/audiotapes, learning logs, student journals, personal responses etc. (Daniels, 1994).
*'''Extension Projects'''
**Extension Projects can take the form of numerous creative and artistic student products, from book jackets to visual media or printed forms.  Projects provide readers with "additional ways to revisit what they've read, continue the conversations (and the discoveries), and create even more meaning" (Schlick Noe &amp; Johnson, [http://www.litcircles.org Literature Circles Resource Center)].  More conversations about the books usually arise out of sharing of these projects with the group and the whole class.
*'''Student Artifacts'''
**Response logs, role sheets, and other process material that students have compiled over the course of the Literature Circle meetings can be also evaluated providing "a rich source of insight" (Daniels, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;164) for the teacher to assess growth and progress of students.
*'''Wikis and Blogs'''
**Students may blog on a teacher created website.  This blog will not only facilitate conversation, but implement technology.  The blog will also give teachers a means by which to grade and assess the quality of student comprehension. Blogs enable students to share ideas, read class notes, and give feedback to the class. (Johnson, Andrew,[http://iteslj.org/Techniques/Johnson-Blogs/]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">[[File:Byzantine Constantinople-en.png|thumb|300px|Map of Byzantine Constantinople]]
The '''''Mese''''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|ἡ Μέση [Ὀδός]}}}} ''i Mése [Odós]'', lit. "Middle [Street]") was the main thoroughfare of ancient [[Constantinople]]. The street was the main scene of Byzantine imperial processions. Its ancient course is largely followed by the modern Divanyolu Avenue.

== Description ==
The ''Mese'' started at the [[Milion]] monument, close to the [[Hagia Sophia]], and led straight westwards. It passed the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] and the palaces of [[Palace of Lausus|Lausos]] and [[Palace of Antiochos|Antiochus]], and after ca. 600 meters reached the oval-shaped [[Forum of Constantine]] where one of the city's two [[Byzantine Senate|Senate houses]] stood. This stretch of the street was also known as the '''''Regia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Ῥηγία}}, "Imperial Road"), as it formed the original ceremonial route from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] and the [[Augustaion]] square to the forum of the city's founder.

From there, the street continued to the square [[Forum of Theodosius]] or Forum of the Bull (''Forum Tauri''), as it was also known. In about the middle of this stretch, the great [[esplanade|mall]] known as ''Makros Embolos'' joined the ''Mese''. At their junction stood a ''[[tetrapylon]]'' known as the ''Anemodoulion'' ("Servant of the winds").

Shortly after it passed the Theodosian Forum, the street divided in two branches at the site of the Capitolium: one branch going northwest, passing by the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], towards the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Gate of Polyandrion]], while the other continued southwest, through the [[Forum of the Ox]] (Forum Bovis) and the [[Forum of Arcadius]] towards the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], where it joined the ''[[Via Egnatia]]''.

The ''Mese'' was 25 metres wide and lined with colonnaded [[portico]]es which housed shops. The ''Mese'' was the route followed by imperial processions through the city at least until [[Comneni]]an times. The most characteristic was the triumphal entry of a victorious emperor, who entered the city through the Golden Gate and followed the ''Mese'' to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]], while jubilant crowds lined along the street would greet him and the imperial army back home.

In [[theoretical physics]], '''modular invariance''' is the invariance under the [[group (mathematics)|group]] such as SL(2,Z) of [[large diffeomorphism]]s of the [[torus]]. The name comes from the classical name [[modular group]] of this group, as in [[modular form]] theory.

In [[string theory]], modular invariance is an additional requirement for [[one-loop diagram]]s. This helps in getting rid of some [[global anomaly|global anomalies]] such as the [[gravitational anomaly|gravitational anomalies]].

'''Naziha Mestaoui''' (born 1975) is a Belgian artist trained in architecture, who lives and works in Paris. She has worked both collectively ([[LAb(au)]], Electronic Shadow) and individually, and has received awards in several countries. As an environmental artist and activist, she is best known for ''One Heart, One Tree'' at  the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Conference (COP21)]] in December 2015. The participatory art installation supports [[reforestation]] on several continents.&lt;ref name=Ardia&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ardia|first1=C. A.

== Early life and education ==
Mestaoui was born in 1975 in [[Brussels]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=COAL2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Prix COAL 2014|url=http://www.projetcoal.org/coal/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/CATALOGUE_COAL_280314EDF_ac.pdf|website=COAL|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father comes from Tunisia.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

Mestaoui trained as an architect. She did undergraduate work from 1993–1996 at [[La Cambre]] in Brussels. From 1996 to 1997 she studied at [[Graz University of Technology]] (T.U. Graz), working with [[Thom Mayne]] of [[Morphosis Architects]]. She received a post-graduate diploma ''Architecte DPLG'' (''[[:fr:Architecte diplômé par le gouvernement|Architecte diplômé par le gouvernement]]'') from La Cambre in 1999.&lt;ref name=Luxe/&gt;&lt;ref name=CREDIF&gt;{{cite web|title=Naziha Mestaoui|url=http://tunis.hosting.kvinfo.dk/fr/expert-profile/naziha-mestaoui|website=Who is She in Tunisia – CREDIF|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborative works==

=== LAb(au) ===
Mestaoui was a co-founder of [[LAb(au)]], an artists group in [[Brussels, Belgium]] which explored the impact of advanced technologies on art, from 1997 to 2000.&lt;ref name=ShadowBio/&gt;

=== Electronic Shadow===
Beginning in 2000, Naziha Mestaoui worked with [[Yacine Aït Kaci]] in the duo ''Electronic Shadow'',  pioneering and patenting techniques of videomapping in digital art.&lt;ref name=Duende&gt;{{cite news|title=Electronic Shadow, from 3 minutes² to the Frac Centre|url=http://www.duendepr.com/actualites/2013/11/23/electronic-shadow-de-3-minutes%C2%B2-a-resonances-au-frac-centre/?lang=en|accessdate=24 December 2015|work=Duende|date=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They worked on a wide variety of projects including wearable computers (interactive i-skin) and immersive and interactive environments.&lt;ref name=ShadowBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Naziha Mestaoui (Biography)|url=http://www.electronicshadow.com/biographies/nazihabio.htm|website=Electronic Shadow|accessdate=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In works such as ''Warm and Cold'', (2005) they used tactile sensors and [[Chromism|chromic materials]] to develop [[Haptic technology|haptic user interfaces]] in which people interact with images to control the surrounding space, transforming the boundaries between space and image.&lt;ref name=Baghdady/&gt;

''Electronic Shadow'' has exhibited in galleries including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Manhattan]], the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]], and the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography]].&lt;ref name=Baghdady&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baghdady|first1=Dina Soliman|title=The Use of Interactive Applications in the Design of Public Buildings|date=2013|publisher=Ain Shams University|location=Cairo, Egypt|pages=141–142|url=http://www.cpas-egypt.com/pdf/DinaSoliman/Ms.c/The%20Use%20of%20Interactive%20Applications%20in%20the%20Design%20of%20Public%20Buildings.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[Musée Granet]]&lt;ref name=Figaro&gt;{{cite news|title=Electronic Shadow à Aix-en-Provence|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/art-de-vivre/electronic-shadow-a-aix-en-provence-011210-3521|accessdate=24 December 2015|work=Le Figaro|date=December 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in 2011, their solo exhibit drew more than 35,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=Ardia/&gt; It was the first time that a Beaux-Arts museum had mounted an exhibition of digital artists.&lt;ref name=Figaro/&gt;

They collaborated with choreographer and dancer [[Carolyn Carlson (artist)|Carolyn Carlson]], in the creation of her work  ''Double Vision''  (2006). The work is an hour-long solo dance, to ambient music composed by [[Nicolas de Zorzi]]. In the piece, Carlson wears a huge skirt of [[parachute silk]] that connects her to the stage. It becomes a screen for ''Electronic Shadow'''s light designs. A gigantic mirror above the stage provides a second viewpoint for the transformations happening onstage. The dancer's environment has been described as a "high-tech playground" filled with light and color.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Robert|title='Double Vision': Mirrored modern dance takes on climate change and more|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2010/10/double_visionmirrored_modern_d.html|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=The Star-Ledger|date=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jowitt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Carolyn Carlson—From France to Jersey; Russell Dumas—Up From Oz|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/carolyn-carlsonfrom-france-to-jersey-russell-dumasup-from-oz-7159119|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=The Village Voice|date=October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 4th [[Moscow Biennale|Biennale of Moscow]] in 2011, they worked with the musician 2square (Stephan Haeri of [[Télépopmusik]]) to create the interactive piece ''Chaos Theory''. The work was presented at Galerie Iragui with the support of the French Embassy in Moscow.&lt;ref name=Biennale&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos theory|url=http://4th.moscowbiennale.ru/en/program/special_projects/chaos_theory.html|website=Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their permanent light installation ''Résonances'' was created as an interactive skin for the outside of the [[FRAC Centre]] in [[Orleans, France]], which opened on September 14, 2013.&lt;ref name=Eflux&gt;{{cite news|title=The Turbulences – FRAC Centre|url=http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/opening-with-archilab-2013-naturalizing-architecture/|accessdate=26 December 2015|work=E-flux|date=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As joint winners in the competition, they worked with architects [[Jakob + MacFarlane]] who created the prefabricated tubular structure known as The Turbulences. By placing diodes on the structural lines of the anodised aluminium casing, Mestaoui and Kaci created a real-time "interactive ‘veil of light'" that is responsive to local climate and environmental data.&lt;ref name=Maier&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maier|first1=Florian|title=Les Turbulences – FRAC Centre in Orléans by Jakob + MacFarlane|url=http://www.detail-online.com/article/les-turbulences-frac-centre-in-orleans-by-jakob-macfarlane-16586/|website=Detail Online|date=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DesignBoom&gt;{{cite web|title=FRAC centre opens in new site by jakob + macfarlane|url=http://www.designboom.com/architecture/frac-centre-opens-in-new-site-by-jakob-macfarlane/|website=DesignBoom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Departures&gt;{{cite news|title=France’s New Contemporary Art Museum|url=http://www.departures.com/art-culture/art-design/france%E2%80%99s-new-contemporary-art-museum|accessdate=24 December 2015|work=Departures|date=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent projects ==
More recently{{When|date=December 2015}}, Naziha Mestaoui has worked independently. Her work was featured in a solo exhibition, ''Au-delà de l’invisible'' (''Beyond the invisible''), at Espace Krajcberg in [[Paris]] in 2014. Her works explored the place of humans in the world, both tribal and modern.&lt;ref name=Krajcberg&gt;{{cite news|title=Au delà de l'invisible|url=http://www.semaest.fr/actualites/article/au-dela-de-l-invisible/ |accessdate=26 December 2015|work=Semaest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Espace&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mestaoui|first1=Naziha|title=Au-delà de l’invisible, exposition de Naziha Mestaoui à l’Espace Krajcberg|url=http://www.electronicshadow.org/nm/?p=1820|date=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Echoing Bodies===
The 2014 interactive installation ''Corps en résonance'' (Echoing bodies) generated sound and light displays in crystal bowls filled with water, in response to the movements of visitors. The installation was inspired in part by [[Tibet]]an [[singing bowls]]. As a bowl moves, it vibrates, moving the surface of the water and producing harmonic frequencies that can be both heard and seen.&lt;ref name=Ardia/&gt;

===One heart, One tree===

Naziha Mestaoui's light installation ''One heart, One tree'' was inspired by her experiences traveling among aboriginal peoples in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], [[India]], and [[Oman]]. These include the [[Amahuaca people|Huni Kui]] and [[Asháninka people|Ashaninka]] in [[Peru]] and [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=Ardia/&gt; The project was crowdsourced through [[Kickstarter]], and developed over a four-year period.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Tamsin|title=Faces of Climate Change Naziha Mestaoui, light artist, Tunisia and Belgium|url=http://www.dw.com/en/naziha-mestaoui-light-artist-tunisia-and-belgium/a-18907940|accessdate=24 December 2015|work=Deutsche Welle (DW)|date=December 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early version, entitled ''One Beat One Tree'', was presented at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20) in 2012.&lt;ref name=Ardia/&gt;

The images created as part of ''One heart, One tree'' were  projected onto monuments in Paris during the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|United Nations Climate Conference (COP21)]] in December 2015.

The '''Paper Project''' is a fusion project that blends art, science, and technology into engaging 2D and 3D experiences.

==About the project==

The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning-laser confocal microscope]]. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D [[anaglyphic]] images make use of inexpensive red-blue [[Anaglyph 3D|3D glasses]] first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.

In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama.  The result of the collaboration was ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions'' that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.

Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.

The '''''Perugia Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala di Perugia'') is a painting   by the Italian early Renaissance painter   [[Fra Angelico]], housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] of [[Perugia]], Italy. 

==History==
The painting was executed for the St. Nicholas Chapel in the [[Basilica of San Domenico, Perugia]]. In the early 19th century, it was split and partially dispersed, and some of the predella panels were acquired by the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]]. In Perugia were executed copies of these panels, enclosed into a neo-Gothic frame. The [[polyptych]] also included some small depictions of saints, on the side piers, and two [[Tondo (art)|tondoes]] with the ''Annunciation Angel'' and the ''Annunciation'', in the cusps.

[[File:The Perugia Altarpiece, Side Panel Depicting St. Dominic.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Side panel depicting St. Dominic, by Fra Angelico]]

==Description==

The work includes a large central panel, depicting the ''Madonna Enthroned with Child and Angels'', which was fully painted by Fra Angelico. The two side panels, each forming  two arched sub-panels and including a figure of saint.  On the left are [[St. Dominic]] and [[St. Nicholas of Bari|St. Nicholas]], attributed to Angelico, while on the right are [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]], considered mostly by his workshop. 

The central Madonna is a ''[[Maestà]]'' depiction, and sits on  a large throne painted using [[geometric perspective]]. In front of her is a step with vases housing three white and red roses (symbolizing of the Virgin's purity and a forecast of Christ's Passion, respectively). The panel resembles strictly  that in the [[Cortona Triptych]], especially for the Madonna, the throne's arch and the placement of the angels. The pavement is decorated with marble tarsia, already used by Fra Angelico in earlier works such as the [[San Pietro Martire Triptych]] (1428-1429).

The saint's figures are less monumental than in the later [[Tabernacle of the Lanaioli]] (1433-1435). Behind them is a table, covered by a brocade drape decorated in gold, over which is St. Nicholas' [[mitre]].

The predella panels portray scenes of the ''Life of St. Nicholas''

{{Mary}}
'''Protestant views on Mary''' include the [[theological]] positions of major Protestant representatives such as Martin Luther and John Calvin as well as some modern representatives.  While it is difficult to generalize about the place of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in [[Protestantism]] given the great diversity of Protestant beliefs, some summary statements are attempted.

While reformers such as [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] at different points in their writings had expressed what seem to be examples of a residual [[catholic]] Marian piety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter Tappolet |year=1962 |title=Das Marienlob der Reformatoren |publisher=Tübingen &lt;!--really the location, but no publisher given--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Henry Tavard |year=1996 |title=The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary |publisher=Liturgical Press |pages=103 |isbn=0-8146-5914-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Protestant emphasis on ''[[sola scriptura]]'', ''[[solus Christus]]'', ''[[soli Deo gloria]]'', among others kept the honoring of Mary to a minimum, and Protestant teaching about Mary co-terminous with her short part in scripture and [[creed]]s. A newer Protestant view of Mary emerging out of the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical movement]] sees Mary as a feisty, assertive, and radically Christian woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scot McKnight |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/december/8.26.html |title=The Mary We Never Knew |journal=Christianity Today |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant theologians==
Some early Protestants venerated and honored Mary. [[Martin Luther]] said of Mary:

{{quote|the honor given to the mother of God has been rooted so deeply into the hearts of men that no one wants to hear any opposition to this celebration... We also grant that she should be honored, since we, according to Saint Paul's words [Romans 12] are indebted to show honor one to another for the sake of the One who dwells in us, Jesus Christ. Therefore we have an obligation to honor Mary. But be careful to give her honor that is fitting. Unfortunately, I worry that we give her all too high an honor for she is accorded much more esteem than she should be given or than she accounted to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basely|first1=Joel R.|title=Festival Sermons of Martin Luther|date=2005|publisher=Mark V Publiscations|location=Dearborn, Michigan|isbn=0-9652403-1-2|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfLCU2Nkxa8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA157&amp;|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Calvin]] said, "It cannot be denied that God in choosing and destining Mary to be the Mother of his Son, granted her the highest honor."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Zwingli]] said, "I esteem immensely the Mother of God" and "The more the honor and love of Christ increases among men, so much the esteem and honor given to Mary should grow".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Thus the idea of respect and high honour was not rejected by the first Protestants; but rather it was the matter of degrees of honor given to Mary, as the mother of Jesus, that [[Protestant Reformers]] were concerned with, and therefore the practical implications for [[Mariology]] are still a matter of debate.

===John Wycliffe===
The pre-Lutheran reformer [[John Wycliffe]] reflected the Marian spirit of the [[later Middle Ages]] in one of his earlier sermons: "It seems to me impossible that we should obtain the reward of Heaven without the help of Mary. There is no sex or age, no rank or position, of anyone in the whole human race, which has no need to call for the help of the Holy Virgin."&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Luther===

{{main article|Lutheran Marian theology}}
Despite Luther's polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the [[ecumenical council]]s and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the [[Theotokos]] or [[Mother of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Remigius Bäumer, ''Marienlexikon Gesamtausgabe'', Leo Scheffczyk, ed., (Regensburg: Institutum Marianum, 1994), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Special attention is given to the assertion, that Luther some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the [[Immaculate Conception]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 191&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the [[Assumption of Mary]], he stated that the [[Bible]] did not say anything about it. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 =[[Eric W. Gritsch]] |editor1=H. George Anderson |editor2=J. Francis Stafford |editor3=Joseph A. Burgess |title=The One Mediator, The Saints and Mary, Lutherans and Roman Catholic in Dialogue |volume=VII |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=1992 |pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the "Papists" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating [[saint]]s' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luther's Works'', 47, pp. 45f; see also, ''Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue'' VIII, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===
{{main article|John Calvin's views on Mary}}
John Calvin accepted Mary's perpetual virginity and the title "Mother of God", in a qualified sense. He considered himself the real follower of Mary{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} because he freed her from misuses of these titles and undeserved "Papist" honour which is due only to Jesus Christ, and for returning this honour to him alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Calvin |title=Commentary on John |volume=1 |chapter=On John 2:1-11 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom34.viii.i.html |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin stated that Mary cannot be the advocate of the faithful, since she needs God’s grace as much as any other human being.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Works'', Serm. de la proph. de Christ: op  35, 686.&lt;/ref&gt; If the Catholic Church praises her as Queen of Heaven, it is blasphemous and contradicts her own intention, because she is praised and not God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Calvin |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.ix.html |title=Harmony of the Evangelists |volume=1 |chapter=On Luke 1:46-50 |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin expressed deep concern over its possible "superstitious" use of the title "Mother of God" from the teachings of the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] :&lt;ref&gt;Calvin to the Foreigners’ Church in London, 27 October 1552, in [[George Cornelius Gorham]], [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0bbTMcT6wXFWRHGP&amp;id=esICAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22george+cornelius+gorham%22 ''Gleanings of a few scattered ears, during the period of [[Reformation in England]] and of the times immediately succeeding : A.D. 1533 to A.D. 1588''] (London: Bell and Daldy, 1857), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not doubt that there has been some ignorance in their having reproved this mode of speech, — that the Virgin Mary is the Mother of God … I cannot dissemble that it is found to be a bad practice ordinarily to adopt this title in speaking of this Virgin: and, for my part, I cannot consider such language as good, proper, or suitable… for to say, the Mother of God for the Virgin Mary, can only serve to harden the ignorant in their superstitions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Karl Barth===
{{main article|Karl Barth's views on Mary}}
[[Karl Barth]] (1886–1968), a [[Reformed Protestant]], was a leading 20th century theologian. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the [[Mother of God]]. In his view, through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race; through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God. Barth also agreed with the [[Dogma]] of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. It meant to him that Jesus as a human does not have a father and that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, but it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2, 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary is "full of grace" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. Regarding Mary’s [[virginity]] after birth, Barth argued that the Church adopted this position not because of Mary but in defence of its [[Christology]]. Barth considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and [[idolatry|idolatrous]] heresy.&lt;ref&gt;"Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist" (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 154). "Catholic mariology is a cancer, a sick theological development, and cancers should be cut out" (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 153). "The heresy of the Catholic Church is its mariology and Marian cult." (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in Protestant theology==

===Mother of God===
The designation ''[[Theotokos]]'' (in {{lang-el|Θεοτόκος}}) or "Bearer of God" for Mary emerged in the [[Church of Alexandria]] and was later adopted by the [[patristic]]-era universal Church at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431. It is a statement of [[Christology|Christological]] orthodoxy (See: [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostasis]]) in opposition to [[Nestorianism]] and also a devotional [[Titles of Mary|title of Mary]] used extensively in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgy. The second verse of a well known Protestant hymn, [[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]], is directly addressed to Mary and is based on an Orthodox prayer.

Presently the [[Lutheran World Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.lutheranworld.org/sites/default/files/1993-Lutheran_Orthodox_Dialogue-EN.pdf |title=7th Plenary of the Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission in Sandbjerg, Denmark |chapter=The Ecumenical Councils and Authority in and of the Church |publisher=The Lutheran World Federation |date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepts the teachings of the [[Council of Ephesus]] and other [[ecumenical council]]s of the [[patristic]]-era Church, including the formulation "Mother of God" as a function of Christ's [[hypostatic union]]. Luther says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Luther |title=Selected Writings of Martin Luther |year=2007 |editor=Theodore G. Tappert |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=0-8006-6226-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We too know very well that God did not derive his divinity from Mary; but it does not follow that it is therefore wrong to say that God was born of Mary, that God is Mary’s Son, and that Mary is God’s mother.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mariolatry===

{{Expand section|date=May 2016|small=no}}

In the 18th and 19th centuries various groups of Protestants began to use the term ''Mariolatry'' to refer to the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] practices of [[Marian devotions|Marian veneration and devotion]]. In their view, the attention paid to Mary is extreme, and may not only distract from the worship of [[God in Christianity|God]], but actually borders on [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Christian Church'' by Philip Schaff 1960 {{ISBN|0-8028-8049-5}} pages 411 and 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Keegan, Matthew C. (2011, April 27). Book Review: The Virgin Mary in the Light of the Word of God. ''WordJourney Magazine'', Retrieved from http://www.wordjourney.com&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has taken various directions over time, in that while some Protestants have at times softened their attitude towards it, others have strengthened their opposition in the 21st century. For instance, during the May 2006 celebrations at [[Our Lady of Walsingham]] in England, as [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] held a Marian procession, Protestant [[heckler]]s held banners that condemned [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Masses]], idolatry and "Mariolatry".&lt;ref&gt;''The Everything Jesus Book: His Life, His Teachings'' by Jon Kennedy 2006 {{ISBN|1-59337-712-6}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Walsingham in Literature and Culture from the Middle Ages to Modernity'' by Dominic Janes, Gary Fredric Waller 2010 {{ISBN|0-7546-6924-6}} pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Symphony in C "Roma"''' is the second of [[Georges Bizet]]'s [[symphony|symphonies]].  Unlike his [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|first symphony]], also in C major, which was written quickly at the age of 17, ''Roma'' was written over an eleven-year span, between the ages of 22 and 33 (he died at age 36). Bizet was never fully satisfied with it, subjecting it to a number of revisions, but died before finishing his definitive version.  All four movements were performed in his lifetime, but never all on the same occasion.  The full symphony in its latest revision was premiered in 1875, after his death.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=work|id=c358447|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is perhaps because of Bizet's dissatisfaction that the work is often said to be [[Unfinished symphony|"unfinished"]].  However, in the form in which it exists today, it is a complete work and is fully scored.  It has been recorded a number of times but is not often heard on the concert platform.

==Background==

Bizet won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1857, which required him to spend the following two years studying free of charge at the French Academy in [[Rome]], followed by a year studying in [[Germany]].  He never went to Germany, but stayed in Rome until July 1860.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67351/Georges-Bizet Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than returning to Paris straight away, he did some touring through Italy, seeing places he had not visited in his earlier travels in 1858 and 1859.  In [[Rimini]] he first planned a symphony with each of the four movements dedicated to a different Italian city – Rome (opening movement), [[Venice]] (Andante), [[Florence]] (Scherzo) and [[Naples]] (finale).&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Eric Blom ed., Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954&lt;/ref&gt;  He may have made some early sketches at this time. When he got to Venice he learned that his mother was seriously ill, so he returned home immediately.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

By 1861 he had written the Scherzo, still generally considered the best movement of the work.  It was performed privately in November 1861, and received a public performance on 11&amp;nbsp;January 1863, conducted by [[Jules Pasdeloup]] at the [[Cirque Napoléon]], at which [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] was present.  It was poorly performed and provoked a hostile reaction from many concert subscribers.  Nevertheless, it was given another performance on 18 January at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and this time received a much more positive reaction.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

By 1866 he had written his first version of the complete work, in which the first movement was a Theme and Variations,&lt;ref name=mso/&gt; but he was dissatisfied and set about undertaking a total revision.  In 1868 he revised it yet again.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Three movements of the revised score, minus the Scherzo, were performed on 28 February 1869, under the title ''Fantaisie symphonique: Souvenirs de Rome'', again conducted by Pasdeloup.  The movements were given programmatic titles ''Une chasse dans la Forêt d'Ostie'', ''Une Procession'' and ''Carnaval à Rome''&lt;ref name=mso&gt;[http://www.buywell.com/booklets/4763520.pdf  Program Notes, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326133626/http://www.buywell.com/booklets/4763520.pdf |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (this was the movement meant to depict Naples).  But Bizet was still not happy, and proceeded to revise it once more. By 1871 he seems to have dropped work on his revisions, being focussed on other projects.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;

The full symphony in its latest known version was premiered after his death, in 1875.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; The work was published in 1880 as ''Roma'', and it probably incorporates some of his changes made in 1871.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

==Title==
In form, the work stands somewhere between a symphony and a symphonic suite.  Grove's Dictionary says: "It is not sufficiently explicit for programme music and too carelessly constructed for an abstract symphony".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Despite Bizet's description of it as a "symphony", it has often been classified in reference works as a [[suite (music)|suite]].  In some sources, it is even numbered as "Symphonic Suite No. 3".&lt;ref name=ang&gt;[http://www.mennicken-pr.com/cd/bizet_cd_en.html Ivan Anguélov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714072310/http://www.mennicken-pr.com/cd/bizet_cd_en.html |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another reason for the alternative title is that his earlier symphony was in the same key, C major, and it was believed by some that calling his second symphonic venture a suite would be less confusing.&lt;ref name=ang/&gt;  However, this renaming could only have occurred after 1935 (60 years after Bizet's death), when the very existence of his [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|first symphony]], the Symphony in C, was made known to the world for the first time.

==The work==
''Roma'' is a very unequal work.  The Scherzo is usually singled out as its best movement, full of liveliness and grace. The outer movements contain both brilliance and academic pedantry, and the slow movement is not generally well regarded, sometimes being described as "ponderous and boring".&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  However, [[Gustav Mahler]] thought highly enough of ''Roma'' to conduct the [[Vienna]] premiere in 1898–99, and to expose American audiences to it on his 1910 tour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=186948185&amp;blogId=341789205 Myspace: MY Music] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its actual United States premiere was on 11&amp;nbsp;November 1880 at the Metropolitan Concert Hall, conducted by [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]].  The New York Times critic of the time said that, while there was much in the work to admire, it was crude in arrangement and had an air of incompleteness about it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1880/11/12/archives/amusements-bizets-roma.html New York Times, 12 November 1880]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The four movements of ''Roma'' are:

The '''Royal Army Medical College (RAMC)''' was located on a site south of the [[Tate Gallery]] (now known as Tate Britain) on [[Millbank]], in [[Westminster]], London, overlooking the [[River Thames]]. The college moved from the site in 1999 and the buildings are now occupied by the [[Chelsea College of Arts]].

==History==
[[File:OS Millbank Tate etc 2.jpg|250px|thumb|Ordnance Survey maps of London extract for 1916. This shows clearly the octagonal outline of the former penitentiary surrounding the small site. At the centre is the National Gallery of British Art, afterwards known as the Tate Gallery, and now as [[Tate Britain]], with the college in the south of the site and hospital in the north. Most of the streets remain as at 2012 apart from Bulinga Street, most of which has been built over, and Dundonald Street which has been renamed 'John Islip Street'. There is a 'Census Office' at the rear of the gallery, long since gone.]]

The site, including that of the Tate Gallery (which opened in 1897), was previously occupied by the [[Millbank Prison]] from 1821 to the late 19th century. The college was built by John Henry Townsend and Wilfred Ainslie in Imperial [[Baroque]] style. They also designed the adjoining Regimental Officers’ [[Mess]] and Commandant's House, in [[French Renaissance]] style. The buildings were opened by [[King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] on 15 May 1907. A statue of Sir [[James McGrigor]], the father of army medicine, originally at the [[Royal Hospital, Chelsea]] was moved to the grounds in 1907 and then moved again to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101452265-statue-of-sir-james-robert-mcgrigor-b-g-m-d-at-royal-military-academy-sandhurst-surrey-heath-borough-council-st-michaels-ward#.Wka1l2hl8dU|title=Statue of Sir James Robert McGrigor B. G., M. D. at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|publisher=British listed buildings|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] was built to the north of the Tate Gallery and opened in 1905. [[Cooper Perry|Sir Cooper Perry]] was [[knighted]] in 1903 for helping set up the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35486 |first=H. L. |last=Eason|title=Perry, Sir (Edwin) Cooper (1856–1938)|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|accessdate= 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]] the college was used to prepare vaccines, including a vaccine against [[typhoid]] which was developed at the college. The college also researched into protection against chemical warfare including the development of [[gas masks]] here. In the second World War, the college provided courses in tropical medicine. The college was seriously damaged in 1941 by bombs and the walls of the Tate Gallery nearby still show signs of the damage.&lt;ref name ="45_Millbank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45millbank.com/history-of-45-millbank.html |title=History of 45 Millbank|publisher=|accessdate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around the college including the Tate, former military hospital and other adjacent areas is a conservation area.&lt;ref name = "WCC"&gt;[http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Millbank%20CAA%20SPG.pdf Millbank Conservation Area] – Westminster City Council, January 2005, accessed 6 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The former college buildings are now [[listed buildings|listed]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern Block {{NHLE|num=1066501|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br/&gt;Officers Mess and Commandants House {{NHLE|num=1376570|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;Statue{{NHLE|num=1066502|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;Former barracks (1) {{NHLE|num=1376572|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;Former barracks (2) {{NHLE|num=1376571|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Show, don't tell''' is a technique used in various kinds of texts to allow the reader to experience the story through [[Action (fiction)|action]], words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's [[exposition (narrative)|exposition]], summarization, and [[description]]. It avoids adjectives describing the author's analysis, but instead describes the scene in such a way that the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. The technique applies equally to [[nonfiction]] and all forms of [[fiction]], literature including [[Haiku]]&lt;ref&gt;British Haiku Society- occasional paper 'English Haiku: a Composite View'2002&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Imagism]] poetry in particular, speech, movie making, and playwriting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Wells | year = 1999 | title = How To Write Non-Fiction Books | publisher = Writers' Bookshop | page = 65 | isbn= 1902713028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Warren | year = 2011 | title = Show Don't Tell: A Guide to Purpose Driven Speech | publisher = Jerianne Warren | isbn= 0615498353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Mackendrick, Cronin, Scorsese | year = 2005 | title = On Film-making: An Introduction to the Craft of the Director | publisher = Faber \&amp; Faber | page = xxiii | isbn= 0571211259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hatcher | year = 2000 | title = The Art and Craft of Playwriting | publisher = F+W Media | page = 43 | isbn= 1884910467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is often attributed to Russian playwright [[Anton Chekhov]], reputed to have said "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass." What Chekhov actually said, in a letter to his brother, was "In descriptions of Nature one must seize on small details, grouping them so that when the reader closes his eyes he gets a picture. For instance, you’ll have a moonlit night if you write that on the mill dam a piece of glass from a broken bottle glittered like a bright little star, and that the black shadow of a dog or a wolf rolled past like a ball." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yarmolinsky|first=Avrahm|year=1954|title=The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings Hitherto Untranslated by Anton Chekhov|page=14|publisher=Noonday Press, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between telling and showing was popularized in [[Percy Lubbock]]'s book ''The Craft of Fiction'' (1921), and has been an important element in Anglo-Saxon [[narratology|narratological theory]] ever since.

==Examples==
===Ernest Hemingway===

Nobel Prize–winning novelist [[Ernest Hemingway]] was a notable proponent of the "show, don't tell" style. His [[Iceberg Theory]], also known as the "theory of omission", developed from his background as a newspaper reporter. The term itself originates from his bullfighting treatise, ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0v1GUke_ncMC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=If+a+writer+of+prose+knows+enough+of+what+he+is+writing+about+he+may+omit+things+that+he+knows+and+the+reader,+if+the+writer+is+writing+truly+enough,+will+have+a+feeling+of+those+things+as+strongly+as+though+the+writer+had+stated+them.+The+dignity+of+movement+of+an+iceberg+is+due+to+only+one-eighth+of+it+being+above+water.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-4-Pywc3XAhVEJFAKHaiMAW8QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Hemingway's Theaters of Masculinity|first=Thomas F.|last=Strychacz|date=20 November 2017|publisher=LSU Press|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If a writer of prose knows enough of what he is writing about he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Creative literature (as opposed to technical writing or objective journalism) in general hinges on the artful use of a wide range of devices (such as inference, [[metaphor]], understatement, the [[unreliable narrator]], and ambiguity) that reward the careful reader's appreciation of subtext and extrapolation of what the author chooses to leave unsaid, untold, and/or unshown. This suggests a form of respect for the reader, who should be trusted to develop a feeling for the meaning behind the action, without having the point painfully laid out for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=izK6BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;lpg=PT17&amp;dq=develop+a+feeling+for+the+meaning+behind+the+action,+without+having+the+point+painfully+laid+out+for+them&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=82FuRr_SB2&amp;sig=Ucrfj3FnKus-LfTEeIL0VllGDBE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy2qmsw83XAhVFJ1AKHbJvD9sQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=How to Write a Novel in 90 Days|first=Conrad|last=Jones|date=21 October 2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited|accessdate=20 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chuck Palahniuk===

In a 2013 article, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] (author of the novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'') goes as far as recommending a ban of what he calls "thought verbs" ("Thinks, Knows, Understands, Realizes, Believes, Wants, Remembers, Imagines, Desires […]") favoring instead the use of "specific sensory detail: action, smell, taste, sound, and feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palahniuk|first=Chuck|title=Nuts and Bolts: "Thought" Verbs|url=http://litreactor.com/essays/chuck-palahniuk/nuts-and-bolts-%E2%80%9Cthought%E2%80%9D-verbs|work=LitReactor|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Scott Bell===

"Show, don't tell" should not be applied to all incidents in a story. According to James Scott Bell, "Sometimes a writer tells as a shortcut, to move quickly to the meaty part of the story or [[scene (fiction)|scene]]. Showing is essentially about making scenes vivid. If you try to do it constantly, the parts that are supposed to stand out won't, and your readers will get exhausted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Orson Scott Card===

[[Scene (drama)|Scenes]] that are important to the story should be dramatized with showing, but sometimes what happens between scenes can be told so the story can make progress. According to [[Orson Scott Card]] and others, "showing" is so terribly time consuming that it is to be used only for dramatic scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Soumak''' (also spelled '''Soumakh''', '''Sumak''', '''Sumac''', or '''Soumac''') is a [[tapestry]] technique of weaving strong and decorative textiles used as [[Oriental rug|rugs]] and domestic bags. Baks used for bedding are known as '''Soumak Mafrash'''. Soumak is a type of flat weave, somewhat resembling but stronger and thicker than [[kilim]], with a smooth front face and a ragged back, where kilim is smooth both sides. Soumak lacks the slits characteristic of kilim, as it is usually woven with supplementary weft threads as continuous supports.

The technique involves wrapping coloured [[weft]] threads over and under the warp threads, adding strength and [[embroidery]]-like pattern.

[[File:Soumak weave.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Soumak weave wraps the [[weft]] threads over 4 warps and back over 2. The weaver may sometimes, as here, go backwards and forwards, reversing the direction of the wrapping.]]

The technique of making a soumak involves wrapping [[weft]]s over a certain number of [[warp (weaving)|warps]] (usually 4) before drawing them back under the last two warps. The process is repeated from [[selvedge]] to selvedge. The wefts are discontinuous; the weaver selects coloured threads in turn, and wraps each within the area which is to have that particular colour. Unlike kilim, the back is left ragged, with all the loose ends of the differently-coloured weft threads visible, sometimes several inches long, providing extra thickness and warmth. Also unlike kilim, there are no slits where colours meet, as there is a supplementary or structural weft which supports the coloured pattern weft. Some late Soumaks made by the Kurds are however "weftless", lacking the structural weft support, and the stitches naturally overlap.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Jon |title=Carpets from the Tents, Cottages and Workshops of Asia |date=1988 |publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins |isbn=0-7126-2501-1 |pages=78, 167-168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mallett&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marlamallett.com/techniques.htm#SOUMAK |title=Basic Tribal and Village Weaves |author=Mallett, Marla |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weavingartmuseum.org/ex2_main.htm |title=Soumak and Kelim weaving of the Caucasus |author=Cassin, Jack |publisher=Weaving Art Museum |date=1998 |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haack&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haack |first1=Hermann |last2=Wingfield Digby |first2=George &amp; Cornelia (trans.) |title=Oriental Rugs: An Illustrated Guide |date=1960 |publisher=Faber &amp; Faber |pages=25-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wendorf|first1=Michael|title=The Nature of Kurdishness|journal=Hali|date=November 2000|volume=113|page=73|quote=Kurds also continued to create weavings using simple and ancient techniques such as weft wrapping without intervening ground wefts (weftless soumak), paired warp tapestry, and other techniques long abandoned by other weavers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soumaks tend to be finely woven, and although not as durable as [[carpet|piled carpet]]s, they are stronger than [[kilim]]s. The soumak wrapping often covers the whole surface of a bag or rug, but it can equally be applied in decorative strips, contrasting with the plainer and thinner flatweave areas.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Middleton |title=Rugs &amp; Carpets |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, camel bags from [[Malatya]] in Eastern Turkey could be woven in simple flatweave stripes of red and blue, with broad strips of soumak weft-wrapping with [[kilim motifs|motifs for fertility and protection]].&lt;ref name=GillowSentance&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillow |first1=John |last2=Sentance |first2=Bryan |title=World Textiles. A Visual Guide to Traditional Techniques |date=1999 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |pages=64-65 |isbn=0-500-01950-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bags were sometimes woven with a face of soumak, with a [[tapestry]]-woven kilim-like top creating slits between blocks of colour: a rope was threaded in and out of the series of slits to fasten and close the bag.&lt;ref name=VandABagface&gt;{{cite web |title=Bag face (T.205-1922) |url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O68518/bag-face-unknown/ |publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]] |accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sizes vary, from carpet format through bags for bedding or for use on [[pack animal]]s, to tiny tribal domestic bags.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt; The following images show the appearance and construction of just such a soumak [[saddle bag]], woven in [[Luristan]] at the end of the 20th century.

==Regions==

Soumak products are made in the [[Caucasus]] (especially the [[Shirvan]] region), Southern and Western [[Persia]] including [[Luristan]], Turkish [[Anatolia]], by the [[Shahsavan]] tribe and the [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] in north-western Persia, and by the [[Baloch people]] on the [[Persia]]–[[Afghanistan]] border.&lt;ref name=Mallett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Middleton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haack/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connell |first1=Barry |title=Fantastic Animal Shahsavan Soumak Bagface 3rd quarter 19th c |url=http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/Rugs/Persian/Shahsavan/Shah997.htm |publisher=Persian Carpet Guide |accessdate=25 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215011629/http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/Rugs/Persian/Shahsavan/Shah997.htm |archivedate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kurd Soumak Bagface Late 19th C |url=http://www.persiancarpetguide.com/sw-asia/Rugs/Kurdish/Kurd_Soumak_Bagface_late_19t_C_Lot_86.htm |publisher=Persian Carpet Guide |accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The name Soumak may plausibly derive from the old town of [[Shemakja]] in [[Azerbaijan]], once a major trading centre in the Eastern Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolitancarpet.com/html/soumac.htm |title=Soumac |accessdate=10 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714214457/http://www.metropolitancarpet.com/html/soumac.htm |archivedate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories include an etymology from Turkish ''sekmek'', to skip up and down, meaning the process of weaving; or from any of about 35 species of flowering plant in the [[Anacardiaceae]] or [[sumac]] family, such as [[dyer's sumach]] (''Cotinus coggygria''), used to make dyestuffs.&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; If this last is the source of the name, then it is derived from the Arabic and [[Syriac language|Syriac]] word ''summāq'', red.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology of Sumac at [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=sumac Etymonline.com] and also at {{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012185830/http://www.scribd.com/doc/14047074/Dictionary-English-Etymology-Origins-A-Short-Etymological-Dictionary-of-Modern-English-Rouledge-1958-Parridge |archivedate=2014-10-12 |df= }} and [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/].

'''''Still Life with a Chinese Porcelain Jar''''' is a 1669 [[oil painting]] by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[Willem Kalf]], located in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It is a sumptuous [[still life]] displaying the sort of costly wares that flowed through the Netherlands during its heyday as a trade center.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In ''Still Life with a Chinese Porcelain Jar'', Kalf selected an array of precious objects with which to showcase the wealth and refinement of the Netherlands and his own skills as a painter. Everything is expensive, imported, or both. The citrus fruit, glassware from [[Venice]], and [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]] jar are evidence of Dutch sailors' enterprise. Local talent is displayed by Dutch silver and a [[rummer]], or wineglass, with a cherub holding a [[cornucopia]] at its base. They stand on a [[marble]] tabletop with a carelessly crumpled [[oriental rug]].&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; Amid all that luxury is a lesson: a ticking watch on the silver platter reminds the viewer that such earthly riches are fleeting, and worth far less than eternal salvation. The carefully balanced composition, rich colors, and warm tonalities make this painting an object of beauty as well as moral edification.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
In the 1650s and '60s, as [[Amsterdam]] flourished as a hub of commerce and politics, Kalf perfected the ''pronk'' (display) still life to exhibit its prosperity. Using an arrangement of objects generally extremely similar to the ones in ''Still Life with a Chinese Porcelain Jar'', depicted with a rich, velvety atmosphere and glistening light, Kalf captured his city's wealth for all to admire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liedtke|first=Walter|title=Still-Life Painting in Northern Europe, 1600–1800|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nstl/hd_nstl.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to render the objects even more beautiful than reality did. This would establish painting as the preeminent art form. [[Goethe]] thought he succeeded, saying of Kalf's paintings that "there is no question that should I have the choice of the golden vessels or the picture, I would choose the picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Levin|title=Following Willem Kalf’s lead…|url=http://levinrodriguez.blogspot.com/2011/12/following-willem-kalfs-lead.html|publisher=The Berkemeyer Project|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
The [[Herron School of Art]] acquired this artwork in 1945, a gift of Mrs. James W. Fesler in memory of Daniel W. and Elizabeth C. Marmon. It remained with the IMA during the division and currently hangs in the William C. Griffith Jr. and Carolyn C. Griffith Gallery. It has the accession number 45.9.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Still Life with a Chinese Porcelain Jar|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/still-life-chinese-porcelain-jar-kalf-willem|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P_S_Krøyer_1899_-_Sommeraften_ved_Skagens_strand._Kunstneren_og_hans_hustru.jpg|300px|thumb|Peder Severin Krøyer: ''Summer Evening at Skagen Beach &amp;ndash; The Artist and his Wife'' (1899)]]
'''''Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife''''' ({{lang-da|Sommeraften ved Skagens strand. Kunstneren og hans hustru}}) is an 1899 painting by [[Peder Severin Krøyer]]. One of the best known paintings of the [[Skagen Painters]], it depicts Krøyer with his wife [[Marie Krøyer|Marie]] and his dog Rap strolling on the beach in the moonlight.

==Background==
{{main|Skagen Painters}}
The Skagen Painters were a close-knit group of mainly Danish artists who gathered each summer from the late 1870s in the fishing village of [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]], painting the local fishermen and their own gatherings. P.S. Krøyer arrived there in 1882, quickly becoming the most prominent member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagensmuseum.dk/en/collection/the-artists/ps-kroeyer/|title=P.S. Krøyer (1851-1909)|publisher=Skagens Museum|accessdate=6 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, in a letter to his friend [[Oscar Björck]], Krøyer wrote "I am also thinking of painting a large portrait of my wife and me together — but for that I shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created his large painting. Maybe it was in recognition of 10 years of marriage with [[Marie Krøyer|Marie Triepcke]] as illustrated in other works of family life at the time as well as in a number of the photographs and sketches he used as a basis for the work.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hirschsprung.dk/Image.aspx?id=12&amp;col=7|title=P.S. Krøyer i den Hirschsprungske Samling: Sommerafter ved Skagens Strand. Kunsteren og hans hustru|publisher=Hirschsprung|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting description==

The final result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Krøyer's faithful dog, Rap. After Krøyer had worked on the painting throughout the summer, he submitted it to the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] in 1900.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung/&gt; It was not very well received there, being criticized as banal. In fact, it presents the blue half-light, a favourite with the [[Symbolists]] who believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. In 1907, Krøyer conveyed his own feelings about Skagen evenings: "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea, ... with the fishermen standing on the beach and the cutters sailing by with loosened sails ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extranet.uv.khs.dk/materiale/Dansk%20Opgave%201/www/opg4-hirschsprung/arbejder/234/index.html|title=Sommeraften ved Skagens strand|publisher=Køge Hamdelsskole|accessdate=18 August 2014 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the spring exhibition, Krøyer was admitted to Middelfart Mental Hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name=hirschsprung/&gt;

'''''The Falconer''''' is a bronze sculpture in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]] by [[English people|English]] [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[George Blackall Simonds]]. It depicts a man in a theatrical version of [[Elizabethan]] dress standing on a high granite pedestal, releasing a hunting [[falcon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Falconer|url=http://www.centralparknyc.org/visit/things-to-see/south-end/the-falconer.html|work=Central Park Conservatory|publisher=Central Park Conservatory|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Falconer'', cast in 1871 in Florence, was erected in 1875&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/centralpark/monuments/461 NYC Dept of Parks: ''The Falconer'']; "1872" in Michele H.

The growth of surrounding trees has partly obscured the site. The sculpture has a history of being vandalized. The original falcon was stolen, and in the 1960s the  [http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/centralpark/monuments/461 New York City Parks Department] commissioned their employee and sculptor, [[Joel Rudnick]], to mold a new falcon which now sits on The Falconer's arm. This new falcon is substantially different from the original falcon.

The '''Vancouver system''', also known as '''Vancouver reference style''' or the '''author–number system''', is a [[citation]] style that uses numbers within the text that refer to numbered entries in the reference list. It is popular in the [[physical sciences]] and is one of two referencing systems normally used in medicine, the other being the [[Harvard referencing|author–date, or "Harvard", system]].&lt;ref name="BMA"&gt;{{vcite web|title=Reference styles|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/library/library-guide/reference-styles|date=|accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hundreds of [[scientific journals]] use author-number systems. They all follow the same essential logic (that is, numbered citations pointing to numbered list entries), although the trivial details of the output mask, such as [[punctuation]], [[letter case#Case styles|casing of titles]], and [[italic type|italic]], vary widely among them. They have existed for over a century; the names "Vancouver system" or "Vancouver style" have existed since 1978. The latest version of the latter is ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', per the ''References &gt; Style and Format'' section of the ICMJE Recommendations.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations&gt;{{Citation |author=ICMJE |title=Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals |url=http://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the broad sense, the Vancouver system refers to any author-number system regardless of the formatting details.  A narrower definition of the Vancouver system refers to a specific author-number format specified by the [[ICMJE Recommendations]] (Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts, URM).  For example, the [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA reference style]] is Vancouver style in the broad sense because it is an author-number system that conforms to the URM, but not in the narrow sense because its formatting differs in some minor details from the NLM/PubMed style (such as what is italicized and whether the citation numbers are bracketed).

==History==
Author–number systems have existed for over a century and throughout that time have been one of the main types of [[citation]] style in [[scientific journal]]s (the other being [[parenthetical referencing|author–date]]). In 1978, a committee of editors from various [[medical journal]]s, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), met in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC, Canada]] to agree to a unified set of requirements for the articles of such journals. This meeting led to the establishment of the [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] (URMs). Part of the URMs is the reference style, for which the ICMJE selected the long-established author–number principle.

The URMs were developed 15 years before the [[World Wide Web]] debuted. During those years, they were published as articles or supplements in various ICMJE member journals. These included the 1991 BMJ publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=2001512 |pmc=1669007 |year=1991 |month=Feb |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=338–341 |issn=0959-8138 |journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.) |doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6772.338}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1995 ''[[CMAJ]]'' publication&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=7728695 |pmc=1337910 |year=1995 |month=May |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals.  | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=152 |issue=9 |pages=1459–1473 |issn=0820-3946 |journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1997 ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=8992922 |year=1997 |month=Jan |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. |author=International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=36–47 |issn=0003-4819 |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8992922 |format=Free full text |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-126-1-199701010-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s and early 2000s, journals were asked to cite the 1997 ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]'' version&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=9062335 |year=1997 |month=Mar |title=Uniform requirements for manuscripts submitted to biomedical journals. | author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors |volume=277 |issue=11 |pages=927–934 |issn=0098-7484 |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |doi=10.1001/jama.277.11.927}}&lt;/ref&gt; when reprinting the ''Uniform requirements''.

In the early 2000s, with the Web having become a major force in academic life, the idea gradually took hold that the logical home for the latest edition of the URMs would be the [http://www.icmje.org/ ICMJE website] itself (as opposed to whichever journal article or supplement had most recently published an update). For example, as of 2004, the editors of ''[[Haematologica]]'' decided simply to invite their authors to visit www.icmje.org for the 2003 revision of the ''Uniform requirements''.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal |pmid=15020262 |year=2004 |month=Mar |author=International Committee Of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) |title=Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: writing and editing for biomedical publication |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=264 |issn=0390-6078 |journal=Haematologica |url=http://www.haematologica.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15020262 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early to mid-2000s, the [[United States National Library of Medicine]] (which runs [[MEDLINE]] and [[PubMed]]) has hosted the ICMJE's "Sample References" pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html |author = International Committee of Medical Journal Editors | title = Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals: Sample References | accessdate = 2006-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 2007, the NLM created ''[[Citing Medicine]]'', its [[style guide]] for citation style, as a new home for the style's details. The ICMJE Recommendations now point to ''[[Citing Medicine]]'' as the home for the formatting details of Vancouver style.&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt; For example, in the December 2013 edition of the ICMJE Recommendations, the relevant paragraph is IV.A.3.g.ii. (''References &gt; Style and Format'').&lt;ref name=icmje-recommendations/&gt;

==Sample usage==

===Labelling citations===
References are numbered consecutively in order of appearance in the text – they are identified by [[Arabic numerals]] in [[Bracket#Parentheses ( )|parentheses]]''' (1)''', [[square brackets]]''' [1]''', [[superscript]]'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''', or a combination'''&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;'''. The number usually appears at the end of the material it supports, and an entry in the reference list would give full bibliographical information for the source:

{{quote|Blood loss and the number of patients requiring post-operative blood transfusions were significantly greater, but operation and fluoroscopy times were significantly shorter, for the DHS versus the PFNA group&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;.}}

And the entry in the reference list would be: 1. {{cite journal|vauthors=Xu YZ, Geng DC, Mao HQ, Zhu XS, Yang HL|title=A comparison of the proximal femoral nail antirotation device and dynamic hip screw in the treatment of unstable pertrochanteric fracture.|pmid=20925999|journal=J Int Med Res|date=2010|volume=38|pages=1266–1275}}

===Placing citations===
Several descriptions of the Vancouver system say that the number can be placed ''outside'' the text punctuation to avoid disruption to the flow of the text, ''or'' be placed ''inside'' the text punctuation, and that there are different cultures in different traditions.&lt;ref name="url_Leicester"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www2.le.ac.uk/library/help/citing/vancouver-numbered-system | title = Vancouver (Numbered) System | publisher = University of Leicester  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlmedind.nic.in"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://medind.nic.in/jbc/t04/i1/jbct04i1p21.pdf | title = Reference systems deciphered for you | publisher = Department of Forensic Medicine, Govt. Medical College, Patiala }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first method is recommended by some universities and colleges,&lt;ref name="urllibrary.vcc.ca"&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | title = Vancouver Citation Style | publisher = Vancouver Community College | quote = The citation in brackets is placed after any commas and periods, and before any colons and semi-colons | accessdate = 2015-01-05 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150209043418/http://library.vcc.ca/downloads/VCC_VancouverStyleGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2015-02-09 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter method is required by scientific publications such as the [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA]]&lt;ref name="urlMLA Citation Style | Cornell University Library"&gt;{{vcite web | url = https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla | title = MLA Citation Style | publisher =  Cornell University Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IEEE]]&lt;ref name=IEEE/&gt; except for in the end of a block quotation. (IEEE are using Vancouver style labels within brackets, for example [1] to cite the first reference in the list, but otherwise refer to [[Chicago Style Manual]].)&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | title = IEEE Citation Reference | format =  | work = IEEE | quote = References ... appear on the line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. | accessdate = 2011-05-12 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110408195511/http://www.ieee.org/documents/ieeecitationref.pdf | archivedate = 2011-04-08 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Vancouver system documents (the [[ICMJE recommendations]] and Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals) do not discuss placement of the citation mark.

===Format of citations===
Different formats exist for different types of sources, e.g. books, journal articles etc. Author names are abbreviated to at most two initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/ |title=Citing Medicine: The NLM Style Guide for Authors, Editors, and Publishers [Internet] | edition=2nd | first = K | last = Patrias | editor-first  = D | editor-last = Wendling |location=Bethesda, MD | publisher = National Library of Medicine (US) | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2012-02-22 | quote = Convert given (first) names and middle names to initials, for a maximum of two initials following each surname | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Citing Medicine'' does not explicitly mandate merging initials (e.g. "R. K." would be merged into "RK"), the examples used throughout the book do.

====Journal articles====

=====Standard journal articles=====
* Leurs R, Church MK, Taglialatela M. H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-antihistamines: inverse agonism, anti-inflammatory actions and cardiac effects. Clin Exp Allergy. 2002 Apr;32(4):489-498.
* Tashiro J, Yamaguchi S, Ishii T, Suzuki A, Kondo H, Morita Y, Hara K, Koyama I. Inferior oncological prognosis of surgery without oral chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer in clinical settings. World J Surg Oncol. 2014 May 10;12(1):145. [Epub ahead of print]

As an option, if a journal carries continuous pagination throughout a volume (as many medical journals do), the month and issue number may be omitted.

* Thomas MC. Diuretics, ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs – the triple whammy. Med J Aust. 2000;172:184-185.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] lists all authors for all articles, because it is appropriate for capturing all authors and all of their publications in the MEDLINE database to be found by searches. However, in the reference lists of articles, most journals truncate the list after 3 or 6 names, followed by "[[et al.]]" (which most medical journals do not italicize):

* Guilbert TW, Morgan WJ, Zeiger RS, Mauger DT, Boehmer SJ, Szefler SJ, et al. Long-term inhaled corticosteroids in preschool children at high risk for asthma. N Engl J Med. 2006 May 11;354(19):1985-1997.

Optionally, a unique identifier (such as the article's [[digital object identifier|DOI]] or [[PubMed#PubMed identifier|PMID]]) may be added to the citation:

* von Itzstein M, Wu WY, Kok GB, Pegg MS, Dyason JC, Jin B, et al. Rational design of potent sialidase-based inhibitors of influenza virus replication. Nature. 1993 Jun 3;363(6428):418-423. {{PMID|8502295}}.

NLM elides ending page numbers and uses a hyphen as the range indicating character (184-5). Some journals do likewise, whereas others expand the ending page numbers in full (184-185), use an en dash instead of a hyphen (184–5), or both (184–185).

Virtually all medical journal articles are published online. Many are published online only, and many others are published online ahead of print. For the date of online publication, at the end of the citation NLM puts "[Epub Year Mon Day]" (for online-only publication) or "[Epub ahead of print]" for online ahead of print (with the month and day following the year in its normal position). In contrast, [[AMA style]] puts "[published online Month Day, Year]" at the end of the article title. It no longer uses the term "Epub" and no longer includes the words "ahead of print". It omits the year from its normal location after the journal title abbreviation if there is no print data to give (online-only publication).

The titles of journals are abbreviated. There are no periods in the abbreviation. A period comes after the abbreviation, delimiting it from the next field. The abbreviations are standardized. The standardization was formerly incomplete and internal to organizations such as NLM. It is now formalized at the [[supraorganization]]al level by documents including [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7251/ ''Citing Medicine'' at Appendix A: Abbreviations for Commonly Used English Words in Journal Titles], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z39.5, [[ISO 4|ISO 4: Information and documentation -- Rules for the abbreviation of title words and titles of publications]], and the [http://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/ ISSN.org List of Title Word Abbreviations (LTWA)].

=====Articles not in English=====
As per journal articles in English:

* Forneau E, Bovet D. Recherches sur l'action sympathicolytique d'un nouveau dérivé du dioxane. Arch Int Pharmacodyn. 1933;46:178-191. French.

The [[National Library of Medicine|NLM]] adds an English translation of the title enclosed in square brackets right after the title. The language is specified in full after the location (pagination), followed by a period.&lt;!-- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/box/A33262/?report=objectonly --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7487">{{other uses of|VARA|Vara (disambiguation)}}
The '''Visual Artists Rights Act of 1990''' ('''VARA'''), {{UnitedStatesCode|17|106A}}, is a [[United States]] law granting certain rights to artists.

VARA was the first federal [[United States Copyright law|copyright]] legislation to grant protection to ''[[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]]''. Under VARA, works of art that meet certain requirements afford their authors additional rights in the works, regardless of any subsequent physical ownership of the work itself, or regardless of who holds the copyright to the work. For instance, a painter may insist on proper attribution of his painting, and in some instances may sue the owner of the physical painting for destroying the painting even if the owner of the painting lawfully owned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703447004575449793518169052|title=When Creator and Owner Clash|first=Daniel|last=Grant|date=31 August 2010|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although federal law had not acknowledged moral rights before this act, some state legislatures and judicial decisions created limited moral-rights protection. The [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] required the protection of these rights by signatory states, and it was in response that the U.S. Congress passed the VARA.

==Exclusive rights under VARA==
VARA exclusively grants authors of works that fall under the protection of the Act the following rights
*right to claim authorship
*right to prevent the use of one's name on any work the author did not create
*right to prevent use of one's name on any work that has been distorted, mutilated, or modified in a way that would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation
*right to prevent distortion, mutilation, or modification that would prejudice the author's honor or reputation

Additionally, authors of works of "recognized stature" may prohibit intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work. Exceptions to VARA require a waiver from the author in writing. To date, "recognized stature" has managed to elude a precise definition. VARA allows authors to waive their rights, something generally not permitted in France and many European countries whose laws were the originators of the moral rights of artists concept.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Sherman. Note: THE VISUAL ARTISTS RIGHTS ACT OF 1990: AMERICAN ARTISTS BURNED AGAIN. 17 Cardozo L. Rev. 373 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In most instances, the rights granted under VARA persist for the life of the author (or the last surviving author, for creators of joint works).

===Covered works===
VARA provides its protection only to [[paintings]], [[drawings]], [[Printmaking|prints]], [[sculptures]], [[Photograph|still photographic images]] produced for exhibition only, and existing in single copies or in limited editions of 200 or fewer copies, signed and numbered by the artist. The requirements for protection do not implicate aesthetic taste or value.

==Application and effect==
VARA's application is limited to visual works that fall within a narrowly defined category. However, for works that do fall within the category of protected works, VARA imposes substantial restrictions on any modification or removal of those works. Purchasers of the works must obtain written waivers from the author if they wish to exercise any of the exclusive rights under VARA.

This has particularly been an issue for those that commission public sculptures. Absent a waiver, artists could effectively veto decisions to remove their structures from their benefactor's land. In a 2006 decision involving public sculptures that were removed from the park for which they were created, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] ruled that VARA does not protect location as a component of site-specific work.  VARA covered works can be moved as long as the move does not constitute "destruction, distortion, or mutilation."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' ''Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.'', 459 F.3d 128 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|1st Circuit]] 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of works==
*[[Tilted Arc]], a well-known artwork by [[Richard Serra]], was removed from public display prior to the enactment of VARA.
*[[Kent Twitchell]]'s [[Ed Ruscha]] [[mural]] was painted over without his approval.

'''Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas''' encompasses the visual [[art]]istic traditions of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from ancient times to the present. These include works from South America, Mesoamerica, North America including [[Greenland]], as well as [[Siberian Yup'ik]] peoples who have great cultural overlap with [[Native Alaskan]] [[Yup'ik]]s.

==Lithic and Archaic stage==
{{See also|Pre-Columbian art|Petroglyph|Pictogram|Petroform|Rock art|Stone tools}}
In North America, the [[Lithic stage]] or [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian period]] is defined as approximately 18,000–8000 BCE.  The period from around 8000–800 BCE is generally referred to as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]]. The production of [[bannerstone]]s, [[Projectile point]], [[Lithic reduction]] styles and pictographic cave paintings are some of the art that remains from this time period.

Belonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is a carved [[megafauna]] bone, possibly from a mammoth, etched with a profile of walking [[mammoth]] or [[mastodon]] that dates back to 11,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasthorizons.com/index.php/archives/06/2011/ice-age-art-from-florida|title=Ice Age Art from Florida|publisher=Past Horizons|date=23 June 2011|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bone was found early in the 21st century near [[Vero Beach, Florida]], in an area where human bones ([[Vero man]]) had been found in association with extinct [[pleistocene]] animals early in the 20th century. The bone is too [[Fossil|mineralized]] to be dated, but the carving has been authenticated as having been made before the bone became mineralized. The anatomical correctness of the carving and the heavy mineralization of the bone indicate that the carving was made while mammoths and/or mastodons still lived in the area, more than 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.verobeach32963.com/news/News060409/060409_BoneCarvingFind.htm University of Florida: Epic carving on fossil bone found in Vero Beach] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913045450/http://www.verobeach32963.com/news/News060409/060409_BoneCarvingFind.htm |date=13 September 2009 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|last=Viegas|first=Jennifer|title=Earliest Mammoth Art: Mammoth on Mammoth|url=http://news.discovery.com/history/earliest-american-art-mammoth-110622.html|publisher=Discovery News|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|last=The Associated Press|title=Ancient mammoth or mastodon image found on bone in Vero Beach|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20110622/ARTICLES/110629821/-1/news?Title=Ancient-mammoth-or-mastodon-image-found-on-bone-in-Vero-Beach|accessdate=23 June 2011|newspaper=Gainesville Sun|date=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Purdy|first=Barbara A., Kevin S.

The southwestern United States and certain regions of the Andes have the highest concentration of [[pictograph]]s (painted images) and [[Petroglyph]]s (carved images) from this period. Both pictographs and petroglyphs are known as [[rock art]].

===Arctic===
{{See also|Inuit art|Alaska Native Art}}
The [[Yup'ik]] of Alaska have a long tradition of carving [[Yup'ik masks|masks]] for use in [[Shamanism among Eskimo peoples|shamanic]] rituals. Indigenous peoples of the Canadian arctic have produced objects that could be classified as art since the time of the [[Dorset culture]]. While the walrus ivory carvings of the Dorset were primarily shamanic, the art of the [[Thule people]] who replaced them circa 1000 CE was more decorative in character. With European contact the historic period of Inuit art began. In this period, which reached its height in the late 19th century, Inuit artisans created souvenirs for the crews of whaling ships and explorers. Common examples include [[cribbage]] boards. Modern Inuit art began in the late 1940s, when with the encouragement of the Canadian government they began to produce prints and [[Serpentinite|serpentine]] sculptures for sale in the south. [[Greenlandic Inuit]]  have a unique textile tradition intregrating skin-sewing, furs, and appliqué of small pieces of brightly dyed marine mammal organs in mosaic designs, called [[avittat]]. Women create elaborate netted beadwork collars. They have strong mask-making tradition and also are known for an art form called ''[[tupilaq]]'' or an "evil spirit object." Traditional art making practices thrive in the [[Ammassalik]].&lt;ref&gt;Hessel, 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sperm whale]] ivory remains a valued medium for carving.&lt;ref&gt;Hessel, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subarctic====
Cultures of interior Alaska and Canada living south of the [[Arctic Circle]] are [[Subarctic peoples]]. While humans have lived in the region far longer, the oldest known surviving Subarctic art is a petroglyph site in northwest [[Ontario]], dated to 5000 BCE. [[Caribou]], and to a lesser extent [[moose]], are major resources, providing hides, antlers, sinew, and other artistic materials. Porcupine [[quillwork]] embellishes hides and birchbark. After European contact with the influence of the [[Grey Nuns]], moosehair [[tufting]] and floral glass beadwork became popular through the Subarctic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.native-art-in-canada.com/nativeart.html A History of Native Art in Canada and North America.] ''Native Art in Canada.'' 11.June.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northwest Coast===
{{Main|Northwest Coast art}} {{See also|Alaska Native art|Coast Salish art|Kwakwaka'wakw art|Haida argillite carvings}}
The art of the [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Heiltsuk]], [[Tsimshian]] and other smaller tribes living in the coastal areas of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]], [[Oregon]], and [[British Columbia]], is characterized by an extremely complex stylistic vocabulary expressed mainly in the medium of woodcarving. Famous examples include [[totem pole]]s, [[transformation mask]]s, and canoes. In addition to woodwork, two dimensional painting and silver, gold and copper engraved jewelry became important after contact with Europeans.

===Eastern Woodlands===

====Northeastern Woodlands====
The [[Eastern Woodlands]], or simply woodlands, cultures inhabited the regions of North America east of the [[Mississippi River]] at least since 2500 BCE. While there were many regionally distinct cultures, trade between them was common and they shared the practice of burying their dead in earthen mounds, which has preserved a large amount of their art. Because of this trait the cultures are collectively known as the [[Mound builder (people)|Mound builders]].

The [[Woodland period]] (1000 BCE–1000 CE) is divided into early, middle, and late periods, and consisted of cultures that relied mostly on hunting and gathering for their subsistence. Ceramics made by the [[Deptford culture]] (2500 BCE–100 CE) are the earliest evidence of an artistic tradition in this region. The [[Adena culture]] are another well-known example of an early Woodland culture. They carved stone tablets with [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] designs, created [[Hopewell pottery|pottery]], and fashioned costumes from animal hides and antlers for ceremonial rituals. Shellfish was a mainstay of their diet, and engraved shells have been found in their burial mounds.

The [[Middle Woodland period]] was dominated by cultures of the [[Hopewell tradition]] (200–500). Their [[Hopewell tradition#Artwork|artwork]] encompassed a wide variety of jewelry and sculpture in stone, wood, and even human bone.

The [[Late Woodland period]] (500–1000 CE) saw a decline in trade and in the size of settlements, and the creation of art likewise declined.

From the 12th century onward, the [[Iroquois]] and nearby coastal tribes fashioned [[wampum]] from shells and string; these were [[mnemonic]] devices, currency, and records of treaties.

Iroquois people carve [[False Face mask]]s for healing rituals, but the traditional representatives of the tribes, the Grand Council of the [[Haudenosaunee]], are clear that these masks are not for sale or public display.&lt;ref name=false&gt;Shenadoah, Chief Leon. [http://www.peace4turtleisland.org/pages/maskpolicy.htm Haudenosaunee Confederacy Policy On False Face Masks.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130712004902/http://www.peace4turtleisland.org/pages/maskpolicy.htm |date=12 July 2013 }} ''Peace 4 Turtle Island''. 2001. Retrieved 15 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The same can be said for Iroquois Corn Husk Society masks.&lt;ref name=corn&gt;Crawford and Kelley, pp. 496–497.&lt;/ref&gt;

One fine art sculptor of the mid-nineteenth century was [[Edmonia Lewis]] (African American / Ojibwe). Two of her works are held by the [[Newark Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallery.newarkmuseum.org/view/people/asitem/L/21?t:state:flow=352caad0-4bcf-46f3-b777-195bf21b76ca Newark Museum - Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Native peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands continued to make visual art through the 20th and 21st centuries. One such artist is Sharol Graves, whose serigraphs have been exhibited in the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NMAI Indian Humor - Graves|url=http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/indian_humor/exhibit/15.htm|website=National Museum of the American Indian|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=25 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426230405/http://nmai.si.edu/exhibitions/indian_humor/exhibit/15.htm|archivedate=April 26, 2009|location=Internet Archive|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves is also the illustrator of ''[https://www.leeandlow.com/books/the-people-shall-continue The People Shall Continue]'' from [[Lee &amp; Low Books]].

====Southeastern Woodlands====
The [[Poverty Point culture]] inhabited portions of the state of [[Louisiana]] from 2000 to 1000 BCE during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/popo/hd_popo.htm|title=Poverty Point-2000 to 1000 BCE|accessdate=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many objects excavated at Poverty Point sites were made of materials that originated in distant places, including chipped stone projectile points and tools, ground stone plummets, gorgets and vessels, and shell and stone beads. Stone tools found at Poverty Point were made from raw materials which originated in the relatively nearby Ouachita and Ozark Mountains and from the much further away [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Tennessee River]] valleys. Vessels were made from [[soapstone]] which came from the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian foothills]] of [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crt.state.la.us/parks/ipvertypt.aspx|title=CRT-Louisiana State Parks Fees, Facilities and Activities|accessdate=2 March 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207140451/http://crt.state.la.us/parks/ipvertypt.aspx|archive-date=7 February 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-modeled lowly fired clay objects occur in a variety of shapes including anthropomophic figurines and cooking balls.&lt;ref name="metmuseum.org"/&gt;

The [[Mississippian culture]] flourished in what is now the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]], [[Eastern United States|Eastern]], and [[Southeastern United States]] from approximately 800 CE to 1500 CE, varying regionally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-707 Mississippian Period: Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; After adopting [[maize]] agriculture the Mississippian culture became fully agrarian, as opposed to the hunting and gathering supplemented by part-time agriculture practiced by preceding woodland cultures. They built [[platform mound]]s larger and more complex than those of their predecessors, and finished and developed more advanced ceramic techniques, commonly using ground [[mussel]] [[Shell tempered pottery|shell as a tempering agent]]. Many were involved with the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]], a pan-regional and pan-linguistic religious and trade network. The majority of the information known about the S.E.C.C. is derived from examination of the elaborate artworks left behind by its participants, including [[Mississippian culture pottery|pottery]], [[shell gorget]]s and cups, [[Mississippian stone statuary|stone statuary]], [[Mississippian copper plates|repoussé copper plates]] such as the [[Wulfing cache]], [[Rogan plates]], and [[Long-nosed god maskette]]s. By the time of European contact the Mississippian societies were already experiencing severe social stress, and with the political upheavals and diseases introduced by Europeans many of the societies collapsed and ceased to practice a Mississippian lifestyle, with notable exceptions being the [[Plaquemine culture]] [[Natchez people|Natchez]] and related [[Taensa]] peoples. Other tribes descended from Mississippian cultures include the [[Caddo]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee Creek]], [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]], and many other southeastern peoples.

A large number of pre-Columbian wooden artifacts have been found in Florida. While the oldest wooden artifacts are as much as 10,000 years old, carved and painted wooden objects are known only from the past 2,000 years. Animal effigies and face masks have been found at a number of sites in Florida. Animal effigies dating to between 200 and 600 were found in a mortuary pond at [[Fort Center]], on the west side of [[Lake Okeechobee]]. Particularly impressive is a 66&amp;nbsp;cm tall carving of an eagle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purdy|first=Barbara A.|title=Indian Art of Ancient Florida|year=1996|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-1462-X|pages=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{commons|Key Marco}}
More than 1,000 carved and painted wooden objects, including masks, tablets, plaques and effigies, were excavated in 1896 at [[Key Marco]], in [[southwestern Florida]]. They have been described as some of the finest prehistoric Native American art in North America. The objects are not well dated, but may belong to the first millienium of the current era. Spanish missionaries described similar masks and effigies in use by the [[Calusa]] late in the 17th century, and at the former [[Tequesta]] site on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] in 1743, although no examples of the Calusa objects from the historic period have survived. A south Florida effigy style is known from wooden and bone carvings from various sites in the [[Belle Glade culture|Belle Glade]], [[Caloosahatchee culture|Caloosahatchee]], and [[Glades culture]] areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Robin C.|title=Florida's First People|year=1994|publisher=Pineapple Press|location=Sarasota, Florida|isbn=1-56164-032-8|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hahn|first=John H.|title=Indians of Central and South Florida 1513-1763|year=2003|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-2645-8|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Seminoles]] are best known for their textile creations, especially patchwork clothing. Doll-making is another notable craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridamemory.com/OnlineClassroom/seminole_dolls/index.cfm Material] from the State Archives of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The West===

====Great Plains====
Tribes have lived on the [[Great Plains]] for thousands of years. Early Plains cultures are commonly divided into four periods: Paleoindian (at least c. 10,000–4000 BCE), Plains Archaic (c. 4000–250 BCE), Plains Woodland (c. 250 BCE–950 CE), Plains Village (c. 950-1850 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Pyburn, Anne. [http://www.indiana.edu/~arch/saa/matrix/naa/naa_web/mod10.html "Peoples of the Great Plains".] ''Indiana University.''. Retrieved 29 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known painted object in North American was found in the southern plains, the [[Cooper Bison Skull]], found in Oklahoma and dated 10,900-10,200 BCE. It's painted with a red zizzag.&lt;ref name=bement/&gt;

In the Plains Village period, the cultures of the area settled in enclosed clusters of rectangular houses and cultivated [[maize]]. Various regional differences emerged, including Southern Plains, Central Plains, [[Oneota]], and Middle Missouri. Tribes were both nomadic hunters and semi-nomadic farmers. During the ''Plains Coalescent period'' (1400-European contact) some change, possibly drought, caused the mass migration of the population to the Eastern Woodlands region, and the Great Plains were sparsely populated until pressure from American settlers drove tribes into the area again.

The advent of the horse revolutionized the cultures of many historical Plains tribes. [[Horse culture]] enabled tribes to live a completely nomadic existence, hunting buffalo. Buffalo hide clothing was decorated with [[quillwork|porcupine quill embroidery]] and beads – dentalium shells and elk teeth were prized materials. Later coins and glass beads acquired from trading were incorporated into Plains art. Plains [[beadwork]] has flourished into contemporary times.

Buffalo was the preferred material for [[Plains hide painting]]. Men painted narrative, pictorial designs recording personal exploits or visions. They also painted pictographic historical calendars known as [[Winter count]]s. Women painted geometric designs on tanned robes and rawhide [[parfleche]]s, which sometimes served as maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationgis.org/native/native1.html "Native American and First Nations' GIS."] ''Native Geography.'' Dec 2000. Retrieved 29 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Reservation Era of the late 19th century, buffalo herds were systematically destroyed by non-native hunters. Due to the scarcity of hides, Plains artists adopted new painting surfaces, such as muslin or paper, giving birth to [[Ledger art]], so named for the ubiquitous ledger books used by Plains artists.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Great Basin and Plateau====
Since the archaic period the Plateau region, also known as the [[Intermontane|Intermontaine]] and upper [[Great Basin]], had been a center of trade. Plateau people traditionally settled near major river systems.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, their art carries influences from other regions – from the Pacific Northwest coasts and Great Plains. [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]], [[Yakama]], [[Umatilla (tribe)|Umatilla]], and [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] women weave flat, rectangular corn husks or [[hemp dogbane]] bags, which are decorated with "bold, geometric designs" in false embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Plateau beadworkers are known for their contour-style beading and their elaborate horse regalia.

[[Great Basin tribes]] have a sophisticated basket making tradition, as exemplified by [[Dat So La Lee]]/Louisa Keyser ([[Washoe people|Washoe]]), [[Lucy Telles]], [[Carrie Bethel]] and [[Nellie Charlie]]. After being displaced from their lands by non-Native settlers, Washoe wove baskets for the commodity market, especially 1895 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]], [[Shoshone]] and Washoe basketmakers are known for their baskets that incorporate seed beads on the surface and for waterproof baskets.&lt;ref&gt;Garey-Sage, Darla.

==== California ====
The [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#California|Native Americans in California]] have a tradition of exquisitely detailed [[basket weaving]] arts. In the late 19th-century Californian [[basket]]s by artists in the [[Cahuilla]], [[Chumash people|Chumash]], [[Pomo]], [[Miwok]], [[Hupa]] and many other tribes became popular with collectors, museums, and tourists. This resulted in great innovation in the form of the baskets. Many pieces by [[List of Native American artists#Basket weavers|Native American basket weavers]] from all parts of California are in museum collections, such as the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]], the [[Autry National Center|Southwest Museum]], and the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

California has a large number of [[pictograph]]s and [[petroglyphs]] [[rock art]]. One of the largest densities of [[petroglyphs]] in North America, by the [[Coso people]], is in [[Big and Little Petroglyph Canyons]] in the [[Coso Rock Art District]] of the northern [[Mojave Desert]] in California.

The most elaborate pictographs in the U.S are considered to be the [[rock art of the Chumash people]], found in [[cave painting]]s in present-day [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Ventura County, California|Ventura]], and [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo Counties]]. The [[Chumash people|Chumash]] [[cave painting]] includes examples at [[Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, California|Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park]] and [[Burro Flats Painted Cave]].

===Southwest===
{{See also|Oasisamerica}}
In the [[Southwestern United States]] numerous pictographs and petroglyphs were created. The [[Fremont culture]] and [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]] and later tribes' creations, in the [[Barrier Canyon Style]] and others, are seen at present day [[Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel]] and [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]], amongst other sites. Petroglyphs by these and the [[Mogollon culture]]'s artists are represented in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] and at [[Newspaper Rock State Historic Monument|Newspaper Rock]].

The [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Ancestral Pueblo]], or Anasazi, (1000 BCE–700 CE) are the ancestors of today's [[Pueblo peoples|Pueblo tribes]]. Their culture formed in the American southwest, after the cultivation of corn was introduced from Mexico around 1200 BCE. People of this region developed an agrarian lifestyle, cultivating food, storage gourds, and cotton with irrigation or [[xeriscaping]] techniques. They lived in sedentary towns, so pottery, used to store water and grain, was ubiquitous.

For hundreds of years, Ancestral Pueblo created utilitarian grayware and black-on-white pottery and occasionally orange or red ceramics.  In historical times, [[Hopi]] created [[olla]]s, dough bowls, and food bowls of different sizes for daily use, but they also made more elaborate ceremonial mugs, jugs, ladles, seed jars and those vessels for ritual use, and these were usually finished with polished surfaces and decorated with black painted designs. At the turn of the 20th century, Hopi potter [[Nampeyo]] famous revived [[Sikyátki]]-style pottery, originated on First Mesa in the 14th to 17th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/sikyatki.shtml "Ancestral Hopi Pottery".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208035314/http://www.statemuseum.arizona.edu/exhibits/nampeyo/sikyatki.shtml |date=8 February 2008 }} ''Arizona State Museum''. 2007.

Southwest architecture includes [[Cliff dwelling]]s, multi-story settlements carved from [[rock-cut architecture|living rock]]; [[pit house]]s; and [[adobe]] and [[sandstone]] [[pueblo]]s. One of the most elaborate and largest ancient settlements is [[Chaco Canyon]] in [[New Mexico]], which includes 15 major complexes of sandstone and timber. These are connected by a network of roads. Construction for the largest of these settlements, [[Pueblo Bonito]], began 1080 years [[before present]]. Pueblo Bonito contains over 800 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/northamerica/chaco.html "Chaco Canyon."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604094657/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/archaeology/sites/northamerica/chaco.html |date=4 June 2010 }} ''Minnesota State Museum, Mankato''. Retrieved 14 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turquoise]], jet, and spiny oyster shell have been traditionally used by Ancestral Pueblo for jewelry, and they developed sophisticated [[inlay]] techniques centuries ago.

Around 200 CE the [[Hohokam]] culture developed in Arizona. They are the ancestors of the [[Tohono O'odham]] and [[Akimel O'odham]] or Pima tribes. The [[Mimbres culture|Mimbres]], a subgroup of the [[Mogollon culture]], are especially notable for the narrative paintings on their pottery.

Within the last millennium, [[Athabaskan]] peoples emigrated from northern Canada in the southwest. These include the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]]. [[Sandpainting]] is an aspect of Navajo healing ceremonies that inspired an art form. Navajos learned to weave on upright looms from Pueblos and wove blankets that were eagerly collected by [[Great Basin]] and [[Plains Indians|Plains tribes]] in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the introduction of the railroad in the 1880s, imported blankets became plentiful and inexpensive, so Navajo weavers switched to producing [[Navajo rug|rugs]] for trade.

In the 1850s, Navajos adopted [[silversmith]]ing from the Mexicans. [[Atsidi Sani]] (Old Smith) was the first Navajo silversmith, but he had many students, and the technology quickly spread to surrounding tribes. Today thousands of artists produce silver jewelry with turquoise. [[Hopi#Culture|Hopi]] are renowned for their overlay silver work and cottonwood carvings. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists are admired for their cluster work jewelry, showcasing turquoise designs, as well as their elaborate, pictorial stone inlay in silver.

==Mesoamerica and Central America==
[[File:Mesoamerica english.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Mesoamerican cultural region.]]
{{See also|Pre-Columbian art#Mesoamerica and Central America}}
The cultural development of ancient [[Mesoamerica]] was generally divided along east and west. The stable Maya culture was most dominant in the east, especially the Yucatán Peninsula, while in the west more varied developments took place in subregions. These included [[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|West Mexican]] (1000–1), Teotihuacan (1–500), Mixtec (1000–1200), and Aztec (1200–1521).

[[Central America]]n civilizations generally lived to the regions south of modern-day Mexico, although there was some overlap.

===Mesoamerica===
{{See also|Mesoamerican architecture|Mesoamerica#Chronology_and_culture}}
Mesoamerica was home to the following cultures, among others:

====Olmec====
{{Main|Olmec figurine|Olmec#Art}}
The Olmec (1500-400 BCE), who lived on the gulf coast, were the [[first civilization]] to fully develop in Mesoamerica. Their culture was the first to develop many traits that remained constant in Mesoamerica until the last days of the Aztecs: a complex astronomical calendar, the ritual practice of a [[Mesoamerican ball game|ball game]], and the erection of [[stela]]e to commemorate victories or other important events.

The most famous artistic creations of the Olmec are [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal basalt heads]], believed to be portraits of rulers that were erected to advertise their great power. The Olmec also sculpted votive [[Olmec figurine|figurines]] that they buried beneath the floors of their houses for unknown reasons. These were most often modeled in terracotta, but also occasionally carved from [[jade]] or [[Serpentinite|serpentine]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Teotihuacan====
[[Teotihuacan]] was a city built in the [[Valley of Mexico]], containing some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] built in the [[pre-Columbian]] [[The Americas|Americas]]. Established around 200 BCE, the city fell between the 7th and 8th century CE. Teotihuacan has numerous well-preserved [[mural]]s.

The native civilizations were most developed in the [[Andes mountains|Andean region]], where they are roughly divided into Northern Andes civilizations of present- day [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] and the Southern Andes civilizations of present- day [[Peru]] and [[Chilé]].

Hunter-gatherer tribes throughout the [[Amazon rainforest]] of [[Brazil]] also have developed artistic traditions involving tattooing and body painting. Because of their remoteness, these tribes and their art have not been studied as thoroughly as Andean cultures, and many even remain [[Uncontacted peoples|uncontacted]].

Traditionally limited in access to stone and metals, Amazonian [[indigenous people]]s excel at featherwork, painting, textiles, and ceramics. [[Caverna da Pedra Pintada]] (Cave of the Painted Rock) in the [[Pará]] state of [[Brazil]] houses the oldest firmly dated art in the Americas – rock paintings dating back 11,000 years. The cave is also the site of the oldest ceramics in the Americas, from 5000 BCE.&lt;ref name=cave&gt;Wilford, John Noble.

==Modern and contemporary==
[[File:Phoenix indian school 1900.jpg|thumb|Drawing class at the Phoenix Indian School, 1900]]

===Beginnings of contemporary Native American art===
Pinpointing the exact time of emergence of "modern" and contemporary Native art is problematic. In the past, Western art historians have considered use of Western art media or exhibiting in international art arena as criteria for "modern" Native American art history.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Native American art history is a new and highly contested academic discipline, and these Eurocentric benchmarks are followed less and less today. Many media considered appropriate for easel art were employed by Native artists for centuries, such as stone and wood sculpture and mural painting. [[Ancestral Pueblo]] artists painted with tempera on woven cotton fabric, at least 800 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, p. xxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Native artists used non-Indian art materials as soon as they became available. For example, [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcocan]] artist [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl]] painted with ink and watercolor on paper in the late 16th century. Bound together in the [[Codex]] Ixtlilxóchitl, these portraits of historical Texcocan leaders are rendered with shading, modeling and anatomic accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Levenson, pp. 554–555.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cuzco School]] of Peru featured [[Quechua people|Quechua]] easel painters in the 17th and 18th centuries. The first [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] in the 16th century, precursors to modern museums, featured Native American art.

It should be noted that the notion that fine art cannot be functional has not gained widespread acceptance in the Native American art world, as evidenced by the high esteem and value placed upon rugs, blankets, basketry, weapons, and other utilitarian items in Native American art shows. A dichotomy between [[fine art]] and [[craft]] is not commonly found in contemporary Native art. For example, the [[Cherokee Nation]] honors its greatest artists as Living Treasures, including frog- and [[Gigging|fish-gig]] makers, [[Knapping|flint knappers]], and [[Basket weaving|basket weavers]], alongside sculptors, painters, and textile artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, Will. [http://www.cherokeephoenix.org/2179/Article.aspx 2006 Cherokee National Living Treasure artists announced.] ''The Cherokee Phoenix.'' 2006. Retrieved 1 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Dawn Ades writes, "Far from being inferior, or purely decorative, crafts like textiles or ceramics, have always had the possibility of being the bearers of vital knowledge, beliefs and myths."&lt;ref&gt;Ades, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizable art markets between Natives and non-Natives emerged upon contact, but the 1820–1840s were a highly prolific time. In the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region, tribes dependent upon the rapidly diminishing fur trade adopted art production a means of financial support. A painting movement known as the [[Iroquois Realist School]] emerged among the Haudenosaunee in [[New York (state)|New York]] in the 1820s, spearheaded by the brothers [[David Cusick|David]] and [[Dennis Cusick]].&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

African-Ojibwe sculptor, [[Edmonia Lewis]] maintained a studio in Rome, Italy and carved [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassicist]] marble sculptors from the 1860s-1880s. Her mother belonged to the [[Mississaugas|Mississauga]] band of the [[Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation|Credit River Indian Reserve]]. Lewis exhibited widely, and a testament to her popularity during her own time was that President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] commissioned her to carve his portrait in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, pp. 12, 14, 108, and 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ho-Chunk]] artist, [[Angel De Cora]] was the best known Native American artist before World War&amp;nbsp;I.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, p. 740&lt;/ref&gt; She was taken from her reservation and family to the [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]], where she began her lengthy formal art training.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, p. 742&lt;/ref&gt; Active in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], De Cora exhibited her paintings and design widely and illustrated books by Native authors. She strove to be tribally specific in her work and was revolutionary for portraying Indians in contemporary clothing of the early 20th century. She taught art to young Native students at [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] and was an outspoken advocate of art as a means for Native Americans to maintain cultural pride, while finding a place in mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, p. 754&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kiowa Five]] or [[Kiowa Six]], a group of Kiowa painters from Oklahoma, met with international success when their mentor, Oscar Jacobson, showed their paintings in First International Art Exposition in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-archives.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!85940!0&amp;term= Pochoir prints of ledger drawings by the Kiowa Five, 1929.] ''Smithsonian Institution Research Information System''. Retrieved 1 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also participated in the 1932 [[Venice Biennale]], where their art display, according to [[Dorothy Dunn]], "was acclaimed the most popular exhibit among all the rich and varied displays assembled."&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, 240&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Santa Fe Indian Market]] began in 1922. [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]] became Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1933 and temporarily reversed the BIA's assimilationist policies by encouraging Native American arts and culture. By this time, Native American art exhibits and the art market increased, gaining wider audiences. In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Indigenist]] art movements flourished in [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Mexico]], most famously with the [[Mexican muralism|Mexican Muralist movements]].

===Basketry===
[[File:Yahgan basket.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional [[Yahgan]] basket, woven by Abuela [[Cristina Calderón]], Chile, photo by Jim Cadwell]][[Basket weaving]] is one of the ancient and most-widespread art forms in the Americas. From coiled [[Leymus arenarius|sea lyme grass]] baskets in Nunavut to bark baskets in Tierra del Fuego, Native artists weave baskets from a wide range of materials. Typically baskets are made of vegetable fibers, but Tohono O'odham are known for their horsehair baskets and [[Inupiaq]] artists weave baskets from [[baleen]], filtering plates of certain whales.&lt;ref name=h17&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grand Traverse Band]] [[Kelly Church]], [[Wasco-Wishram]] Pat Gold, and [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] Joel Queen all weave baskets from copper sheets or wire, and [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]-[[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] conceptual artist [[Gail Tremblay]] weaves baskets in the traditional fancywork patterns of her tribes from exposed film. Basketry can take many forms. [[Haida people|Haida]] artist [[Lisa Telford]] uses cedar bark to weave both traditional functional baskets and impractical but beautiful cedar evening gowns and high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artisttrust.org/node/8696 Lisa Telford.] ''Artist Trust''. Retrieved 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of native grasses provides material for Arctic baskets, as does baleen, which is a 20th-century development. Baleen baskets are typically embellished with walrus ivory carvings.&lt;ref name=h17/&gt; Cedar bark is often used in northwest coastal baskets. Throughout the Great Lakes and northeast, black ash and sweetgrass are woven into fancy work, featuring "porcupine" points, or decorated as strawberries. Bark baskets are traditional for gathering berries. [[Arundinaria|Rivercane]] is the preferred material in the Southeast, and [[Chitimacha]]s are regarded as the finest rivercane weavers. In Oklahoma, rivercane is prized but rare so baskets are typically made of honeysuckle or buckbrush runners. Coiled baskets are popular in the southwest and the Hopi and Apache in particular are known for pictorial coiled basketry plaques. The Tohono O'odham are well known for their basket-weaving prowess, and evidenced by the success of [[Annie Antone]] and [[Terrol Dew Johnson]].

[[File:Kumeyaai basket.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kumeyaay]] coiled basket, Celestine Lachapa of Inajo, late 19th century]]California and Great Basin tribes are considered some of the finest basket weavers in the world. [[Juncus]] is a common material in southern California, while sedge, willow, redbud, and devil's claw are also used. [[Pomo]] basket weavers are known to weave 60–100 stitches per inch and their rounded, coiled baskets adorned with quail's topknots, feathers, abalone, and clamshell discs are known as "treasure baskets". Three of the most celebrated Californian basket weavers were [[Elsie Allen]] (Pomo), Laura Somersal ([[Wappo]]), and the late Pomo-[[Patwin]] medicine woman, [[Mabel McKay]],&lt;ref&gt;Dalrymple, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; known for her biography, ''Weaving the Dream''. [[Dat So La Lee|Louisa Keyser]] was a highly influential [[Washoe people|Washoe]] basket weaver.

[[File:Yurok 20061109192219.jpg|thumb|right|Yurok women's basketry caps, Northern California]]
A complex technique called "doubleweave," which involves continuously weaving both an inside and outside surface is shared by the [[Choctaw]], Cherokee, Chitimacha, [[Tarahumara]], and Venezuelan tribes. [[Mike Dart]], [[Cherokee Nation]], is a contemporary practitioner of this technique. The Tarahumara, or Raramuri, of [[Copper Canyon]], Mexico typically weave with pine needles and [[sotol]]. In [[Panama]], [[Embera-Wounaan]] peoples are renowned for their pictoral [[Astrocaryum standleyanum|chunga palm]] baskets, known as ''hösig di'', colored in vivid full-spectrum of [[natural dyes]].

Retrieved 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While in most tribes the basket weavers are often women, among the [[Waura tribe]] in Brazil, men weave baskets. They weave a wide range of styles, but the largest are called ''mayaku'', which can be two feet wide and feature tight weaves with an impressive array of designs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indian-cultures.com/Cultures/waura.html Indian Cultures from Around the World: Waura Indians.] ''Hands Around the World.''. Retrieved 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Today basket weaving often leads to environmental activism. Indiscriminate pesticide spraying endangers basket weavers' health. The [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] tree, used by basket weavers from Michigan to Maine, is threatened by the [[emerald ash borer]]. Basket weaver Kelly Church has organized two conferences about the threat and teaches children how to harvest black ash seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Church, Kelly.

===Beadwork===
[[File:Nat Am beadwork sampler.jpg|thumb|left|Examples of contemporary Native American beadwork]]
[[Beadwork]] is a quintessentially Native American art form, but ironically uses beads imported from Europe and Asia. Glass beads have been in use for almost five centuries in the Americas. Today a wide range of beading styles flourish.

In the Great Lakes, Ursuline nuns introduced floral patterns to tribes, who quickly applied them to beadwork.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Great Lakes tribes are known for their bandolier bags, that might take an entire year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century the Plateau tribes, such as the [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] perfected contour-style beadwork, in which the lines of beads are stitch to emphasize the pictorial imagery. Plains tribes are master beaders, and today dance regalia for man and women feature a variety of beadwork styles. While Plains and Plateau tribes are renowned for their beaded horse trappings, Subarctic tribes such as the [[Dene]] bead lavish floral dog blankets.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Philips, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern tribes have a completely different beadwork aesthetic, and [[Innu]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]], and Haudenosaunee tribes are known for symmetrical scroll motifs in white beads, called the "double curve."&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Iroquois are also known for "embossed" beading in which strings pulled taut force beads to pop up from the surface, creating a bas-relief. [[Tammy Rahr]] (Cayuga) is a contemporary practitioner of this style. [[Zuni people|Zuni]] artists have developed a tradition of three-dimensional beaded sculptures.

[[File:Huichol Trabajando.JPG|thumb|upright|Huichol bead artist, photo by Mario Jareda Beivide]][[Huichol people|Huichol]] Indians of [[Jalisco]] and [[Nayarit]], Mexico have a completely unique approach to beadwork. They adhere beads, one by one, to a surface, such as wood or a gourd, with a mixture of resin and beeswax.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Paul. [http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/Huichol/huichol4.htm The Huichol Web of Life: Creation and Prayer.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518111414/http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/Huichol/huichol4.htm |date=18 May 2008 }} ''The Bead Museum.''. Retrieved 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Native beadwork is created for tribal use but beadworkers also create conceptual work for the art world. [[Richard Aitson]] ([[Kiowa]]-[[Apache]]) has both an Indian and non-Indian audience for his work and is known for his fully beaded [[cradle board|cradleboards]]. Another Kiowa beadworker, [[Teri Greeves]] has won top honors for her beadwork, which consciously integrates both traditional and contemporary motifs, such as beaded dancers on Converse high-tops. Greeves also beads on buckskin and explores such issues as warfare or Native American voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez, Antonio.

Retrieved 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Amerman]], [[Choctaw]], one of today's most celebrated bead artists, pioneered a movement of highly realistic beaded portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; His imagery ranges from 19th century Native leaders to pop icons such as Janet Jackson and Brooke Shields.

Roger Amerman, Marcus' brother, and [[Martha Berry (artist)|Martha Berry]], [[Cherokee]], have effectively revived Southeastern beadwork, a style that had been lost because of forced removal from tribes to Indian Territory. Their beadwork commonly features white bead outlines, an echo of the shell beads or pearls Southeastern tribes used before contact.&lt;ref&gt;Berlo and Phillips, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie Okuma ([[Luiseño people|Luiseño]]-[[Shoshone]]-[[Bannock (tribe)|Bannock]]) was won top awards with her beaded dolls, which can include entire families or horses and riders, all with fully beaded regalia. The antique Venetian beads she uses can as small as size 22°, about the size of a grain of salt.&lt;ref&gt;Indyke, Dottie.

Retrieved 13 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juanita Growing Thunder Fogarty]], Rhonda Holy Bear, and Charlene Holy Bear are also prominent beaded dollmakers.

The widespread popularity of glass beads does not mean aboriginal bead making is dead. Perhaps the most famous Native bead is [[wampum]], a cylindrical tube of [[quahog]] or whelk shell. Both shells produce white beads, but only parts of the quahog produce purple. These are ceremonially and politically important to a range of [[Northeastern Woodland tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;Dubin, p. 170-171&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth James Perry ([[Aquinnah Wampanoag]]-[[Eastern Band Cherokee]]) creates wampum jewelry today, including wampum belts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elizabethjamesperry.com/ Original Wampum Art.] ''Elizabeth James Perry.'' 2008.

The [[Caddo]] tribe's centuries-long pottery tradition had died out in the early 20th century, but has been effectively revived by [[Jereldine Redcorn]].

Pueblo people are particularly known for their ceramic traditions. [[Nampeyo]] (c. 1860 – 1942) was a [[Hopi]] potter who collaborated with anthropologists to revive traditional pottery forms and designs, and many of her relatives are successful potters today. [[Maria Martinez|Maria]] and [[Julian Martinez]], both [[San Ildefonso Pueblo]] revived their tribe's blackware tradition in the early 20th century. Julian invented a gloss-matte blackware style for which his tribe is still known today. [[Lucy M. Lewis|Lucy Lewis]] (1898–1992) of [[Acoma Pueblo]] gained recognition for her black-on-white ceramics in the mid-20th century. [[Cochiti Pueblo]] was known for its grotesque figurines at the turn-of-the-20th century, and these have been revived by Virgil Ortiz. Cochiti potter [[Helen Cordero]] (1915–1994) invented [[storyteller figure]]s, which feature a large, single figure of a seated [[American Indian elder|elder]] telling stories to groups of smaller figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artssouthwest.com/pottery/HelenCorderobio.html Helen Cordero.] ''Arts of the Southwest.''.

Today contemporary Native potters create a wide range of ceramics from functional pottery to monumental ceramic sculpture. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] of [[Santa Clara Pueblo]] is one of the leading ceramic artists in the Americas. She creates coil-built, emotionally charged figures that comment on contemporary society. [[Nora Naranjo-Morse]], also of Santa Clara Pueblo is world-renowned for her individual figures as well as conceptual installations featuring ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cla.purdue.edu/waaw/peterson/Naranjo.html Nora Naranjo-Morse.] ''Women Artists of the American West.''.

[[Performance art]] is a new art form, emerging in the 1960s, and so does not carry the cultural baggage of many other art genres. Performance art can draw upon storytelling traditions, as well as music and dance, and often includes elements of installation, video, film, and textile design. [[Rebecca Belmore]], a Canadian [[Ojibway]] performance artist, has represented her country in the prestigious [[Venice Biennale]]. [[James Luna]], a [[Luiseño people|Luiseño]]-[[Mexican people|Mexican]] performance artist, also participated in the Venice Biennale in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Nottage, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

Performance allows artists to confront their audience directly, challenge long held stereotypes, and bring up current issues, often in an emotionally charged manner. "[P]eople just howl in their seats, and there's ranting and booing or hissing, carrying on the in the audience," says Rebecca Belmore of the response to her work.&lt;ref name="trick"&gt;Ryan, 146&lt;/ref&gt; She has created performances to call attention to violence against and many unsolved murders of First Nations women. Both Belmore and Luna create elaborate, often outlandish outfits and props for their performances and move through a range of characters. For instance, a repeating character of Luna's is Uncle Jimmy,&lt;ref&gt;Nottage, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; a disabled veteran who criticizes greed and apathy on his reservation.

On the other hand, [[Marcus Amerman]], a [[Choctaw]] performance artist, maintains a consistent role of the Buffalo Man, whose irony and social commentary arise from the odd situations in which he finds himself, for instance a James Bond movie or lost in a desert labyrinth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marcusamerman.com/creations/performance.html Performance.] ''Marcus Amerman.''.

Performance art has allowed Native Americans access to the international art world, and Rebecca Belmore mentions that her audiences are non-Native;&lt;ref name="trick"/&gt; however, Native American audiences also respond to this genre. ''Bringing It All Back Home,'' a 1997 film collaboration between James Luna and [[Chris Eyre]], documents Luna's first performance at his own home, the La Jolla Indian Reservation. Luna describes the experience as "probably the scariest moment of my life as an artist ... performing for the members of my reservation in the tribal hall."&lt;ref&gt;Nottage, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marmon Publicity Photo for Web.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lee Marmon]] (Laguna Pueblo), next to his most famous photograph, "White Man's Moccasins"]]Native Americans embraced photography in the 19th century. Some even owned their own photography studios, such as [[Benjamin Haldane]] (1874–1941), [[Tsimshian]] of [[Metlakatla, Alaska|Metlakatla]] Village on [[Annette Island, Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php Artwork in ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829153559/http://www.washington.edu/burkemuseum/inthespirit/our_artwork.php |date=29 August 2008 }} ''The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.''.

Their early photographs stand in stark contrast to the romanticized images of Edward Curtis and other contemporaries. Recent scholarship by Mique’l Askren (Tsimshian/Tlingit) on the photographs of B.A. Haldane has analyzed the functions that Haldane's photographs served for his community: as markers of success by having Anglo-style formal portraits taken, and as markers of the continuity of potlaching and traditional ceremonials by having photographs taken in ceremonial regalia. This second category is particularly significant because the use of the ceremonial regalia was against the law in Canada between 1885 and 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ |title=Mique'l Askren, Bringing our History into Focus: Re-Developing the Work of B.A. Haldane, 19th-century Tsimshian Photographer, ''Blackflash: Seeing Red'', Volume 24, No. 3, 2007, pp. 41-47 |access-date=13 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306171344/http://travelpeapod.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/bringing-our-history-into-focus/ |archive-date=6 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Martín Chambi]] (1891–1973), a Quechua photographer from Peru, was one of the pioneering indigenous photographers of South America. [[Peter Pitseolak]] (1902–1973), [[Inuit]] from [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]], documented Inuit life in the mid-20th century while dealing with challenges presented by the harsh climate and extreme light conditions of the Canadian Arctic. He developed his film himself in his igloo, and some of his photos were shot by oil lamps. [[Horace Poolaw]] (1906–1984), [[Kiowa]], shot over 2000 images of his neighbors and relatives in Western Oklahoma from the 1920s onward. [[Jean Fredericks]] (born 1906), [[Hopi]], had to carefully negotiate cultural views towards photography and made a point of not offering his portraits of Hopi people for sale to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Masayesva and Younger, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today innumerable Native people are professional art photographers; however, acceptance to the genre has met with challenges. [[Hulleah Tsinhnahjinnie]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]]-[[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]]-[[Seminole]], has not only established a successful career with her own work, she has also been an advocate for the entire field of Native American photography. She has curated shows and organized conferences at the C.N. Gorman Museum at [[UC Davis]] featuring Native American photographers. Tsinhnahjinnie wrote the book, ''Our People, Our Land, Our Images: International Indigenous Photographers.'' Native photographers have taken their skills into the fields of art videography, photocollage, digital photography, and digital art.

===Printmaking===
Although it is widely speculated that the ancient [[Adena culture|Adena]] stone tablets were used for printmaking, not much is known about aboriginal American [[printmaking]]. 20th-century Native artists have borrowed techniques from Japan and Europe, such as [[woodcut]], [[linocut]], [[serigraphy]], [[monotyping]], and other practices.

Printmaking has flourished among [[Inuit]] communities in particular. European-Canadian [[James Archibald Houston|James Houston]] created a graphic art program in [[Cape Dorset, Nunavut]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="as"&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Houston taught local Inuit stone carvers how to create prints from stone-blocks and stencils. He asked local artists to draw pictures and the shop generated limited edition prints, based on the [[ukiyo-e]] workshop system of Japan. Cooperative print shops were also established in nearby communities, including [[Baker Lake, Nunavut|Baker Lake]], [[Puvirnituq, Quebec|Puvirnituq]], [[Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories|Holman]], and [[Pangnirtung]]. These shops have experimented with [[etching]], [[engraving]], [[lithography]], and silkscreen. Shops produced annual catalogs advertising their collections. Local birds and animals, spirit beings, and hunting scenes are the most popular subject matter,&lt;ref name="as"/&gt; but are allegorical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Backgrounds tend to be minimal and perspective is mixed.&lt;ref name=h50&gt;Hessel, ''Arctic Spirit'', p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most prominent of Cape Dorset artists is [[Kenojuak Ashevak]] (born 1927), who has received many public commissions and two honorary doctorate degrees.&lt;ref name=h50/&gt; Other prominent Inuit printmakers and graphic artists include [[Parr (artist)|Parr]], [[Osuitok Ipeelee]], [[Germaine Arnaktauyok]], [[Pitseolak Ashoona]], [[Tivi Etok]], [[Helen Kalvak]], [[Jessie Oonark]], [[Kananginak Pootoogook]], [[Pudlo Pudlat]], [[Irene Avaalaaqiaq Tiktaalaaq]], and [[Simon Tookoome]]. Inuit printmaker [[Andrew Qappik]] designed the [[coat of arms of Nunavut]].

Many Native painters transformed their paintings into fine art prints. [[Potawatomi]] artist [[Woody Crumbo]] created bold, screen prints and etchings in the mid-20th century that blended traditional, flat [[Bacone College|Bacone Style]] with [[Art Deco]] influences. [[Kiowa]]-[[Caddo]]-[[Choctaw]] painter, [[T.C. Cannon]] traveled to Japan to study wood block printing from master printers.

In Chile, [[Mapuche]] printmaker [[Santos Chávez]] (1934–2001) was one of the most celebrated artists of his country – with over 85 solo exhibitions during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oll.state.oh.us/multimedia/programs/person.cfm?person_id=107528&amp;program_id=15 Jose Santos Chavez.] ''The Ohio Channel Media Center.''. Retrieved 5 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Yazzie]] ([[Navajo people|Navajo]]), [[Linda Lomahaftewa]] ([[Hopi]]-[[Choctaw]]), [[Fritz Scholder]] and [[Debora Iyall]] ([[Cowlitz (tribe)|Cowlitz]]) have all built successful careers with their print and have gone on to teach the next generation of printers. [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla]] artist, [[James Lavadour]] founded Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts on the [[Umatilla Indian Reservation|Umatilla Reservation]] in Oregon in 1992. Crow's Shadow features a state-of-the-art printmaking studio and offers workshops, exhibition space, and printmaking residencies for Native artists, in which they pair visiting artists with master printers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crowsshadow.org/ Crow's Shadow Institute of the Arts.].

===Sculpture===

[[File:Pai Tavytera indian traditional wood carving.JPG|thumb|[[Pai Tavytera people|Pai Tavytera]] traditional woodcarving, [[Amambay Department]], [[Paraguay]], 2008]]
Native Americans have created sculpture, both monumental and small, for millennia. Stone sculptures are ubiquitous through the Americas, in the forms of [[stelae]], [[inuksuit]], and statues. Alabaster stone carving is popular among Western tribes, where [[catlinite]] carving is traditional in the Northern Plains and [[Zuni fetish|fetish]]-carving is traditional in the Southwest, particularly among the [[Zuni people|Zuni]]. The [[Taíno people|Taíno]] of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] are known for their [[zemi]]s– sacred, three-pointed stone sculptures.

[[Inuit art]]ists sculpt with walrus ivory, caribou antlers, bones, soapstone, serpentinite, and argillite. They often represent local fauna and humans engaged in hunting or ceremonial activities.

Edmonia Lewis paved the way for Native American artists to sculpt in mainstream traditions using non-Native materials. [[Allan Houser]] ([[Warms Springs Chiricahua Apache]]) became one of the most prominent Native sculptors of the 20th century. Though he worked in wood and stone, Houser is most known for his monumental bronze sculptors, both representational and abstract. Houser influenced a generation of Native sculptors by teaching at the [[Institute of American Indian Arts]]. His two sons, Phillip and [[Bob Haozous]] are sculptors today. [[Roxanne Swentzell]] ([[Santa Clara Pueblo]]) is known for her expressive, figurative, ceramic sculptures but has also branched into bronze casting, and her work is permanently displayed at the [[National Museum of the American Indian]].

The Northwest Coastal tribes are known for their woodcarving – most famously their monumental [[totem pole]]s that display clan crests. During the 19th century and early 20th century, this art form was threatened but was effectively revived. [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] totem pole carvers such as Charlie James, [[Mungo Martin]], [[Ellen Neel]], and [[Willie Seaweed]] kept the art alive and also carved masks, furniture, bentwood boxes, and jewelry. Haida carvers include [[Charles Edenshaw]], [[Bill Reid]], and [[Robert Davidson (artist)|Robert Davidson]]. Besides working in wood, Haida also work with [[Haida Argillite Carvings|argillite]]. Traditional formline designs translate well into glass sculpture, which is increasingly popular thanks to efforts by contemporary glass artists such as [[Preston Singletary]] ([[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]), [[Susan Point]] ([[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]]) and Marvin Oliver ([[Quinault people|Quinault]]/[[Isleta Pueblo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tall Chief, Russ.

Retrieved 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Southeast, woodcarving dominates sculpture. [[Willard Stone]], of Cherokee descent, exhibited internationally in the mid-20th century. [[Amanda Crowe]] ([[Eastern Band Cherokee]]) studied sculpture at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and returned to her reservation to teach over 2000 students woodcarving over a period of 40 years, ensuring that sculpture thrives as an art form on the Qualla Boundary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cherokeeheritagetrails.org/elderart/eld05.html Amanda Crowe.] ''Cherokee Heritage Trails.'' 2003.

Coroma in [[Antonio Quijarro Province]], [[Bolivia]] is a major center for ceremonial textile production.&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; An Aymara elder from Coroma said, "In our sacred weavings are expressions of our philosophy, and the basis for our social organization...

[[File:KunaWomanWithMolas.jpg|thumb|left|Kuna woman with molas, [[San Blas Islands]], [[Panama]].]]
[[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] tribal members of [[Panama]] and [[Colombia]] are famous for their [[Mola (art form)|mola]]s, cotton panels with elaborate geometric designs created by a reverse [[appliqué]] technique. Designs originated from traditional skin painting designs but today exhibit a wide range of influences, including [[pop culture]]. Two mola panels form a blouse, but when a Kuna woman is tired of a blouse, she can disassemble it and sell the molas to art collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panart.com/molainfo.htm About Molas.] ''Indigenous Art from Panamá.''. Retrieved 28 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayan women have woven cotton with backstrap looms for centuries, creating items such as ''[[huipil]]s'' or traditional blouses. Elaborate [[Maya textiles]] featured representations of animals, plants, and figures from oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Geise, Paula.

[[Seminole]] seamstresses, upon gaining access to sewing machines in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, invented an elaborate appliqué patchwork tradition. Seminole patchwork, for which the tribe is known today, came into full flower in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Blackard, David M. and Patsy West. [http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml Seminole Clothing: Colorful Patchwork.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316140336/http://www.seminoletribe.com/culture/clothing.shtml |date=16 March 2008 }} ''Seminole Tribe of Florida.''.

Great Lakes and Prairie tribes are known for their [[ribbonwork]], found on clothing and blankets. Strips of silk ribbons are cut and appliquéd in layers, creating designs defined by negative space. The colors and designs might reflect the clan or gender of the wearer. [[Powwow]] and other dance regalia from these tribes often feature ribbonwork. These tribes are also known for their [[Fingerweaving|fingerwoven]] sashes.

[[Pueblo]] men weave with cotton on upright looms. Their mantas and sashes are typically made for ceremonial use for the community, not for outside collectors.

[[File:Seminole patchwork shawl.jpg|left|thumb|[[Seminole patchwork]] shawl made by Susie Cypress from [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], c. 1980s]]
[[Navajo rug]]s are woven by Navajo women today from [[Navajo-Churro sheep]] or commercial wool. Designs can be pictorial or abstract, based on traditional Navajo, Spanish, Oriental, or Persian designs. 20th-century Navajo weavers include [[Clara Sherman]] and [[Hosteen Klah]], who co-founded the [[Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian]].

In 1973, the Navajo Studies Department of the [[Diné College]] in [[Many Farms, Arizona]], wanted to determine how long it took a [[Navajo weaving|Navajo weaver]] to create a rug or blanket from [[sheep shearing]] to market. The study determined the total amount of time was 345 hours. Out of these 345 hours, the expert Navajo weaver needed: 45 hours to shear the sheep and process the wool; 24 hours to [[spinning (textiles)|spin]] the [[wool]]; 60 hours to prepare the [[dye]] and to dye the wool; 215 hours to [[weaving|weave]] the piece; and only one hour to sell the item in their shop.&lt;ref&gt;http://nativeamerican-art.com/navajo-blankets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional textiles of Northwest Coast tribes are enjoying a dramatic revival. [[Chilkat weaving]] and ravenstail weaving are regarded as some of the most difficult weaving techniques in the world. A single Chilkat blanket can take an entire year to weave. In both techniques, dog, mountain goat, or sheep wool and shredded cedar bark are combined to create textiles featuring curvilinear [[formline designs]]. [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] weaver [[Jennie Thlunaut]] (1982–1986) was instrumental in this revival.

Experimental contemporary textile artists include Martha Gradolf ([[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]]), whose work is overtly political in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Rachel.

==Cultural sensitivity and repatriation==
As in most cultures, Native peoples create some works that are to be used only in sacred, private ceremonies. Many sacred objects or items that contain medicine are to be seen or touched by certain individuals with specialized knowledge. Many [[Pueblo people|Pueblo]] and [[Hopi]] [[kachina|katsina]] figures (''tihü'' in [[Hopi language|Hopi]] and ''kokko'' in [[Zuni language|Zuni]]) and katsinam regalia are not meant to be seen by individuals who have not received instruction about that particular katsina.

Retrieved 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Various tribes prohibit photography of many sacred ceremonies, as used to be the case in many Western cultures.  As several early photographers broke local laws, photographs of sensitive ceremonies are in circulation, but tribes prefer that they not be displayed. The same can be said for photographs or sketches of medicine bundle contents.

Two [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] leaders sued a museum, trying to remove a [[False Face Society mask]] or ''Ga:goh:sah'' from an exhibit because "it was a medicine object intended to be seen only by community members and that its public display would cause irreparable harm to the Mohawk."&lt;ref name=phil&gt;Phillips 49&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Council of the [[Haudenosaunee]] has ruled that such masks are not for sale or public display,&lt;ref name=false/&gt; nor are Corn Husk Society masks.&lt;ref name=corn/&gt;

Tribes and individuals within tribes do not always agree about what is or is not appropriate to display to the public. Many institutions do not exhibit [[Ghost Dance]] regalia.

==Museum representation==
Indigenous American arts have had a long and complicated relationship with museum representation since the early 1900s. In 1931, ''The Exposition of Indian Tribal Arts'' was the first large scale show that held Indigenous art on display. Their portrayal in museums grew more common later in the 1900s as a reaction to the Civil Rights Movement. With the rising trend of representation in the political atmosphere, minority voices gained more representation in museums as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlo|first1=Janet Catherine|title=The Art of Indigenous Americans and American Art History: A Century of Exhibitions|journal=Perspective|date=5 December 2015|issue=2|doi=10.4000/perspective.6004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Indigenous art was being displayed, the curatorial choices on how to display their work were not always made with the best of intentions. For instance, Native American art pieces and artifacts would often be shown alongside dinosaur bones, implying that they are a people of the past and non-existent or irrelevant in today's world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abu Hadal|first1=Katherine|title=Why Native American Art Doesn’t Belong in the American Museum of Natural History|url=http://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/arts-entertainment/why-native-american-art-doesnt-belong-in-the-american-museum-of-natural-history/|website=Indian Country Today|publisher=Indian Country Today Media Network|date=20 February 2013|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American remains were on display in museums up until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Duane H.|title=Exhibiting Culture: American Indians and Museums|journal=Tulsa Law Review|date=2009|volume=45|issue=1|pages=25–32|url=http://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/tlr/vol45/iss1/3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though many did not yet view Native American art as a part of the mainstream as of the year 1992, there has since then been a great increase in volume and quality of both Native art and artists, as well as exhibitions and venues, and individual curators. Such leaders as the director of the National Museum of the American Indian insist that Native American representation be done from a first-hand perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, Joshua. “A New Dawn for Museums of Native American Art.” ''The New York Times'', 20 Aug. 2005, www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/arts/design/a-new-dawn-for-museums-of-native-american-art.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of such museums as the [[Heard Museum]] and the [[National Museum of the American Indian]], both of which trained spotlights specifically upon Native American arts, enabled a great number of Native artists to display and develop their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ash-Milby|first1=Kathleen|last2=Phillips|first2=Ruth B.|title=Inclusivity or Sovereignty?

Museum representation for Indigenous artists calls for great responsibility from curators and museum institutions. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 enacted by George H.W. Bush prohibits non-Indigenous artists from selling art based upon Native American culture. This law has brought to light ideas regarding representation and affected artists’ reputations such as that of Jimmie Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Dear Unsuspecting Public, Jimmie Durham Is a Trickster.” ''Indian Country Media Network'', 26 June 2017, indiancountrymedianetwork.com/news/opinions/dear-unsuspecting-public-jimmie-durham-trickster/.&lt;/ref&gt; Durham creates art based around Indigenous culture, representation, and identity. Despite not being officially enrolled as a Cherokee citizen, he has claimed to be of Cherokee descent, due in part to his participation in the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM). Ultimately, artists like Durham bring up debates regarding what representation is, who it is for, if artists can represent other cultures (and if so, how?), and what the limits of identity are.&lt;ref&gt;Schmelzer, Paul. “How Can Contemporary Art Be More Inclusive of Native Voices?” ''Walker Art Center'', 12 Oct. 2017, walkerart.org/magazine/inclusion-native-american-art-panel-discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions and curators work in sync with these topics, discussing who to represent, why are they being chosen, what Indigenous Art looks like, and what its purpose is. Together, they shape the narrative of Indigenous culture in a meaningful way. Museums, as educational institutions, give light to cultures and narratives that would otherwise go unseen; they provide a necessary spotlight and who they choose to represent is pivotal to the history of the represented artists and culture.

'''Yazılıkaya''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]; ''inscribed rock'') was a sanctuary of [[Hattusa]], the capital city of the [[Hittite Empire]], today in the [[Çorum Province]], [[Turkey]].  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]], and these are generally regarded as the most important group. 
[[File:Yazilikaya B Thudalija.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rock carving in Chamber B depicting god Sharruma and King Tudhaliya dated to around 1250 - 1220 BC.]]

This was a holy site for the [[Hittites]], located within walking distance of the gates of the city of [[Hattusa]]. It had two main chambers formed inside a group of rock outcrops. Access to the roofless chambers were controlled by gateway and building structures built right in front of them, however only the foundations of those structures survived today. Most impressive today are the [[rock relief]]s of Chambers A and B portraying the gods of the Hittite pantheon. One of the uses of the sanctuary may have involved the New Year's celebrations ceremonies. It was in use at least since late 16th century BCE, but most of the rock carvings date to the reign of the Hittite kings [[Tudhaliya IV]] and [[Suppiluliuma II]] in the late 13th century BCE, when the site underwent a significant restoration.
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Chamber B relief with the twelve gods of the underworld.]]

The most impressive is Chamber A, which contains rock-cut relief of 64 deities in procession. The left wall shows a procession of male deities, wearing the traditional kilts, pointed shoes and horned hats. Mountain gods are also shown with scaled skirts to symbolise the rocky mountains. The right wall shows a procession of female deities wearing crowns and long skirts. The only exception to this divide is the goddess of love and war, [[Shaushka]] (Mesopotamian goddess [[Ishtar]]/[[Inanna]]) who is shown on the male procession with two female attendants. This is likely to be because of her male attributes as the goddess of war. The processions lead to a central scene of the supreme couple of the pantheon: the storm-god [[Teshub]] and the sun-goddess [[Hebat]]. Teshub stands on two mountain gods whilst Hebat stands on a panther. Behind Hebat are shown their son [[Sharruma]], daughter [[Alanzu]] and a granddaughter.

The smaller and narrower Chamber B has fewer but larger and better preserved reliefs. It may have served as a mortuary mausoleum or memorial for the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV.

It is intriguing to note how the Hittite practise of assimilating other cultures' gods into their own pantheon is in evidence at Yazilikaya. The Mesopotamian god of wisdom, Ea ([[Enki]]) is shown in the male procession and the god Teshub was a [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] god who was syncretized with the Hittite storm-god. Hebat's original consort was changed into her and Teshub's son (Sharruma) and she was later syncretized with the Hattic sun-goddess of [[Arinna]]. It is believed that the wife of the Hittite king Hattusili III, [[Puduhepa]], who was the daughter of a Hurrian priestess, also played a role in the increasing Hurrian influence on Hittite cult.
