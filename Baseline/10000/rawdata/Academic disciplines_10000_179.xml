'''Ace Centre''' (previously  '''ACE Centre''' (Aiding Communication in Education), ACE Centre North) provides support for people with complex communications difficulties. Ace Centre offer assessment, training and information services across England, with a focus on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) and Assistive Technology (AT). AThe ACE Centre have two offices are based in [[Oldham]] and Abingdon, and provide assessment services to [[England and Wales]] and are non-profit making independent organisation with charitable status.

== Brief outline ==
Ace Centre is a registered charity (No. 1089313) providing support for people with complex communications difficulties. 

== Foundation ==

The first ACE Centre was started in 1984 through UK government funding as part of the new initiative to introduce information technology into schools in England and Wales following the end of the Micro-Electronics Project MEP.  During MEP four [[Special education|Special Education]] Micro-technology Resource Centres (SEMERCs) were set up in London (Redbridge), Manchester, Bristol and Newcastle. A special education [[Software engineering|software development]] centre was also established in Manchester.  It was felt that those pupils with severe language or physical disabilities required more specialist support.

This idea for the first ACE centre to support these students came from Tim Southgate (Head of Ormerod Special School) and Prue Fuller, a teacher at the school. They were inspired by the computer research of Patrick Poon at the school. The original staff at the opening of the Centre in May 1984 were Prue Fuller (Director), Andrew Lysley (SEN Teacher), David Colven (Technical Officer) and Pauline Paine (Administrator).  The Centre was managed by Mary Hope at MESU, a post that was later taken over by Tina Detheridge now of Wigit Software.

It was essentially a project under the management of MESU (Micro Electronics Support Unit) a government quango which later merged with CET (Centre for [[Educational technology|Educational Technology]]) to become NCET (the National Centre for Educational Technology). This eventually became Becta (British Educational Communications and Technology Agency) in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=12D0CFAF-3048-7290-FE61D857018897C3 History of the ACE Centre]. (Source for part of the "Founcation" section.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 a second Centre was opened in [[Oldham]]  at Park Dean School It was managed by the head teacher Rhys Williams, who later became principal of Hereward College, and Roger Bates (now of Inclusive Technology).  The first Director proper of ACE Oldham as it was then was Steve Broadbent.  The two Centres in Oldham and Oxford service the north and south of England and Wales respectively.

== History ==

'''Location'''
The ACE Center was housed in a spare classroom at Ormerod special school in [[Headington|Headington, Oxford]] .  Later it moved to temporary buildings on the same site and remained there until the new 'Wooden Spoon' building was erected on [[Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre]] site in 1998.  The new 'Wooden Spoon' building was largely funded by the Wooden Spoon Society&lt;ref&gt;Wooden Spoon: [http://www.woodenspoon.com/projects/project_history.php?sortd=wspoon_commitment&amp;includeref=dynamic Project History].&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially opened by [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] in April 1999. The new building has custom build facilities for assessment and training.

'''Staff'''
It has occupational therapists, speech and language Therapists, special needs and mainstream teachers, assistive technology specialists and support staff.  Early members of staff were Caroline Gray ([[occupational therapist]]), Gillian Hazell (the Nelms, Speech and Language Therapist) and Mark Saville (web page and publications creator).

Prue Fuller retired as director in 1999 and was later awarded an MBE for her services to Assistive and Alternative Communication.  She was also bi-annual president of ISAAC 1998 - 2000.  Caroline Grey became director of the ACE Centre following Prue's retirement until she retired in 2007.  Liz Tapper took over as temporary director until September 2008 and Dr Ben Janubi has been in post since January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;ACE Centre: [http://www.ace-centre.org.uk/index.cfm?pageid=CC3AA672-3048-7290-FE03DC64593E3CD8 Staff Profiles] (incomplete source).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The CAP Project''' This was a government initiative to boost the support and provision of communication aids to school students.&lt;ref&gt;Teach Training Resource Bank: [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100605151523/http://www.ttrb.ac.uk/ViewArticle2.aspx?anchorId=17790&amp;selectedId=18229&amp;menu=17837&amp;ContentId=13930 Evaluation of the Communication Aids Project].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ACE Centres were two of the organisations involved with assessment for this project.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  It initially had a two-year timetable and a £10M budget but was extended for a further two years on the same funding basis. During this time the staffing in the centre increased considerably to cope with the assessment demand.

== Software developments ==
The first software developments at the ace centre was to re-write Sentence Scan and Start-Write for the increasingly popular [[BBC Micro]].  Sentence scan was a switch or keyboard accessible sentence builder with speech support.  Sentences could be built up from sets of stored words or phrases.  Start-Write was a letter/keyboard based program with speech support and sophisticated user support configurations.  Staff from the Centre also contributed to the design of the programs such as 'Prompt Writer' and 'Concept', being created by the Special Needs Software Centre based at the Manchester SEMERC managed by Dave King.

The advent of the [[IBM PC compatible|IBM compatible]] computer lead to more graphics based programs being developed for switch users such as 'Plocka' (Swedish for 'pick up').  Plocka has facilities for creating sorting and matching scenarios for switch users and has a built in [[graphics library]].

* AccessMaths is a program developed for students that need to create geometric drawings but cannot manipulate a mouse. Users can use a laptop keyboard only to produce accurate and detailed mathematical constructions and drawings. Switch users can also manipulate the program via programs like 'The Grid 2' and 'SAW' (see below). It was originally developed on the BBC Master computer but later versions were created for use in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows 3]] and later.  The current version is version 4 which is available in English, Swedish and French.  Number Navigator is also a maths based utility which enables students to do 'sums' within a formatted grid.
* SAW (Special Access to Windows) is a program that was created from a grant from the then [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] to enable switch users to manipulate mathematical equations on screen.  It was quickly realised that creating a programmable scanning on-screen keyboard for Windows (version 3 at the time,) the full functionality of what they were hoping to create - and much more - could be realised by using other programs such as 'MathType'.  These programmable on-screen keyboards (selection sets) are now available for a number of very different applications.  SAw 5 is now an [[Open-source software|open source]] program available from the [[OATS|Oatsoft web site]].
* Hotspots - This program has similar user characteristics to SAW, but is designed for [[Point-and-click|point and click]] environments.  In addition to scanning user defined spots on the screen it can annotate these with sounds, images and text.  It is easy to make simple software switch accessible.

== Publications ==
The Ace Centre has published a number of reviews, guides, and 'how to' documents over the years. as well as contributing articles to conferences and [[peer review]]ed journals.  The main forum for disseminating out work is increasingly through the web site but they regularly give papers at conferences including the ISAAC conference,  Communication Matters, AAATE and others.

== Research and projects ==
Ace Centre works with companies, universities and other charities to:
* Investigate health and education issues for children and adults with complex disabilities
* Support companies to trial new products and develop progressive technology
* Find solutions for an individual or a sector
Research and development projects enhance achievement and good practice in the field; directly, through the development of AT &amp;  AAC, and indirectly through awareness raising, skills building and informing government policy. Service-users with communication disabilities are involved throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://acecentre.org.uk/services/research/|title=Research {{!}} Ace Centre|work=Ace Centre|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AlloSphere includes a three-story cube that has been insulated extensively with sound-absorbing material, making it one of the largest echo-less chambers in the world. Within the chamber are two hemispheres of 5 meter radii, made of perforated aluminum. These are opaque and acoustically transparent.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The AlloSphere at the California NanoSystems Institute, UC Santa Barbara|url = http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/|website = www.allosphere.ucsb.edu|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 26 video projectors, to create as much of a field of vision as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The loudspeaker real-time sound synthesis cluster (140 individual speaker elements plus sub-woofers) is suspended behind the aluminum screen resulting in 3-D audio. Computation clusters include simulation, sensor-array processing, real-time video processing for motion-capture and visual computing, render-farm/real-time ray-tracing and radiosity cluster, and content and prototyping environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The AlloSphere was developed by a team of scientists, led primarily by Professor [[JoAnn Kuchera-Morin]], a professor in the field of Composition, of the Media Arts &amp; Technology Program of UCSB.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Bariloche Atomic Centre''' ({{lang-es|Centro Atómico Bariloche}}) is one of the research and development centres of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. As its name implies, it is located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]]. Bariloche Atomic Centre is responsible for research in [[physics]] and [[nuclear engineering]]. It also hosts the [[Balseiro Institute]], a collaboration between [[National University of Cuyo]] and the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. The Bariloche Atomic Centre opened in 1955 with its first director, [[José Antonio Balseiro]].

== Activity ==
The centre is devoted to basic and applied physics research as well as Nuclear and Mechanical Engineering.

Basic research is focused on deepening understanding of nuclear energy. Applied sciences have provided support for both state- and privately owned companies. The main areas of research include: materials, neutrons, thermodynamics and theoretical physics.

Nuclear Engineering at the Centre is aimed at further developing Argentina's atomic technology. Most of the research is done taking advantage of RA-6, a 1 [[Megawatt|MW]] experimental reactor. Experiments done with the RA-6 include irradiation and radioactive activation of several materials.

Some research groups also focus on refining reactor calculations and performance measurements and designing mechanical devices for those tasks.

Various companies have sprung out of the Bariloche Aromic Center, such as [[INVAP]] y ALTEC.

The '''Staatliches Bauhaus''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtaːtlɪçəs ˈbaʊˌhaʊs|lang|Staatliches Bauhaus.oga|listen}}), commonly known as the '''Bauhaus''', was a [[Germany|German]] [[art school]] operational from 1919 to 1933 that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicized and taught.&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 4th edn., 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-953294-X}}, pp. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bauhaus was founded by [[Walter Gropius]] in [[Weimar]]. The German term ''[[wikt:Bauhaus#German|Bauhaus]]''—literally "building house"—was understood as meaning "School of Building", but in spite of its name and the fact that its founder was an [[architect]], the Bauhaus did not have an [[architecture]] department during its first years of existence. Nonetheless, it was founded with the idea of creating a "total" work of art ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) in which all arts, including architecture, would eventually be brought together. The Bauhaus style later became one of the most influential currents in modern design, [[Modern architecture|Modernist architecture]] and art, design and architectural education.&lt;ref name="archdic"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |location=London |isbn=0-14-051323-X |pages=880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, [[industrial design]], and [[typography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bauhaus Movemen |url=http://www.bauhaus-movement.com/en/ |website=Rethinking the world Art and Technology – A new Unity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school existed in three German cities: [[Weimar]] from 1919 to 1925, [[Dessau]] from 1925 to 1932, and [[Berlin]] from 1932 to 1933, under three different architect-directors: [[Walter Gropius]] from 1919 to 1928, [[Hannes Meyer]] from 1928 to 1930, and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] from 1930 until 1933, when the school was closed by its own leadership under pressure from the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, having been painted as a centre of communist intellectualism. Although the school was closed, the staff continued to spread its idealistic precepts as they left Germany and emigrated all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=...] |first=[contributors Rachel Barnes |title=The 20th-Century art book. |year=2001 |publisher=Phaidon Press |location=London |isbn=0714835420 |edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes of venue and leadership resulted in a constant shifting of focus, technique, instructors, and politics. For example, the pottery shop was discontinued when the school moved from Weimar to Dessau, even though it had been an important revenue source; when Mies van der Rohe took over the school in 1930, he transformed it into a private school, and would not allow any supporters of Hannes Meyer to attend it.

==Bauhaus and German modernism==
[[File:מוזיאון הבאוהאוס1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Bauhaus Museum, Tel Aviv]]]]
{{details|New Objectivity (architecture)}}
Germany's defeat in [[World War I]], the fall of the [[House of Hohenzollern|German monarchy]] and the abolition of censorship under the new, liberal [[Weimar Republic]] allowed an upsurge of radical experimentation in all the arts, which had been suppressed by the old regime. Many Germans of left-wing views were influenced by the cultural experimentation that followed the [[Russian Revolution]], such as [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]]. Such influences can be overstated: Gropius did not share these radical views, and said that Bauhaus was entirely apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'', p. 416&lt;/ref&gt; Just as important was the influence of the 19th century English designer [[William Morris]], who had argued that art should meet the needs of society and that there should be no distinction between form and function.&lt;ref&gt;''Funk and Wagnall's New Encyclopaedia'', Vol 5, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Bauhaus style, also known as the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], was marked by the absence of ornamentation and by harmony between the function of an object or a building and its design.

However, the most important influence on Bauhaus was [[modernism]], a cultural movement whose origins lay as early as the 1880s, and which had already made its presence felt in Germany before the World War, despite the prevailing conservatism. The design innovations commonly associated with Gropius and the Bauhaus—the radically simplified forms, the rationality and functionality, and the idea that [[mass production]] was reconcilable with the individual artistic spirit—were already partly developed in Germany before the Bauhaus was founded. The German national designers' organization [[Deutscher Werkbund]] was formed in 1907 by [[Hermann Muthesius]] to harness the new potentials of mass production, with a mind towards preserving Germany's economic competitiveness with England. In its first seven years, the Werkbund came to be regarded as the authoritative body on questions of design in Germany, and was copied in other countries. Many fundamental questions of craftsmanship versus mass production, the relationship of usefulness and beauty, the practical purpose of formal beauty in a commonplace object, and whether or not a single proper form could exist, were argued out among its 1,870 members (by 1914).

[[File:Bauhaus Chemnitz hb.JPG|right|thumb|Bauhaus building in [[Chemnitz]]]]
The entire movement of German architectural modernism was known as [[New Objectivity (architecture)|Neues Bauen]]. Beginning in June 1907, [[Peter Behrens]]' pioneering [[industrial design]] work for the German electrical company [[AEG]] successfully integrated art and mass production on a large scale. He designed consumer products, standardized parts, created clean-lined designs for the company's graphics, developed a consistent corporate identity, built the modernist landmark [[AEG Turbine Factory]], and made full use of newly developed materials such as poured concrete and exposed steel. Behrens was a founding member of the Werkbund, and both Walter Gropius and [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] worked for him in this period.

The Bauhaus was founded at a time when the German [[zeitgeist]] had turned from emotional [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]] to the matter-of-fact [[New Objectivity]]. An entire group of working architects, including [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Hans Poelzig]], turned away from fanciful experimentation, and turned toward rational, functional, sometimes standardized building. Beyond the Bauhaus, many other significant German-speaking architects in the 1920s responded to the same aesthetic issues and material possibilities as the school. They also responded to the promise of a "minimal dwelling" written into the new [[Weimar Constitution]]. [[Ernst May]], Bruno Taut and [[Martin Wagner (architect)|Martin Wagner]], among others, built large housing blocks in [[Frankfurt]] and Berlin. The acceptance of modernist design into everyday life was the subject of publicity campaigns, well-attended public exhibitions like the [[Weissenhof Estate]], films, and sometimes fierce public debate.

===Bauhaus and Vkhutemas===
{{Main article|Vkhutemas}}
The Vkhutemas, the Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in [[Moscow]], has been compared to Bauhaus. Founded a year after the Bauhaus school, Vkhutemas has close parallels to the German Bauhaus in its intent, organization and scope. The two schools were the first to train artist-designers in a modern manner.&lt;ref name="GSE"&gt;{{ru icon}} ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia; Bolshaya Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya'', [https://archive.is/20050503051137/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/007/304.htm ''Вхутемас'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both schools were state-sponsored initiatives to merge the craft tradition with modern technology, with a basic course in aesthetic principles, courses in [[color theory]], industrial design, and architecture.&lt;ref name="GSE" /&gt; Vkhutemas was a larger school than the Bauhaus,&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Paul (1999) ''The Challenge of the Avant-Garde''. New Haven: [[Yale University Press]] {{ISBN|0-300-07762-9}}, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; but it was less publicised outside the [[Soviet Union]] and consequently, is less familiar in [[Western culture|the West]].&lt;ref name="Fry1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tony Fry |title=A New Design Philosophy: An Introduction to Defuturing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEc7UGv2xQEC |accessdate=15 May 2011 |date=October 1999 |publisher=UNSW Press |isbn=978-0-86840-753-1 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the internationalism of modern architecture and design, there were many exchanges between the Vkhutemas and the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Colton, Timothy J. (1995) ''Moscow: Governing the Socialist Metropolis''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press {{ISBN|0-674-58749-9}}; p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The second Bauhaus director Hannes Meyer attempted to organise an exchange between the two schools, while Hinnerk Scheper of the Bauhaus collaborated with various Vkhutein members on the use of colour in architecture. In addition, [[El Lissitzky]]'s book ''Russia: an Architecture for World Revolution'' published in German in 1930 featured several illustrations of Vkhutemas/Vkhutein projects there.

==History of the Bauhaus==
===Weimar===
The school was founded by Walter Gropius in [[Weimar]] in 1919, as a merger of the [[Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School]] and the Weimar Academy of Fine Art. Its roots lay in the arts and crafts school founded by the [[William Ernest, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] in 1906, and directed by Belgian [[Art Nouveau]] architect [[Henry van de Velde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=James Stevens Curl |editor=Pevsner, Nikolaus |others=Fleming, John; Honour, Hugh |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=1999 |type=Paperback |edition=5th |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=0-19-860678-8 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; When van de Velde was forced to resign in 1915 because he was Belgian, he suggested Gropius, [[Hermann Obrist]] and [[August Endell]] as possible successors. In 1919, after delays caused by the destruction of [[World War I]] and a lengthy debate over who should head the institution and the socio-economic meanings of a reconciliation of the [[fine art]]s and the [[applied art]]s (an issue which remained a defining one throughout the school's existence), Gropius was made the director of a new institution integrating the two called the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name="Frampton 1992 124"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frampton |first=Kenneth |title=Modern Architecture: A Critical History |year=1992 |edition=3rd ed. rev. |publisher=Thames and Hudson, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-20257-5 |page=124 |chapter=The Bauhaus: Evolution of an Idea 1919–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pamphlet for an April 1919 exhibition entitled ''Exhibition of Unknown Architects'', Gropius proclaimed his goal as being "to create a new guild of craftsmen, without the class distinctions which raise an arrogant barrier between craftsman and artist." Gropius' [[neologism]] ''Bauhaus'' references both building and the Bauhütte, a [[premodern]] [[guild]] of stonemasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Whitford, Frank |title=The Bauhaus: Masters &amp; Students by Themselves |year=1992 |publisher=Conran Octopus |location=London |isbn=1-85029-415-1 |page=32 |quote=He invented the name 'Bauhaus' not only because it specifically referred to bauen ('building', 'construction')—but also because of its similarity to the word Bauhütte, the medieval guild of builders and stonemasons out of which Freemasonry sprang. The Bauhaus was to be a kind of modern Bauhütte, therefore, in which craftsmen would work on common projects together, the greatest of which would be buildings in which the arts and crafts would be combined.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early intention was for the Bauhaus to be a combined architecture school, crafts school, and academy of the arts. Swiss painter [[Johannes Itten]], German-American painter [[Lyonel Feininger]], and German sculptor [[Gerhard Marcks]], along with Gropius, comprised the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1919. By the following year their ranks had grown to include German painter, sculptor and designer [[Oskar Schlemmer]] who headed the theater workshop, and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]], joined in 1922 by Russian painter [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. A tumultuous year at the Bauhaus, 1922 also saw the move of Dutch painter [[Theo van Doesburg]] to Weimar to promote ''[[De Stijl]]'' ("The Style"), and a visit to the Bauhaus by Russian Constructivist artist and architect [[El Lissitzky]].&lt;ref name="foster"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Hal Foster |others=Rosalind Krauss, Yve-Alain Bois, Benjamin Buchloh |title=Art Since 1900: Volume 1—1900 to 1944|year=2004 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-500-28534-9 |pages=185–189 |chapter=1923: The Bauhaus … holds its first public exhibition in Weimar, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Weimarbauhaus6.jpg|thumb|Foyer of the Bauhaus-University Weimar, with [[Art Nouveau|Jugendstil]] staircase]]
From 1919 to 1922 the school was shaped by the pedagogical and aesthetic ideas of [[Johannes Itten]], who taught the ''Vorkurs'' or "preliminary course" that was the introduction to the ideas of the Bauhaus.&lt;ref name="Frampton 1992 124" /&gt; Itten was heavily influenced in his teaching by the ideas of [[Franz Cižek]] and [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]. He was also influenced in respect to aesthetics by the work of the [[Der Blaue Reiter]] group in [[Munich]], as well as the work of Austrian Expressionist [[Oskar Kokoschka]]. The influence of German [[Expressionism]] favoured by Itten was analogous in some ways to the fine arts side of the ongoing debate. This influence culminated with the addition of [[Der Blaue Reiter]] founding member [[Wassily Kandinsky]] to the faculty and ended when Itten resigned in late 1922. Itten was replaced by the Hungarian designer [[László Moholy-Nagy]], who rewrote the ''Vorkurs'' with a leaning towards the New Objectivity favored by Gropius, which was analogous in some ways to the applied arts side of the debate. Although this shift was an important one, it did not represent a radical break from the past so much as a small step in a broader, more gradual socio-economic movement that had been going on at least since 1907, when van de Velde had argued for a craft basis for design while [[Hermann Muthesius]] had begun implementing industrial prototypes.&lt;ref name="foster" /&gt;

Gropius was not necessarily against [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], and in fact himself in the same 1919 pamphlet proclaiming this "new guild of craftsmen, without the class snobbery", described "painting and sculpture rising to heaven out of the hands of a million craftsmen, the crystal symbol of the new faith of the future." By 1923, however, Gropius was no longer evoking images of soaring [[Regional characteristics of Romanesque architecture#Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics|Romanesque cathedrals]] and the craft-driven aesthetic of the "[[Völkisch movement]]", instead declaring "we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=1987 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |pages=309–316 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gropius argued that a new period of history had begun with the end of the war. He wanted to create a new architectural style to reflect this new era. His style in architecture and consumer goods was to be functional, cheap and consistent with mass production. To these ends, Gropius wanted to reunite art and craft to arrive at high-end functional products with artistic merit. The Bauhaus issued a magazine called ''Bauhaus'' and a series of books called "Bauhausbücher". Since the Weimar Republic lacked the quantity of raw materials available to the United States and Great Britain, it had to rely on the proficiency of a skilled labor force and an ability to export innovative and high quality goods. Therefore, designers were needed and so was a new type of art education. The school's philosophy stated that the artist should be trained to work with the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bauhaus, 1919–1933 |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm |website=The MET |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bauhaus |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Bauhaus |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weimar was in the German state of [[Thuringia]], and the Bauhaus school received state support from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]]-controlled Thuringian state government. The school in Weimar experienced political pressure from conservative circles in Thuringian politics, increasingly so after 1923 as political tension rose. One condition placed on the Bauhaus in this new political environment was the exhibition of work undertaken at the school. This condition was met in 1923 with the Bauhaus' exhibition of the experimental [[Haus am Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;Ackermann et al., Bauhaus (Cologne: Könemann, 1999), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education placed the staff on six-month contracts and cut the school's funding in half. The Bauhaus issued a press release on 26 December 1924, setting the closure of the school for the end of March 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baumgartner and Josef Helfenstein [http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm At the Bauhaus in Weimar, 1921–1924] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929012710/http://www.paulkleezentrum.ch/ww/en/pub/web_root/act/wissenschaftliches_archiv/werkphasen/am_bauhaus_in_weimar_1921_1924.cfm |date=29 September 2009}}, at Zentrum Paul Klee&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Droste (2002) [1990] [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXB8rX5AsgUC ''Bauhaus, 1919–1933''] p.113&lt;/ref&gt; At this point it had already been looking for alternative sources of funding. After the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, a school of industrial design with teachers and staff less antagonistic to the conservative political regime remained in Weimar. This school was eventually known as the Technical University of Architecture and Civil Engineering, and in 1996 changed its name to [[Bauhaus-University Weimar]].

===Dessau===
Gropius's design for the [[Dessau]] facilities was a return to the futuristic Gropius of 1914 that had more in common with the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] lines of the [[Fagus Factory]] than the stripped down [[Neoclassical architecture#Regional trends|Neo-classical]] of the Werkbund pavilion or the ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' Sommerfeld House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=William |title=Modern Architecture Since 1900 |year=2000 |edition=2nd |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0-13-586694-4 |page=120 |chapter=Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Dessau years, there was a remarkable change in direction for the school. According to Elaine Hoffman, Gropius had approached the Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]] to run the newly founded architecture program, and when Stam declined the position, Gropius turned to Stam's friend and colleague in the ABC group, Hannes Meyer.

Meyer became director when Gropius resigned in February 1928,&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"/&gt; and brought the Bauhaus its two most significant building commissions, both of which still exist: five apartment buildings in the city of Dessau, and the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer favored measurements and calculations in his presentations to clients, along with the use of off-the-shelf architectural components to reduce costs. This approach proved attractive to potential clients. The school turned its first profit under his leadership in 1929.

But Meyer also generated a great deal of conflict. As a radical functionalist, he had no patience with the aesthetic program, and forced the resignations of [[Herbert Bayer]], [[Marcel Breuer]], and other long-time instructors. Even though Meyer shifted the orientation of the school further to the left than it had been under Gropius, he didn't want the school to become a tool of left-wing party politics. He prevented the formation of a student communist cell, and in the increasingly dangerous political atmosphere, this became a threat to the existence of the Dessau school. Dessau mayor Fritz Hesse fired him in the summer of 1930.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard A. Etlin |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MTYQuQ2g36MC |accessdate=15 May 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-22086-4 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dessau city council attempted to convince Gropius to return as head of the school, but Gropius instead suggested [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. Mies was appointed in 1930, and immediately interviewed each student, dismissing those that he deemed uncommitted. He halted the school's manufacture of goods so that the school could focus on teaching, and appointed no new faculty other than his close confidant [[Lilly Reich]]. By 1931, the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]]  (Nazi Party) was becoming more influential in German politics. When it gained control of the Dessau city council, it moved to close the school.&lt;ref name="Mies"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Spaeth |title=Ludwig Mies van der Rohe |year=1985 |publisher=Rizzoli New York |isbn=0-8478-0563-8 |pages=87–93}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Berlin===
In late 1932, Mies rented a derelict factory in Berlin (Birkbusch Street 49) to use as the new Bauhaus with his own money. The students and faculty rehabilitated the building, painting the interior white. The school operated for ten months without further interference from the Nazi Party. In 1933, the [[Gestapo]] closed down the Berlin school. Mies protested the decision, eventually speaking to the head of the Gestapo, who agreed to allow the school to re-open. However, shortly after receiving a letter permitting the opening of the Bauhaus, Mies and the other faculty agreed to voluntarily shut down the school {{when|date=July 2017}}.&lt;ref name="Mies"/&gt;

Although neither the Nazi Party nor [[Adolf Hitler]] had a cohesive architectural policy before they came to power in 1933, Nazi writers like [[Wilhelm Frick]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]] had already labeled the Bauhaus "un-German" and criticized its modernist styles, deliberately generating public controversy over issues like flat roofs. Increasingly through the early 1930s, they characterized the Bauhaus as a front for communists and social liberals. Indeed, a number of communist students loyal to Meyer moved to the [[Soviet Union]] when he was fired in 1930.

Even before the Nazis came to power, political pressure on Bauhaus had increased. The Nazi movement, from nearly the start, denounced the Bauhaus for its "[[degenerate art]]", and the Nazi regime was determined to crack down on what it saw as the foreign, probably Jewish influences of "cosmopolitan modernism".&lt;ref name="Artists 2009 pp. 64-66"/&gt; Despite Gropius's protestations that as a war veteran and a patriot his work had no subversive political intent, the Berlin Bauhaus was pressured to close in April 1933. Emigrants did succeed, however, in spreading the concepts of the Bauhaus to other countries, including the "New Bauhaus" of Chicago:&lt;ref&gt;Jardi, Enric (1991) ''Paul Klee''. Rizzoli Intl Pubns, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Mies decided to emigrate to the United States for the directorship of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute (now [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]) in Chicago and to seek building commissions.{{Ref label|fn_1|a|a}} The simple engineering-oriented functionalism of stripped-down modernism, however, did lead to some Bauhaus influences living on in [[Nazi Germany]]. When Hitler's chief engineer, [[Fritz Todt]], began opening the new [[autobahn]] (highways) in 1935, many of the bridges and service stations were "bold examples of modernism"—among those submitting designs was Mies van der Rohe.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Evans, ''The Third Reich in Power'', 325&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural output==
The paradox of the early Bauhaus was that, although its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bauhausmanifesto.com |title= Manifesto of the Staatliches Bauhaus |author=Gropius, Walter |date=April 1919 |work=BauhausManifesto.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), he and his partner [[Adolf Meyer (architect)|Adolf Meyer]] observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in [[Jena]], and the competition design for the [[Chicago Tribune Tower]], which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 [[Haus am Horn]], student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.

In the next two years under Meyer, the architectural focus shifted away from aesthetics and towards functionality. There were major commissions: one from the city of Dessau for five tightly designed "Laubenganghäuser" (apartment buildings with balcony access), which are still in use today, and another for the [[ADGB Trade Union School|Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes]] (ADGB Trade Union School) in [[Bernau bei Berlin]]. Meyer's approach was to research users' needs and scientifically develop the design solution.

[[Mies van der Rohe]] repudiated Meyer's politics, his supporters, and his architectural approach. As opposed to Gropius's "study of essentials", and Meyer's research into user requirements, Mies advocated a "spatial implementation of intellectual decisions", which effectively meant an adoption of his own aesthetics. Neither Mies van der Rohe nor his Bauhaus students saw any projects built during the 1930s.

The popular conception of the Bauhaus as the source of extensive Weimar-era working housing is not accurate. Two projects, the apartment building project in Dessau and the Törten row housing also in Dessau, fall in that category, but developing worker housing was not the first priority of Gropius nor Mies. It was the Bauhaus contemporaries [[Bruno Taut]], [[Hans Poelzig]] and particularly [[Ernst May]], as the city architects of Berlin, [[Dresden]] and [[Frankfurt]] respectively, who are rightfully credited with the thousands of socially progressive housing units built in [[Weimar Germany]]. The housing Taut built in south-west Berlin during the 1920s, close to the U-Bahn stop [[Onkel Toms Hütte (Berlin U-Bahn)|Onkel Toms Hütte]], is still occupied.

==Impact==
[[File:Olivetti-schawinsky-bauhaus-typewriter.jpg|thumb|Typewriter ''Olivetti Studio 42'' designed by the Bauhaus-alumnus [[Xanti Schawinsky]] in 1936]]
The Bauhaus had a major impact on art and architecture trends in Western Europe, the United States, Canada and [[Israel]] in the decades following its demise, as many of the artists involved fled, or were exiled by, the Nazi regime. Tel Aviv in 2004 was named to the list of [[world heritage]] sites by the UN due to its abundance of Bauhaus architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3777385.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Unesco celebrates Tel Aviv |date=8 June 2004 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1096 |title=White City of Tel-Aviv -- the Modern Movement |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had some 4,000 Bauhaus buildings erected from 1933 onwards.

In 1928, the Hungarian painter Alexander Bortnyik founded a school of design in [[Budapest]] called Miihely (also "Muhely"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1976, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Mugely"&lt;ref&gt;William Chapin Seitz, Marla Price, ''Art in the Age of Aquarius'', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1992, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;), which means "the studio".&lt;ref name="Gaston Diehl 1972, p. 12"&gt;Gaston Diehl, ''Vasarely'', New York: Crown, 1972, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the seventh floor of a house on Nagymezo Street,&lt;ref name="Gaston Diehl 1972, p. 12"/&gt; it was meant to be the Hungarian equivalent to the Bauhaus.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, ''History of Abstract Painting'', Paris: Hazan, 1989, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The literature sometimes refers to it—in an oversimplified manner—as "the Budapest Bauhaus".&lt;ref&gt;See: William Chapin Seitz, Marla Price, ''Art in the Age of Aquarius'', Smithsonian Inst Press, 1992, p. 92; Edward Lucie-Smith, ''Late Modern: The Visual Arts Since 1945'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1976, p. 164; Jean Louis Ferrier, Yann Le Pichon, Art of our century: the story of western art, 1900 to the present 1990, London : Longman, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt; Bortnyik was a great admirer of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and had met Walter Gropius in Weimar between 1923 and 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Guitemie Maldonaldo, "Une réception différée et relayée. L'Atelier d'art abstrait et le "modèle-Bauhaus", 1950–1953", in: Martin Schieder, Isabelle Ewig, ''In die Freiheit geworfen: Positionen zur deutsch-französischen Kunstgeschichte nach 1945'', Oldenbourg Verlag, 22 Nov 2006, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Moholy-Nagy himself taught at the Miihely. [[Victor Vasarely]], a pioneer of [[Op Art]], studied at this school before establishing in Paris in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Louis Ferrier, Yann Le Pichon, ''Art of Our Century: The Story of Western Art, 1900 to the Present'', 1990, London: Longman, p. 521.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Gropius, [[Marcel Breuer]], and Moholy-Nagy re-assembled in Britain during the mid 1930s to live and work in the [[Isokon]] project before the war caught up with them. Gropius and Breuer went to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] and worked together before their professional split. Their collaboration produced The Aluminum City Terrace in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and the [[Alan I W Frank House]] in Pittsburgh, among other projects. The Harvard School was enormously influential in America in the late 1920s and early 1930s, producing such students as [[Philip Johnson]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Lawrence Halprin]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], among many others.

In the late 1930s, [[Mies van der Rohe]] re-settled in Chicago, enjoyed the sponsorship of the influential [[Philip Johnson]], and became one of the pre-eminent architects in the world. Moholy-Nagy also went to Chicago and founded the [[New Bauhaus]] school under the sponsorship of industrialist and philanthropist [[Walter Paepcke]]. This school became the [[Institute of Design IIT|Institute of Design]], part of the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]]. Printmaker and painter [[Werner Drewes]] was also largely responsible for bringing the Bauhaus aesthetic to America and taught at both [[Columbia University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. [[Herbert Bayer]], sponsored by Paepcke, moved to [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], Colorado in support of Paepcke's Aspen projects at the [[Aspen Institute]]. In 1953, [[Max Bill]], together with [[Inge Scholl|Inge Aicher-Scholl]] and [[Otl Aicher]], founded the [[Ulm School of Design]] (German: Hochschule für Gestaltung—HfG Ulm) in Ulm, Germany, a design school in the tradition of the Bauhaus. The school is notable for its inclusion of [[semiotics]] as a field of study. The school closed in 1968, but the "Ulm Model" concept continues to influence international design education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/the_hfg_ulm/|title=HfG-Archiv Ulm - The HfG Ulm|first=Ulmer Museum/HfG-Archiv|last=Ulm|website=www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the Bauhaus on design education was significant. One of the main objectives of the Bauhaus was to unify art, craft, and technology, and this approach was incorporated into the curriculum of the Bauhaus. The structure of the Bauhaus ''Vorkurs'' (preliminary course) reflected a pragmatic approach to integrating theory and application. In their first year, students learnt the basic elements and principles of design and colour theory, and experimented with a range of materials and processes.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, H., Gropius, W., &amp; Gropius, I. (Eds.). (1975). ''Bauhaus 1919–1928''. London: Secker&amp; Warburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Itten 1963"&gt;Itten, J. (1963). ''Design and Form: The Basic Course at the Bauhaus and Later'' (Revised edition, 1975). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to design education became a common feature of architectural and design school in many countries. For example, the Shillito Design School in Sydney stands as a unique link between Australia and the Bauhaus. The colour and design syllabus of the Shillito Design School was firmly underpinned by the theories and ideologies of the Bauhaus. Its first year foundational course mimicked the ''Vorkurs'' and focused on the elements and principles of design plus colour theory and application. The founder of the school, Phyllis Shillito, which opened in 1962 and closed in 1980, firmly believed that "A student who has mastered the basic principles of design, can design anything from a dress to a kitchen stove".&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Z. (2013). "The Shillito Design School: Australia's link with the Bauhaus". ''The International Journal of Design in Society'', 6(3), 149–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important contributions of the Bauhaus is in the field of [[modern furniture]] design. The ubiquitous [[Cantilever chair]] and the [[Wassily Chair]] designed by [[Marcel Breuer]] are two examples. (Breuer eventually lost a legal battle in Germany with Dutch architect/designer [[Mart Stam]] over the rights to the cantilever chair patent. Although Stam had worked on the design of the Bauhaus's 1923 exhibit in Weimar, and guest-lectured at the Bauhaus later in the 1920s, he was not formally associated with the school, and he and Breuer had worked independently on the cantilever concept, thus leading to the patent dispute.) The single most profitable tangible product of the Bauhaus was its wallpaper.

The physical plant at Dessau survived [[World War II]] and was operated as a design school with some architectural facilities by the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. This included live stage productions in the Bauhaus theater under the name of ''Bauhausbühne'' ("Bauhaus Stage"). After [[German reunification]], a reorganized school continued in the same building, with no essential continuity with the Bauhaus under Gropius in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/en/|title=Bauhaus Dessau|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 Bauhaus-Dessau College started to organize postgraduate programs with participants from all over the world. This effort has been supported by the Bauhaus-Dessau Foundation which was founded in 1974 as a public institution.

Later evaluation of the Bauhaus design credo was critical of its flawed recognition of the human element, an acknowledgment of "… the dated, unattractive aspects of the Bauhaus as a projection of utopia marked by mechanistic views of human nature…Home hygiene without home atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;Schjeldahl, Peter, "Bauhaus Rules," ''The New Yorker'', November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===The White City===
The [[White City (Tel Aviv)|White City of Tel Aviv]] ({{lang-he|העיר הלבנה}}, ''Ha-Ir HaLevana'') refers to a collection of over 4,000 Bauhaus or [[International style (architecture)|International style]] buildings built in [[Tel Aviv]] from the 1930s by [[German Jewish]] architects who emigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] after the rise of the [[Nazis]]. Tel Aviv has the largest number of buildings in this style of any city in the world. In 2003, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) proclaimed Tel Aviv's ''White City'' a [[World Heritage Site|World Cultural Heritage site]], as "an outstanding example of new town planning and architecture in the early 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], [http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/718 ''Decision Text''], World Heritage Centre, retrieved 14 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2000, [[Bauhaus Center Tel Aviv]] is an organization dedicated to the ongoing documentation of the architectural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/965644.html "The Bauhaus Center"], ''Haaretz'', 18 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it hosted an exhibition on preservation of the architecture that showcased 25 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Zandberg, [http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/objects/pages/PrintArticle.jhtml?itemNo=350188 ''Exhibition on Preservation of Bauhaus in Tel Aviv''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605095415/http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasite/objects/pages/PrintArticle.jhtml?itemNo=350188 |date=5 June 2011 }}, Haaretz, 15 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; To further the architectural culture in the city, a small [[Bauhaus Museum]] opened in Tel Aviv in 2008, designed by Israeli architect [[Ron Arad (industrial designer)|Ron Arad]].&lt;ref&gt;Esther Hecht, [http://archrecord.construction.com/news/daily/archives/080421bauhaus.asp "Bauhaus Museum Opens in Tel Aviv's White City"], ''Architectural Record'', 21 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Bachar, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/949759.html "Surroundings / Daniella Luxembourg's Bauhaus kiosk"], ''Haaretz'', 1 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological determinism of human gender roles''' is the view that human sexuality is [[genetic determinism|controlled by an individual's genes]] or some component of their [[physiology]]. This is an aspect of [[biological determinism]], the wider view that human behaviour is determined by biological factors. Both views regard the contribution of learning and other environmental factors in a person's development as being over-stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Taylor A. | editor-first1 = Verta | editor-last2 = Rupp | editor-first2 = Leila J. | editor-last3 = Whittier | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Feminist frontiers | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=o6WMkQEACAAJ | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2012 | edition = 9th | isbn = 9780078026621 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Naiman | first = Joanne | title = How societies work: class, power, and change | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=diypPAAACAAJ | publisher = Fernwood Publishing | location = Halifax, Winnipeg | year = 2012 | edition = 5th | isbn = 9781552664810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of human gender roles==

===Gender assignment===
Lynda Birke's ''In Pursuit of Difference'' argues that the discipline of human biology often presents "clear-cut differences"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Birke | first = Lynda | chapter = In pursuit of difference: scientific studies of women and men | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KgcpAAAAYAAJ | title = Feminism and the biological body | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780813528236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between sexes with regards to chromosomes, genetics, and inheritance. However, while obvious physical differences between males and females exist and develop during puberty, hormonal differences are "not absolute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Laurie|first=Timothy|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-03/laurie-bigotry-or-biology/6514156|title=Bigotry or biology: the hard choice for an opponent of marriage equality | work = [[The Drum (TV program)|The Drum]]|publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]] | location = Australia|date=3 June 2015|access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a broad range of reproductive anatomy that doesn't necessarily fit the "gender definition" of male or female. According to the [[Intersex Society of North America]], "a person may be born with mosaic genetics", differing in their chromosomal configuration.&lt;ref name="isna.org"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Home page | url = http://www.isna.org | website = isna.org | publisher = [[Intersex Society of North America]] |access-date=9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homosexuality===
{{main|Biology and sexual orientation|Neuroscience and sexual orientation}}

Though scientists are unsure as to whether [[homosexuality]] can be attributed to biological or social factors, [[LGBT]] rights activists have used the theories of biological determinism to support their cause. This has become a frequent point of dissension between [[pro-gay]] individuals and [[anti-gay]] individuals. Due to the fact that a single cause has not been determined as the cause of homosexuality, many scholars theorize that a combination of biological and social causes determine one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Abramson | first1 = Paul R. | last2 = Pinkerton | first2 = Steven D. | author-link1 = Paul R. Abramson | chapter = Introduction: Nature, nurture, and in-between | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5SUFxfft7zMC&amp;pg=PA4 | title = Sexual nature, sexual culture | page = 4 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780226001821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gay rights advocates]] believe that proving that homosexuality has a definite biological basis will prove it to be an unchangeable characteristic, thus allowing homosexuals to be protected under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brookey | first = Robert Alan | title = Bio-rhetoric, background beliefs and the biology of homosexuality | journal = [[Argumentation and Advocacy]] | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | date = 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/00028533.2001.11951668 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area of research that has been a valuable tool for gay rights activists has been [[Dean Hamer]]'s work studying the "[[Biology and sexual orientation#Chromosome linkage studies|gay gene]]". Another researcher who worked with Hamer in finding evidence for biological influence in male homosexuality was [[Simon LeVay]], a neuroscientist. In 1991, LeVay published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that detailed the difference in [[hypothalamic structure]]s between homosexual and heterosexual men. His findings in studying the [[INAH 3|INAH-3]] implied that "sexual orientation has a biological substrate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spanier | first = Bonnie | title = Biological determinism and homosexuality | journal = [[NWSA Journal]], special issue: Sexual Orientation | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Spring 1995 | jstor = 4316378 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his research showed that there was a biological basis in sexual orientation, LeVay cautioned against people interpreting his article to say that he found that homosexuality is genetic, emphasizing that he did not "locate a gay center in the brain—[as] INAH3 is less likely to be the sole gay nucleus of the brain than part of a chain of nuclei engaged in men and women's sexual behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimmons|first=David|title=Sex and the brain|url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/mar/sexandthebrain346/?searchterm=levay#.UpLnSGRDuqw|work=[[Discover Magazine]]|date=March 1994 | access-date =9 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He merely hoped that his work would serve as a catalyst in working towards finding more evidence that homosexuality is at least partly genetic.

===Social construction===
{{main|Social construction of gender}}
{{POV check|section|date=April 2017|talk=Social construction}}

[[Richard Lewontin]], [[Steven Rose]], and [[Leon Kamin]] were interested in the way that biological determinism was present in science. They wanted to figure out how much of it was true, and how much of it was socially constructed according to certain beliefs and societal norms and determined gender roles within society. In their book ''[[Not in Our Genes]]'' they explore the possibilities of biological determinism. In their studies, they found some very interesting evidence that points to the fact that biological determinism in science is actually greatly affected by certain norms and tendencies within society. According to them, biological determinism is more constructed by society than by anything else. In a study that was performed on girls who were relatively "[[masculinity|masculinized]]", biological determinists [[John Money]] and [[Anke Ehrhardt]] looked for ways to describe femininity that fit into the common definition of it, such as clothing preference or using makeup. Although these scientists believed that they were providing evidence to support their definitions of femininity within nature, they fell into the trap of labeling these girls according to Western social standards. As Lewontin points out, this experiment not only embraces the stereotypes that already existed, but it also "ignores the existence of societies in which women wear pants, or in which men wear skirts, or in which men enjoy and appropriate jewelry to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | year = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin realize that biological determinism is clouded and, can in fact, be shaped according to the standards and norms of the society one lives in. Therefore, they choose to take a different approach. They decide to look at numbers and statistics instead of simple social experiments which can be easily misinterpreted. When they look at the numbers and statistics of men and women over the years, they discover that the differences between men and women are no longer as pronounced as they had been in the past. All of a sudden, there are more women in the work place holding higher ranking jobs. More women are excelling in areas that used to be male dominant, such as sports. And, even biologically, women are beginning to catch up to men in height while men are beginning to catch up in life expectancy. However, these changes are mostly visible in numbers and statistics, and social differences between men and women are still easily observed. Lewontin, Rose, and Kamin argue, however, that these differences are imposed by society itself.

The [[Anne Fausto-Sterling#The Standard Model|standard model]] for the difference between sex/gender states that there is a clear-cut dichotomy between males &amp; females, with no overlap. [[Margaret W. Rossiter]]’s article “Women’s Work in Science” discusses how in the 1880s women were introduced to the science field and hired, but although employed they were still segregated from men in the science field.&lt;ref name="Rossiter"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rossiter | first = Margaret W. | title = "Women's Work" in Science, 1880-1910 | journal = [[Isis (journal)|Isis]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 381&amp;ndash;398 | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | doi = 10.2307/230118 | jstor = 230118 | date = September 1980 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/230118 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rossiter, segregation started because it was apparent that men and women worked differently and had different "talents" to offer in the field of science.&lt;ref name="Rossiter" /&gt; To add to this, women in the 1880s got paid less than the male worker in the science field. Women got paid an average of "two hundred dollars less" than their male coworkers yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jardins | first = Julie | chapter = To embrace or decline marriage and family: Annie Jump Cannon and the women of the Harvard Observatory, 1880-1940 | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HULGDNDSenYC&amp;pg=PA92 | title = The Madame Curie complex: the hidden history of women in science | page = 92 | publisher = Feminist Press at the City University of New York | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781558616134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this norm there is a historically constructed viewpoint of "average", meaning that society holds the idea that one must be either male or female, feminine or masculine. [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]]'s article "''[[Sexing the Body|Of Gender and Genitals]]''" discusses how this standard model shapes doctors' ideas about gender and what is socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fausto-Sterling | first = Anne | author-link = Anne Fausto-Sterling | chapter = Of gender and genitals: the use and abuse of the modern intersexual | chapterurl = https://libcom.org/files/Fausto-Sterling%20-%20Sexing%20the%20Body.pdf | title = Sexing the body | pages = 44&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | isbn = 9780465077144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that (according to the standard model) "Bodies in the "normal" range are culturally intelligible as males or females, but the rules for living as male or female are strict", meaning that people are culturally "trained" in believing that there is a sexual binary and anything outside of those confines is rejected.

'''Cogeneration''' or '''combined heat and power''' ('''CHP''') is the use of a [[heat engine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ Cogeneration and Cogeneration Schematic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209230320/http://www.clarke-energy.com/chp-cogeneration/ |date=2013-12-09 }}, www.clarke-energy.com, retrieved 26.11.11&lt;/ref&gt; or [[power station]] to [[electricity generation|generate electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time. '''Trigeneration''' or '''combined cooling, heat and power''' ('''CCHP''') refers to the simultaneous generation of electricity and useful heating and cooling from the combustion of a fuel or a solar heat collector. The terms ''cogeneration'' and ''trigeneration'' can be also applied to the power systems generating simultaneously electricity, heat, and industrial chemicals – e.g., [[syngas]] or pure [[hydrogen]] (article: [[combined cycle]]s, chapter: [[Combined cycle#Natural gas integrated power &amp; syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle|natural gas integrated power &amp; syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle]]).

Cogeneration is a more efficient use of fuel because otherwise wasted heat from electricity generation is put to some productive use. Combined heat and power (CHP) plants recover otherwise wasted [[thermal energy]] for [[HVAC#heating|heating]]. This is also called combined heat and power district heating. Small CHP plants are an example of [[Distributed generation|decentralized energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dekb.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=93|title=What is Decentralised Energy?|publisher=The Decentralised Energy Knowledge Base|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210123230/http://www.dekb.co.uk/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=93|archivedate=2008-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By-product heat at moderate temperatures (100–180&amp;nbsp;°C, 212–356&amp;nbsp;°F) can also be used in [[absorption refrigerator]]s for cooling.

The supply of high-temperature heat first drives a [[gas turbine|gas]] or [[steam turbine]]-powered generator. The resulting low-temperature waste heat is then used for water or space heating. At smaller scales (typically below 1 MW) a [[gas engine]] or [[diesel engine]] may be used. Trigeneration differs from cogeneration in that the [[waste heat]] is used for both heating and cooling, typically in an absorption refrigerator. Combined cooling, heat and power systems can attain higher overall efficiencies than cogeneration or traditional power plants. In the United States, the application of trigeneration in buildings is called building cooling, heating and power. Heating and cooling output may operate concurrently or alternately depending on need and system construction.

Cogeneration was practiced in some of the earliest installations of electrical generation. Before central stations distributed power, industries generating their own power used exhaust steam for process heating. Large office and apartment buildings, hotels and stores commonly generated their own power and used waste steam for building heat. Due to the high cost of early purchased power, these CHP operations continued for many years after utility electricity became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
[[File:Masnedø power station.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Masnedø]] CHP power station in [[Denmark]]. This station burns straw as fuel. The adjacent greenhouses are heated by [[district heating]] from the plant.]]

Many process industries, such as chemical plants, oil refineries and pulp and paper mills, require large amounts of process heat for such operations as chemical reactors, distillation columns, steam driers and other uses. This heat, which is usually used in the form of steam, can be generated at the typically low pressures used in heating, or can be generated at much higher pressure and passed through a turbine first to generate electricity. In the turbine the steam pressure and temperature is lowered as the internal energy of the steam is converted to work. The lower pressure steam leaving the turbine can then be used for process heat.&lt;!--[[Thermal power plants]] (those that are based on a [[thermodynamic cycle]] to convert heat produced from [[Concentrated solar power|solar mirrors]], [[uranium|fissile elements]], burning [[coal]], [[petroleum]], or [[natural gas]]), and [[heat engine]]s in general, do not convert all of their thermal energy into electricity. In most heat engines, more than half is lost as excess [[heat]] (see: [[Second law of thermodynamics]] and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]]). By capturing the excess heat, CHP uses heat that would be wasted in a conventional [[power plant]], potentially reaching an [[thermal efficiency|efficiency]] of up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/industry/distributedenergy/pdfs/chp_report_12-08.pdf|title=Combined Heat and Power – Effective Energy Solutions for a Sustainable Future|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |accessdate=9 September 2011 |date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that less fuel needs to be consumed to produce the same amount of useful energy.--&gt;

Steam turbines at [[thermal power station]]s are normally designed to be fed high pressure steam, which exits the turbine at a condenser operating a few degrees above ambient temperature and at a few millimeters of mercury absolute pressure. (This is called a ''condensing'' turbine.) For all practical purposes this steam has negligible useful energy before it is condensed. Steam turbines for cogeneration are designed either for ''extraction'' of some steam at lower pressures after it has passed through a number of turbine stages, with the un-extracted steam going on through the turbine to a condenser. In this case, the extracted steam causes a mechanical [[power loss factor|power loss]] in the downstream stages of the turbine. Or they are designed, with or without extraction, for final exhaust at ''back pressure'' (non-condensing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36924.pdf|title=Consider Installing High-Pressure Boilers With Back Pressure Turbine-Generators|author=|date=|website=nrel.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221120102/http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36924.pdf|archivedate=21 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"&gt;{{cite book
|title=Steam-its generation and use |last= |first= |authorlink= |year= |publisher =Babcock &amp; Wilcox |location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extracted or exhaust steam is used for process heating. Steam at ordinary process heating conditions still has a considerable amount of [[enthalpy]] that could be used for power generation, so cogeneration has an opportunity cost.

A typical power generation turbine in a [[paper mill]] may have extraction pressures of 160 psig (1.103 MPa) and 60 psig (0.41 MPa). A typical back pressure may be 60 psig (0.41 MPa). In practice these pressures are custom designed for each facility. Conversely, simply generating process steam for industrial purposes instead of high enough pressure to generate power at the top end also has an opportunity cost (See: [[Steam turbine#Steam supply and exhaust conditions|Steam supply and exhaust conditions]]). The capital and operating cost of high pressure boilers, turbines and generators are substantial. This equipment is normally operated [[Continuous production|continuously]], which usually limits self-generated power to large-scale operations.

[[File:Metz biomass power station.jpg|thumb|left|A cogeneration plant in [[Metz]], [[France]]. The 45MW boiler uses waste wood [[biomass]] as energy source, and provides electricity and heat for 30,000 [[dwelling]]s.]]

A [[combined cycle]] (in which several thermodynamic cycles produce electricity), may also be used to extract heat using a heating system as [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] of the power plant's [[bottoming cycle]]. For example, the RU-25 [[MHD generator]] in [[Moscow]] heated a boiler for a conventional steam powerplant, whose condensate was then used for space heat. A more modern system might use a [[gas turbine]] powered by [[natural gas]], whose exhaust powers a steam plant, whose condensate provides heat. Cogeneration plants based on a combined cycle power unit can have thermal efficiencies above 80%.

The viability of CHP (sometimes termed utilisation factor), especially in smaller CHP installations, depends on a good baseload of operation, both in terms of an on-site (or near site) electrical demand and heat demand. In practice, an exact match between the heat and electricity needs rarely exists. A CHP plant can either meet the need for heat (''heat driven operation'') or be run as a [[power plant]] with some use of its waste heat, the latter being less advantageous in terms of its utilisation factor and thus its overall efficiency. The viability can be greatly increased where opportunities for trigeneration exist. In such cases, the heat from the CHP plant is also used as a primary energy source to deliver cooling by means of an [[absorption chiller]].

CHP is most efficient when heat can be used on-site or very close to it. Overall efficiency is reduced when the heat must be transported over longer distances. This requires heavily insulated pipes, which are expensive and inefficient; whereas electricity can be transmitted along a comparatively simple wire, and over much longer distances for the same energy loss.

A car engine becomes a CHP plant in winter when the reject heat is useful for warming the interior of the vehicle. The example illustrates the point that deployment of CHP depends on heat uses in the vicinity of the heat engine.

Thermally [[enhanced oil recovery]] (TEOR) plants often produce a substantial amount of excess electricity. After generating electricity, these plants pump leftover steam into heavy oil wells so that the oil will flow more easily, increasing production. TEOR cogeneration plants in [[Kern County, California]] produce so much electricity that it cannot all be used locally and is transmitted to [[Los Angeles]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

CHP is one of the most cost-efficient methods of reducing carbon emissions from heating systems in cold climates &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html|title=Carbon footprints of various sources of heat – biomass combustion and CHPDH comes out lowest|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005102349/http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html|archivedate=2011-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy from fossil fuels or biomass into electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/industry/combined-heat-and-power-generation/chp-units.html|title=Cogeneration recognized to be the most energy efficient method of transforming energy|publisher=Viessmann|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808225555/http://www.viessmann.co.uk/en/industry/combined-heat-and-power-generation/chp-units.html|archivedate=2016-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Cogeneration plants are commonly found in [[district heating]] systems of cities, [[central heating]] systems of larger buildings (e.g. hospitals, hotels, prisons) and are commonly used in the industry in thermal production processes for process water, cooling, steam production or [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] fertilization.

==Types of plants==
Topping cycle plants primarily produce electricity from a steam turbine. Partly expanded steam is then condensed in a heating condensor at a temperature level that is suitable e.g. [[district heating]] or [[water desalination]].

[[Bottoming cycle]] plants produce high temperature heat for industrial processes, then a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] boiler feeds an electrical plant. Bottoming cycle plants are only used in industrial processes that require very high temperatures such as furnaces for glass and metal manufacturing, so they are less common.

Large cogeneration systems provide heating water and power for an industrial site or an entire town. Common CHP plant types are:
* [[Gas turbine]] CHP plants using the waste heat in the flue gas of gas turbines. The fuel used is typically [[natural gas]].
* [[Gas engine]] CHP plants use a reciprocating gas engine which is generally more competitive than a gas turbine up to about 5 MW. The gaseous fuel used is normally [[natural gas]]. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site's gas supply, electrical distribution network and heating systems. Typical outputs and efficiences see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/finning-caterpillar-gas-engine-chp-ratings-and-thermal-outputs.html|title=Finning Caterpillar Gas Engine CHP Ratings|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518094951/http://www.claverton-energy.com/finning-caterpillar-gas-engine-chp-ratings-and-thermal-outputs.html|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical large example see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/first-energy-offer-excellent-condition-complete-gas-engined-chp-system-for-sale-and-installation.html|title=Complete 7 MWe Deutz ( 2 x 3.5MWe) gas engine CHP power plant for sale|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930042456/http://www.claverton-energy.com/first-energy-offer-excellent-condition-complete-gas-engined-chp-system-for-sale-and-installation.html|archivedate=2013-09-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biofuel|Biofuel engine]] CHP plants use an adapted reciprocating gas engine or [[diesel engine]], depending upon which biofuel is being used, and are otherwise very similar in design to a Gas engine CHP plant. The advantage of using a biofuel is one of reduced [[hydrocarbon fuel]] consumption and thus reduced carbon emissions. These plants are generally manufactured as fully packaged units that can be installed within a plantroom or external plant compound with simple connections to the site's electrical distribution and heating systems. Another variant is the [[wood gasifier]] CHP plant whereby a wood pellet or wood chip biofuel is [[gasified]] in a zero oxygen high temperature environment; the resulting gas is then used to power the gas engine. Typical smaller size biogas plant see &lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html|title=38% HHV Caterpillar Bio-gas Engine Fitted to Sewage Works - Claverton Group|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130102053132/http://www.claverton-energy.com/38-hhv-caterpillar-bio-gas-engine-fitted-to-long-reach-sewage-works.html|archivedate=2 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Combined cycle]] power plants adapted for CHP
* [[Molten-carbonate fuel cell]]s and [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s have a hot exhaust, very suitable for heating.
* [[Steam turbine]] CHP plants that use the heating system as the [[steam]] condenser for the steam turbine.
* [[Nuclear power]] [[Nuclear power plant|plants]], similar to other steam turbine power plants, can be fitted with extractions in the turbines to bleed partially expanded steam to a heating system. With a heating system temperature of 95&amp;nbsp;°C it is possible to extract about 10 MW heat for every MW electricity lost. With a temperature of 130&amp;nbsp;°C the gain is slightly smaller, about 7 MW for every MWe lost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elforsk.se/nyhet/seminarie/Elforskdagen%20_10/webb_varme/d_welander.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} [swedish]&lt;/ref&gt; A review of cogeneration options is in &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locatelli|first=Giorgio|last2=Fiordaliso|first2=Andrea|last3=Boarin|first3=Sara|last4=Ricotti|first4=Marco E.|date=2017-05-01|title=Cogeneration: An option to facilitate load following in Small Modular Reactors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014919701630292X|journal=Progress in Nuclear Energy|volume=97|pages=153–161|doi=10.1016/j.pnucene.2016.12.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller cogeneration units may use a [[reciprocating engine]] or [[Stirling engine]]. The heat is removed from the exhaust and radiator. The systems are popular in small sizes because small gas and diesel engines are less expensive than small gas- or oil-fired steam-electric plants.

===MicroCHP===
[[Micro combined heat and power]] or 'Micro cogeneration" is a so-called [[Distributed Energy Resource|distributed energy resource]] (DER). The installation is usually less than 5 [[Watt#Electrical and thermal watts|kW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;]] in a house or small business. Instead of burning fuel to merely heat space or water, some of the energy is converted to electricity in addition to heat. This electricity can be used within the home or business or, if permitted by the grid management, sold back into the electric power grid.

Delta-ee consultants stated in 2013 that with 64% of global sales the fuel cell micro-combined heat and power passed the conventional systems in sales in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf The fuel cell industry review 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414152813/http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 20.000 units were sold in [[Japan]] in 2012 overall within the Ene Farm project.

===Combined heat and power district heating===

In the [[United States]], [[Consolidated Edison]] distributes 66 billion kilograms of 350&amp;nbsp;°F (180&amp;nbsp;°C) steam each year through its seven cogeneration plants to 100,000 buildings in [[Manhattan]]—the biggest steam district in the United States. The peak delivery is 10 million pounds per hour (or approximately 2.5 GW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Newsroom: Steam| publisher =ConEdison| url =http://www.coned.com/newsroom/energysystems_steam.asp| accessdate =2007-07-20| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070821132012/http://www.coned.com/newsroom/energysystems_steam.asp| archivedate =2007-08-21| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Bevelhymer| first =Carl| title =Steam| publisher =Gotham Gazette| date =2003-11-10| url =http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674| accessdate =2007-07-20| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070813013416/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674| archivedate =2007-08-13| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial CHP===
Cogeneration is still common in [[pulp and paper mill]]s, refineries and chemical plants. In this "industrial cogeneration/CHP", the heat is typically recovered at higher temperatures (above 100 deg C) and used for process steam or drying duties. This is more valuable and flexible than low-grade waste heat, but there is a slight loss of power generation. The increased focus on [[sustainability]] has made industrial CHP more attractive, as it substantially reduces [[carbon footprint]] compared to generating steam or burning fuel on-site and importing electric power from the grid.

====Utility pressures versus self generated industrial====
Industrial cogeneration plants normally operate at much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because boiler feed water from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually have to treat proportionately more boiler make up water. Boiler feed water must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the feed water.&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt; 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities are less likely to have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.

===Heat recovery steam generators===
A [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) is a steam boiler that uses hot [[exhaust gas]]es from the [[gas turbine]]s or [[reciprocating engine]]s in a CHP plant to heat up water and generate [[steam]]. The steam, in turn, drives a [[steam turbine]] or is used in industrial processes that require heat.

HRSGs used in the CHP industry are distinguished from conventional steam generators by the following main features:
* The HRSG is designed based upon the specific features of the gas turbine or reciprocating engine that it will be coupled to.
* Since the exhaust gas temperature is relatively low, heat transmission is accomplished mainly through [[convection]].
* The exhaust gas velocity is limited by the need to keep head losses down. Thus, the transmission coefficient is low, which calls for a large heating surface area.
* Since the temperature difference between the hot gases and the fluid to be heated (steam or water) is low, and with the heat transmission coefficient being low as well, the evaporator and economizer are designed with plate fin heat exchangers.

==Comparison with a heat pump==
A [[heat pump]] may be compared with a CHP unit as follows. If, to supply thermal energy, the exhaust steam from the turbo-generator must be taken at a higher temperature than the system would produce most electricity at, the lost electrical generation is ''as if'' a heat pump were used to provide the same heat by taking electrical power from the generator running at lower output temperature and higher efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchardpartners.co.uk/Docs/IAEEVilniusPaperWhyHeatFromCHPisRenewableMarginalExergyAnalysis2011-09-14.pdf|title=Why Heat From CHP is Renewable - based on paper presented at IAEE Vilnius (2010)|date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2017-12-25|page=4 paragraph 4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921204903/http://www.orchardpartners.co.uk/Docs/IAEEVilniusPaperWhyHeatFromCHPisRenewableMarginalExergyAnalysis2011-09-14.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically for every unit of electrical power lost, then about 6 units of heat are made available at about 90&amp;nbsp;°C. Thus CHP has an effective [[Coefficient of performance|Coefficient of Performance (COP)]] compared to a heat pump of 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2011.05.007| title = Combined heat and power considered as a virtual steam cycle heat pump| year = 2011| last1 = Lowe | first1 = R. | journal = Energy Policy| volume = 39| issue = 9| pages = 5528–5534}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for a remotely operated heat pump, losses in the electrical distribution network would need to be considered, of the order of 6%. Because the losses are proportional to the square of the current, during peak periods losses are much higher than this and it is likely that widespread (i.e. citywide application of heat pumps) would cause overloading of the distribution and transmission grids unless they were substantially reinforced.

It is also possible to run a heat driven operation combined with a heat pump, where the excess electricity (as heat demand is the defining factor on utilization) is used to drive a heat pump. As heat demand increases, more electricity is generated to drive the heat pump, with the waste heat also heating the heating fluid.

==Distributed generation==
Most industrial countries generate the majority of their electrical power needs in large centralized facilities with capacity for large electrical power output. These plants benefit from economy of scale, but may need to transmit electricity across long distances causing transmission losses. Cogeneration or trigeneration production is subject to limitations in the local demand, and thus may sometimes need to reduce e.g. heat or cooling production to match the demand. An example of cogeneration with trigeneration applications in a major city is the [[New York City steam system]].

==Thermal efficiency==
Every heat engine is subject to the theoretical efficiency limits of the [[Carnot cycle]] or subset [[Rankine cycle]] in the case of steam turbine power plants or [[Brayton cycle]] in gas turbine with steam turbine plants. Most of the efficiency loss with steam power generation is associated with the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] of steam that is not recovered when a turbine exhausts its low temperature and pressure steam to a condenser. (Typical steam to condenser would be at a few millimeters absolute pressure and on the order of 5&amp;nbsp;°C/11&amp;nbsp;°F hotter than the cooling water temperature, depending on the condenser capacity.) In cogeneration this steam exits the turbine at a higher temperature where it may be used for process heat, building heat or cooling with an [[absorption chiller]]. The majority of this heat is from the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]] when the steam condenses.

[[Thermal efficiency]] in a cogeneration system is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} \equiv \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} \equiv \frac{\text{Electrical power output + Heat output}}{\text{Total heat input}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th}&lt;/math&gt; = Thermal efficiency
:&lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; = Total work output by all systems
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; = Total heat input into the system

Heat output may be used also for cooling (for example in Summer), thanks to an absorption chiller.
If cooling is achieved in the same time, [[Thermal efficiency]] in a trigeneration system is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th} \equiv \frac{W_{out}}{Q_{in}} \equiv \frac{\text{Electrical power output + Heat output + Cooling output}}{\text{Total heat input}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{th}&lt;/math&gt; = Thermal efficiency
:&lt;math&gt;W_{out}&lt;/math&gt; = Total work output by all systems
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{in}&lt;/math&gt; = Total heat input into the system

Typical cogeneration models have losses as in any system. The energy distribution below is represented as a percent of total input energy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trigeneration Systems with Fuel Cells|url=http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq-08/245-san-martin.pdf|work=Research Paper|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006064857/http://www.icrepq.com/icrepq-08/245-san-martin.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Electricity = 45%
:Heat + Cooling = 40%
:Heat losses = 13%
:Electrical line losses = 2%

Conventional central coal- or nuclear-powered power stations convert about 33-45% of their input heat to electricity.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=DOE – Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527095840/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=May 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt;  [[Brayton cycle]] power plants operate at up to 60% efficiency. In the case of conventional power plants approximately 10-15% of this heat is lost up the stack of the boiler, most of the remaining heat emerges from the turbines as low-grade waste heat with no significant local uses so it is usually rejected to the environment, typically to cooling water passing through a condenser.&lt;ref name="Steam-its generation and use"/&gt; Because turbine exhaust is normally just above ambient temperature, some potential power generation is sacrificed in rejecting higher temperature steam from the turbine for cogeneration purposes.&lt;ref&gt;See Mechanical or Chemical Engineering texts on Thermodynamics.&lt;/ref&gt;

For cogeneration to be practical power generation and end use of heat must be in relatively close proximity (&lt;2 KM typically).
Even though the efficiency of a small distributed electrical generator may be lower than a large central power plant, the use of its waste heat for local heating and cooling can result in an overall use of the primary fuel supply as great as 80%.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt; This provides substantial financial and environmental benefits.

==Costs==
{{See also|Cost of electricity by source}}
Typically, for a gas-fired plant the fully installed cost per kW electrical is around £400/kW ($577 USD), which is comparable with large central power stations.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"/&gt;

==History==

===Cogeneration in Europe===
[[File:Power plant at sunset.jpg|thumb|220px|A cogeneration thermal power plant in [[Ferrera Erbognone]] ([[Province of Pavia|PV]]), [[Italy]]]]

The [[European Union|EU]] has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the [[CHP Directive]]. In September 2008 at a hearing of the European Parliament’s Urban Lodgment Intergroup, Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying, “security of supply really starts with energy efficiency.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/230908_Energy_Efficiency_Industrial_Forum_Security_of_Supply.pdf |title =Energy Efficiency Industrial Forum Position Paper: energy efficiency – a vital component of energy security }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union’s Cogeneration Directive 2004/08/EC. This directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country. The development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances.

The European Union generates 11% of its electricity using cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/medialibrary/2011/04/21/2bc24419/240311%20COGEN%20Europe%20press%20release.pdf|title=2011 - Cogen -Experts discuss the central role cogeneration has to play in shaping EU energy policy|author=|date=|website=cogeneurope.eu|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620044706/http://www.cogeneurope.eu/medialibrary/2011/04/21/2bc24419/240311%20COGEN%20Europe%20press%20release.pdf|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is large difference between Member States with variations of the energy savings between 2% and 60%. Europe has the three countries with the world’s most intensive cogeneration economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/Cogeneration_Europe_Draft_paper_on_Security_of_Supply_in_EU_energy_policy.pdf |title=COGEN Europe: Cogeneration in the European Union’s Energy Supply Security }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 28.46 TWh of electrical power generated by conventional thermal power plants in Finland in 2012, 81.80% was cogeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energia.fi/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/sahkotilastot/sahkontuotanto/sahkon-hankinta-energialahteittain |title=Electricity Generation by Energy Source |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220125742/http://energia.fi/tilastot-ja-julkaisut/sahkotilastot/sahkontuotanto/sahkon-hankinta-energialahteittain |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other European countries are also making great efforts to increase efficiency. Germany reported that at present, over 50% of the country’s total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration. So far, Germany has set the target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5% of the country’s electricity to 25% of the country’s electricity by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KWKG 2002|url=http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kwkg_2002/__1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095900/http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/kwkg_2002/__1.html|archivedate=2014-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK is also actively supporting combined heat and power. In light of UK’s goal to achieve a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, the government has set the target to source at least 15% of its government electricity use from CHP by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |title=DEFRA Action in the UK - Combined Heat and Power |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612100647/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK measures to encourage CHP growth are financial incentives, grant support, a greater regulatory framework, and government leadership and partnership.

According to the IEA 2008 modeling of cogeneration expansion for the G8 countries, the expansion of cogeneration in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe’s savings from today’s 155.69 Twh to 465 Twh in 2030. It would also result in a 16% to 29% increase in each country’s total cogenerated electricity by 2030.

Governments are being assisted in their CHP endeavors by organizations like [[COGEN Europe]] who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within Europe’s energy policy. COGEN is Europe’s umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry.

===Cogeneration in the United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], the ''Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance'' scheme regulates the combined production of heat and power. It was introduced in 1996. It defines, through calculation of inputs and outputs, "Good Quality CHP" in terms of the achievement of primary energy savings against conventional separate generation of heat and electricity. Compliance with Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance is required for cogeneration installations to be eligible for government subsidies and tax incentives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chpqa.decc.gov.uk|title=Combined Heat and Power Quality Assurance Programme|author=|date=|website=decc.gov.uk|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030232902/http://chpqa.decc.gov.uk/|archivedate=30 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cogeneration in the United States===
[[File:Mirant Kendall Cogeneration Station.jpg|thumb|right|The 250 [[megawatt|MW]] [[Kendall Cogeneration Station]] plant in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]]]

Perhaps the first modern use of [[energy recycling]] was done by [[Thomas Edison]]. His 1882 [[Pearl Street Station]], the world’s first commercial power plant, was a combined heat and power plant, producing both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to warm neighboring buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|title=World’s First Commercial Power Plant Was a Cogeneration Plant|work=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425015724/http://www.cogeneration.net/ThomasEdisonsCogenPlant.htm|archivedate=2008-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recycling allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.

By the early 1900s, regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized plants managed by regional utilities. These regulations not only promoted electrification throughout the countryside, but they also discouraged decentralized power generation, such as cogeneration.

By 1978, Congress recognized that efficiency at central power plants had stagnated and sought to encourage improved efficiency with the [[Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act]] (PURPA), which encouraged utilities to buy power from other energy producers.

Cogeneration plants proliferated, soon producing about 8% of all energy in the United States.&lt;ref name=localpower&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localpower.org/documents/report_worldsurvey06.pdf|title=World Survey of Decentralized Energy|date=May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bill left implementation and enforcement up to individual states, resulting in little or nothing being done in many parts of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The [[United States Department of Energy]] has an aggressive goal of having CHP constitute
20% of generation capacity by the year 2030. Eight Clean Energy Application Centers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulfcoastcleanenergy.org/WhatisCHP/StateInformation/OtherStates/tabid/1349/Default.aspx Eight Clean Energy Application Centers] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130415062907/http://www.gulfcoastcleanenergy.org/WhatisCHP/StateInformation/OtherStates/tabid/1349/Default.aspx |date=2013-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been established across the nation whose mission is to develop the required technology application knowledge and educational infrastructure necessary to lead "clean energy" (combined heat and power, waste heat recovery and district energy) technologies as viable energy options and reduce any perceived risks associated with their implementation. The focus of the Application Centers is to provide an outreach and technology deployment program for end users, policy makers, utilities, and industry stakeholders.

High electric rates in New England and the Middle Atlantic make these areas of the United States the most beneficial for cogeneration.&lt;ref name=electricitydata&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a|title=Electricity Data|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531215733/http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a|archivedate=2015-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=energysaving&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newenglandcondo.com/articles/773/1/Energy-Saving-Incentives/Page1.html|title=New England Energy|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123213042/http://newenglandcondo.com/articles/773/1/Energy-Saving-Incentives/Page1.html|archivedate=2015-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4142">'''Cognitive [[philology]]''' is the [[science]] that studies written and oral texts as the product of human mental processes. Studies in cognitive philology compare documentary evidence emerging from textual investigations with results of experimental research, especially in the fields of cognitive and ecological psychology, neurosciences and artificial intelligence. "The point is not the text, but the mind that made it". Cognitive Philology aims to foster communication between literary, textual, philological disciplines on the one hand and researches across the whole range of the cognitive, evolutionary, ecological and human sciences on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognitive Philology|url=http://ojs.uniroma1.it/index.php/cogphil|website=DigiLab, Servizi di publishing digitale|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive philology: 

* investigates transmission of oral and written text, and categorization processes which lead to classification of knowledge, mostly relying on the [[information theory]];
* studies how [[narrative]]s emerge in so called natural conversation and selective process which lead to the rise of literary standards for storytelling, mostly relying on embodied [[semantic]]s;
* explores the evolutive and evolutionary role played by [[rhythm]] and [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in human ontogenetic and phylogenetic development and the pertinence of the semantic association during processing of cognitive maps;
* Provides the scientific ground for multimedia [[Textual criticism | critical editions]] of literary texts.

A '''courtesan''' was originally a [[courtier]], which means a person who attends the [[noble court|court]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] or other powerful person.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary], v. courtesan, -zan, 1, Obs., "One attached to the court of a prince"; courtesan, -zan, 2, "A court-mistress", Etymon "a. F. ''courtisane'', ad. It. ''cortigiana'', in Florio ''cortegiana'' "a curtezane, a strumpet", orig. ''woman attached to the court'', fem. of ''cortigiano''. In quotation 1565 directly from Italian"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[feudalism|feudal society]], the court was the centre of [[government]] as well as the residence of the monarch, and social and political life were often completely mixed together. Prior to the Renaissance, courtesans served to convey information to visiting dignitaries, when servants could not be trusted. In [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], courtiers played an extremely important role in upper-class society. As it was customary during this time for royal couples to lead separate lives—commonly marrying simply to preserve bloodlines and to secure political alliances—men and women would often seek gratification and companionship from people living at court. In fact, the verb 'to court' originally meant "to be or reside at court", and later came to mean "to behave as a courtier" and then '[[courtship]]', or "to pay amorous attention to somebody".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com ''Oxford English Dictionary''], v. court, verb&lt;/ref&gt; The most intimate companion of a ruler was called the ”[[favourite]]”.

In [[Renaissance]] usage, the Italian word ''cortigiana'', feminine of ''cortigiano'' ("courtier") came to refer to a person who attends the court, and then to a well-educated and independent woman, eventually a trained artist or artisan of dance and singing, especially one associated with wealthy, powerful, or upper-class society who was given luxuries and status in exchange for entertainment and companionship.&lt;ref&gt;In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] in his ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' uses the masculine form ''cortigiano'' ("courtier") but for the feminine form ''cortigiana'' ("courtesan") uses the term ''donna di palazzo'' (literally "palace lady")&lt;/ref&gt; The word was [[loanword|borrowed]] by English from Italian through the French form ''courtisane'' during the 16th century, especially associated to the meaning of ''donna di palazzo''.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"/&gt;

A male figure comparable to the courtesan was the Italian ''[[cicisbeo]]'', the French ''[[chevalier (disambiguation)|chevalier]] servant'', the Spanish ''[[cortejo]]'' or ''estrecho''. It actually seems that the figure of the ''chevalier servant'' (French, literally "serving cavalier", lady's escort) of a married lady was quite common in Europe up to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/110.2/patriarca.html Silvana Patriarca, "Indolence and Regeneration: Tropes and Tensions of Risorgimento Patriotism", The American Historical Review, 110(2), 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810094203/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/110.2/patriarca.html |date=2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courtesans of East Asia, particularly those of the [[Japanese empire]], held a different social role than that of their European counterparts. Examples of Japanese courtesans included the [[oiran]] class, who were more focused on the aspect of entertainment in comparison with European courtesans.&lt;ref name="Geisha Dolls"&gt;[http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/jshoaf/Jdolls/oiran.htm "Geisha Dolls"]. University of Florida. 2012-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term ''courtesan'' has become a [[euphemism]] to designate a comforter, [[call girl|escort]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] or a [[prostitute]], especially one of dignified etiquette who attracts wealthy, powerful, or influential clients.{{why|date=November 2015}}

[[Image:VeronicaFranco.jpg|thumb|right|[[Veronica Franco]], famous Venetian poet and courtesan. Portrait by [[Paolo Veronese]].]]
There were two types of courtesan.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In one category was a type of courtesan known (in Italy) as the ''cortigiana onesta'', or the honest courtesan, who was cast as an intellectual. In the other was the ''cortigiana di lume'', a lower class of courtesan. Although the latter was still considered better than an average courtesan{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, the former was the sort most often romanticized and treated more-or-less equal to women of the nobility. It is with this type of courtesan that the art of "courtisanerie" is best associated.

The ''cortigiane oneste'' were usually well-educated and worldly (sometimes even more so than the average upper-class woman), and often held simultaneous careers as performers or artists. They were typically chosen on the basis of their "breeding"—social and conversational skills, intelligence, common-sense, and companionship—as well as their physical attributes. It was usually their wit and personality that set them apart from regular women.  Sex constituted only a facet of the courtesan's array of services. For example, they were well-dressed and ready to engage and participate in a variety of topics ranging from art to music to politics.

In some cases, courtesans were from well-to-do backgrounds, and were even married—but to husbands lower on the social ladder than their clients. In these cases, their relationships with those of high social status had the potential to improve their spouses' status—and so, more often than not, the husband was aware of his wife's profession and dealings.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

==Differences in status==

===As primary employment===
Courtesans from non-wealthy backgrounds provided charming companionship for extended periods, no matter what their own feelings or commitments might have been at the time, and sometimes had to be prepared to do so on short notice. They were also subject to lower social status, and often religious disapproval, because of the immoral aspects of their profession and their reliance upon courtisanerie as a primary source of income. In cases like this, a courtesan was solely dependent on her benefactor or benefactors financially, making her vulnerable; [[Cora Pearl]] is a good example.
[[File:Lancelot Volders - Ladies with their servants.jpg|thumb|280px|''Courtesans with their servants'' by [[Lancelot Volders]]]]
Often, courtesans serving in this capacity began their career as a prostitute, although many came to the "profession" by other means. It was not uncommon for a courtesan to enter into an arranged long-term liaison by contract with a wealthy benefactor. These contracts were written up by and witnessed by lawyers, and were binding. Most included some provision for the financial welfare of the courtesan beyond the end of the relationship in the form of an annuity. Many such women became so powerful socially and financially that they could be particular about the men they associated with; in other words they chose their paramour as would any other mistress, not the other way around. Wealthy benefactors would go to great lengths to court a courtesan as a prize, the ultimate goal being a long-term contract as a mistress. 

Occasionally courtesans were passed from one benefactor to another, thereby resulting in them being viewed in society circles as lower than both their benefactor and those of wealth and power with whom they would socialize. Often, in instances of this sort, if the courtesan had satisfactorily served a benefactor, that benefactor would, when ending the affair, pass them on to another benefactor of wealth as a favor to the courtesan, or set them up in an arranged marriage to a semi-wealthy benefactor. In the event that the courtesan had angered or dissatisfied a benefactor, they would often find themselves cast out of wealthy circles, returning more often than not to street [[prostitution]].

===For social or political benefits===
Those from wealthy backgrounds, either by birth or marriage, and who were acting as courtesans only for the social or political advancement of themselves and/or their spouses were generally treated as equals. They were more respected by their extramarital companions, both placing one another's family obligations ahead of the relationship and planning their own liaisons or social engagements around the lovers' marital obligations.

Affairs of this sort would often be short-lived, ending when either the courtesan or the courtesan's spouse received the status or political position desired, or when the benefactor chose the company of another courtesan, and compensated the former companion financially. In instances like this, it was often viewed simply as a business agreement by both parties involved. The benefactor was aware of the political or social favors expected by the courtesan, the courtesan was aware of the price expected from them for those favors being carried out, and the two met one another's demands, an example being [[Madame de Pompadour]].{{Doubtful|date=December 2016}}

This was generally a safe affair, as both the benefactor's spouse and the courtesan's spouse usually were fully aware of the arrangement, and the courtesan was not solely dependent on the benefactor. It, rather, was simply an affair of benefits gained for both those involved. Publicly and socially, affairs of this sort were common during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the early 20th century, and were generally accepted in wealthy circles.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;[http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html "A brief history of the Courtesan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319091907/http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html |date=2006-03-19 }}(from icqurimage.com, 2005) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrigues==
Very often, courtesans would betray one another in acts of political intrigue in attempts to climb into higher positions of power within royal courts. There are many cases throughout history where one courtesan would attempt (sometimes successfully) to supplant the mistress to a king or emperor. This was typically preceded by her discrediting the ruler's companion, often by divulging secrets that could lead to her rival being cast aside and replaced by her. However, this was a delicate process, and if a courtesan of "lower status" attempted to replace a courtesan who wielded a substantial amount of power within the court, it would often result in the lower courtesan being exiled from the royal court, or married off to a lesser noble in an arranged marriage, or even murdered. There are also many examples of courtesans who took advantage of their involvement with powerful individuals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Career length==
In later centuries, from the mid-18th century on, courtesans would often find themselves cast aside by their benefactors, but the days of public execution or imprisonment based on their [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] lifestyle were over. There are many examples of courtesans who, by remaining discreet and respectful to their benefactors, were able to extend their careers into or past middle age and retire financially secure; [[Catherine Walters]] is a good example. By the late 19th century, and for a brief period in the early 20th century, courtesans had reached a level of social acceptance in many circles and settings, often even to the extent of becoming a friend and confidant to the wife of their benefactor.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

More often than not, a woman serving as a courtesan would last in that field only as long as she could prove herself useful to her companion, or companions. This, of course, excludes those who served as courtesans but who were already married into high society. When referring to those who made their service as a courtesan as their main source of income, success was based solely on financial management and longevity. Many climbed through the ranks of royalty, serving as mistress to lesser nobles first, eventually reaching the role of mistress to a king or prince. Others were able to obtain such a high position early on, but few lasted long, and after serving a prince or king there was nowhere to go but down.

[[Pietro Aretino]], an [[Italian Renaissance]] writer, wrote a series of dialogues (''Capricciosi ragionamenti'') in which a mother teaches her daughter what options are available to women and how to be an effective courtesan. The [[France|French]] novelist [[Balzac]] wrote about a courtesan in his ''[[Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes]]'' (1838–47). [[Emile Zola]] likewise wrote a novel, ''[[Nana (book)|Nana]]'' (1880), about a courtesan in nineteenth-century [[France]].

In addition to the list above, the term "courtesan" has often been used in a political context in an attempt to damage the reputation of a powerful woman, or disparage her importance. Because of this, there is still much historical debate over whether certain women in history can be referred to as courtesans. For example, the title was applied to the Byzantine empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], who had started life as an erotic actress but later became the wife of the Emperor [[Justinian]] and, after her death, an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[saint]]. The term has also been applied to influential women including [[Anne Boleyn]], Umrao Jaan (Amiran) from the novel &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Umrao Jann Ada]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; : She was kidnapped and sold into a Tawaif Kotha. [[Madaline Bishop]], [[Diane de Poitiers]], [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], [[Pamela Harriman]], [[Eva Perón]] and [[Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel]]. The attempt to define such women as courtesans is often intended to draw attention to certain perceived qualities, ambitions or conduct which are held to be courtesan-like.

'''Cultural depictions of dogs''' extend back thousands of years to when [[dog]]s were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs in art became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. [[Hunting]] scenes were popular in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/middle/animals2.htm|title=Animal Symbolism in Many Cultures}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As dogs became more domesticated, they were shown as companion animals, often painted sitting on a lady's lap. Throughout the [[art history]] there is an overwhelming presence of dogs as status symbols and pets in painting mainly in the [[Western art]].  The dogs were brought to houses and were allowed to live in the house and cherished as part of the family, and were regarded as mostly in the upper classes who used them for hunting and could afford to feed them. Hunting dogs were generally connected to the aristocracy. Only the nobility were allowed to keep hunting dogs, and this would signal status, and it was the signalment of a noble man. Dog portraits became increasingly popular in the 18th century, and the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', which further encouraged the popularity of dog portraiture.

The walls of caves and tombs dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] have illustrations or statues of dogs. These generally portray dogs used for hunting, and even children's toys and ceramics depicting dogs.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog|url=http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-15457|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Greeks and Romans, contrary to the Semitic cultures  favored dogs as pets, and valued them for their faithfulness and courage and were often seen on Greek and Roman reliefs and ceramics as symbols of fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Journals/CJ/44/4/Household_Pets*.html|title=Greek and Roman Household Pets |publisher=penelope.uchicago.edu|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cats were not favoured over dogs, on contrary Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't keep cats as pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyforkids.net/greek-pets.html|title=Greek pets|publisher=historyforkids.net|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs were given as gifts among lovers and kept them as both  pets, status symbols or kept for guardians and as hunting dogs. Dogs were appreciated by the Greek for their faith and love. [[Homeros]] [[Odyssey]] tells the story of [[Odysseus]] who had a dog called Argos he raised and who was the only one that recognized him when he returned  home after his travels, disguised to conceals his appearance. Only the old dog recognized him instantly. This theme has been often depicted in on ancient Greek vases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/53-3/kitchell.pdf|title=Pets of Ancient Greeks|publisher=www.penn.museum|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ancient Romans kept three types of dogs. Hunting dogs; especially [[sighthound]]s, Molossus type of dogs like the [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]  were often depicted in  reliefs and mosaics with the words Cave Canem; and small companion dogs of [[Maltese (dog)|Maltese]] type as women's [[lap dog]]s. Greyhounds were often depicted too, often as sculptures. Large dogs were often used in war by the Roman army  in attack formations or for wolf-hunting on horseback,  which was a popular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societasviaromana.net/Collegium_VitaQuotidiana/pets.php|title=Pets in Ancient Rome

[[File:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|Jan van Eyck's ''The Arnolfini Wedding'' (1434).]]
Generally, dogs symbolize [[faith]] and loyalty.&lt;ref name="Hall1979"&gt;{{citation|last=Hall|first=James|title=Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fLjd0fyT0_IC|year=1979|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|isbn=978-0-06-430100-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dog, when included in an [[allegory|allegorical]] painting, portrays the attribute of [[fidelity]] personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred S.|title=Gardner's Art through the Ages: The Western Perspective|year=2009|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a portrait of a married couple, a dog placed in a woman's lap or at her feet can represent marital fidelity. If the portrait is of a widow, a dog can represent her continuing faithfulness to the memory of her late husband.&lt;ref name="Hall1979" /&gt;

An example of a dog representing marital fidelity is present in Jan van Eyck's ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]''. An oil painting on [[oak]] [[Panel painting|panel]] dated 1434 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Jan van Eyck]], it is a small full-length double portrait,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Erwin Panofsky]] published an article entitled ''Jan van Eyck's 'Arnolfini' Portrait'' in the ''[[Burlington Magazine]] 1934&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to represent the Italian merchant [[Giovanni Arnolfini|Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini]] and his wife,&lt;ref&gt;Stockstad Cothren&lt;/ref&gt; presumably in their home in the [[Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Bruges]]. It portrays a wedding scene, where the people invited to witness the ceremony can be seen in the convex mirror at the back, the mirror symbolizing the eye of God. In those times people were not always married in the church, it was enough that two witnesses were present to make a wedding legal. A number of symbols can be found in the picture: the fruit, the symbol of fertility and wealth, the shoes removed (this is a holy place), and the dog. The oranges casually placed to the left are a sign of wealth; they were very expensive in Burgundy, and may have been one of the items dealt in by Arnolfini. The little dog symbolizes in the Middle Ages [[iconography]]  faithfulness, devotion or [[loyalty]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  or can be seen as an emblem of [[lust]], signifying the couple's desire to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jan Van Eyck: The Play of Realism|pages=20–50|first=Craig|last=Harbison|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the couple, the dog looks out to meet the gaze of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig, ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}} pp. 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;  The dog could also be simply a lap dog, a gift from husband to wife. Many wealthy women in the court had lap dogs as companions.

During the Middle Ages, images of dogs were often carved on tombstones to represent the deceased's feudal loyalty or marital fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keister|first=Douglas|title=Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography|year=2004|publisher=Gibbs Smith|location=Salt Lake City, UT|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting scenes===
[[File:Livre de Chasse 40v.jpg|thumb|left|''Livre de Chasse'', French hunting dog book]]

Hunting scenes were common topics in medieval and Renaissance art. Hunting in the medieval period was a sport exclusive to the aristocracy and hunting was an essential part of court etiquette. Depictions of person together with a hunting dog, hawks or falcons would signal status, or was the signalment of a noble man - since the hunting dogs were  connected to aristocracy, and only the nobility was hunting. Hunting was considered as a sport, but also a way of showing bravery, chivalric virtue while hunting dangerous prey such as wild boars and bears. Hunting dogs allow humans to pursue and kill prey that would otherwise be very difficult or dangerous to hunt. Different breeds of dogs were used for different types of hunting. Hunting with dogs was so popular that during the Middle Ages the wild bears had already been hunted to extinction in England.
[[File:ST. Eustachius.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pisanello]] (1395–1455), hunting scene with dogs (''The Vision of St. Eustachius'')]]
Even as animal domestication became relatively widespread and after the development of agriculture, hunting was usually a significant contributor to the human food supply. Hunting filled also a practical necessity, assuring food for the tables of the nobility. Nobles spending their money on packs of specially bred hounds were not unusual.

[[Gaston III, Count of Foix|Gaston Phoebus]] (30 April 1331 – 1391) wrote a manual on hunting and there are several tapestries from the period which depict hunting scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medieval and renaissance hunting|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/m/med-ren-hunting/|publisher=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if nobility was hunting, hunting has been forbidden to servants, peasants and also the Roman Catholic Church [[cleric]]s. Thus the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'' (C. ii, X, De cleric. venat.) says, "We forbid to all servants of God hunting and expeditions through the woods with hounds; and we also forbid them to keep hawks or falcons." The [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]], held under [[Pope Innocent III]], decreed (canon xv): "We interdict hunting or hawking to all clerics." The decree of the [[Council of Trent]] is worded more mildly: "Let clerics abstain from illicit hunting and hawking" (Sess. XXIV, De reform., c. xii), which seems to imply that not all hunting is illicit, and canonists generally make a distinction declaring noisy (''clamorosa'') hunting unlawful, but not quiet (''quieta'') hunting. Thus, hunting dogs are seldom seen depicted in the company of [[cleric]]s, but very often in the company of in the highest social class of that society.

=== In heraldry===

[[File:Coa Hungary Town Ebes.svg|thumb|120px|Coats of arms of the Hungarian town [[Ebes]]]]

For the same reason, depictions of dogs can be found in heraldry. In monarchies, the aristocracy are a class of people  who either possess hereditary titles granted by a monarch or are related to such people, and thanks to the specific connection of the aristocrats with the hunting dogs, dogs were often shown as symbols in heraldry. In the late [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], [[heraldry]] became a highly developed discipline. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur as [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] and [[supporter]]s in many [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], and often symbolise courage, vigilance, loyalty and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120304224608/http://www.scottish-wedding-dreams.com/heraldic-animals.html ~ Heraldry Symbols]&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[encaustic tile]]s dating from the 15th century featured a white hound, the Talbot family crest and the inscription "Sir John Talbot" (the [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|1st Earl of Shrewsbury]]). Part of a set of four, the tiles were possibly originally used on a church floor. The term talbot is used in heraldry to refer to a good-mannered hunting dog. The [[Talbot (dog)|Talbot dog]] always depicts the Talbot [[coat of arms]] and is the original hound used as an English heraldic symbol. It is portrayed in the family arms of several noble German families and at least seven other English families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Waters |first=Nick |title=History of the Talbot tiles |url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-(2) |accessdate=18 January 2014 |newspaper=[[Dog World (newspaper)|Dog World]] |date=5 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6MiPuGlGR?url=http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/2223/Features/35-Waters-%282%29 |archivedate=18 January 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==16th and 17th century==
[[File:Ofthedogingeneral.jpg|thumb|150px|A woodcut illustration from ''The history of four-footed beasts and serpents'' by [[Edward Topsell]], 1658]]
During the 16th and 17th century, dogs were depicted in hunting scenes, or depicted representing social status, as a lap dog, or sometimes as a personal friend. They may also used as symbols in painting. The Greek philosopher [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] (404-323 BC) was  depicted by Jean-Léon Gérôme, in the company of dogs that also served as emblems of his "Cynic" (Greek: "kynikos," dog-like) philosophy, which emphasized an austere existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shakespeare's Clown: Actor and Text in the Elizabethan Playhouse|page=155|first=David|last=Wiles|publisher=Cambridge university press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Plato, ''Republic'' Book II&lt;/ref&gt; Diogenes stated that  "Unlike human beings who either dupe others or are duped, dogs will give an honest bark at the truth. Other dogs bite their enemies, I bite my friends to save them." &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Diogenes of Sinope, quoted by Stobaeus, ''Florilegium'', iii. 13. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek philosopher is seated in his [[abode]], the earthenware tub, - also depicted sometimes in sitting in a [[barrel]], -  in the [[Metroon]], Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to go in searching for an honest man.

Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh portrayed probably a scholar noted by its significance to its particular profession,  depicting a book, or a Protestant preacher and theologian with the Bible opened on the table. A dog depicted as a companion to the scholar is a symbol of [[fidelity]], vigilance and regularity in the research due to assigned to dogs natural intelligence and intuition, and the [[parrot]] is a symbol of erudition and [[eloquence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/rudeness.htm "Logical Rudeness"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==

[[File:Izumiya Tomotada - Netsuke in the Form of a Dog - Walters 711020 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumbnail|''[[Netsuke]] in the Form of a Dog'']]
Netsuke are Japanese miniature sculptures of great artistic merit that were also serving a practical function as a storage place for kimomos that traditionally had no pockets. These small boxes had a carved, button-like toggle called a ''netsuke''. Most netsuke production was during around 1615&amp;ndash;1868, in the [[Edo period]] in Japan. Among others motifs, netsukes depicted even dogs. 
The tradition of showing dogs in hunting scenes continued through to the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Secord"&gt;{{cite web|title=Victorian England|url=http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|publisher=William Secord Gallery|accessdate=24 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113235416/http://www.dogpainting.com/info_detail.cfm?type=referance&amp;info_name=VICTORIANENGLAND&amp;index=2|archivedate=13 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture entitled ''A Distinguished Member of the Humane Society'' depicts a dog that was well known in London at that time.  The dog depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer 1838, was a Newfoundland called "Bob", who was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront, where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty-three times over the course of fourteen years. For this, he was made a distinguished member of the [[Royal Humane Society]], granting him a medal and access to food.&lt;ref name=newfoundlandart&gt;{{cite web|title=The Newfoundland in Art &amp; Literature|url=http://www.ncanewfs.org/history/pages/landseer2.html|publisher=Newfoundland Club of America|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Newfoundlanders with white patches are now recognized as a breed of their own,  as a "[[Landseer (dog)|Landseer]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Story|first=George M.|title=Dictionary of Newfoundland English|year=1990|publisher=Univ. of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-5887-4|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrVbk3EndTcC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=C61rTpmOOcu38QOQ4vEL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The painting was described by ''[[The Art Journal]]'' 1838 as being "one of the best and most interesting publications of the year", and "Mr Thomas Landseer's first great effort in this department of the art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Journal|year=1839|publisher=The Art Union|location=London|page=173|volume=I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7TlAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22A+Distinguished+Member+of+the+Humane+Society%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K6drToKMMsju-gbVsZDMCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22A%20Distinguished%20Member%20of%20the%20Humane%20Society%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 19th century copy of the painting by [[George Cole (artist)|George Cole]] was sold by auctioneers [[Bonhams]] for £7,200 in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot Details: A Distinguished Member of The Humane Society|url=http://www.bonhams.com/eur/auction/14971/lot/12/|publisher=Bonhams|accessdate=10 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the Victorian era, the mainly sporting tradition remained but after the establishment of [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK in 1873 and the [[American Kennel Club]] in 1884 introduced [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standards]] or 'word pictures', dog portraits soared in popularity.&lt;ref name="Secord" /&gt; There were differences between the British and European style of depiction; William Secord, a world expert on canine art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art  A Muse to Artists and a Delight to Countless Viewers|url=http://www.ralphlaurenhome.com/design/art_gallery_guide/william_secord.aspx|publisher=Ralph Lauren Media|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; described it by stating: "Belgian, Dutch, Flemish and German artists were more influenced by realism, depicting the dog the way it really looked, with dirt on it’s coat and slobber and that kind of thing. You see Alfred Stevens, who's Belgian, do street dogs and dogs that are suffering, which in England you never see. British depictions were more idealized. They want it pretty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dog Art: The Dog Has Been a Muse to Countless Artists and a Delight to Viewers |url=http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/02/dog-star/ |publisher=Art &amp; Antiques |accessdate=24 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LLfDkUoj?url=http://www.artandantiquesmag.com/2012/02/dog-star/ |archivedate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prices achieved for canine art increased the 1980s–90s and started to gain popularity in established art circles rather than antique markets. Buyers can generally be divided into three dominant categories: hunters; breeders and exhibitors of pedigree dogs; and owners of companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silberman|first=Vanessa|title=Who Let the Dogs Out?|journal=Art Business News|date=May 2001|volume=28|issue=5|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-74628439/who-let-the-dogs-out|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of dogs have been extended as well to the artform of [[photography]], a noted example being the work of photographer [[Elliott Erwitt]].

The '''''Da’at Miqra''''' (Hebrew דעת מקרא) is a series of volumes of [[Hebrew]]-language [[biblical]] [[Bible commentary|commentary]] published by the [[Jerusalem]]-based [[Mossad Harav Kook]] and constitutes a cornerstone of contemporary [[Israel]]i [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[bible]] scholarship. The project was headed by [[Yehuda Kiel]], who received the [[Israel Prize]] for his part in the enterprise.

==Overview==
The singularity of ''Da’at Miqra'' lies in its combination of a [[traditional]] outlook and the findings of modern research.  The ''Da’at Miqra'' editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon ''[[Peshat]]'' — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to ''[[Peshat|Drash]]''.  They do so by incorporating [[geographic]] references, [[archaeological]] findings and textual analysis, presenting a clear link between the commentary's traditional approach and contemporary methodology.  There has been some suggestion that the ''Da’at Miqra‘''s dualistic approach reflects an underlying polemic against [[biblical criticism]], without directly addressing the views and queries of [[bible]] critics but via a commentary aimed at debunking their methodology.

==Methodology and structure==
The ''Da’at Miqra'' relies upon the [[Aleppo Codex]] for its basic text.  The commentary includes clarifications of difficult words and [[etymological]] references—particularly with regard to the names of locations mentioned—and contains various notes aimed at demonstrating, expanding upon or presenting alternate views on the text.  Each book of the ''[[Tanakh]]'' is divided into parts, each of which is preceded by a description of the chapter’s division and literary style and a general explanation of the portion.  In addition, each book contains a general introduction aimed at clarifying general issues within the text, such as the dating of its authorship, its historical background, parallels to other biblical books, an explanation of various repeating phrases or personas, and the like.

==Editorial staff==
Editors of the series included  [[Yehuda Elitzur]] of [[Bar-Ilan University]], the [[International Bible Contest]] champion and Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]],  [[Sha’ul Yisra’eli]] and  [[Mordechai Breuer]].

Icke was a [[BBC]] television sports presenter and spokesman for the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]] when, he claims, a [[psychic]] told him, in 1990, that he had been placed on Earth for a purpose and would begin to receive messages from the spirit world.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103&gt;Michael Barkun, ''A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America'', Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103].&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he announced that he was a "Son of the Godhead",&lt;ref name="stuff"/&gt; and that the world would soon be devastated by [[Tsunami|tidal waves]] and [[earthquakes]], a prediction he repeated on the BBC's primetime show ''[[Wogan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', London: Warner Books, 1993, 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Ronson, ''Them: Adventures with Extremists'', London: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001, 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt; The show changed his life, turning him from a respected household name into someone who was laughed at whenever he appeared in public.&lt;ref name="Channel 5 12 Dec 2006 00:02:20"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQzOZmJykk "David Icke: Was He Right?"], [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 12 December 2006, from 00:02:20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next 11 years he wrote ''The Robots' Rebellion'' (1994), ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), and ''Children of the Matrix'' (2001), where he developed his worldview of [[New Age]] conspiracism.&lt;ref&gt;For the four books over seven years, Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103].&lt;/ref&gt; His endorsement of the [[antisemitic]] forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' in ''The Robots' Rebellion'', and in ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', led his publisher to refuse to publish his books, which were [[Self-publishing|self-published]] thereafter.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt; Icke has gone on to lecture around the world, frequently selling out venues, and his books have been translated into eleven languages.&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt; 

At the heart of Icke's theories lies the idea that [[the universe]] is made up of "vibrational" energy, and consists of an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of [[Multiverse|dimensions]] that share the same space.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that an [[Interdimensional hypothesis|inter-dimensional]] race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]] beings called the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]] (or [[Anunnaki]]), have hijacked the [[Earth]], and that a [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] human/Archon [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] race of [[Shapeshifting|shape-shifting]] reptilians, also known as the "[[#reptoid|Babylonian Brotherhood]]", the [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati]], or the '[[Global elite|elite]]', manipulate global events to keep humans in a constant state of fear, so the Archons can feed off the 'negative energy' this creates.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 19–25, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims many prominent figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood, and are propelling [[Human beings|humanity]] towards an [[Orwellian]] global [[Fascism|fascist]] state, or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]; a [[post-truth]] era where [[freedom of speech]] is ended.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Henry Widdas |title=Being 'red-pilled' by David Icke has never been so entertaining...and terrifying |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/whats-on/theatre/being-red-pilled-by-david-icke-has-never-been-so-entertaining-and-terrifying-1-9120860 |website=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icke believes that the only way this 'Archontic' influence can be defeated is by humanity waking up to 'the truth', and filling their hearts with [[love]].&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; Critics have accused Icke of being a [[Holocaust denier]] and his "reptilians" and other theories of being antisemitic, claims he denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Henry|last=Widdas|title=Icke: Reports of my madness have been greatly exaggerated|url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/politics/icke-reports-of-my-madness-have-been-greatly-exaggerated-1-9253395|accessdate=9 August 2018|work=Lancashire Post|date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Family and education===
The middle son of three boys born seven years apart, Icke was born in [[Leicester General Hospital]] to Beric Vaughan Icke and Barbara J. Icke, née Cooke, who were married in Leicester in 1951. Beric had wanted to be a doctor, but the family had no money, so he joined the [[Royal Air Force]] as a medical orderly.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded a [[British Empire Medal]] for gallantry in 1943 after an aircraft crashed into the [[Chipping Warden]] air base in Northamptonshire. Along with a [[squadron leader]], Beric ran into the burning aircraft, without protective clothing, and saved the life of a crew member who was trapped inside.{{refn|group=n|1479714 Leading Aircraftman Beric Vaughan Icke, Royal Air Force, ''[[The London Gazette]]'', 14 May 1943:{{pb}} "One night in March, 1943, an aircraft crashed on a Royal Air Force station and immediately burst into flames. Squadron Leader Moore (the duty medical officer) saw the accident and, accompanied by [[Leading Aircraftman]] Icke, a medical orderly, proceeded to the scene. Squadron Leader Moore directed the removal of the rear gunner, who was dazed and sitting amongst the burning wreckage, to a place of safety. The aircraft was now enveloped in flames and ammunition was exploding. Nevertheless, despite the intense heat and the danger from exploding oxygen bottles this officer and airman entered the burning wreckage in an attempt to rescue another member of the crew who was pinned down. Without any protective clothing they lifted aside the burning wreckage and, with great difficulty, succeeded in extricating the injured man. Squadron Leader Moore rendered first aid to the rescued man. Squadron Leader Moore sustained burns to his chest and hands in carrying out the operation. This officer and airman both displayed courage and devotion to duty in keeping with the highest traditions of the Royal Air Force.{{pb}}"Acting Squadron Leader Frederick Thomas Moore, B.S., F.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (23417), Reserve of Air Force Officers, was awarded the MBE for his part in this action."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080302090432/http://www.rafweb.org/BEM_Holders2.htm "1479714 Leading Aircraftman Beric Vaughan Icke, Royal Air Force"], ''The London Gazette'', 14 May 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the war Beric became a clerk in the [[Gents' of Leicester|Gents]] clock factory. The family lived in a [[terraced house]] on Lead Street in the centre of [[Leicester]],&lt;ref name=Icke1993pp29,33/&gt; an area that was demolished in the mid-1950s as part of the city's [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref name=Hewitt2013p153&gt;Ned Newitt, ''The Slums of Leicester'', JMD Media Ltd, 2013, 153 (for demolition, 159–160).&lt;/ref&gt; When Icke was three, in around 1955, they moved to the Goodwood estate, one of the [[council estate]]s the [[Attlee ministry|post-war Labour government]] built. "To say we were skint," he wrote in 1993, "is like saying it is a little chilly at the North Pole."&lt;ref name=Icke1993pp29,33&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 29, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He recalls having to hide under a window or chair when the council man came for the rent; after knocking, the rent man would walk around the house peering through windows. His mother never explained that it was about the rent; she just told Icke to hide. He wrote in 2003 that he still gets a fright when someone knocks on the door.&lt;ref name=Icke2003p2&gt;David Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', Ryde: Bridge of Love Publications, 2003, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Always a loner, he spent hours playing with toy trains, preferring to cross the street rather than speak to anyone. He attended Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before he passed out. The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father disagreed.&lt;ref name=Light36&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 36, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke2003p2/&gt;

Icke made no effort at school, but when he was nine, he was chosen for the junior school's third-year football team. It was the first time he had succeeded at anything, and he came to see football as his way out of poverty. He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

After failing his [[Eleven plus exam|11-plus exam]] in 1963, he was sent to the city's Crown Hills Secondary Modern (rather than the local [[grammar school]]), where he was given a trial for the Leicester Boys Under-Fourteen team.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 44, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He left school at 15 after being talent-spotted by [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who signed him up in 1967 as their youth team's goalkeeper. He also played for [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]]'s reserve team and [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]], on loan from Coventry.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 54, 58 (for Oxford).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] in his left knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making a career out of football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], including in the first team when they were in the [[Football League Fourth Division|fourth]], and later in the [[Football League Third Division|third]], division of the English [[The Football League|Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt; He was earning up to £33 a week.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2012, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First marriage===
Icke met his first wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a dance at the Chesford Grange Hotel near [[Leamington Spa]]; she was working as a van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's arthritis was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

He and Atherton were married on 30 September that year, four months after they met.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter was born in March 1975, followed by one son in December 1981 and another in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 82, 96, 253–254.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 2001 but remained good friends, and Atherton continued to work as Icke's business manager.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 139–140, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism, sports broadcasting===

The loss of Icke's position with Hereford meant that he and his wife had to sell their home, and for several weeks they lived apart, each moving in with their parents. In 1973 Icke found a job as a reporter with the weekly ''Leicester Advertiser'', through a contact who was a sports editor at the ''[[Daily Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 72, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved on to the Leicester News Agency, and through it did some work for [[BBC Radio Leicester]] as its football reporter,&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; then worked his way up through the ''Loughborough Monitor'', the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'' and [[Free Radio Birmingham|BRMB Radio]] in Birmingham.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 79, 81, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked for two months in [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1976, helping with the national football team. It was supposed to be a longer-term position, but he missed his wife and new daughter and decided not to return after his first holiday back to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt; BRMB gave him his job back, after which he successfully applied to ''[[Midlands Today]]'' at the BBC's [[Pebble Mill Studios]] in Birmingham, a job that included on-air appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest stories he covered there was the murder of [[Bridgewater Four|Carl Bridgewater]], the paperboy who was shot during a robbery in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 Icke became a sports presenter for the BBC's national programme, ''[[Newsnight]]'', which had begun the previous year. Two years later, on 17 January 1983, he appeared on the first edition of the BBC's ''[[Breakfast Time]]'', British television's first national breakfast show, and presented the sports news there until 1985, which meant getting up at two o'clock in the morning five days a week. In the middle of 1983 he achieved his ambition when he co-hosted ''[[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]]'', at the time the BBC's flagship national sports programme.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 93–95, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He also published his first book that year, ''It's a Tough Game, Son!'', about how to break into football.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke and his family moved in 1982 to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 109.&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with ''Grandstand'' was short lived – he wrote that a new editor arrived in 1983 who appeared not to like him – but he continued working for [[BBC Sport]] until 1990, often on [[bowls]] and [[snooker]] programmes, and at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; He was by then a household name, but a career in television began to lose its appeal; he wrote that he found television workers insecure, shallow and sometimes vicious.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1990, his contract with the BBC was terminated when he initially refused to pay the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]] (also known as the "poll tax"), a local tax introduced that year by [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s government. He ultimately paid it, but his announcement that he was willing to go to prison rather than pay prompted the BBC, by charter an impartial public-service broadcaster, to distance itself from him.&lt;ref&gt;"Protester David Icke finally pays community charge," ''The Guardian'', 14 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy20March1991&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Maev |authorlink=Maev Kennedy|title=Icke resigns Green Speaker and parliamentary roles |work=The Guardian |date=20 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual awakening==
===Green Party, Betty Shine===
[[File:Ryde, Isle of Wight, down to the sea.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Icke moved to [[Ryde]] on the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1982.]]
Icke had begun to flirt with [[alternative medicine]] and New Age philosophies in the 1980s, in an effort to relieve his arthritis, and this encouraged his interest in Green politics. Within six months of joining the [[Green Party (UK)|Green Party]], he was given a position as one of its four [[principal speaker]]s, positions created in lieu of a single leader.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Truth Vibrations'', London: Gateway, 1991, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

His second book, ''It Doesn't Have To Be Like This'', an outline of his views on the environment, was published in 1989, and he was regularly invited to high-profile events. That year he discussed animal rights during a televised debate at the [[Royal Institution]], alongside [[Tom Regan]], [[Mary Warnock]] and [[Germaine Greer]],&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [http://www.all-creatures.org/articles/video-flv-human.html "Does the Animal Kingdom need a Bill of Rights?"], Royal Institute of Great Britain, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1990 his name appeared on advertisements for a children's charity, along with [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Woody Allen]] and other celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;''Weekend Guardian'', 22–23 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his successful media career, Icke wrote that 1989 was a time of considerable personal despair, and it was during this period that he said he began to feel a presence around him.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Days of Decision'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He often describes how he felt it while alone in a hotel room in March 1990, and finally asked: "If there is anybody here, will you please contact me because you are driving me up the wall!" Days later, in a [[Newsagent's shop|newsagent's]] in Ryde, he felt a force pull his feet to the ground, he wrote, and heard a voice guide him toward some books. One of them was ''Mind to Mind'' (1989) by [[Betty Shine]], a psychic healer in [[Brighton]]. He read the book, then wrote to her requesting a consultation about his arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Phantom Self'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2016, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bio1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110619122640/http://davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 "Biography 1"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 8 June 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnkaCvp?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=1 archived]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2003/jan/12/features.sportmonthly "The 10 worst decisions in the history of sport"], ''The Observer'', 12 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Truth Vibrations'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke visited Shine four times. During the third meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke claims to have felt something like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;Kay 2011, 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David G. Robertson, "David Icke’s Reptilian Thesis and the Development of New Age Theodicy," ''International Journal for the Study of New Religions'', 4(1), 2013 (27–47), 33. {{doi|10.1558/ijsnr.v4i1.27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Icke had been sent to heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilised by having oil taken from under the seabed.&lt;ref name=bio1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;For the date and predictions, [http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=6 "Biography 2"], davidickebooks.co.uk, accessed 12 December 2010 ([https://www.webcitation.org/66tnr47yM?url=http://www.davidickebooks.co.uk/index.php?act%3DviewDoc%26docId%3D6 archived]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke 2016, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1991, Icke visited a pre-[[Inca]] [[Sillustani]] burial ground near [[Puno]], [[Peru]], where he says he felt drawn to a particular circle of waist-high stones. As he stood in the circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, and that it would be over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] (a term from Hindu [[yoga]]) activating his [[chakra]]s, or energy centres, triggering a [[Higher consciousness|higher level of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 12–13, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;

===Turquoise period===
[[File:Sillustani Archaeological Site (7640965048).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|alt=photograph|Icke's turquoise period followed an experience by a burial site in [[Sillustani]], Peru, in 1991.]]
There followed what Icke called his "turquoise period". He had been [[Mediumship|channelling]] for some time, he wrote, and had received a message through [[automatic writing]] that he was a "Son of the Godhead", interpreting "Godhead" as the "Infinite Mind".&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 190, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; He began to wear only [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], often a turquoise [[shell suit]], a colour he saw as a conduit for positive energy.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001&gt;Jon Ronson, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend "Beset by lizards (part one)"]; [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend1 "Beset by lizards (part two)"], ''The Guardian'', 17 March 2001, edited extracts from Jon Ronson, ''Them: Adventures with Extremists''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also started working on his third book, and the first of his New-Age period, ''The Truth Vibrations''.

In August 1990, before his visit to Peru, Icke had met Deborah Shaw, an English psychic living in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. When he returned from Peru they began a relationship, with the apparent blessing of Icke's wife. In March 1991 Shaw began living with the couple, a short-lived arrangement that the press called the "turquoise triangle". Shaw changed her name to Mari Shawsun, while Icke's wife became Michaela, which she said was an aspect of the [[Archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].&lt;ref name=Taylor1997&gt;Sam Taylor, "So I was in this bar with the son of God&amp;nbsp;...," ''The Observer'', 20 April 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship with Shaw led to the birth of a daughter in December 1991, although she and Icke had stopped seeing each other by then. Icke wrote in 1993 that he decided not to visit his daughter and had seen her only once, at the request of Shaw. Icke's wife gave birth to the couple's second son in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 223, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press conference===
In March 1991, Icke resigned from the Green Party during a party conference, telling them he was about to be at the centre of "tremendous and increasing controversy", and winning a standing ovation from delegates after the announcement.&lt;ref name=Kennedy20March1991/&gt; A week later, shortly after his father died, Icke and his wife, Linda Atherton, along with their daughter and Deborah Shaw, held a press conference to announce that Icke was a son of the Godhead.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''In the Light of Experience'', 188 for his father; 192–193 for the press conference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 130–131.&lt;/ref&gt; He told reporters the world was going to end in 1997. It would be preceded by a hurricane around the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[New Orleans]], eruptions in [[Cuba]], disruption in China, a hurricane in Derry, and an earthquake on the [[Isle of Arran]].  The information was being given to them by voices and [[automatic writing]], he said. [[Los Angeles]] would become an island, [[New Zealand]] would disappear, and the cliffs of Kent would be under water by Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;John Ezard, "'Son and daughter of God' predict apocalypse is nigh," ''The Guardian'', 28 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wogan'' interview===
The headlines attracted requests for interviews from [[Nicky Campbell]]'s [[BBC Radio One]] programme, for [[Terry Wogan]]'s prime-time ''[[Wogan]]'' show, and [[Fern Britton]]'s ITV chat show.&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p131&gt;Robertson 2016, 131.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wogan'' interview, on 29 April 1991, was the most damaging.

Wogan introduced the 1991 segment with "The world as we know it is about to end". Amid laughter from the audience, Icke prevaricated when asked if he was the son of God, replying that Jesus would have been laughed at too, and repeating that Britain would soon be devastated by tidal waves and earthquakes. Without these, "the Earth will cease to exist". When Icke said laughter was the best way to remove negativity, Wogan replied of the audience: "But they're laughing ''at'' you. They're not laughing with you."&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p131/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson 2001, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/david-icke-terry-wogan-interview/ "The day David Icke told Terry Wogan 'I'm the son of God'"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 29 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interview proved devastating for Icke. The BBC was criticised for allowing it to go ahead; Des Christy of ''The Guardian'' called it a "media crucifixion".&lt;ref name=Christy&gt;Des Christy, "Crucifixion, courtesy of the BBC," ''The Guardian'', 6 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke disappeared from public life for a time.&lt;ref name="Channel 5 12 Dec 2006 00:02:20"/&gt; In May 1991, police were called to the couple's home after a crowd of over 100 youths gathered outside, chanting "[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|We want the Messiah]]" and "Give us a sign, David".&lt;ref&gt;"Icke taunted," ''The Times'', 27 May 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke told [[Jon Ronson]] in 2001:

{{quote|
"One of my very greatest fears as a child was being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People come up to you in the street and shake your hand and talk to you in a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into "Icke's a nutter." I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule."&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ronson 2001, 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006 Wogan re-interviewed Icke for a special 'Now &amp; Then' series. Wogan apologised for his conduct in the earlier 1991 interview.&lt;ref name="Robertson2"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David G. Robertson |title=UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1474253208 |pages=147 |edition=First |language=English |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and lecturing==
===Publishing===
The ''Wogan'' interview separated Icke from his own previous life, he wrote in 2003, although he considered it the making of him in the end, giving him the courage to develop his ideas without caring what anyone thought.&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Tales from the Time Loop'', 14, 17, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''The Truth Vibrations'', inspired by his experience in Peru, was published in May 1991, and he continued to write, turning himself into a popular author and speaker.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt;

Between 1992 and 1994, he wrote five books, all published by mainstream publishers, four in 1993. ''Love Changes Everything'' (1992), influenced by the "channelling" work of Deborah Shaw, is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] work about the origin of the planet, in which Icke writes with admiration about Jesus. ''Days of Decision'' (1993) is an 86-page summary of his interviews after the 1991 press conference; it questions the [[historicity of Jesus]] but accepts the existence of the Christ spirit. Icke's autobiography, ''In the Light of Experience'', was published the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, pp. 133–135.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''Heal the World: A Do-It-Yourself Guide to Personal and Planetary Transformation'' (1993).

====''The Robots' Rebellion''====
[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|1alt=cartoon|In his 2001 documentary about Icke, Jon Ronson cited this cartoon, "Rothschild" (1898), by [[Charles Lucien Léandre|Charles Léandre]], arguing that Jews have long been depicted as lizard-like creatures out to control the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ronson (Channel 4) 2001, 06:12 mins.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Icke's fifth book of that period, ''The Robots' Rebellion'' (1994), published by Gateway, attracted allegations that his work was [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], the book contains "all the familiar beliefs and paranoid clichés" of the US conspiracists and militia.&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity'', New York University Press, 2003, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It claims that a plan for world domination by a shadowy cabal, perhaps extraterrestrial, was laid out in ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' (c. 1897). 

''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' is a notorious antisemitic [[literary forgery]], probably written under the direction of the [[Okhrana|Russian secret police]] in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by the Jewish people to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a forgery in 1920 by [[Lucien Wolf]] and the following year by [[Philip Graves]] in ''The Times''.&lt;ref name=Barkunprotocols&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA50 50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007058 "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"] ([https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007244 timeline]), United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Once exposed, [[Michael Barkun]] argues, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Barkun49&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA50 50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA145 145–146].&lt;/ref&gt; Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Juliane Wetzel, "''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' on the internet: How radical political groups are networked via antisemitic conspiracy theories," in Esther Webman (ed.), ''The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth'', New York: Routledge, 2012 (147–160), 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun states that Icke's reliance on the ''Protocols'' in ''The Robots' Rebellion'' is "the first of a number of instances in which Icke moves into the dangerous terrain of anti-Semitism".&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also see Norman Simms, "Anti-Semitism: A Psychopathological Disease," in Jerry S. Piven, Chris Boyd, Henry W. Lawton (eds.),  ''Judaism and Genocide: Psychological Undercurrents of History'', Volume IV, Lincoln, NE: Writers Club Press, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=eFFsEYvBEZgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA30 30ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke took both the extraterrestrial angle and the focus on the ''Protocols'' from ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991) by [[Milton William Cooper]], who was associated with the American militia movement; chapter 15 of Cooper's book reproduces the ''Protocols'' in full.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Cooper: Ed Vulliamy, Bruce Dirks, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/1997/nov/03/mcveigh.usa "New trial may solve riddle of Oklahoma bombing"], ''The Guardian'', 3 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Robots' Rebellion'' refers repeatedly to the ''Protocols'', calling them the ''Illuminati protocols'', and defining ''Illuminati'' as the "Brotherhood elite at the top of the pyramid of secret societies world-wide". Icke adds that the ''Protocols'' were not the work of the Jewish people, but of [[Zionism|Zionists]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Robots' Rebellion'', London: Gateway, 1992, 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Honigsbaum&gt;Mark Honigsbaum, [https://web.archive.org/web/19990428140350/http://www2.ca.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi/orgs/british/combat-18/press/evening-standard.052695 "The Dark Side of David Icke"], ''London Evening Standard'', 26 May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Robots' Rebellion'' was greeted with dismay by the Green Party's executive. Despite the controversy over the press conference and the ''Wogan'' interview, they had allowed Icke to address the party's annual conference in 1992—a decision that led one of its principal speakers, [[Sara Parkin]], to resign—but after the publication of ''The Robot's Rebellion'' they moved to ban him.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/greens-bar-icke-1448269.html "Greens bar Icke"], ''The Independent'', 12 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vivek Chaudhary, "Greens see red at 'Son of God's anti-Semitism'," ''The Guardian'', 12 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Goodwin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130602074558/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4678912.html "Icke factor could thwart Greens' serious message"], ''The Independent'', 29 September 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.

===Self-Publishing===
{{Rquote|right|&lt;small&gt;Why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the [[Second World War]]? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events. And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history.&lt;/small&gt;|''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995)&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}
Icke's next manuscript, ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), contained a chapter questioning aspects of the Holocaust, which caused a rift with his publisher, Gateway.&lt;ref name=Honigsbaum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biggestsecret/andtruthfreebook/truthfree07.htm "Chapter Seven: Master races"], ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', Ryde: Bridge of Love Publications, 1995, 127–146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=off&gt;Will Offley, [http://www.publiceye.org/Icke/Ickequotes.htm "Selected Quotes Of David Icke"], Political Research Associates, 23 February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

After borrowing £15,000 from a friend, Icke set up Bridge of Love Publications, later called David Icke Books. He self-published ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', and all his work thereafter. Icke wrote in 2004 that ''And the Truth'' was one of his proudest achievements.&lt;ref name=IckeTruthintro&gt;Icke, ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'', Introduction to 21st century edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; 

According to Lewis and Kahn, Icke set about consolidating all conspiracy theories into one project with unlimited explanatory power. His books sold 140,000 copies between 1998 and 2011, at a value of over £2 million.&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt; Thirty thousand copies of ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999) were in print months after publication, according to Icke,&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106].&lt;/ref&gt; and it was reprinted six times between 1999 and 2006. His 2002 book, ''Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster'', became a long-standing top-five bestseller in South Africa.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt; By 2006, his website was getting 600,000 hits a week, and by 2011 his books had been translated into 11 languages.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011/&gt;

===Lecturing===
[[File:David Icke, 7 June 2013 (2).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Icke speaking in June 2013]]
Icke became known, in particular, for his lengthy lectures. By 2006, he had lectured in at least 25 countries, attracting audiences of several thousand each time.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; He lectured for seven hours to 2,500 people at the [[Brixton Academy]], London, in 2008,&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2250650/ "David Icke: ''Beyond the Cutting Edge'' (2008)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; and the same year addressed the [[University of Oxford]]'s debating society, the [[Oxford Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Evans, [http://www.newstatesman.com/life-and-society/2008/03/icke-world-conspiracy "Interview: David Icke"], ''New Statesman'', 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Marre, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/7days/story/0,,2243708,00.html "Pendennis"], ''The Observer'', 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCwAcJ78a8A "David Icke Live at the Oxford Union Debating Society"], produced by Linda Atherton, Commonage, February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His book tour for ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2010) included a sell-out talk to 2,100 in [[New York City|New York]] and £83,000 worth of ticket sales in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. In October 2012, he delivered a 10-hour lecture to 6,000 people at London's [[Wembley Arena]].&lt;ref name=Alexander4Dec2011&gt;Harriet Alexander, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8933565/David-Icke-would-you-believe-it.html "David Icke – would you believe it?"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 4 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For London, Susie Mesure, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-icke-is-not-the-messiah-or-even-that-naughty-but-boy-can-he-drone-on-8229433.html "David Icke is not the Messiah. Or even that naughty. But boy, can he drone on"], ''The Independent'', 27 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage, politics, television===
In 1997, Icke met his second wife, Pamela Leigh Richards, in [[Jamaica]]. He and Linda Atherton divorced in 2001,&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139-140&gt;Robertson 2016, 139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Richards were married the same year.&lt;ref name=Channel52006/&gt; However, the couple separated in 2008 and divorced in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke stood for parliament in the [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008|2008 by-election]] for [[Haltemprice and Howden (UK Parliament constituency)|Haltemprice and Howden]] (an [[East Yorkshire]] constituency), on the issue of "Big Brother—The Big Picture". He came 12th out of 26 candidates, with 110 votes (0.46%), resulting in a lost [[Deposit (politics)|deposit]].&lt;ref name="Robertson2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7501046.stm "Haltemprice and Howden: Result in full"], BBC News, 11 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Wainwright, Allegra Stratton and agencies, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/11/haltemprice.byelections1 "Haltemprice and Howden byelection: Davis sees off Loonies and claims victory in 42-day detention battle"], ''The Guardian'', 11 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that he was standing because "if we don't face this now we are going to have some serious explaining to do when we are asked by our children and grandchildren what we were doing when the global fascist state was installed. 'I was watching ''[[EastEnders]]'', dear' will not be good enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120213180350/http://www.votewise.co.uk/index.php?pg=show&amp;c=1076&amp;eid=MP0003-0&amp;this=1076 "David ICKE stood for the None (No Party)"], VoteWise, accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Naughton, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article4226273.ece "Reptilians beware – David Icke is back!"], ''The Times'', 27 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Icke launched an internet television station, [[The People's Voice (internet TV station)|The People's Voice]], broadcast from London. He founded the station after crowdsourcing over £300,000 and worked for it as a volunteer until March 2014. As of that year, the station had stopped broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Tomas Jivanda, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/david-icke-launches-internet-tv-station-the-people-s-voice-8962731.html "David Icke launches internet TV station The People's Voice"], ''The Independent'', 25 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepeoplesvoice.tv/ ''The People's Voice 2.0''] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518144619/http%3A//thepeoplesvoice.tv/ |date=18 May 2016 }}, thepeoplesvoice.tv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTPVchannel ''The People's Voice''], YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key ideas==
===Overview===
Icke combines New Age philosophical discussion about the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories about public figures being reptilian humanoids and [[paedophilia|paedophiles]]. He argues in favour of [[reincarnation]]; a collective consciousness that has [[intentionality]]; [[modal realism]] (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the [[Law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).&lt;ref&gt;For law of attraction, Icke, ''Children of the Matrix'', 291ff, and ''The Biggest Secret'', 30–40. For other possible worlds, Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

In ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), he introduced the idea that many prominent figures derive from the [[Anunnaki]], a reptilian race from the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2012), he identified the [[Moon]] (and later [[Saturn]]) as the source of [[holographic]] experiences, broadcast by the reptiles, that humanity interprets as reality.&lt;ref name=Icke2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; David Icke also thinks that [[global warming|climate change]] is a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/dec/06/more-terrifying-than-trump-the-booming-conspiracy-culture-of-climate-science-denial|title=More terrifying than Trump? The booming conspiracy culture of climate science denial|year=2016|newspaper=The Guardian|last1=Readfearn|first1=Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infinite dimensions===
Icke believes that the universe is made up of "vibrational" energy, and consists of an infinite number of dimensions that share the same space, just like television and radio frequencies, and that some people can tune their consciousness to other wavelengths.&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH"&gt;{{cite web |author1=James Ward |title=Mocked prophet: what is David Icke's appeal? |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4797/mocked-prophet-what-is-david-ickes-appeal |website=New Humanist |accessdate=15 June 2018 |date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated in an interview with [[The Guardian]] that:

{{cquote|
Our five senses can access only a tiny frequency range, like a radio tuned to one station. In the space you are occupying now are all the radio and television stations broadcasting to your area. You can't see them and they can't see each other because they are on different wavelengths. But move your radio dial and suddenly there they are, one after the other. It is the same with the reality we experience here as 'life'. What we call the 'world' and the 'universe' is only one frequency range in an infinite number sharing the same space.&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006/&gt;
}}

Icke believes that time is an illusion; there is no past, or future, and only the "infinite now" is real, and that humans are an aspect of consciousness, or infinite awareness, which he describes as "all that there is, has been, and ever can be".&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

===Reptoid hypothesis{{anchor|reptoid}}===
{{further|New World Order (conspiracy theory)}}
[[File:Draco Hevelius.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=drawing|The [[Draco (constellation)|Draco constellation]] from ''Firmamentum Sobiescianum sive Uranographia'' (1690)  by [[Johannes Hevelius]]. Icke's "reptoid hypothesis" posits that humanity is ruled by descendants of reptilians from Draco.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA105 105].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Icke proposes that an inter-dimensional race of reptilian beings called the [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archons]], have hijacked the earth, and are stopping humanity from realising its true potential.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt; He claims they are the same beings as; the [[Anunnaki]] [[deities]] from the [[Babylonia]]n creation myth, the ''[[Enûma Eliš]]'', and the fallen angels, or [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]], who mated with human women in the [[Biblical apocrypha]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 19–25, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Archons--&gt; Icke believes that a genetically modified human/Archon hybrid race of shape-shifting reptilians, known as the "Babylonian Brotherhood", or the [[Illuminati]], manipulate global events to keep humans in a constant state of fear, so the Archons can feed off the 'negative energy' this creates.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 52ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Biggest Secret'' (1999), Icke identified the Brotherhood as descendants of reptilians from the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], and said that they live in caverns inside the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 140ff.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke said in an interview:

&lt;blockquote style="background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;"&gt;
"When you get back into the ancient world, you find this recurring theme of a union between a non-human race and humans—creating a hybrid race."

"From 1998, I started coming across people who told me they had seen people change into a non-human form. It's an age-old phenomenon known as shape-shifting. The basic form is like a scaly humanoid, with reptilian rather than humanoid eyes."&lt;ref name="Scotsman2006"&gt;[http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/the-royal-family-are-bloodsucking-alien-lizards-david-icke-1-1103954 "The Royal Family are bloodsucking alien lizards – David Icke"], ''The Scotsman'', 30 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Icke claims the first reptilian-human breeding programmes took place 200,000–300,000 years ago (perhaps creating [[Adam]]),&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40/&gt; and the third (and latest) 7,000 years ago. Icke claims the hybrids of the third programme, which are more Anunnaki than human, currently control the world. He writes in ''The Biggest Secret'' that: "The Brotherhood which controls the world today is the modern expression of the Babylonian Brotherhood of reptile-[[Aryan]] priests and 'royalty'". Icke states that they came together in [[Sumer]] after [[Genesis flood narrative|'the flood']], but originated in the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke1999p52&gt;Icke, ''Biggest Secret'', 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Icke1999p43&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that when he uses the term "Aryan" he is referring to "the white race."&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke states that the reptilians not only come from another planet, but also from another dimension, the lower level of the fourth dimension (the "lower [[Astral plane|astral dimension]]"), the one nearest the physical world.&lt;ref name=Biggest26/&gt; It is from this dimensions that they control the planet, although just as fourth-dimensional reptilians control us, they in turn are controlled by a fifth dimension.&lt;ref name=Biggest26&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Barkun argues that Icke's introduction of different dimensions allowed him to skip awkward questions about how the reptilians got here.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106/&gt; 

Icke believes that the only way this 'Archontic' influence can be defeated is by humanity waking up to 'the truth', and filling their hearts with love.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Icke briefly introduced his [[Ancient astronaut hypothesis|ancient-astronaut hypothesis]] in ''The Robot's Rebellion'' (1994), citing [[Milton William Cooper|Bill Cooper]]'s ''Behold a Pale Horse'' (1991), and expanded it in ''And the Truth Shall Set You Free'' (1995), citing Barbara Marciniak's ''Bringers of the Dawn'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Barbara Marciniak wrote that ''Bringers of the Dawn'' was a [[Mediumship|channelled]] book dictated from the [[Pleiades in folklore and literature|Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Marciniak, ''Bringers of the Dawn'', Rochester: Bear &amp; Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Robertson writes that Icke's reptilian idea is adapted from [[Zecharia Sitchin]]'s ''The 12th Planet'' (1976), combined with material from [[Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa|Credo Mutwa]], a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] healer.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2013, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitchin suggested that the Anunnaki came to Earth for its precious metals. Icke has said that they came for what he refers to as 'mono-atomic gold', which he claims, can increase the capacity of the [[nervous system]] ten thousandfold, and that after ingesting it, the Anunnaki can process vast amounts of information, speed up trans-dimensional travel, and [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] from reptilian to human.&lt;ref name=Icke1999p30&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p81&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis and Kahn argue that Icke is using [[allegory]] to depict the alien, and alienating, nature of global capitalism.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82/&gt; Icke has said he is not using allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Reptilian humanoid#VandIcke|some aspects]] of the [[V (franchise)|V]] [[science fiction]] franchise may have helped inspire some of David Icke's theories.&lt;ref name=VReview-01a&gt;{{cite web |last=Haase |first=Holger |title='V' - The Series DVD review|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/dvd-bluray/7710/v-the-series-dvd-review |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=30 November 2018 |publisher=[[Den of Geek]] |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=December 2018}}

As of 2003, the reptilian bloodline is claimed to encompassed 43 American presidents, three British and two Canadian prime ministers, several Sumerian kings and Egyptian pharaohs, and a smattering of celebrities. Key bloodlines include the [[Rockefeller family|Rockefeller]]s, [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]]s, various European aristocratic families, the establishment families of the Eastern United States, and the British [[House of Windsor]].&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt; Icke confirmed to [[Andrew Neil]] in May 2016 that he believes the British Royal Family are shape-shifting lizards.&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016&gt;Andrew Neil, [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36339298 "David Icke on 9/11 and lizards in Buckingham Palace theories"], ''This Week'', BBC (video), 20 May 2016, 00:04:02.&lt;/ref&gt; He identified the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] in 2001 as "seriously reptilian",&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104/&gt; and said he had seen [[Ted Heath]]'s eyes turn black while the two waited for a Sky News interview in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/22/broadcasting.observermagazine "This much I know"], interviewed by Ben Mitchell, ''The Observer'', 22 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Doyle17Feb2006&gt;Paul Doyle, [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/feb/17/smalltalk.sportinterviews "David Icke"], ''The Guardian'', 17 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Brotherhood aims and institutions====
At the apex of the Babylonian Brotherhood stand the Global Elite, and at the top of the Global Elite are what Icke refers to as the 'Prison Wardens'. Icke claims the goal of the Brotherhood, or their "Great Work of Ages", is a microchipped population, a world government, and a global [[Orwellian]] [[Fascism|fascist]] state, or [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], which he claims will be a [[post-truth]] era where [[freedom of speech]] is ended.&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p103/&gt;&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Neil20May2016/&gt;&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p104&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA104 104].&lt;/ref&gt;

Icke believes that the "Brotherhood" use human anxiety as energy, and that the Archons keep humanity trapped in a "five sense reality", so they can feed off the negative energy created by fear and hate.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p82&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Claiming the more of these emotions that can be stimulated the more energy the reptilians have to work with, Icke wrote in 1999: "Thus we have the encouragement of wars, human genocide, the mass slaughter of animals, sexual perversions which create highly charged negative energy, and black magic ritual and sacrifice which takes place on a scale that will stagger those who have not studied the subject."&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke proposes that human sacrifice 'to the gods' in the ancient world was for the benefit of the reptilians, especially sacrifice of children, because "at the moment of death by sacrifice a form of adrenalin surges through the body, accumulating at the base of the brain and is, apparently more potent in children", claiming "this is what the reptilians and their crossbreeds want". Icke suggests that these sacrifices continue to this day.&lt;ref name=Icke1999p40&gt;Icke, ''The Biggest Secret'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims the reptilians and their hybrid bloodlines engage in [[pedophilia]] and [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is claimed that the Brotherhood either created, or controls; the [[United Nations]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Round Table (club)|Round Table]], [[Council on Foreign Relations]], [[Chatham House]], [[Club of Rome]], [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]], [[Trilateral Commission]] and [[Bilderberg Group]], as well as the media, military, [[CIA]], [[MI6]], [[Mossad]], science, religion, and the [[Internet]], with witting or unwitting support from the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clarke2003p291/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Children of the Matrix'', 339.

==== Controversy of antisemitism ====

David Icke has been accused of antisemitism on numerous occasions. After Icke's talk in Vancouver on Sept. 2 2017, the Canadian Jewish News called Icke "a controversial conspiracy theorist, anti-Semite and Holocaust denier" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gindin |first1=Matthew |title=Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theorist David Icke Gives Talk in Vancouver |url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/anti-semitic-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-gives-talk-vancouver |website=[[The Canadian Jewish News]] | publisher=The Canadian Jewish News |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following complaints from the [[Canadian Jewish Congress]] in 2000, Icke was briefly detained by immigration officials in Canada where he was booked for a speaking tour,&lt;ref name=Jonson17March2001/&gt; and his books were removed from [[Indigo Books]], a Canadian chain. Several stops on the tour were cancelled by the venues, as was a lecture in London.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Kraft, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301204725/http://www.cjnews.com/pastIssues/99/oct7-99/front2.htm "New Age speaker set to talk in Toronto"], ''The Canadian Jewish News'', 7 October 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Cowley, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-5116145.html "The Icke Files"], ''The Independent on Sunday'', 1 October 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Two venues in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], cancelled live events scheduled to be hosted by Icke in 2017 following accusations of antisemitism. The Maritim hotel did not give a reason for the cancellation, but The Carl Benz Arena stated on its [[Facebook]] page that it was due to the "contentious nature and the contradictory statements, which for us as a politically neutral event venue do not give a clear picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lizard conspiracist David Icke not wanted in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.com/en/lizard-conspiracist-david-icke-not-wanted-in-berlin/a-37693384|accessdate=26 May 2018|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event to be held at [[Manchester United]]'s [[Old Trafford]] was also cancelled in 2017, with the venue stating it was due to Icke's "objectionable views."&lt;ref name="GuardianManU"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Jackson |first1=Jamie |title=Manchester United cancel David Icke show at Old Trafford after backlash |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/17/manchester-united-cancel-david-icke-show-at-old-trafford-social-media-backlash |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2018|date=2017-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke repeatedly denies he is an anti-Semite and many of the people Icke has publicly named as reptilian are not Jewish. In 2001, when questioned by [[Jon Ronson]], Icke declared that the Protocols of Zion is evidence not of a Jewish plot, but of a reptilian plot. Icke also stated: "the families in positions of great financial power obsessively interbreed with each other. But I'm not talking about one earth race, Jewish or non-Jewish. I'm talking about a genetic network that operates through all races, this bloodline being a fusion of human and reptilian genes....let me make myself clear - this does not in any way relate to an earth race." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ronson |first1=Jon| authorlink=Jon Ronson |title=Beset by Lizards |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/17/features.weekend |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate= 6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His message is consistent over time.  However, he tends to refer to the reptilian plot as the "unseen".  After Icke's 2018 talk in Southport, UK, [[Michael Marshall (skeptic)|Michael Marshall]] reported:

{{quote|
"The appearance of the ‘unseen’ in the Middle East 6,000 years ago seems to be no coincidence, and it’s little wonder that Icke’s work is so often accused of anti-Semitism. However, if we were to accept that Icke himself does not hold such views, and that his work is merely co-opted by groups who undeniably are anti-Semitic, we also have to acknowledge that Icke often does his case no favours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marshall |first1=Michael | authorlink=Michael Marshall (skeptic) |title=David Icke Live: What I Learned From Spending Four Hours With The World's Most Famous Conspiracy Theorist |url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/05/david-icke-live-what-i-learned-from-spending-four-hours-with-the-worlds-most-famous-conspiracy-theorist/ |website=Gizmodo - UK |accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Problem–reaction–solution===
Icke uses the phrase 'problem–reaction–solution' to explain how he believes the Illuminati agenda advances. They guide the population in the direction they desire by creating false problems, which then creates a reaction from the target population, which then allows them to give their desired solution to the problem they created.&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139&gt;Robertson 2016, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He also refers to this process as "order out of chaos".&lt;ref name=IckeNov152009&gt;David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206225716/http://www.newsforthesoul.com/icke-2.htm "Problem-reaction-solution"], ''News for the Soul'', accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents and issues Icke attributes to the Illuminati, or 'Global Elite', include the [[Oklahoma City bombing]], [[Dunblane school massacre|Dunblane]], [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]], [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]] (which Icke believes was an '[[False flag|inside job]]' to provide an excuse to advance an agenda of [[regime change]] across the world), [[7/7]], [[global warming]], [[Chemtrail conspiracy theory|chemtrails]], [[water fluoridation]], the death of [[Princess Diana]], the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Scotsman2006" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icke, ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For 9/11, Icke, ''Alice in Wonderland and the World Trade Center Disaster''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For global warming and Agenda 21, Icke, ''Phantom Self'', 303.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LEP911"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Henry Widdas |title=David Icke: My unanswered 9/11 questions |url=https://www.lep.co.uk/news/opinion/david-icke-my-unanswered-9-11-questions-1-9196768 |website=[[Lancashire Evening Post]] |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=English |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents then allow them to respond in whatever way they intended to act in the first place.&lt;ref name=IckeNov152009&gt;David Icke, [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206225716/http://www.newsforthesoul.com/icke-2.htm "Problem-reaction-solution"], ''News for the Soul'', accessed 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the methods Icke claims they use is creating fake opposites, or what he calls "opposames", such as the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] of World War II, which he believes were used to provoke the creation of the [[European Union]] and the state of [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139&gt;Robertson 2016, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Icke argues that to ensure the outcome they want, they have to control both sides.&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt; He believes that the [[President of the United States|US presidents]] [[George W. Bush]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Donald Trump]] are part of a false [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left]] political divide. Despite the presidency belonging to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] then the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], then going back to the Republicans, Icke claims they are all pushing the same agenda of regime change in the [[Middle East]], a goal which was set out in the early [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] in a document called [[The Project for the New American Century]].&lt;ref name="LEPredpilled" /&gt; Icke claims that this [[Hegelian Dialectic|dialectic]] allows the Illuminati to gradually move societies toward [[totalitarianism]] without challenge, a process he refers to as the "totalitarian tiptoe".&lt;ref name=Robertson2016p139/&gt;

In ''Tales From The Time Loop'' (2003), Icke argues that the Illuminati create religious, racial, ethnic and sexual division to [[divide and rule]] humanity but believes that the many can only be controlled by the few if they allow themselves to be, and that the power the Illuminati have is the power the people give away to them.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Icke |title=Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to be Truly Free |date=30 September 2003 |publisher=Bridge of Love |isbn=978-0953881048 |page=447 |edition=First |language=0953881040}} &lt;/ref&gt; Writing: "Divide and rule is the bottom line of all dictatorships...Arab is turned against Jew, black against white, Right against Left. Unplugging from the Matrix means refusing to recognise these illusory fault lines. We are all One. I refuse to see a Jew as different from an Arab and vice versa. They are both expressions of the One and need to be observed and treated the same, none more or less important than the other. I refuse to see black people in terms that I would not see white, nor to see the ‘Left’ as I would not see the ‘Right’. How could it be any different, except when we believe the illusion of division is real? If we do that, the Matrix has us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=David Icke |title=Tales from the Time Loop: The Most Comprehensive Expose of the Global Conspiracy Ever Written and All You Need to Know to be Truly Free |date=30 September 2003 |publisher=Bridge of Love |isbn=978-0953881048 |page=447 |edition=First |language=0953881040}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Icke's solution is peaceful [[non-compliance]], which he believes will disempower 'the elite'.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Dresses===
[[File:Red Dress Programmes by Neil Hague.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing|Image by Neil Hague from Icke's ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'' (2005), showing [[Queen Elizabeth II]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] as ''Red Dresses'', the highest level of the Brotherhood.]]
In ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'' (2005), Icke introduces his three categories of people. The Brotherhood are "interactive software programs", or "Red Dresses". They lack consciousness and free will, and their human bodies are holographic veils.&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth: ''Everything'' Else is Illusion'', Wildwood, MO: Bridge of Love Publications, 2005, 79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; A second group, the "[[sheeple]]" (the vast majority of humanity), are conscious, but do as they are told and are the Brotherhood's main energy source. They include the "repeaters", people in positions of influence who repeat what other people tell them; he cites doctors, teachers and journalists as examples.&lt;ref name=Love78/&gt;

The third and smallest group are those who see through the illusion; they are usually dubbed dangerous or mad. The Red Dress genetic lines interbreed obsessively to make sure their bloodlines are not weakened by the second or third levels of consciousness, because consciousness can rewrite the software.&lt;ref name=Love78&gt;Icke, ''Infinite Love is the Only Truth'', 78–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Channel52006&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcQzOZmJykk "David Icke: Was He Right?"], [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], 12 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saturn–Moon Matrix===
The Moon Matrix is introduced in ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'' (2010), in which Icke suggests that the Earth and collective human mind are manipulated from the Moon, a [[hollow moon|spacecraft]] and inter-dimensional portal controlled by the reptilians. The Moon Matrix is a broadcast from that spacecraft to the human body–computer, specifically to the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] of the brain, which gives us our sense of reality: "We are living in a dreamworld within a dreamworld—a Matrix within the virtual-reality universe—and it is being broadcast from the Moon. Unless people force themselves to become fully conscious, their minds are the Moon's mind."&lt;ref&gt;David Icke, ''Human Race Get Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2010, 618, 627, 632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Liam O'Brien |title=Prize-winning author Alice Walker gives support to David Icke on Desert Island Discs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/prize-winning-author-alice-walker-gives-support-to-david-icke-on-desert-island-discs-8622648.html |website=Independent |accessdate=19 June 2018 |language=English |date=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea is further explored in Icke's ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'' (2012), where he introduces the concept of the "Saturn–Moon Matrix". In this more recent conceptualization, the rings of Saturn (which Icke believes were artificially created by reptilian spacecraft) are the ultimate source of the signal, while the Moon functions as an amplifier.&lt;ref name=Icke2012&gt;David Icke, ''Remember Who You Are: Remember 'Where' You Are and Where You 'Come' From'', Ryde: David Icke Books, 2012.&lt;!--page number--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robertson 2016, 157.&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that frequencies broadcast from the [[Saturn's hexagon|hexagonal storm on Saturn]] are amplified through the hollow structure of our artificial moon keeping humanity trapped in a holographic projection.&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

Icke states in ''And the truth shall set you free'' (1996):{{quote|why do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the Second World War? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the Spielberg film, Schindler's List, are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events. And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history.&lt;ref name=holocaust/&gt;}}

Icke claims that the antisemitic forgery ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' is genuine, explaining in ''And the truth shall set you free'': {{quote|I strongly believe that a small Jewish clique which has contempt for the mass of Jewish people worked with non-Jews to create the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the Second World War....They then dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and created the circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable.

Icke claims that Jews themselves are to blame for antisemitism (a classic Nazi claim that can be traced to [[Adolf Hitler]]): {{quote|Thought patterns in the collective Jewish mind have repeatedly created that physical reality of oppression, prejudice and racism which matches the pattern—the expectation—programmed into their collective psyche.

[[Political Research Associates]] described Icke's politics as "a mishmash of most of the dominant themes of contemporary neofascism, mixed in with a smattering of topics culled from the U.S. militia movement."  He opposes [[gun control]], and claims that many [[mass shooting]]s were orchestrated in order to increase public opposition to guns.

David G. Robertson in his book, ''UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age'', stated that Icke was not anti-Semitic. Saying that in order to believe that when Icke said reptilians he really meant Jews, was just easier for some to accept than that he literally means extraterrestrial reptilians control world politics. Pointing out that in order to believe the accusations of antisemitism you must ignore numerous things. Such as, the many high profile people he names as reptilian who are not Jewish, a point which was also made by [[Jon Ronson]] in his 2001 documentary ''Secret Rulers Of The World''. You must also ignore the frequent statements by Icke that he is speaking literally and not metaphorically. And you must ignore the fact he identifies the supposedly reptilian ruling elite as '[[Aryan]]' in several places, which specifically contradicts the idea that reptilian is code for 'Jew'. Also noting that Icke denounces racism calling it "the ultimate idiocy"&lt;ref name="Robertson1" /&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]] has described Icke's position as New Age [[conspiracism]], writing that Icke is the most fluent of the genre,&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA98 98]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA103 103ff], 163.&lt;/ref&gt; describing his work as "improvisational [[millennialism]]", with an end-of-history scenario involving a final battle between good and evil. Barkun defines improvisional [[millennialism]] as an "act of [[bricolage]]": because everything is connected in the conspiracist world view, every source can be mined for links.&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA10 10–11], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA107 107–108], 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Add that 9/11 made conspiracism and therefore Icke more popular--&gt; Barkun argues that Icke has actively tried to cultivate the radical right stating that "There is no fuller explication of [their] beliefs about ruling elites than Icke's." He also notes that Icke regards Christian patriots as the only Americans who understand the "New World Order".&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA106 106], [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA108 108].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barkun 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA107 107].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Icke spoke to a conference in [[Reno, Nevada]], alongside opponents of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act]], including Kirk Lyons, a lawyer who has represented the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=Barkun2003p106/&gt; But it has been pointed out that Icke has never been a member of any right wing group, and has criticised them.&lt;ref name="Robertson1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=David G. Robertson |title=UFOs, Conspiracy Theories and the New Age |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1474253208 |pages=150–151 |edition=First |language=English |chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on [[Douglas Kellner]]'s distinction between clinical [[paranoia]] and a "critical paranoia" that confronts power, Richard Kahn and Tyson Lewis argue that Icke displays elements of both, and that his reptilian hypothesis and "postmodern metanarrative" may be [[Allegory|allegorical]], a [[Jonathan Swift|Swiftian]] [[satire]] used to give ordinary people a narrative with which to question what they see around them and to alert them to the alleged emergence of a global fascist state.&lt;ref name=Lewis2010p75/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 73ff, 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyson Lewis, Richard Kahn, "The Reptoid Hypothesis: Utopian and Dystopian Representational Motifs in David Icke's Alien Conspiracy Theory," ''Utopian Studies'', 16(1), Spring 2005 (45–74), 52, 55–56. {{jstor|20718709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Kahn 2010, 88ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]] request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to ask this of [[John Key]], the then prime minister, and Facebook's [[Mark Zuckerberg]] was asked the same during a Q&amp;A in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.)&lt;ref&gt;Ben Guarino, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/15/i-am-not-a-lizard-mark-zuckerberg-is-latest-celebrity-asked-about-reptilian-conspiracy/ "‘I am not a lizard’: Mark Zuckerberg is latest celebrity asked about reptilian conspiracy"], ''The Washington Post'', 15 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 survey in the United States by [[Public Policy Polling]], 4% believed that "'lizard people' control our societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/04/conspiracy-theory-poll-results-.html "Conspiracy Theory Poll Results"], Public Policy Polling, 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Harris, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/02/americans-obama-anti-christ-conspiracy-theories "One in four Americans think Obama may be the antichrist, survey says"], ''The Guardian'', 2 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olga Oksman, [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/07/conspiracy-theory-paranoia-aliens-illuminati-beyonce-vaccines-cliven-bundy-jfk "Conspiracy craze: why 12 million Americans believe alien lizards rule us"], ''The Guardian'', 7 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

James Ward states that "In some ways, you could say [Icke's] been vindicated. For years he has claimed that people operating at the highest levels of the establishment were members of secret paedophile networks, claims that now routinely appear on the front pages of our newspapers. Many of the people at the centre of these stories were even specifically named by Icke in print years ago." Except that, "even on this issue Icke’s credibility is compromised by his habit of naming more or less everyone and claiming they are all part of the same network. Inevitably, he’s going to be right once in a while – after all, if you throw enough shit at a stopped clock, some of it will stick. And throw shit he does." Adding that, Icke's underlying message is positive, which "might hint at why it appeals to some": as Icke said at Wembley in 2012, "If we want a world of love and peace, we have to be loving and peaceful with everyone, even people we don't like."&lt;ref name="WardNH" /&gt;

'''''Dawkins' God: Genes, Memes, and the Meaning of Life''''' is a book by [[Alister McGrath]], a theologian who is currently Professor of Historical [[Theology]] at [[Oxford University]]. The book, published in 2004, with a 2nd ed. in 2015, aims to refute claims about [[religion]] made by another well-known professor at Oxford, [[Richard Dawkins]]. McGrath's book does not seek to demonstrate how Dawkins’ claims differ from Christianity, rather, it argues that Dawkins' arguments fall far short of the logical and evidence-based reasoning that Dawkins himself espouses.

==Synopsis==
McGrath begins with an overview of evolutionary biology and Darwinist theory. He then presents Dawkins’ view that the current state of scientific knowledge should lead a rational person to conclude that there is no God. McGrath argues that Dawkins fails to declare or defend several crucial assumptions or premises. McGrath also defends other conclusions in the book, including:

* the [[scientific method]] cannot conclusively prove that God does or does not exist;
* the theory of evolution does not necessarily entail any particular [[Atheism|atheistic]], [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], or Christian understanding of the world;
* Dawkins' refutation of [[William Paley]]'s watchmaker analogy does not equate to a refutation of God’s existence;
* Dawkins' proposal that [[memes]] explain the evolutionary development of human culture is more illogical and unscientific than a clearly articulated defence of Christianity;
* Dawkins is ignorant of Christian theology and mischaracterizes religious people generally.

McGrath argues that Dawkins' rejection of faith is a [[straw man]] argument. According to McGrath, Dawkins’ definition that faith “means blind trust, in the absence of evidence” is not a Christian position. In contrast, argues McGrath, accepting Dawkins’ definition would require blind trust since he offers no evidence to support it. Rather, it is based upon what McGrath calls “an unstated and largely unexamined cluster of hidden non-scientific values and beliefs” (p.&amp;nbsp;92). McGrath then argues that Dawkins frequently violates the very tenets of evidence-based reasoning that Dawkins himself claims to uphold and use to dismiss all religious belief.

Also on page 92, McGrath states "... Darwinism neither proves nor disproves the existence of God (unless, of course God is defined by his critics in precisely such a way...)."

==Reception==
In ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' the [[skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]], reviewing this book, says "[McGrath's] defense of religious faith is a passionate and honorable one and he demonstrates that some of Dawkins's characterizations of religion are indeed overly simplistic or selective, but he never delivers an answer to the God question. The closest thing to an argument for God's existence I could find in the book is this: 'Why should God require an explanation at all? He might just be an "ultimate,"...one of those things we have to accept as given and is thus amenable to description, rather than explanation.' That may be, but like all other arguments made in favor of God's existence, this only works as a reason to believe ''if you already believe''. If you do not already believe, science cannot help you."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/308/5719/205?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=Dawkins&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT] requires AAAS membership&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from Dawkins==
In response to the book in general, and to the accusation of being ignorant of [[Christian theology]] in particular, Richard Dawkins stated:

{{cquote|
Yes, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject. It is empty. Vacuous. Devoid of coherence or content. I imagine that McGrath would join me in expressing disbelief in [[fairy|fairies]], [[astrology]] and [[Mjölnir|Thor's hammer]]. How would he respond if a fairyologist, astrologer or Viking accused him of ignorance of their respective subjects? &lt;ref&gt;Marianna Krejci-Papa, 2005.

A '''developed  country''', '''industrialized country''', '''more developed country''', or '''more economically developed country''' ('''MEDC'''), is a [[sovereign state]] that has a developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), [[gross national product]] (GNP), the [[per capita income]], level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp#axzz1legO8olO Developed Economy Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322201145/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp |date=22 March 2016 }}. Investopedia (16 April 2010). Retrieved 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate.

Developed countries have generally [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] economies, meaning the [[service sector]] provides more wealth than the [[industrial sector]]. They are contrasted with [[developing country|developing countries]], which are in the process of [[industrialization]] or pre-industrial and almost entirely [[Agriculture|agrarian]], some of which might fall into the category of [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]. As of 2015, advanced economies comprise 60.8% of global GDP based on [[nominal value]]s and 42.9% of global GDP based on [[purchasing power parity|purchasing-power parity]] (PPP) according to the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=30&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C110&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPSH&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 IMF GDP data (October 2015)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041611/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=30&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C110&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPSH&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the ten largest advanced economies by GDP in both nominal and PPP terms were [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weoselco.aspx?g=110&amp;sg=All+countries+/+Advanced+economies|title=All countries/Advanced economies|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms linked to the concept ''developed country'' include "advanced country", "industrialized country", "'more developed country" (MDC), "more economically developed country" (MEDC), "[[Global North]] country", "[[First World|first world]] country", and "post-industrial country". The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as [[industrialization]] is an ongoing process that is hard to define.  The first industrialized country was the [[United Kingdom]], followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to [[Germany]], [[United States]], [[France]] and other [[Western Europe]]an countries. According to some [[economist]]s such as [[Jeffrey Sachs]], however, the current divide between the developed and [[Developing country|developing world]] is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century.&lt;!--

==Definition and criteria==
Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is income per capita; countries with high [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries.  Another economic criterion is [[industrialization]]; countries in which the [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary sectors of industry]] dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently another measure, the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating.  The index, however, does not take into account several factors, such as the [[List of countries by wealth per adult|net wealth per capita]] or the relative [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries, such as the [[G7]] members and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2D0AAAAMAAJ|title=The Courier|date=1994|publisher=Commission of the European Communities|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/human-development-index/|title=Human development index - Economics  Help|work=Economics  Help|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Statistics Division]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the [[United Nations]] system.&lt;ref name="unstated.un.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Millennium Development Indicators: World and regional groupings |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |date=2003 |at=Note b |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210031555/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |archivedate=10 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And it notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The designations "developed" and "developing" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.&lt;ref name="unstats.un.org"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49): Developed Regions |url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |access-date=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711220015/https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |archivedate=11 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Development Index (HDI)==
{{Main article|Human Development Index|List of countries by Human Development Index}}
The UN HDI is a statistical measure that gauges a country's level of human development. While there is a strong correlation between having a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, the UN points out that the HDI accounts for more than income or productivity. Unlike GDP per capita or per capita income, the HDI takes into account how income is turned "into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development."

Since 1990, [[Norway]] (2001–2006, 2009–2017), [[Japan]] (1990–1991 and 1993), [[Canada]] (1992 and 1994–2000) and [[Iceland]] (2007–2008) have had the highest HDI score.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15856">'''Education for librarianship''' in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] generally consists of a [[master's degree]] program in [[library science]]. In [[Germany]], the first step for an academic librarian is a [[Ph.D.]] in a subject field, followed by additional training in librarianship. There are also [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[Associate degree|associate]], and certificate programs in library science, which provide formal training of paraprofessional library workers, [[library technician]]s, and clerks—as well as preparation for [[Graduate school|graduate study]] in library science.

==Historical development==
Until the 19th century, the librarian in charge of an academic collection was normally a scholar, often a university professor with a special interest in the library.  There were no training programs, and the new librarian was expected to follow the practices of other similar libraries. (Popular libraries in the modern sense had not yet developed.) In the 19th century, although some librarians followed this older pattern, others prepared as apprentices under the direction of established librarians.

==Library school==
A library school is an institution of [[Higher education|higher learning]] specializing in the professional training of [[librarian]]s. The first library school in the United States was established by [[Melvil Dewey]] (the originator of the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey decimal system]]) in 1887 at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Carl Milton. 1961. The origins of the American library school. New York: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then many library schools have been founded in the United States and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Churchwell, Charles D. 1975. The shaping of American library education. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; with Canada's first formal librarianship program established at [[McGill University]] in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission &amp; history|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/sis/about/mission-history|website=McGill University School of Information Studies|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of library schools in other countries began in 1915, when librarians' schools were founded at [[Leipzig]] and [[Barcelona]] (currently, as a faculty of the [[Universitat de Barcelona]], [[Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació (UB)|the latter]] is the oldest library school in Europe). Many others were founded during [[World War II]]. The [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]] became the first library school to confer a master's degree in [[library science]], which is now the standard professional degree, and later became the first to give a doctoral degree in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/74029187|title=Libraries and librarianship : sixty years of challenge and change, 1945-2005|last=Sylvan)|first=Bobinski, George S. (George|date=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|year=|isbn=9780810858992|location=Lanham, Md.|pages=124|oclc=74029187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent American library schools are located at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Most library schools in North America offer graduate programs only. Accreditation of these programs is granted by the [[American Library Association]]. The bachelor's degree in Library Science (or Library Economy as it was called in early days) was, for the most part, phased out several decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;White, Carl Milton. 1976. A historical introduction to library education: problems and progress to 1951. Metuchen, N.J.: Scarecrow Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Librarians in North America typically earn a master's degree, typically the Master of Library Science (MLS) or the [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (MLIS). This degree allows one to work as a practicing librarian in public libraries, academic libraries, school library media centers, and special libraries, while many individuals with the MLS credential work with major library vendors. The degree is also applicable to related sectors such as publishing.

Master of Library Science programs are typically structured to offer a combination of required and elective courses in [[library science]] and [[information science]]. The required courses focus on core library skills such as [[cataloging]], reference, [[collection development]] as well as related areas such as the philosophy underlying the profession, [[information technology]] and [[management]].  Elective courses may include [[information management]], [[children's literature]], [[genealogy]] and [[archives]] as well as specialized courses related to different types of libraries.

In recent decades, many schools offering librarianship education have changed their names to reflect the shift from print media to electronic media, and to information contained outside of traditional libraries. Some call themselves schools of library and information science (abbreviated to "SLIS", hence the term "SLISters" for their students), while others [[List of Information Schools|may have dropped the word "library" altogether]]. This trend began as early as the 1960s with the recognition that information and access to it was shifting to electronic resources with the development of telecommunications and computer networks and away from the traditional definition of librarianship.  This shift led a number of library schools to change or broaden their mission to be more inclusive of information sciences across many disciplines including library sciences, archives, computer sciences and more, and led to the development by a number of schools of an ''iSchool'' organization, &lt;ref&gt;Olson, G., &amp; Grudin, J. (2009, March 1). The information school phenomenon. ''Interactions: New Visions of Human-Computer Interaction'', 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt; to advance the field of information as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://ischools.org/|website=iSchools|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree programs==
The normal preparation for a faculty member in a department of library science (or other name) is a Ph.D. in [[Library science]] or [[Information science]]. In some fields of librarianship, a Ph.D. in another related subject, such as archival studies, is the equivalent, and some faculty have doctorates in various subject fields, as well as an MLS (or similar) degree.

===United States and Canada===
In the United States and Canada, a professional librarian normally has a one or two-year [[master's degree]] in [[library and information science]], [[library science]] or [[information science]] with abbreviations such as MLS, MSLS, MIS, MS-LIS, MISt, MI, MLIS, or MILS. Many professional librarians have degrees obtained from programs [[accredited by the American Library Association]] (ALA) and can have specializations within fields such as [[archive]]s, [[records management]], [[information architecture]], information policy, knowledge management, public librarianship, medical librarianship, law librarianship, special librarianship, academic librarianship, or school (K-12) librarianship. School librarians often are required to have a [[teaching credential]] and school librarian license in addition to a library science degree. Master's degree programs for school library media specialist initial preparation are also accredited by the [[National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education]] (NCATE), which ALA recognizes. Many, if not most, academic librarians also have a second, subject-based master's degree.

The early history of education for librarians in the U.S. has been explored by Churchwell.&lt;ref&gt;Churchwell, Charles D. 1975. ''The shaping of American library education''. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of Chicago studies in library science assessed the state of education for librarians in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Berelson, Bernard. 1949. Education for librarianship; papers presented at the Library Conference, University of Chicago, August 16–21, 1948. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pivotal role of the first [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral degree]] at the [[University of Chicago Graduate Library School]] from 1921-1951 has been analyzed by John Richardson in his study, ''The Spirit of Inquiry''.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, John V. 1982. ''The spirit of inquiry: the Graduate Library School at Chicago, 1921-51.'' Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Many faculty members at the [[University of Chicago, Graduate Library School]] (1928-1979) were at the forefront of the field's development in the twentieth century: [[Lester Asheim]], [[Lee Pierce Butler]], [[Leon Carnovsky]], [[Herman H. Fussler]], [[Frances E. Henne]], [[Carleton B. Joeckel]], [[Jesse Shera]], [[Peggy Sullivan]], [[Douglas Waples]], [[Louis Round Wilson]], Howard Winger, and Robert Wadsworth. ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' was first published by the Graduate Library School in 1931.

At the turn of the millennium (1999–2000), problems related to the graduate education of professional librarians pervaded professional and academic discourse.  These were initially identified by the Council of the American Library Association as the growing elimination of the word "library" from the names of schools, the seeming lack of attention to core competencies (cataloguing was often mentioned), and the national shortage of professionals to work with particular groups (specifically young people in public libraries and disadvantaged populations), and in particular environments (such as schools). The [http://www.ala.org/ala/educationcareers/education/1stcongressonpro/1stcongresssteeringcommittees.cfm Final Report of the Steering Committee on the Congress for Professional Education] provides an analysis of these issues. The Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Literary Education supported by the Kellogg Foundation provided additional analysis of future educational needs and direction.&lt;ref&gt;Drabenstott, K. M., et al., The Kellogg CRISTAL-ED Project: creating a model program to support libraries in the digital age {Coalition on Reinventing Information Science, Technology, and Literary Education}. In: ''Advances in librarianship'', v20. Academic Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  Bernie Sloan compiled an extensive 2004 bibliography on changes in LIS education.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Bernie. 2004.

Distinguished service to education for librarianship in the U.S. and Canada is recognized by the annual [[Beta Phi Mu Award]] sponsored by the International Honorary Society, [[Beta Phi Mu]].&lt;ref&gt;George S. Bobinski (2007) ''Libraries and Librarianship: Sixty Years of Chaallenge and Change, 1945-2005'', pp. 129-146.  Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt; The first award was made in 1954 to [[Rudolph Hjalmar Gjelsness]] Dean of the University of Michigan's Library Science Department from 1940 to 1964.

The primary association for faculty teaching in library and information science programs is the [[Association for Library and Information Science Education]].

In [[academic regalia in the United States]], the color for library science is [[lemon (color)|lemon]].

===Europe===
In the UK, a librarian can have a three- or four-year [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Library and information science|library and information studies]] or [[information science]]; separate [[master's degree]]s in librarianship, archive management, and records management are also available. In the [[United Kingdom]], these degrees are accredited by the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] and the [http://www.archives.org.uk/ Society of Archivists].

In [[Germany]], the first step for an academic librarian is a [[Ph.D.]] in a subject field, followed by additional training in librarianship.

In [[Denmark]] the first step to become a librarian is a 3-year long [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Library and Information Science]] (B.Sc.) at [[The Royal School of Library and Information Science]]. The students then have the choice between taking a half-year-long education for [[librarianship]] called Librarian D.B or take a 2-year [[master's degree]] called [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (M.L.I.Sc.). All the already mentioned courses takes place in [[Danish language|Danish]] but The Royal School of Library and Information Science also offers an English-speaking 2-year master's degree called [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (M.L.I.Sc.). Students who complete the bachelor's degree, the librarianship or one of the master's degrees offered get work as librarians, information employees or organization staff. The students can also obtain a [[Ph.D.]] in Library and Information Science at The Royal School of Library and Information Science (first awarded at The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 2004). The students can also obtain a [[doctorate]] in Library and Information Science at The Royal School of Library and Information Science (first awarded at The Royal School of Library and Information Science in 2006).

===Philippines===
In 1914, the [[University of the Philippines]] offered the first courses in Library education in the country. The University would later establish the first separate library school in the country in 1961; the [[UP School of Library and Information Studies|Institute of Library Science]], a former department of the now defunct College of Liberal Arts. Librarians usually have a four-year [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Library and information science|library and information studies]], or a [[master's degree]] in LIS or one with a concentration in Library Science. It is also not uncommon for librarians to possess a degree in Education, with a specialization or major in Library Science. With passage of the Republic Act No. 6966 (Repealed in 2003 with the passing of R.A. 9246 or "The Philippine Librarianship Act of 2003") in 1990, graduates of library and information science are required to take the licensure examinations for librarians in order to practice librarianship in the Philippines or countries which have reciprocity as regards the practice of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9246.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415074535/http://www.ops.gov.ph/records/ra_no9246.htm |date=April 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, [[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only university providing postgraduate education in librarianship.  Qualifications include Master of Information Studies (course based) and Master of Arts (thesis based) as well as postgraduate diploma and certificate in librarianship.  [[Open Polytechnic]] provides undergraduate librarianship education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17014">'''Embodied bilingual language''', also known as '''L2 embodiment''', is the idea that people mentally simulate their actions, [[perception]]s, and [[emotion]]s when speaking and understanding a [[second language]] (L2) as with their [[first language]] (L1).&lt;ref name=Vukovic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vukovic|first1=Nikola|last2=Shtyrov|first2=Yury|title=Cortical motor systems are involved in second-language comprehension: Evidence from rapid mu-rhythm desynchronisation|journal=NeuroImage|date=2014|volume=102|pages=695–703|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.039|pmid=25175538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is closely related to [[embodied cognition]] and [[embodied language processing]], both of which only refer to native language thinking and speaking.  An example of embodied bilingual language would be situation in which a L1 English speaker learning Spanish as a second language hears the word ''rápido'' ("fast") in Spanish while taking notes and then proceeds to take notes more quickly.

==Overview==
Embodied bilingual language refers to the role second language learning plays in embodied cognition, which proposes that the way the body interacts with its environment influences the way a person thinks or creates mental images.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barsalou|first1=Lawrence|title=Perceptual symbol systems|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1999|volume=22|issue=44|pages=577–660|doi=10.1017/S0140525X99002149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Embodied cognition theory assumes that embodiment occurs automatically and in a person’s native tongue.&lt;ref name=Bergen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Lau|first2=Ting-Ting Chan|last3=Narayan|first3=Schweta|last4=Stojanovic|first4=Diana|last5=Wheeler|first5=Kathryn|title=Body part representations in verbal semantics|journal=Memory and Cognition|date=2010|volume=38|issue=7|pages=969–981|doi=10.3758/MC.38.7.969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied theories of language posit that word meaning is grounded in mental representations of action, perception, and emotion.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999/&gt;  Thus, L2 embodiment presupposes that embodied cognition takes place in a language that was learned later in life, outside of a child’s [[critical period]] of learning a language.  In embodied bilingual language, a second language as well as the first language connects cognition with physical body movements.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;

For example, in first language (L1) embodiment, research shows that participants are quicker to comprehend sentences if they are simultaneously presented with pictures describing the actions in the sentence.&lt;ref name=GK&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glenberg|first1=Arthur|title=Grounding language in action|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=2002|volume=9|issue=3|pages=558–565|doi=10.3758/BF03196313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied language assumes that comprehension of language requires mental simulation, or imagination, of the subject and action of a sentence that is being processed and understood.  Following L1 embodiment, L2 embodiment supposes that the understanding of sentences in L2 also require the same mental processes that underlie first language comprehension.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;

==Theory==
Research shows that embodiment is present in native language processing,&lt;ref name=Bergen/&gt; and if embodiment occurs in first language processing, then embodiment might also occur in second language processing.&lt;ref name=VW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vukovic|first1=N|last2=Williams|first2=J|title=Automatic perceptual simulation of first language meanings during second language sentence processing in bilinguals|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=2014|volume=145|pages=98–103|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  How second language is embodied compared to first language is still a topic of debate. Currently, there are no known theories or models that address the presence or absence of embodiment in second language processing, but there are bilingual processing models that can lead to multiple hypotheses of embodiment effects in second language learning.&lt;ref name=degrawe&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Grawe|first1=S|last2=Willems|first2=R.M.|last3=Rueschemeyer|first3=S|last4=Lemhöfer|first4=K|last5=Schriefers|first5=H|title=Embodied language in first- and second-language speakers: Neural correlates of processing motor verbs.|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=2014|volume=56|pages=334–349|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.02.003|pmid=24524912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revised hierarchical model (RHM)===
[[File:Kroll &amp; Stewart's RHM Model.png|thumbnail|According to the RHM, lexical associations from L2 to L1 are stronger than that of L1 to L2.  While the link from L1 to conceptual memory is stronger than the link from L2 to conceptual memory, the two conceptual links are nevertheless bidirectional.]]
The [[Simultaneous bilingualism#Bilingual lexical representations|revised hierarchical model (RHM)]] hypothesizes that [[Lexicon|lexical]] connections are stronger from L2 to L1 than from L1 to L2.  In other words, translating a word from second language to first language occurs faster than vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kroll|first1=Judith|last2=Stewart|first2=Erika|title=Category interference in translation and picture naming: Evidence for asymmetric connection between bilingual memory representations.|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=1994|volume=33|issue=2|pages=149–174|doi=10.1006/jmla.1994.1008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while translating from native language to second language might be delayed, the [[semantics]], or word meanings of the information being conveyed, are maintained and understood by the translator.

What this means in terms of embodied bilingual language is that there should be no difference in embodiment effects between first language processing and second language processing.  Because the RHM model posits that semantic representations are shared across languages, meanings found in first language action, perception, and emotion will transfer equally into second language processing&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

===Extended bilingual interactive activation (BIA+) model===
[[File:Djkstra &amp; van Heuven's BIA+ Model.png|thumbnail|left|According to the BIA+ model, orthographic representations activate first, which then activate phonological and semantic representations.]]
According to the [[Simultaneous bilingualism#Bilingual lexical representations|BIA+ model]] of bilingual lexical processing, the brain activates both languages when recognizing a word in either language.  Rather than selecting a single language, lexical access, or the sound-meaning connections of a language, is non-selective across languages.  The BIA+ model suggests that orthographic representations activate first, followed by their associated phonological and semantic representations.  The speeds of these activations depend on frequency of use of the language.  Given this proposition, if second language is used less often than first language, second language activation occurs more slowly than first language activation.  However, the BIA+ model argues that these differences in activation time are minuscule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dijkstra|first1=Tom|last2=Van Heuven|first2=Walter|title=The architecture of the bilingual word recognition system: From identification to decision|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=2002|volume=5|issue=3|pages=175–197|doi=10.1017/S1366728902003012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the RHM, the BIA+ model says that while there are slight differences in time when accessing word meanings in both first and second languages, the semantic representations are maintained.  Thus, in terms of embodiment, the BIA+ model would suggest that embodiment effects, too, are maintained across native and second language processing.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

===Sense model===
[[File:Finkbeiner et al. Sense Model.png|thumbnail|A sense model representation of two translation equivalents which only partially share semantic meaning. Semantics are completely connected to first language but only very little in second language.]]
The sense model takes a different position from the previously stated models. The sense model supposes that native language words are associated with a greater number of semantic senses than second language words and argues for partially overlapping distributed semantic representations for L1 and L2 words.  As a result, the sense model argues that semantic representations in second language are "less rich" than in those in the native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkbeiner|first1=Matthew|last2=Forster|first2=Kenneth|last3=Nicol|first3=Janet|last4=Nakamura|first4=Kumiko|title=The role of polysemy in masked semantic and translation priming|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|date=2004|volume=51|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2004.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If this is the case in embodied bilingual language, then embodiment in second language processing may be minimal or even completely lacking.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;

==Action==

===Non-selective motor systems===
Embodied bilingual processing is rooted in motor processing because research shows that the [[motor cortex]] activates during language processing.  In first language processing, for example, leg-related words like "kick" and "run" stimulate the part of the motor cortex that controls leg motions.&lt;ref name=Pul&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pulvermüller|first1=F|last2=Härle|first2=M|last3=Hummel|first3=F|title=Walking or Talking?: Behavioral and Neurophysiological Correlates of Action Verb Processing|journal=Brain and Language|date=2001|volume=78|issue=2|pages=143–168|doi=10.1006/brln.2000.2390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This illustrates that language describing motor actions activates motor systems in the brain, but only when the words provide [[literal meaning]] as opposed to figurative meaning.&lt;ref name=BW/&gt; Following L1 embodiment, L2 embodiment assumes that the words "punch" and "throw" in a second language will also stimulate the same parts of the motor cortex as does first language words.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;  In essence, language that describes motor actions activates [[motor systems]] in the brain.&lt;ref name=Vukovic/&gt;  If this holds true for all languages, then the processing that occurs when understanding and using a second language must also activate motor regions of the brain, just as native language processing does.

Research shows that both first and second language action words rely on the motor cortex for language processing, strengthening the claim that the motor cortex is necessary for action language processing.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt;  This research suggests that action language processing has direct access to semantic motor representations in both languages.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;  This results from second language motor systems calling on and activating information from first language motor systems.  Initially, the semantic representations stimulated by the first language are stronger than that of the second language.  But with more experience and exposure to the second language, sensorimotor involvement and second language comprehension becomes stronger.&lt;ref name=Pul/&gt;  The more often a second language is used, the stronger the neural networks and associations become, and thus some researchers argue that semantic representations in second language become just as prominent as for first language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dudschig|first1=C|last2=Kaup|first2=B|title=Embodiment and second-language: Automatic activation of motor responses during processing spatially associated L2 words and emotion L2 words in a vertical stroop paradigm.|journal=Embodiment and second-language: Automatic activation of motor responses during processing spatially associated L2 words and emotion L2 words in a vertical stroop paradigm.|date=2013|volume=132|pages=14–21|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2014.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception==
Grounded or embodied cognition is a theoretical view that assumes knowledge is represented in the mind as modal representations, which are memories of perceptual, motor, and affective experiences.&lt;ref name=Barsalou1999/&gt;  Perceptual features include orientation, location, visibility conditions, motion, movement direction, and action direction.  All of these perceptual features are necessary for comprehending language.  If this is true for first language processing, then this must also be true for second language processing.&lt;ref name=BW&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergen|first1=Benjamin|last2=Wheeler|first2=Kathlyn|title=Grammatical aspect and mental simulation.|journal=Brain and Language|date=2010|volume=112|pages=150–158|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These perceptual features occur when imagining an action, recalling an action, and observing various sensory information.&lt;ref name=degrawe/&gt;  In addition to motor brain areas, [[somatosensory]] areas, which deal with touch and physical awareness, are also activated.  This sensory information contributes to formulating the mental simulation, or imagination of the action being described, that necessitates language comprehension&lt;ref name=BW/&gt;

Finally, research shows that embodied bilingual language processing not only activates the perceptual simulation of first and second language meanings, but this activation is automatic.&lt;ref name=VW/&gt;  Second language users automatically stimulate word meanings in a detailed perceptual fashion.  Rather than consciously using strategies for language comprehension, bilinguals automatically perceive and construct meaning.

==Emotion==
Embodied bilingual language also assumes that comprehension of language activates parts of the brain that correspond with [[emotion]].  Research provides evidence that emotion words are embedded in a rich semantic network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A|title=Emotion and emotion-laden words in the bilingual lexicon|journal=Bilingualism: Language and Cognition|date=2008|volume=11|pages=147–165|doi=10.1017/S1366728908003283}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given this information, emotion is better perceived in a first language because linguistic development coincides with conceptual development and development of emotional regulation systems.  Linguistic conditioning spreads to phonologically and semantically related words of the same language, but not to translation equivalents of another language.

===Disembodied bilingual language and emotion===
Some researchers have argued for disembodied cognition when it comes to processing emotion.  The idea of disembodied cognition comes from research, which shows that less emotion is shown by a bilingual person when using a second language.  This may illustrate that less emotionality is attached to second language, which then leads to the reduction of [[biases]] such as decision bias or framing bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pavlenko|first1=A|title=Affective processing in bilingual speakers: Disembodied cognition?|journal=International Journal of Psychology|date=2012|volume=47|issue=6|pages=405–428|doi=10.1080/00207594.2012.743665}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study examining the anxiety effects of L2 words such as "death" found that those with lower levels of proficiency in L2 were more likely than L1 speakers to experience feelings of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keysar|first1=B|last2=Hayakawa|first2=S|last3=An|first3=S|title=The foreignlanguage effect: Thinking in a foreign tongue reduces decision biases.|journal=Psychological Science|date=2012|volume=23|pages=661–668.|doi=10.1177/0956797611432178|pmid=22517192}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|How does this figure in to the rest of this paragraph?|date=June 2015}} Because the emotion is less interpreted during second language processing, speakers will be more likely to ignore or fail to comprehend the emotion of a situation when making decisions or analyzing situations. However, others have found that such and similar results may be due not so much to an emotions-based explanation, as the fact that speaking in a second/foreign language seems to release the speaker from the social norms, limitations and political correctness imposed by their mother tongue.&lt;ref name="ParadowskiGawinkowskaBilewicz2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gawinkowska M, Paradowski MB, Bilewicz M |title=Second language as an exemptor from sociocultural norms. Emotion-Related Language Choice revisited |url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225 |journal=PLoS ONE  |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=e8122 |year=2013 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0081225 |pmid=24349044 |pmc=3859501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of disembodied cognition posits that because emotions are not as clearly recognized in a second language versus a first language, emotions will not affect and bias a person who is using a second language as much as using a first language.  This lack of comprehension of emotion provides evidence for the sense model, which hypothesizes that embodied cognition fails to be present in second language processing.

[[File:Solomon's Temple, Museum für Hamburgische Geschichte, Hamburg, Germany IMG 5846 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail]]
[[File:Villapando Temple Plan.jpg|upright|thumb|The floor plan of the Hamburg model corresponds to the lack of outdoor gallery from the plan of Juan Bautista Villalpando: : In Ezechielem Explanationes 1604.]]

The '''Hamburg temple model''' is a [[baroque]] architectural model of the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple of Solomon]]. It covers an area of about {{convert|12|m2|sqft}} and is made from wood. It is square, with four wings and nine courtyards, two of them in the central axis.

It was made from 1680 to 1692 after being commissioned by the [[Hamburg]] senator and founder and director of the [[Hamburg Opera]], [[Gerhard Schott]]. The model was first exhibited at the Hamburg Opera. After his death, Schott's heirs put the model up for sale in London, where it was acquired by an agent of [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]], [[King of Poland]]. In 1732 it was taken to [[Dresden]], where it was shown as part of the collection of [[Jewish ceremonial art]]. After the restructuring of this collection in the early 19th Century the model had several owners, before being acquired by the [[Hamburgmuseum]] in 1910.

Schott's model is in the tradition of many Renaissance and Baroque attempts at reconstruction of the temple by theological and architectural scholars.&lt;!--  considerations examined the original shape of the temple described in the Bible to approach. While most of the experiments were published independently in written or graphic form, is not original bulkhead model.--&gt; The Hamburg-based model closely follows an interpretation by the Spanish Jesuit [[Juan Bautista Villalpando]] in 1604, in turn, based on the [[Third Temple]] described in the [[Book of Ezekiel]].

The reason the expensive and complex model was commissioned is unknown.

The '''Holocene Climate Optimum''' (HCO) was a [[warm period]] during roughly the interval 9,000 to 5,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. It has also been known by many other names, such as '''Altithermal''', '''Climatic Optimum''', '''Holocene Megathermal''', '''Holocene Optimum''', '''Holocene Thermal Maximum''', '''Hypsithermal''', and '''Mid-Holocene Warm Period'''.

This warm period was followed by a gradual decline until about two [[millennia]] ago.

The [[Holocene]] Climate Optimum warm event consisted of increases of up to 4&amp;nbsp;°C near the [[North Pole]] (in one study, winter warming of 3 to 9&amp;nbsp;°C and summer of 2 to 6&amp;nbsp;°C in northern central [[Siberia]]).&lt;ref name="koshkarova2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Koshkarova, V.L. | author2=Koshkarov, A.D. | title=Regional signatures of changing landscape and climate of northern central Siberia in the Holocene | journal=Russian Geology and Geophysics | year=2004 | volume=45 | issue=6 | pages=672–685 | url=http://www.sibran.ru/psb/show_text.phtml?eng+4213+9+ }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Northwestern Europe]] experienced warming, but there was cooling in [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref name="davis2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davis, B.A.S. |author2=Brewer, S. |author3=Stevenson, A.C. |author4=Guiot, J. | title=The temperature of Europe during the Holocene reconstructed from pollen data | journal=Quaternary Science Reviews | year=2003 | volume=22 | pages=1701–16 | doi=10.1016/S0277-3791(03)00173-2 | issue=15–17|bibcode = 2003QSRv...22.1701D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average temperature change appears to have declined rapidly with latitude and so essentially no change in mean temperature is reported at low and middle latitudes. Tropical reefs tend to show temperature increases of less than 1&amp;nbsp;°C; the tropical ocean surface at the [[Great Barrier Reef]] about 5350 years ago was 1&amp;nbsp;°C warmer and enriched in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O by 0.5 per mil relative to modern seawater.&lt;ref name="Gagan1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gagan |first=Michael K. |year=1998 |title=Temperature and Surface-Ocean Water Balance of the Mid-Holocene Tropical Western Pacific |journal=Science |volume=279 |issue=5353 |pages=1014–8 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5353.1014 |pmid=9461430 |last2=Ayliffe |first2=LK |last3=Hopley |first3=D |last4=Cali |first4=JA |last5=Mortimer |first5=GE |last6=Chappell |first6=J |last7=McCulloch |first7=MT |last8=Head |first8=MJ |bibcode = 1998Sci...279.1014G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the global average, temperatures were probably warmer than now (depending on estimates of latitude dependence and seasonality in response patterns).{{cn|date=July 2017}} While temperatures in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]  were warmer than average during the summers, the [[Tropics]] and parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] were colder than average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kitoh, Akio |author2=Murakami, Shigenori |title=Tropical Pacific climate at the mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum |journal=Paleoceanography |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=1047 |year=2002 |doi=10.1029/2001PA000724 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2002/2001PA000724.shtml |bibcode=2002PalOc..17c..19K |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119135516/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2002/2001PA000724.shtml |archivedate=January 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 140 sites across the western [[Arctic]], there is clear evidence for conditions warmer than now at 120 sites. At 16 sites, where quantitative estimates have been obtained, local HTM temperatures were on average 1.6±0.8&amp;nbsp;°C higher than now.  Northwestern [[North America]] had peak warmth first, from 11,000 to 9,000 years ago, and the [[Laurentide ice sheet]] still chilled the continent.  Northeastern North America experienced peak warming 4,000 years later. Along the [[Arctic coastal tundra|Arctic Coastal Plain]] in [[Alaska]], there are indications of summer temperatures 2–3&amp;nbsp;°C warmer than present.&lt;ref name="kaufman2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.S.

[[West Africa]]n sediments additionally record the '''African Humid Period''', an interval, between 16,000 and 6,000 years ago, when [[Africa]] was much wetter. This was caused by a strengthening of the African [[monsoon]] by changes in summer radiation, resulting from long-term variations in the [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]]. The "[[Green Sahara]]" was dotted with numerous lakes, containing typical African lake [[crocodile]] and [[hippopotamus]] fauna. A curious discovery from the marine sediments is that the transitions into and out of the wet period occurred within decades, not the previously-thought extended periods.&lt;ref name="usgcrp980217dd"&gt;{{cite web | title=Abrupt Climate Changes Revisited: How Serious and How Likely? | work=USGCRP Seminar, 23 February 1998 | url=http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/seminars/980217DD.html | accessdate=May 18, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that humans played a role in altering the vegetation structure of [[North Africa]] at some point after 8,000 years ago, when they introduced [[List of domesticated animals|domesticated animals]]. This introduction contributed to the rapid transition to the arid conditions found in many locations in the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=David K.|date=26 January 2017|title=Humans as Agents in the Termination of the African Humid Period|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2017.00004/full#|journal=Frontiers in Earth Science|volume=5|pages=|doi=10.3389/feart.2017.00004|via=FrontiersIn|bibcode=2017FrEaS...5....4W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the far Southern Hemisphere ([[New Zealand]] and [[Antarctica]]), the warmest period during the Holocene appears to have been roughly 8,000 to 10,500 years ago, immediately following the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]].&lt;ref name="masson2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Masson, V. |author2=Vimeux, F. |author3=Jouzel, J. |author4=Morgan, V. |author5=Delmotte, M. |author6=Ciais,P. |author7=Hammer, C. |author8=Johnsen, S. |author9=Lipenkov, V.Y. |author10=Mosley-Thompson, E. |author11=Petit, J.-R. |author12=Steig, E.J. |author13=Stievenard, M. |author14=Vaikmae, R. | year=2000 | title=Holocene climate variability in Antarctica based on 11 ice-core isotopic records | journal=Quaternary Research | volume=54 |pages=348–358 | doi=10.1006/qres.2000.2172 | issue=3|bibcode = 2000QuRes..54..348M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="williams2004"&gt;{{cite journal | journal=The Holocene | volume=14 |issue=2 |year=2004 | pages=194–208 |author1=P.W.

However, some authors have used the term "Holocene Climatic Optimum" to describe the earlier southern warm period, as well.

==Comparison of ice cores==

A comparison of the delta profiles at [[Byrd Station]], West Antarctica (2164 m ice core recovered, 1968) and [[Camp Century]], Northwest Greenland, shows the post glacial climatic optimum.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard&gt;{{ cite book |author=Dansgaard W |title=Frozen Annals Greenland Ice Sheet Research |isbn=87-990078-0-0 |publisher=[[Narayana Press]] |location=[[Odder]], [[Denmark]] |pages=124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Points of correlation indicate that in these two locations the Holocene climatic optimum (post glacial climatic optimum) probably occurred at the same time. A similar comparison is evident between the Dye 3 1979 and Camp Century 1963 cores regarding this period.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard/&gt;

The [[Hans Tausen Iskappe]] (ice cap) in [[Peary Land]] (northern [[Greenland]]) was drilled in 1977 with a new deep drill to 325 m. The ice core contained distinct melt layers all the way to bedrock indicating that Hans Tausen Iskappe contains no ice from the last glaciation; i.e., the world’s northernmost ice cap melted away during the post-glacial climatic optimum and was rebuilt when the climate got colder some 4000 years ago.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard/&gt;

From the delta-profile, the [[Renland]] ice cap in the [[Scoresby Sound]] has always been separated from the inland ice, yet all the delta-leaps revealed in the Camp Century 1963 core recurred in the Renland 1985 ice core.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard/&gt; The Renland ice core from East Greenland apparently covers a full glacial cycle from the Holocene into the previous Eemian interglacial. The Renland ice core is 325 m long.&lt;ref name=Hansson1&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Hansson M, Holmén K |title= High latitude biospheric activity during the Last Glacial Cycle revealed by ammonium variations in Greenland Ice Cores|journal=Geophys. Res. Lett. |date=Nov 2001 |volume=28 |issue=22 |pages=4239–42 |doi=10.1029/2000GL012317 |bibcode=2001GeoRL..28.4239H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the depths are different, the GRIP and NGRIP cores also contain this climatic optimum at very similar times.&lt;ref name=Dansgaard/&gt;

== Milankovitch cycles ==
[[Image:Orbital variation.svg|thumb|right|Milankovitch cycles.]]
The climatic event was probably a result of predictable changes in the Earth's orbit ([[Milankovitch cycles]]) and a continuation of changes that caused the end of the last [[ice age|glacial period]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.

The effect would have had maximum Northern Hemisphere heating 9,000 years ago, when the axial tilt was 24° and the nearest approach to the Sun ([[perihelion]]) was during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. The calculated [[Milankovitch Forcing]] would have provided 0.2% more [[solar radiation]] (+40&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to the Northern Hemisphere in summer, tending to cause greater heating. There seems to have been the predicted southward shift in the global band of thunderstorms, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].

However, [[orbital forcing]] would predict maximum climate response several thousand years earlier than those observed in the Northern Hemisphere. The delay may be a result of the continuing changes in climate as the Earth emerged from the last glacial period and related to [[ice-albedo feedback]]. It should also be noted that different sites often show climate changes at somewhat different times and lasting for different durations. At some locations, climate changes may have begun as early as 11,000 years ago or persisted until 4,000 years ago. As noted above, the warmest interval in the far south significantly preceded warming in the north.

== Other changes ==
While significant temperature changes do not appear to have been at most low latitude sites, other climate changes have been reported, such as significantly wetter conditions in [[Africa]], [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]
and desert-like conditions in the [[Midwestern United States]]. Areas around the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] show temperature increases and drier conditions.&lt;ref name="mayle2004"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Francis E. Mayle, [[David J. Beerling]], William D. Gosling, Mark B. Bush | title=Responses of Amazonian ecosystems to climatic and atmospheric carbon dioxide changes since the Last Glacial Maximum | journal=Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences | year=2004 | volume=359 | issue=1443| pages=499–514 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1434 | pmid=15212099 | pmc=1693334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2007 and based in the School of History at [[University College Dublin]], as of December 2016 the project has made available data for the period from the beginning of printing in the Iberian Peninsula around 1472 to the middle of the seventeenth century. In late 2017, the project expects to publish the datasets for the second half of the seventeenth century.  The datasets currently available online (1472-1650) hold information on 66,000 items, 339,000 copies, and 15,000 digital copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project works in partnership with the [[University College Dublin Library|Digital Library Group]] at University College Dublin and with the [[Universal Short Title Catalogue|Universal Short Title Catalogue Project]] based at the [[University of St Andrews]].

==Project==
Iberian Books is a bibliographical resource similar to the [[English Short Title Catalogue]], helping to identify works by a given author or publisher, or on a given subject.&lt;ref&gt;See David McKitterick, 'Bibliography, Population and Statistics', in Joseph P. McDermott and Peter Burke (eds.), ''The Book Worlds of East Asia and Europe, 1450-1800. Connections and Comparisons'' (Hong Kong: HKU, 2015), p. 82 &lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it helps in identifying and mapping broader publishing trends.&lt;ref&gt; For the contours of publishing revealed by the data, see the introductions to the printed catalogue Alexander S. Wilkinson (ed.), ''Iberian Books. Books Published in Spanish or Portuguese or on the Iberian Peninsula before 1601'', (Leiden: Brill, 2010)'&lt;/ref&gt;  The datasets are published via a platform that facilitates the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) harvesting of metadata in OAI-compliant Dublin Core and Metadata Object Description Schema (MODS) formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://iberian.ucd.ie/about/ | title = About Iberian Books| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The datasets have also been incorporated in the open-access Universal Short Title Catalogue (USTC) based at the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ustc.ac.uk/index.php/site/about/ | title = Information on the USTC Project| work = project website | accessdate = 2016-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8179">'''Instructional rounds''' is a process that school districts and schools use to better understand teaching and learning in schools in order to improve learning at scale. In an instructional rounds session, a group of educators from perhaps 20 to 40 in size makes a series of visits to classrooms to observe what is taking place in the instructional core (the interactions between students and teachers in the presence of content).  Low inference observation notes are taken about a learning problem identified by the school being observed.  The observation notes are used to create a picture of what has been seen in teaching and learning practices throughout the school.  It is these practices that are shared with the school, not information about individual teachers or students. Adapted from the practice of [[grand rounds]] in medical school,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the aim of instructional rounds is to observe teaching and learning to discern root causes for problems identified by the school and to help the school and district create more productive outcomes. Distinct from [[supervision]] and evaluation, rounds are used to describe what is happening in classrooms and the share observations with educators, and are not intended to be [[evaluative]].

== Origin ==
The process of instructional rounds was adapted from medical rounds model that is used in schools of medicine and teaching hospitals to improve practice of prospective and current doctors in diagnosing and curing patients. Physicians use medical rounds as a major way of improving their theory and practice. "In the most commonly used version of medical rounds, a group of medical interns, residents, and supervising or attending physicians visit patients, observe and discuss the evidence for diagnoses, and, after a thorough analysis of evidence, discuss possible treatments."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Description of common practice ==

Instructional rounds include several steps: formation of a network that ideally includes representative members from all those who impact student learning; choosing a problem to be addressed; classroom observation; observation debrief ; detection of the next steps, and regular repetition of this process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=City|first1=Elizabeth|title=Learning from Instructional Rounds|journal=Educational Leadership|date=2011|volume=69, number 2|issue=Coaching: The New Leadership Skill|pages=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network formation ===
Network formation involves the gathering of educators who will regularly meet with each other to do rounds. There are not specific criteria sets for the creation of networks, it depends on the situation, time and preferences of educators. Different kinds of networks could be used to do rounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=City|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Elmore|first2=Richard|last3=Fiarman|first3=Sarah|last4=Lee|first4=Teitel|title=Instructional rounds in education: A network approach to improving teaching and learning|date=2011|publisher=Harvard Education Press|location=8 Story Street First Floor, Cambridge, MA 02138|isbn=9781934742167|edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them are cross-functional in which teachers and administrators work together, while others are [[homogeneous]] in nature composed of [[superintendent (education)|superintendent]]s or teachers exclusively. Instructional rounds could be integrated into existing networks or specially formed new networks of educators. Sometimes members of the network are selected intentionally, according to the subject, content they teach or problem area they share. Other networks are more [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]], for instance, teachers with the same planning time engage in rounds together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Choosing problem of practice ===
The problem of practice is a specific issue that the school  needs constructive feedback on, worries about or struggles against.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The problem should be [[observable]] and focused on improving teaching. It is unsolved problem that the school has spent time and money to address, but it is in further need of assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Leading instructional rounds in education|last=Fowler-Finn|first=Thomas|publisher = Harvard Education Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-61250-526-8|location = 8 Story Street, Cambridge, MA 02138|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different ways of identifying problems of practice. The best way is to relate these problems to continuous school improvement and to proceed based on data. To determine the problem of practice sometimes the entire staff gathers or only the leadership team meets to identify a problem.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An example of a problem of practice could be the following: "In reading and writing, our students seem to be doing relatively well on [[Encoding|decoding]], [[vocabulary]], and simple writing tasks, but they are not doing as well as we had hoped on comprehension free-response tasks. Teachers have begun using a workshop method to work with smaller groups of students, but there is no consistency in what happens in those small groups".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Classroom observation ===
After determining the problem of practice, the network splits into smaller groups of 4-5 teachers that visit approximately 4-5 classrooms for 25 minutes each. Observers collect descriptive data rather than evaluative, meaning that they do not have any [[rubric|rubrics]] to guide them. Observers do have guiding questions associated with the problem they are investigating. For instance, 'What are students and teachers doing and saying?,' 'What is the assignment?,' 'What do students do when they do not understand the concept or instruction?'.

Observers do not look at every issue in the classroom, but only those connected with the problem of practice. For instance, if the issue is lack of higher order thinking skills among students, observers do not pay attention on behavior and attendance of students, their involvement in the task, or teacher behavior, such as writing objectives on the board. Observers attempt to find the cause of the existing problem of practice in school and then identify a viable cure for it.

It is very important that observers do not talk between class observations and save everything they saw, their descriptive feedback, for the official debrief.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Observation debrief ===
The process of debrief consists of three steps: [[description]], [[analysis]], and [[prediction]]. During the description stage, all groups of the network meet together and share their evidence that pertains to the problem of practice with the others. The evidence should be specific and descriptive rather than evaluative and general. Regular practice and peer help could facilitate learning to collect specific and descriptive evidence.

Having gathered a set of evidence, the network can begin analyzing it by looking at trends, patterns, and exceptions across the data. Examples of patterns could be: Students are divided into groups, but work individually; teacher asks simple questions that requires short 1-2 words answers. Each groups of teachers share trends and patterns that have seen. This could help educators to determine common patterns in subject area, grade level and across school. However, sometimes patterns could vary in each subject or grade level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At the prediction stage observers answer to the following question, “If you were a student in these classes today and you did everything the teacher asked you to do, what would you know and be able to do?” This question is asked to see what students could learn as a result of the completed assignments and tasks in the class. The responses of the observers could be: Learners will be able to solve mathematical problems, recall information, etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Detection of the next steps ===

There are different ways of detecting next steps of work. Some networks [[brainstorming|brainstorm]] action plans for the following week, next month or by the end of educational year. Other networks creates reflective questions to reflect

{{nihongo|'''International Christian University''' |国際基督教大学|Kokusai Kirisutokyō Daigaku|'''ICU'''}} is a non-denominational [[private university]] located in [[Mitaka, Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Commonly known as '''ICU''' (in Japan and abroad), the university was founded in 1949. ICU offers 31 undergraduate majors and a [[Graduate school]].

The university is considered to be the most prestigious [[Liberal arts college|Liberal Arts College]] in Japan and it has several partner institutions worldwide including [[University of California|The University of California system]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Duke University]], [[Yonsei University]], [[University College London]] and more.

ICU is unique for being a fully bilingual campus. Classes are held in either English or Japanese, with all faculty required to have strong command in both languages. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/campuslife/club/bilingual.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable alumni include: [[Princess Mako of Akishino]], [[Princess Kako of Akishino]], President and CEO of [[Sony]], [[Kaz Hirai]], and U.S. Senator, [[Jay Rockefeller]]. In 2014, the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] selected ICU as one of the 37 schools for [[Top Global University Project|The Top Global University Project]]. It is consistently ranked as one of the top and most selective universities in Japan.

===History===
[[File:International Christian University in 1950s.JPG|thumb|International Christian University in 1950s. The main building was used by Mitaka Institute of the [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/airplane/museum/nakajima/nakajima2.html|title=中島飛行機株式会社その軌跡|accessdate=May 24, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

ICU was founded in 1949. With an emphasis on reconciliation and peace, ICU was envisaged as a “University of Tomorrow,” a place where [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and international students would live together and learn to serve the needs of an emerging, more interconnected world. When students enter ICU they sign the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/en/about/pledge.html|title=Student Pledge - ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are challenged to commit themselves to help bring about social justice and world peace. Due to this commitment to human rights, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] delivered ICU's first convocation address.

According to JICUF (Japan ICU Foundation), 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Concerted fundraising campaigns were initiated in both [[Japan]] and in [[North America]]. [[Hisato Ichimada]], the Governor of the [[Bank of Japan]] who was [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]], headed the Japan campaign that raised the funds necessary to purchase a large tract of land for the university. The Honorary Chair of the US fundraising campaign was General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and the North American public responded with generous contributions as well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jicuf.org/history History - Japan ICU Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The third son of the [[Emperor Taishō]], a younger brother of the [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] and an uncle of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Akihito]] [[Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu]] officiated the Honorary President of the Preparatory Committee for founding ICU.

==Campus==
ICU's main campus of 150 wooded acres is located in west Tokyo, with downtown areas like Shinjuku about half an hour's train ride away. Computer and internet access is available throughout the campus.
[[File:Entrance to ICU in spring.jpg|thumb|The entrance to ICU leading up to the university chapel. The road has rows of cherry blossom trees on both side which bloom in spring, signifying the start of a new school year.]]

The campus sits on ancient pre-[[Jomon]] and Jomon archaeological remains, which gives students the opportunity to participate in archaeological fieldwork. Excavated items found on the campus are on permanent display in the [[Hachiro Yuasa Memorial Museum]]. In addition, the campus is directly on the former location of a [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]] factory.

In a quiet wooded area of the campus and through a large thatched gate is the Taizanso Garden. Built in the 1920s, the garden includes a traditional Japanese [[tea house]] and the historically significant One-Mat Room constructed out of wood gathered from sacred and historic sites throughout Japan.

ICU owns a {{convert|240|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus in Nasu and a {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} retreat center in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]], [[Kitasaku District, Nagano|Kitasaku District]], [[Nagano Prefecture]].

ICU houses one of the Rotary Centers for [[International studies|International Studies]] in [[Peace and conflict studies|peace and conflict resolution]], partnering with [[Rotary International]]. The [[University of California]] Tokyo Study Center which hosts the UCEAP program to Japan is also located on ICU campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uctsc.org/index.html|title=University of California Tokyo Study Center, EAP, Japan Program, Sign Out, UC Center, カリフォルニア大学東京スタディセンター|website=www.uctsc.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

ICU offers [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts|liberal arts]] fields, as well as [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] [[academic degree|degree]]s in [[education]], [[public administration]], comparative culture and [[natural science]]s. About 18% of the faculty come from overseas (primarily [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]]). There is a strong English language program (ELP), taught by tenured and contract faculty English teachers, which was embroiled in a contentious curricular reform in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.icu.ac.jp/lrb/docs/HaleLRB25.pdf |format=PDF |last=Hale |first=C. |year=2010 |title= Change, Conflict and Conant: ELP Reform and ICU's Liberal Arts Heritage. Language research bulletin. 25 |location=Tokyo |publisher=International Christian University}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the name being changed to the ELA (English for Liberal Arts program) in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/english/liberalarts/collegewide/elp/index.html|title=HTTP 404 error｜国際基督教大学|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics who aspire to teach at ICU are required to submit a reference who can testify to their commitment to Christianity, despite the university' stance that increasing adherents to the Christian faith is not its primary goal.[http://www.icu.ac.jp/en/about/commitment.html]

=== Undergraduate Programs ===

Students choose one or two majors as single major, double major or major/minor. 31 majors are being offered as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/english/liberalarts/major/index.html|title=HTTP 404 error｜国際基督教大学|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilingual Academics ===
The languages of instruction at ICU are Japanese and English. Around 30% of all courses are offered in English, the rest in Japanese or in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/admissions/september/faq/index.html#g5|title=FAQ {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective students without prior Japanese language knowledge are able to apply under a documentary screening process, instead of undergoing the entrance exams held in Japanese. These students are required to have college level English proficiency and subsequently take ICU Japanese Language Programs (JLP) courses to gain [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] and eventually take courses taught in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/admissions/september/faq/index.html#g2|title=FAQ {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the policy of [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of ICU curriculum, students take language courses for their non-dominant language in their freshman and sophomore year (Depending on the student's language requirements, English for Liberal Arts or Japanese Language Programs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/liberalarts/policy/index.html|title=Policies {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each campus department staffs employees with strong command in both languages. Student resources, ICU websites, and campus bulletin boards are in both Japanese and English to accommodate students from any language background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/campuslife/club/bilingual.html|title=A Fully Bilingual Campus Organizational Structure {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trimester System ===
The academic year is divided into trimesters of approximately eleven weeks each with each course lasting one trimester term. This allows for a dynamic learning experience, one where students can design their own curricula as their interests change and develop.

===Japan ICU Foundation===
The Japan ICU Foundation (JICUF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jicuf.org|title=Home Cover Page|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York State]] on November 23, 1948 and helped to establish ICU in 1953. Today, the foundation maintains two [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit corporations]]: The Japan ICU Foundation, Inc. and the JICUF Endowment, Inc.

The Japan ICU Foundation supports ICU in a variety of ways, including providing scholarships, running a faculty exchange program, providing funding for international programs and projects and helping to fund new buildings on campus. The Foundation has offices in [[New York City]]. The current president of JICUF is Dr. David Vikner.

== Research Institutes ==
ICU has eight research institutes as of 2016. In addition to research, these institutes plan and sponsor conferences, lectures, symposia and seminars as well as provide students with opportunities to meet distinguished scholars from Japan and overseas.
* The Institute of Educational Research and Service (IERS)
* The Social Science Research Institute (SSRI)
* The Institute for the Study of Christianity and Culture (ICC)
* The Institute of Asian Cultural Studies (IACS)
* The Peace Research Institute (PRI)
* The Research Center for Japanese Language Education (RCJLE)
* The Institute for Advanced Studies of Clinical Psychology (IASCP)
* The Center for Gender Studies (CGS)

==Student life==

===Demographics===
As of 2011, ICU had 2851 undergraduates studying in the College of Liberal Arts, with a 1041 male students and 1810 female students. The ICU Graduate School had 150 students, with 64 men and 86 women. 90.5% of ICU's undergraduate and graduate students are Japanese citizens, and the remainder represent 44 countries. Many returnee Japanese students that have lived overseas, also known as [[kikokushijo]] (帰国子女), make up the student body.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icu.ac.jp/en//about/info/outline/Student.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of ICU students live off-campus, either at home with their families or in apartments. As of 2010, about 600 students were living on campus.

=== International Education Exchange Programs ===
More than half of the students participate in study abroad programs during their time at ICU. The percentage of students who study abroad through ICU programs before they graduate is 55.5% (in 2014). Students who come from abroad to study at ICU on a year-long exchange program are referred to as OYRs (One Year Regulars).

===ICU Dining Hall===
The ICU Dining Hall, also known as Gakki (ガッキ), is the official cafeteria of International Christian University. Rebuilt in 2010, Gakki is a public, self-service [[cafeteria]] and is one of the newest and most renowned buildings on campus.

===Student clubs/circles===
ICU students are known for their remarkable energy and initiative in creating a kaleidoscope of student-led and student-managed co-curricular activities. There are about 100 student-led clubs and organizations in the arts, sports, academic and social fields. New clubs are formed as student interest dictates, and most ICU students participate in one or more of these organizations.

=== After Graduation ===
As of 2016, 95.3% of ICU undergraduate alumni (students seeking employment) land a job right after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/en/campuslife/career/index.html|title=Paths after Graduation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICU students have found employment in a wide range of industries, particularly with global companies.

Over 20% of students go on to graduate school overseas and in Japan. Domestic and Overseas Universities include: International Christian University, [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]], [[Hitotsubashi University]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Columbia University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of London]], [[Harvard University]], and many more.

==Accreditation==

There are several rankings related to ICU, shown below.

===General rankings===
In 2017, ICU was ranked 15th among all universities, and 3rd among private universities in Japan by Times Higher Education and Benesse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/japan-university/2017#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats|title=Japan University Rankings 2017|date=2017-03-23|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[QS World University Rankings]] ranked ICU as 174th in Asia in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2016|title=QS Asia rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes made a list of top 10 liberal arts colleges in Asia including ICU that was based on the 2014 QS University rankings for Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/gkle45i/top-10-liberal-arts-coll/#15d609e16742|title=Top 10 Liberal Arts Colleges In Asia - pg.1|last=Klebnikov|first=Sergei|website=Forbes|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alumni rankings===
According to the ''Weekly Economist'''s ({{Interlanguage link multi|Shūkan ekonomisuto|ja|3=エコノミスト (雑誌)}}) 2010 rankings and the ({{Interlanguage link multi|PRESIDENT inc.|ja|3=プレジデント社}}) article on 2006/10/16, graduates from ICU have the 24th best employment rate in 400 major companies, and their average graduate salary is the 4th best in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/3865.html|title=Employment rate in 400 major companies rankings |year=2011 |publisher=Weekly Economist |accessdate=Apr 29, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=大学偏差値情報局 |time= 02:51|url=http://hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net/article/26733115.html#more |title=年収偏差値・給料偏差値ランキング（2006・10・16）：稼げる大学はどれ？ |publisher=Hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This 400 major companies exclude foreign companies, thus the ranking position tends to be lower for ICU which has many alumni who work in foreign companies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularity and selectivity===
ICU is one of the most selective universities in Japan. Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as one of the top among 730 private universities. National and public universities use different kinds of exams. Thus it's only comparable between universities in the same category, e.g., {{Interlanguage link multi|Yoyogi seminar|ja|3=代々木ゼミナール}} published Hensachi (the indication showing the entrance difficulties by prep schools) rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |title=代々木ゼミナール（予備校） - ご案内 |publisher= |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422110816/http://yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |archivedate=April 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese journalist {{Interlanguage link multi|Kiyoshi Shimano|ja|3=島野清志}} ranks its entrance difficulty as SA (most selective/out of 11 scales) in Japan, which includes only four private universities and 11 national universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:危ない大学・消える大学 2012年版 |year=2011 |publisher=YELL books |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%8D%B1%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E3%83%BB%E6%B6%88%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6-%EF%BC%92%EF%BC%90%EF%BC%91%EF%BC%92%E5%B9%B4%E7%89%88-YELL-books-%E5%B3%B6%E9%87%8E-%E6%B8%85%E5%BF%97/dp/4753930181|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Union for Conservation of Nature''' ('''IUCN'''; officially '''International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About |publisher=IUCN |quote=The organisation changed its name to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 1956 with the acronym IUCN (or UICN in French and Spanish). This remains our full legal name to this day. |url=https://www.iucn.org/about|date=2014-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[international organization]] working in the field of [[nature conservation]] and sustainable use of [[natural resource]]s. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. IUCN's mission is to "influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable".

Over the past decades, IUCN has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to [[sustainable development]] in its projects. Unlike many other international environmental organisations, IUCN does not itself aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. It tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]], which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide.&lt;ref name=About /&gt;

IUCN has a membership of over 1400 governmental and non-governmental organizations. Some 16,000 scientists and experts participate in the work of IUCN commissions on a voluntary basis. It employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 50 countries. Its headquarters are in [[Gland, Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=About &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucn.org/about |title=About IUCN|publisher=IUCN |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN has [[Observer status#United Nations|observer]] and [[consultative status]] at the [[United Nations]], and plays a role in the implementation of several international conventions on nature conservation and [[biodiversity]].  It was involved in establishing the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and the [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]]. In the past, IUCN has been criticized for placing the interests of nature over those of indigenous peoples. In recent years, its closer relations with the business sector have caused controversy.&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya: The Maasai Stand up to IUCN Displacement Attempts from their Forest|url=http://www.wrm.org.uy/oldsite/bulletin/84/Kenya.html|website=World Rainforest Movement|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Block |first=Ben |title=Environmentalists Spar Over Corporate Ties|type=updated version |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5934|website=[[Worldwatch Institute]]. worldwatch.org|accessdate=26 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN was established in 1948. It was previously called the '''International Union for the Protection of Nature''' (1948–1956) and the '''World Conservation Union''' (1990–2008).

===Overview===
'''Establishment'''&lt;ref name="holdgate"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holdgate|first1=Martin|title=The green web: a union for world conservation|date=1999|publisher=Earthscan|isbn=1 85383 595 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16–38}}

IUCN was established on [[5 October]] [[1948]], in [[Fontainebleau]], France, when representatives of governments and conservation organizations signed a formal act constituting the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUPN). The initiative to set up the new organisation came from [[UNESCO]] and especially from its first Director General, the British biologist [[Julian Huxley]]. [[File:Julian Huxley 1964.jpg|thumb|Julian Huxley, the first Director General of UNESCO, took the initiative to set up IUCN]] The objectives of the new Union were to encourage international cooperation in the protection of nature, to promote national and international action and to compile, analyse and distribute information. At the time of its founding IUPN was the only international organisation focusing on the entire spectrum of nature conservation (an international organisation for the protection of birds, now [[BirdLife International]], had been established in 1922.)

'''Early years: 1948–1956'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|47–63}}&lt;br /&gt;
IUPN started out with 65 members. Its secretariat was located in Brussels. Its first work program focused on saving species and habitats, increasing and applying knowledge, advancing education, promoting international agreements and promoting conservation. Providing a solid scientific base for conservation action was the heart of all activities; commissions were set up to involve experts and scientists.

IUPN and UNESCO were closely associated. They jointly organized the 1949 Conference on Protection of Nature ([[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], USA). In preparation for this conference a list of gravely endangered species was drawn up for the first time, a precursor of the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]. In the early years of its existence IUCN depended almost entirely on UNESCO funding and was forced to temporarily scale down activities when this ended unexpectedly in 1954.

IUPN was successful in engaging prominent scientists and identifying important issues such as the harmful effects of [[pesticide]]s on wildlife but not many of the ideas it developed were turned into action. This was caused by unwillingness to act on the part of governments, uncertainty about the IUPN mandate and lack of resources. In 1956, IUPN changed its name to International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.

'''Increased profile and recognition: 1956–1965'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|67–82}}&lt;br /&gt;
In the 1950s and 1960s Europe entered a period of economic growth and formal colonies became independent. Both developments had impact on the work of IUCN. Through the voluntary (i.e. ''[[pro bono]]'') involvement of experts in its Commissions IUCN was able to get a lot of work done while still operating on a low budget. It expanded its relations with UN-agencies and established links with the [[Council of Europe]]. In 1961, at the request of [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC), the United Nations Economic and Social Council, IUCN published the first global list of national parks and protected areas which it has updated ever since. IUCN's best known publication, the Red Data Book on the conservation status of species, was first published in 1964.&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN began to play a part in the development of international treaties and conventions, starting with the [[African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]]. Environmental law and policy making became a new area of expertise. [[File:Ngorongoro-Crater-Morning-Scene.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Africa was the first regional focus of IUCN conservation action]]
Africa was the focus of many of the early IUCN conservation field projects. IUCN supported the ‘Yellowstone model’ of protected area management, which severely restricted human presence and activity in order to protect nature. IUCN and other conservation organisations were criticized for protecting nature against people rather than with people. This model was initially also applied in Africa and played a role in the decision to remove the [[Maasai people]] from [[Serengeti]] National Park and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]].&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"/&gt;

To establish a stable financial basis for its work, IUCN participated in setting up the World Wildlife Fund (1961) (now the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] WWF). WWF would work on fundraising, public relations, and increasing public support. IUCN would continue to focus on providing sound science and data, and developing ties with international bodies. Funds raised by WWF would be used to cover part of the operational costs of IUCN. Also in 1961, the IUCN headquarters moved from Belgium to [[Morges]] in Switzerland.

'''Consolidating its position in the international environmental movement: 1966–1975'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|110–124}}&lt;br /&gt;
Public concerns about the state of the environment in the sixties and seventies led to the establishment of new NGOs, some of which (e.g. [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]]) also worked globally. Many of these new organisations were more activist and critical of government than IUCN which remained committed to providing science-based advice to governments. As a result, IUCN was criticized by some as being old-fashioned and irrelevant.

IUCN’s membership still grew (from 200 in 1961 to 350 in 1974) and its formal standing and influence increased. A grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] in 1969 enabled it to boost its secretariat and expand operations. During the 1960s, IUCN lobbied the UN General Assembly to create a new status for NGOs. Resolution 1296, adopted in 1968, granted 'consultative' status to NGOs. IUCN itself was eventually accredited with six UN organizations.&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding NGOs|url=https://agendatwentyone.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/understanding-ngos-non-government-organizations/ |website=agendatwentyone.wordpress.com |publisher=[[WordPress.com]]|accessdate=5 December 2014|date=2010-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IUCN was one of the few environmental organisations formally involved in the preparations of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm, 1972). The Stockholm Conference eventually led to three new international conventions, with IUCN involved in their drafting and implementation:
* [[World Heritage Site|Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] (1972). IUCN co-drafted the World Heritage Convention with UNESCO and has been involved as the official Advisory Body on nature from the onset.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/world-heritage/about/iucn-and-world-heritage|title=IUCN and World Heritage|date=2015-11-10|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[CITES]]- the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (1974) IUCN is a signatory party and the CITES secretariat was originally lodged with IUCN.
* [[Ramsar Convention]] – Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (1975). The secretariat is still administered from IUCN's headquarters.

IUCN entered into an agreement with the United Nations Environment Programme [[UNEP]] to provide regular reviews of world conservation. The income this generated, combined with growing revenue via WWF, put the organisation on relatively sound financial footing for the first time since 1948.

This period saw the beginning of a gradual change in IUCN’s approach to conservation. Ensuring the survival of habitats and species remained its key objective, but there was a growing awareness that economic and social demands had to be taken into account. IUCN started to publish guidelines on sustainable development. In 1975 the IUCN General Assembly passed a resolution to retain indigenous peoples and cater for their traditional rights in National Parks and protected areas. As a result, IUCN became more appealing to organisations and governments in the developing world.

{{anchor|World Conservation Strategy}}
'''The World Conservation Strategy 1975–1985'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|132–165}}&lt;br /&gt;
In the late seventies, between its General Assemblies in [[Kinshasha]] (1975) and [[Ashkabad]] (1978), IUCN went through a phase of turbulence in governance and management. Its work program continued to grow, in part as a result of the partnership with WWF. In 1978, IUCN was running 137 projects, largely in the global south. The involvement of representatives from the developing world in the IUCN Council, Committees and staff increased.
In 1975 IUCN started work on the ''World Conservation Strategy''. [[File:Myanmar Illicit Endangered Wildlife Market 06.jpg|thumb|Stopping illegal trade of wildlife is one of IUCN's priorities]]The drafting process – and the discussions with the UN agencies involved – led to an evolution in thinking within IUCN and growing acceptance of the fact that conservation of nature by banning human presence no longer worked. (The debate about the balance between strict nature protection and conservation through sustainable development would, however, continue within IUCN well into the 1999
s.) The ''World Conservation Strategy'' was launched in 35 countries simultaneously on 5 March 1980. It set out fundamental principles and objectives for conservation worldwide, and identified priorities for national and international action. It is considered one of the most influential documents in 20th century nature conservation and one of the first official documents to introduce the concept of sustainable development. The Strategy was followed in 1982 by the ''[[World Charter for Nature]]'', which was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], after preparation by IUCN.

In 1980, IUCN and WWF moved into shared new offices in [[Gland, Switzerland]]. This marked a phase of closer cooperation with WWF. It was the support of WWF that allowed IUCN to weather a financial crisis in 1980–1982. The close ties between IUCN and WWF were severed in 1985 when WWF decided to take control of its own field projects, which so far had been run by IUCN. In 1989, IUCN moved into a separate building in Gland, close to the offices it had shared with WWF.

'''Sustainable development and regionalisation: 1985 to present day'''&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt;{{rp|176–222}}&lt;br /&gt;
In 1982, IUCN set up a Conservation for Development Centre within its secretariat. The Centre undertook projects to ensure that nature conservation was integrated in development aid and in the economic policies of developing countries. Over the years, it supported the development of national conservation strategies in 30 countries. Several European countries began to channel considerable amounts of bilateral aid via IUCN’s projects. Management of these projects was primarily done by IUCN staff, often working from the new regional and country offices IUCN set up around the world. This marked a shift within the organisation. Previously the volunteer Commissions had been very influential, now the Secretariat and its staff began to play a more dominant role. Initially, the focus of power was still with the Headquarters in Gland but the regional offices and regional members’ groups gradually got a bigger say in operations.

In spite of the increased attention for sustainable development, the protection of habitats and species remained a core activity of IUCN. Special programs were developed for Antarctica, tropical forests and wetlands, and IUCN expanded its operations in Latin America.

In 1991, IUCN (together with UNEP and WWF) published ''Caring for the Earth'', a successor to the World Conservation Strategy. It was published in the run-up to the [[Earth Summit]], the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. The ''World Conservation Strategy'', ''Caring for the Earth'', and the ''Global Diversity Strategy ''(also published in 1992 by UNEP, IUCN, and WRI) are considered hugely influential in shaping the global environmental agenda. They lay the foundations for the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], a new global treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity developed by UNEP with support from IUCN, the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]] and [[Agenda 21]].&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs"/&gt;

Social aspects of conservation were now integrated in IUCN’s work; projects began to take account of the role of women in natural resource management and to value the knowledge indigenous peoples have about their natural environment.  At the General Assembly in 1994 the IUCN mission was redrafted to its current wording to include the equitable and ecologically use of natural resources.

IUCN’s current work makes direct contributions towards achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular, IUCN’s Programme 2017–2020 focusing on SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 2 (Zero hunger), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 13 (Climate action), SDG 14 (Life below water), SDG 15 (Life on land), SDG 16 (Peace, justice and strong institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals).&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/about/programme-work-and-reporting/programme|title=IUCN Programme|last=|first=|date=2015-10-01|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:IUCN-Headquarters.jpg|thumb|IUCN-Headquarters in Gland, Switzerland]]

'''Closer to business: 2000 to present day'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since the creation of IUCN in 1948, IUCN Members have passed more than 300 resolutions that include or focus on business related activities. The range of topics covers in these resolutions varies greatly, including a focus on fisheries, tourism, agriculture, the extractive industries and the business sector in general.

The increased attention on sustainable development as a means to protect nature brought IUCN closer to the corporate sector. A discussion started about cooperation with business, including the question if commercial companies could become IUCN members. The members decided against this, but IUCN did forge a partnership with the [[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]. IUCN renewed a multi-year MOU with them with WBCSD in December 2015.

In 1996, after decades of seeking to address specific business issues, IUCN’s Members asked for a comprehensive approach to engaging the business sector. Resolution 1.81 of the IUCN World Conservation Congress held that year “urged IUCN Members and the Director General, based on the need to influence private sector policies in support of the Mission of IUCN, to expand dialogue and productive relationships with the private sector and find new ways to interact with members of the business community”.

The IUCN Global Business and Biodiversity Program (BBP) was established in 2003 to influence and support private partners in addressing environmental and social issues. The Program wants to engage with business sectors that have a significant impact on natural resources and livelihoods to promote sustainable use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Business and Biodiversity Programme|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/business/|website=IUCN|accessdate=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the first IUCN Private Sector Engagement Strategy was developed (in response to Council Decision C/58/41). 
Most prominent in the Business and Biodiversity Program is the five-year collaboration IUCN started with the energy company [[Shell International]] in 2007. The aim was to mitigate the environmental impact of Shell's operations.  The partnership almost immediately came under fire from IUCN's members, especially the NGO-members who feared for IUCN’s reputation. At the World Conservation Congress (formerly the IUCN General Assembly) in Barcelona in 2008 NGO-members tabled a motion to terminate the Shell contract. The proposal was narrowly defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN and Shell: Guiding the way|url=http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=434|website=Business &amp; Biodiversity|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195343/http://www.business-biodiversity.eu/default.asp?Menue=155&amp;News=434|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldwatch.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentalists spar over corporate ties|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5934|website=Worldwatch|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, at the World Conservation Congress held in the Republic of South Korea, the Union adopted a more focused approach to enable IUCN to deliver both on‐the‐ground results and fit‐for‐purpose knowledge products, working with many agencies, including business. The Business Engagement Strategy (2012) calls on IUCN to prioritise engagement with business sectors that have a significant impact on natural resources and livelihoods. These include: large 'footprint' industries, such as: mining and oil and gas; biodiversity-dependent industries including fishing, agriculture and forestry; and, financial services and “green” enterprises such as organic farming, renewable energy and nature-based tourism.

Furthermore, the IUCN Operational Guidelines for Business Engagement offer critical support to the implementation of the IUCN Business Engagement Strategy. First developed in 2006, and then revised in 2009 and again in 2015, they provide a consistent approach to the management of risks associated with engaging business, as well as outline the opportunities between the different types of engagement.

Today, the Business and Biodiversity Programme continues to set the strategic direction, coordinate IUCN’s overall approach and provide institutional quality assurance in all business engagements. The Programme ensures that the Business Engagement Strategy is implemented through IUCN’s global thematic and regional programmes as well as helps guide the work of IUCN’s six Commissions.

'''Championing Nature-based Solutions: 2009 to present day'''

[[Nature Based Solutions|Nature-based Solutions (NbS)]] use ecosystems and the services they provide to address societal challenges such as climate change, food security or natural disasters.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46191|title=Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges {{!}} IUCN Library System|website=portals.iucn.org|access-date=2017-07-04|isbn=9782831718125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the NbS concept in environmental sciences and nature conservation contexts came as international organisations, such as IUCN and the World Bank, searched for solutions to work with ecosystems rather than relying on conventional engineering interventions (such as seawalls), to adapt to and mitigate climate change effects, while improving sustainable livelihoods and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.

IUCN actively promoted the NbS concept in its 2009 position paper on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP 15, and in 2012 IUCN formally adopted NbS as one of the three areas of work within its 2013–2016 Programme.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"/&gt;

At the IUCN World Conservation Congress 2016, IUCN Members agreed on a definition of nature-based solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/congress/motion/077|title=077 – Defining Nature-based Solutions {{!}} 2016 Congress portal|website=portals.iucn.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature-based Solutions are defined as “actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits”. Members also called for governments to include nature-based solutions in strategies to combat climate change . A report, ''Nature-based solutions to address global societal challenges'', was launched at the Congress, and includes a set of general principles for any NbS intervention.&lt;ref name="portals.iucn.org"/&gt;

Implementing NbS at scale can help countries achieve the targets of Sustainable Development Goals. It can also help them achieve the [[land degradation]] neutrality goal of the UNCCD, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the CBD, and the Paris Agreement on climate change.

==Current work==

=== IUCN Programme 2017–2020 ===
According to its website, IUCN works on the following themes: business, [[climate change]], economics, [[ecosystems]], [[environmental law]], [[forest protection|forest conservation]], [[gender]], global policy, [[marine habitats|marine]] and [[polar regions|polar]], [[protected areas]], science and knowledge, [[social policy]], [[species]], water and [[world heritage sites|world heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What we do|url=http://www.iucn.org/what/|website=IUCN|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IUCN works on the basis of four-year programs, determined by the membership. In the IUCN Programme for 2017–2020 conserving nature and biodiversity is inextricably linked to sustainable development and poverty reduction.  IUCN states that it aims to have a solid factual base for its work and takes into account the knowledge held by indigenous groups and other traditional users of natural resources.

The IUCN Programme 2017–2020 identifies three priority areas:&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme"/&gt;

1. Valuing and conserving nature.

2. Promoting and supporting effective and equitable governance of natural resources

3. Deploying [[Nature Based Solutions]] to address societal challenges including climate change, food security and economic and social development.&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme" /&gt;

Unlike other environmental organisations, IUCN does not itself aim to directly mobilize the general public.  Education has been part of IUCN's work program since the early days but the focus is on stakeholder involvement and strategic communication rather than mass-campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEC – what we do|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/cec/cec_what_we_do/|website=IUCN|accessdate=26 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226162000/http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/cec/cec_what_we_do/|archivedate=26 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Habitats and species===
IUCN runs field projects for [[habitat conservation|habitat]] and species conservation around the world. It produces the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems which in a similar way measures risks to ecosystems.
The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems is a global standard to assess the conservation status of ecosystems. It is applicable at local, national, regional and global levels. It is based on a set of rules, or criteria, for performing evidence-based, scientific assessments of the risk of ecosystem collapse, as measured by reductions in geographical distribution or degradation of the key processes and components of ecosystems.

IUCN participates in efforts to restore [[critically endangered]] species. In 2012 it published a list of [[the world's 100 most threatened species]]. It wants to expand the global network of [[national parks]] and other [[protected areas]] and promote good management of such areas, for example through the publication of the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Green List' awards world's top conservation sites|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/11/iucn-sets-up-the-green-list|accessdate=18 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IUCN is the governing body responsible for the development of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|Protected Area Management Categories]] into which each protected area is divided depending on its conservation requirements and management aims. It also developed a standard to identify [[Key Biodiversity Areas]] — places of international importance for conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/wcpa/what-we-do/biodiversity-and-protected-areas/key-biodiversity-areas|title=Key Biodiversity Areas|date=2016-03-08|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it focuses on greater protection of the [[oceans]] and [[marine habitats]].

=== Business partnerships ===
IUCN has a growing program of partnerships with the corporate sector to promote sustainable use of natural resources. Globally, IUCN collaborates with Black Mountain Mining, Nespresso, Rio Tinto, Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd, Shell, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, Ltd., the International Olympic Committee, Natural Capital Coalition, Renova Foundation, Tiffany Foundation, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and others.

At the national and regional level, IUCN also works with Marriott International in Thailand, the Zambezi Valley Development Agency (ADPP) in Mozambique, Minh Phu – the largest shrimp exporter in Vietnam, Xingzhitianxia Media Company in China, the Secretariat of the Southern Agriculture Corridor of Tanzania (SAGCOT), Tata Steel in India, Engro Elengy Terminal (Pvt) Ltd in Pakistan, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-001-v.1-En.pdf|title=IUCN 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National and international policy ===
On the national level, IUCN helps governments prepare national biodiversity policies. Internationally, IUCN provides advice to environmental conventions such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[CITES]] and the [[Framework Convention on Climate Change]]. It advises [[UNESCO]] on natural [[world heritage site|world heritage]].&lt;br /&gt;
It has a formally accredited permanent observer mission to the [[United Nations]] in New York. According to its own website, IUCN is the only international observer organization in the UN General Assembly with expertise in issues concerning the environment, specifically biodiversity, nature conservation and sustainable natural resource use.&lt;ref name="IUCN Programme" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN has official relations with the [[Council of Europe]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO),  the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), the [[UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] (UNEP-WCMC), the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO NGO database|url=http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100033055|website=UNESCO|accessdate=4 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208140552/http://ngo-db.unesco.org/r/or/en/1100033055|archivedate=8 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
As an organization, IUCN has three components: the member organizations, the six scientific commissions, and the secretariat.

===Members===
IUCN Members are states (making IUCN a supranational [[GONGO]]), government agencies, international nongovernmental organizations, national nongovernmental organizations, and indigenous peoples’ organisations. In 2017, IUCN had 1400 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/news/secretariat/201706/iucn-welcomes-13-new-members|title=IUCN welcomes 13 new Members|date=2017-06-06|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-07-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members can organize themselves in national or regional committees to promote cooperation. In 2016, there were 62 national committees and 7 regional committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-001-v.1-En.pdf|title=IUCN 2016 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:USSR 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Soviet]] Stamp commemorating the 1978 IUCN General Assembly in [[Ashgabat]]]]

===Commissions===
The six IUCN Commissions involve 16,000 volunteer experts from a range of disciplines. They 'assess the state of the world’s natural resources and provide the Union with sound know-how and policy advice on conservation issues'.&lt;ref name="IUCNCommissions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucn.org/about/union/commissions/ | title = IUCN – Commissions |date=12 May 2010 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Commission on Education and Communication (CEC): communication, learning and knowledge management in IUCN and the wider conservation community. Members: over 1300
* Commission on Environmental, Economic, and Social Policy (CEESP): economic and social factors for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Members: 1465.
* World Commission on Environmental Law (WCEL): developing new legal concepts and instruments, and building the capacity of societies to employ environmental law for conservation and sustainable development. Members: 800.
* Commission on Ecosystem Management (CEM): integrated ecosystem approaches to the management of natural and modified ecosystems. Members: 1000.
* Species Survival Commission (SSC): technical aspects of species conservation and action for species that are threatened with [[extinction]]. Members: 7500.
* World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA):  establishment and effective management of a network of terrestrial and marine protected areas. Members: 1300. {{Main article|World Commission on Protected Areas}}

===Secretariat===
The Secretariat is led by the Director General. For management of its operations IUCN distinguishes eight geographical regions; each is led by a director who reports to the Director General.&lt;br /&gt;
The IUCN head office is in [[Gland]], Switzerland. Eight regional offices implement IUCN’s program in their respective territories. Since 1980, IUCN has established offices in more than 50 countries. The total number of staff grew from 100 (1980) to around 1,000 (2014);  nearly all this growth was in the national and regional offices. Approximately 150 staff are based in the head office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IUCN|url=http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/|website=IUCN|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and funding==

===Governance===
[[File:Inger2 (5243802649).jpg|thumb|[[Inger Andersen (environmentalist)|Inger Andersen]], IUCN Director General since January 2015]]The '''World Conservation Congress''' (Members’ Assembly) is IUCN’s highest decision-making body. The Congress convenes every four years, most recently in [[Hawaii]] (2016) and previously in Jeju, South Korea (2012). It elects the Council, including the President, and approves IUCN’s workprogram for the next four years, and budget.

The IUCN '''Council''' is the principal governing body of IUCN. The Council provides strategic direction for the activities of the Union, discusses specific policy issues and provides guidance on finance and the membership development of the Union. The Council is composed of the President, four Vice Presidents (elected by the Council from among its members), the Treasurer, the Chairs of IUCN's six Commissions, three Regional Councillors from each of IUCN's eight Statutory Regions and a Councillor from the State in which IUCN has its seat (Switzerland).  IUCN's current President is [[Zhang Xinsheng]].

The Council appoints a '''Director General''', who is responsible for the overall management of IUCN and the running of the Secretariat. [[Inger Andersen (environmentalist)|Inger Andersen]] is IUCN Director General since January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inger Andersen named IUCN Director General|url=http://www.iucn.org/?18465/Inger-Andersen-named-IUCN-Director-General|website=IUCN|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She succeeded [[Julia Marton-Lefèvre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Union|url=http://iucn.org/about/union/|website=IUCN|accessdate=3 December 2014|date=2014-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
IUCN’s total income in 2013 was 114 million CHF, equaling approximately 95 million Euro or 116 million US dollar.&lt;br /&gt;
IUCN’s funding mainly comes from Official Development Assistance budgets of bilateral and multilateral agencies. This represented 61% of its income in 2013. Additional sources of income are the membership fees, as well as grants and project funding from foundations, institutions and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Annual Report 2013|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/IUCN-2014-017.pdf|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticism==

===Influence===
IUCN is considered one of the most influential conservation organisations in the world and, together with WWF and the [[World Resources Institute]] (WRI), is seen as a driving force behind the rise of the influence of environmental organisations at the UN and around the world.&lt;ref name="Understanding NGOs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is IUCN"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is IUCN?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-iucn.htm|website=WiseGeek|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It has established a network covering all aspects of global conservation via its worldwide membership of governmental and non-governmental organisations, the participation of experts in the IUCN Commissions, formal involvement in international agreements, ties to intergovernmental organisations and increasingly partnerships with international business. The World Conservation Congress and the World Parks Congress events organised by IUCN are the largest gatherings of organisations and individuals involved in conservation worldwide.  They involve governmental organisations, NGOs, media, academia and the corporate sector. &lt;br /&gt;
According to some, IUCN is not only a major global player in conservation action, but also has considerable influence in defining what nature conservation actually is.&lt;ref name="IUCN: A History of Constraint"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Kenneth|title=IUCN: A History of Constraint|publisher=UCLouvain|url=http://perso.uclouvain.be/marc.maesschalck/MacDonaldInstitutional_Reflexivity_and_IUCN-17.02.03.pdf|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] and the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems determine which species and natural areas merit protection. Through the Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas and the system of [[IUCN protected area categories]] IUCN influences how protected areas are managed.

===Criticism===
The relevance of the scientific insights and the data that IUCN produces are not often drawn into question, but IUCN has encountered criticism in other matters.

It has been claimed that IUCN put the needs of nature above those of humans, disregarding economic considerations and the interests of indigenous peoples and other traditional users of the land. Until the 1980s IUCN favored the "Yellowstone Model’ of conservation which called for the removal of humans from protected areas. The expulsion of the [[Maasai people]] from [[Serengeti National Park]] and the [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]] is perhaps the best known example of this approach.&lt;ref name="wrm.org.uy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="holdgate"/&gt;[[File:Ngorongoro 2012 05 30 2353 (7500935618).jpg|thumb|IUCN's relationships with local land users like the Maasai have caused controversy in the past]]
This is linked to another criticism that has been directed at IUCN, namely that throughout its history it has mainly been ‘Northern focused’, i.e. had a West-European or North-American perspective on global conservation.  Some critics point to the fact that many individuals involved in the establishment of IUCN had been leading figures in the British Society for the Preservation of the Wild Fauna of Empire, which wanted to protect species against the impact of ‘native’ hunting pressure in order to safeguard hunting by Europeans.&lt;ref name="IUCN: A History of Constraint"/&gt; The fact that at least until the 1990s,  most of IUCN staff, the chairs of the Commissions and the IUCN President came from western countries has also led to criticism.&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt; Over the past decade, IUCN has changed its approach. It now aims to work in close cooperation with indigenous groups. It has also become more regionalized in its operations and more truly global in its staffing.&lt;ref name="holdgate" /&gt; At the 2016 World Conservation Congress, IUCN introduced a new membership category for indigenous peoples’ organisations in recognition of their role in conserving the planet.

More recently, activist environmental groups have argued that IUCN is too closely associated with governmental organisations and with the commercial sector.&lt;ref name="What is IUCN"/&gt;  IUCN’s cooperation with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] came in for criticism, also from its own membership.&lt;ref name="worldwatch.org"/&gt; IUCN's close partnership with [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] in Vietnam – where they have together been launching Coca-Cola-focused community centers – has also drawn some criticism and allegations of [[greenwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iucn.org/ur/node/26042|title=What's an EKOCENTER and what does it do?|date=2016-04-04|work=IUCN|access-date=2017-06-20|language=ur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/dec/04/coca-cola-coke-water-neutral|title=Greenwash: Are Coke's green claims the real thing?|date=2008-12-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theecologist.org/blogs_and_comments/commentators/2985093/never_mind_the_greenwash_coca_cola_can_never_be_water_neutral.html|title=Never mind the greenwash – Coca Cola can never be 'water neutral'|work=The Ecologist|access-date=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its decision to hold the 2012 World Conservation Congress on [[Jeju Island]], South Korea, where the local community and international environmental activists were protesting against the construction of a navy base also led to controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeju island navy base controversy divides iucn|url=http://biodiversitymedia.ning.com/profiles/blogs/jeju-island-navy-base-controversy-divides-iucn|website=Biodiversity media alliance|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IUCN remains committed to its partnerships with the business sector, seeing sustainable development as the way to ensure long-term protection of natural areas and species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Natural capital must be the way forward, says IUCN director general|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/natural-capital-way-forward-iucn|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=21 January 2015|date=2013-11-11|last1=Smedley|first1=Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
IUCN has a wide range of publications, reports, guidelines and databases related to conservation and [[sustainable development]]. It publishes or co-authors more than 100 books and major assessments every year, along with hundreds of reports, documents and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iucn.org/resources/publications|title=Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=IUCN|accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 76 IUCN articles were published in peer reviewed scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|title=IUCN Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|publisher=IUCN|year=|isbn=|location=https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-020.pdf|pages=Page 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report, released at the IUCN World Parks Congress in Sydney on 13 November 2014 showed that the 209,000 conservation reserves around the world now cover 15.4 per cent of the total land area. The new figures are a step in the right direction of protecting 17 percent of land and 10 percent of ocean environments on Earth by 2020 since an agreement between the world's nations at the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], held in Japan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big increase in Earth’s protected areas|url=http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/11/big-increase-in-earth%E2%80%99s-protected-areas|accessdate=17 November 2014|website=Australian Geographic|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its World Conservation Congress in Hawaii in 2016, the IUCN launched a report ''Explaining ocean warming: causes, scale, effects and consequences'', one of the most comprehensive reviews to date on ocean warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/46254 |title=Explaining ocean warming |last1=Baxter |first1=J.M. |last2=Laffoley |first2= Daniel D'A|date= September 5, 2016|website= |publisher=IUCN |accessdate= September 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Mary's River Project, which is a part of the Muldoon River Center, is a state and federally funded [[marine biology]] research program,&lt;ref name=Yeatman/&gt; administered through [[St. Mary's College of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=Yeatman/&gt;

Using the St. Mary's River and other nearby waters as field laboratories, the project investigates and monitors the water quality and the ecological health of both the [[St. Marys River (Maryland)|St. Mary's River]]&lt;ref name=Yeatman/&gt; and the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The project also promotes environment awareness and stewardship in Chesapeake Bay communities.&lt;ref name=Yeatman/&gt; Students work and study in all aspects of the programs activities, including classroom and hands-on field and laboratory learning.

The laboratories and offices of the project are located in the Muldoon River Center, a geothermally heated and cooled building on the campus waterfront.

The '''Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center''' ('''JSC''') is [[NASA|the National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]'s '''Manned Spacecraft Center''', where [[human spaceflight]] training, research, and [[flight controller|flight control]] are conducted. It was built and [[lease]]d to NASA by Joseph L. Smith &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;ref name="AW-1963"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Aviation_Week_1963-06-17#page/n63/mode/1up "Space" is our product]. // ''Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology'', June 17, 1963, v. 78, no. 24, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed in honor of the late U.S. president and Texas native, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], by an act of the [[United States Senate]] on February 19, 1973.

It consists of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on {{convert|1,620|acre|ha|abbr=off}} in the [[Clear Lake Area]] of [[Houston]], which acquired the official [[Nicknames of Houston|nickname]] "Space City" in 1967.  The center is home to [[NASA Astronaut Corps|NASA's astronaut corps]], and is responsible for training astronauts from both the U.S. and its international partners. It has become popularly known for its flight control function, identified as "[[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]]" during the [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Skylab]], [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|Apollo–Soyuz]], and [[Space Shuttle program]] flights.

The Manned Spacecraft Center grew out of the [[Space Task Group]] (STG) headed by [[Robert Gilruth]], formed soon after the creation of NASA to co-ordinate the US manned spaceflight program. The STG was based at the [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]], but reported organizationally to the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] just outside [[Washington, DC|Washington, D.C]]. To meet the growing needs of the US human spaceflight program, plans began in 1961 to expand its staff to its own organization, and move it to a new facility. This was constructed in 1962 and 1963 on land donated by the [[Humble Oil]] company through [[Rice University]], and officially opened its doors in September 1963. Today, JSC is one of ten major [[NASA facilities#NASA field centers|NASA field centers]].

==History==
Johnson Space Center has its origins in [[NASA]]'s [[Space Task Group]] (STG), created on November 5, 1958, with Langley Research Center engineers under the direction of [[Robert Gilruth]], to direct [[Project Mercury]] and follow-on manned space programs. The STG originally reported to the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] organization, with a total staff of 45, including 37 engineers and eight secretaries and "[[Human computer|computers]]" (women who ran calculations on mechanical adding machines). In 1959, the center added 32 Canadian engineers put out of work by the cancellation of the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] project.{{sfnp|Murray|Bly Cox|1989|pp=33-35}} NASA's first administrator, [[T. Keith Glennan]], realized that the growth of America's space program would cause the STG to outgrow the Langley and Goddard centers and require its own location. On Jan. 1, 1961, he wrote a memo to his yet-unnamed successor (who turned out to be [[James E. Webb]]), recommending a new site be chosen.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=36}} Later that year, when President [[John F. Kennedy]] set the goal to put a man on the [[Moon]] by the end of the decade, it became clear Gilruth would need a larger organization to lead the [[Apollo Program]], with new test facilities and research laboratories.&lt;ref name=JSC&gt;{{Cite web

===Site selection===

In 1961, Congress held hearings and passed a $1.7 billion 1962 NASA appropriations bill which included $60 million for the new "manned spaceflight laboratory".{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=38}} A set of requirements for the new site was drawn up and released to the Congress and general public. These included: access to [[water transport]] by large barges, a moderate climate, availability of all-weather commercial jet service, a well-established industrial complex with supporting technical facilities and labor, close proximity to a culturally attractive community in the vicinity of an institution of higher education, a strong electric utility and water supply, at least 1,000 acres of land, and certain specified cost parameters.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=38}} In August 1961, Webb asked Associate Director of the [[Ames Research Center]] John F. Parsons to head a site-selection team, which included Philip Miller, Wesley Hjornevik, and I. Edward Campagna, the construction
engineer for the STG.&lt;ref name="TNO 12"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team initially came up with a list of 22 cities based on the climate and water criteria, then cut this to a short list of nine with nearby federal facilities:
* Jacksonville, Florida ([[Green Cove Springs, Florida|Green Cove Springs]] [[Naval Station]])
* Tampa, Florida ([[MacDill Air Force Base]])
* [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]
* Shreveport, Louisiana ([[Barksdale Air Force Base]])
* Houston, Texas ([[San Jacinto Army Ordnance Depot]])
* Victoria, Texas ([[Victoria Regional Airport|FAA Airport]])
* Corpus Christi, Texas ([[Naval Air Station]])
* San Diego, California ([[Camp Elliott]])
* San Francisco, California ([[Benicia Arsenal]]){{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=39}}
 
Another 14 sites were then added, including two additional Houston sites chosen because of proximity to the [[University of Houston]] and [[Rice University]].&lt;ref name=JSC/&gt; The team visited all 23 sites between August 21 and September 7, 1961. During these visits, Massachusetts Governor [[John A. Volpe]] and Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]] headed a delegation which exerted particularly strong political pressure, prompting a personal inquiry to Webb from President Kennedy. Senators and Congressmen from sites in Missouri and California similarly lobbied the selection team. Proponents of sites in Boston, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia, went so far as to make separate presentations to Webb and the headquarters staff, so Webb added these additional sites to the final review.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=39}}

Following its tour, the team identified MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa as its first choice, based on the fact the Air Force was planning to close down its Strategic Air Command operations there. The Houston Rice University site was second, and the Benicia Ordnance Depot in San Francisco was third. Before a decision could be made, however, the Air Force decided not to close MacDill, omitting it from consideration and moving the Rice University site to first place. Webb informed President Kennedy on September 14 of the decision made by him and deputy administrator [[Hugh Dryden]] in two separate memoranda, one reviewing the criteria and procedures, and the other stating: "Our decision is that this laboratory should be located in Houston, Texas, in close association with Rice University and the other educational institutions there and in that region." The Executive Office and NASA made advance notifications of the award, and the public announcement of the location followed on September 19, 1961.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=40}} According to [[Texas A&amp;M University]] historian [[Henry C. Dethloff]], "Although the Houston site neatly fit the criteria required for the new center, Texas undoubtedly exerted an enormous political influence on such a decision. Lyndon B. Johnson was Vice President and head of the Space Council, [[Albert Richard Thomas|Albert Thomas]] headed the House Appropriations Committee, [[Robert R. Casey|Bob Casey]] and [[Olin E. Teague]] were members of the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, and Teague headed the Subcommittee on Manned Space Flight. Finally, [[Sam Rayburn]] was Speaker of the House of Representatives."{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|pp=41-42}}

The land for the new facility was {{convert|1000|acre|ha|abbr=off}} donated to Rice by the [[Humble Oil]] company, situated in an undeveloped area {{convert|25|mi|km}} southeast of Houston adjacent to [[Clear Lake (Galveston Bay)|Clear Lake]] near [[Galveston Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rice.edu/2009/07/16/houston-we-have-a-space-program/|title=Houston, we have a space program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman"&gt;{{cite book | author=Schulman, Bruce J. | title=From Cotton Belt to Sunbelt: Federal Policy, Economic Development, and the Transformation of the South 1938–1980 | publisher=Duke University Press | year=1994 | page=149 | isbn=978-0-8223-1537-7 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=vwcGbPRuM9oC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Dumoulin|1988}} At the time, the land was used to graze cattle.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=40}} Immediately after Webb's announcement, Gilruth and his staff began planning the move from Langley to Houston, using what would grow to {{convert|295996|ft2|m2}} of leased office and laboratory space in 11 scattered sites.&lt;ref name="TNO 12"/&gt; On November 1, the conversion of the Task Group to MSC became official.{{sfnp|Grimwood|1963|p=152}}

Tracts of land in the vicinity of the Manned Spacecraft Center were either owned or being under exclusive control of Joseph L. Smith &amp; Associates, Inc.&lt;ref name="AW-1963" /&gt;
NASA purchased an additional {{convert|600|acre|ha|abbr=off}} so the property would face a highway, and the total included another {{convert|20|acre|ha|abbr=off}} reserve drilling site.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=48}} Construction of the center, designed by [[Charles Luckman]], began in April 1962, and Gilruth's new organization was formed and moved to the temporary locations by September.&lt;ref name="TNO AppC"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Mission Operations Control Room at the conclusion of Apollo 11.jpg|thumb|right|Mission Operations Control Room 2 at the conclusion of [[Apollo 11]] in 1969]]
In 1961, as plans for [[Project Gemini]] began, it became increasingly clear that the [[Mercury Control Center]] located at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] launch center would become inadequate to control missions with maneuverable spacecraft such as Gemini and Apollo. [[Christopher Kraft]] and three other [[flight controller]]s began studying what was needed for an improved control center, and directed a study contract awarded to [[Philco]]'s Western Development Laboratory. Philco bid on and won the contract to build the electronic equipment for the new Mission Control Center, which would be located in Building 30 of MSC rather than Canaveral or the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in Maryland. Construction began in 1963.{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|pp=85-86}}

The new center had two Mission Operations Control Rooms, allowing training and preparation for a later mission to be carried out while a live mission is in progress. It was brought online for testing purposes during the unmanned [[Gemini 2]] flight in January 1965{{sfnp|Dethloff|1993|p=85}} and the first manned Gemini flight, [[Gemini 3]] in March 1965, though the Mercury Control Center still retained primary responsibility for control of these flights. It became fully operational for the flight of [[Gemini 4]] the following June, and has been the primary flight control center for all subsequent U.S. [[manned space mission]]s from Project Gemini forward.&lt;ref name="Schulman"/&gt;{{sfnp|Dumoulin|1988}}

NASA named the center the Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center on April 14, 2011.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/kraft_mcc.html NASA - NASA Names Mission Control for Legendary Flight Director Christopher Kraft].

In addition to housing NASA's astronaut operations, JSC is also the site of the former [[Lunar Receiving Laboratory]], where the first astronauts returning from the Moon were [[quarantine]]d, and where the majority of [[lunar sample]]s are stored. The center's Landing and Recovery Division operated ''[[MV Retriever]]'' in the Gulf of Mexico for Gemini and Apollo astronauts to practice water egress after [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]].

On February 19, 1973, after Johnson's death, President [[Richard Nixon]] signed into law a Senate resolution renaming the Manned Spacecraft Center in honor of Johnson, who as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] had sponsored the [[National Aeronautics and Space Act|1958 legislation which created NASA]].{{sfnp|Nixon|1973}}{{sfnp|New York Times|1973}} Dedication ceremonies under the new name were held on August 27 of that year.

One of the artifacts displayed at Johnson Space Center is the [[Saturn V]] rocket.  It is whole, except for the ring between the [[S-IC]] and S-II stages, and the fairing between the S-II and [[S-IVB]] stages, and made of actual surplus flight-ready articles.  It also has real (though incomplete) [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]] command and service modules, intended to fly in the [[canceled Apollo missions|cancelled Apollo 19 mission]].

===Space Shuttle program===

In the wake of the January 28, 1986, [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]], President [[Ronald Reagan]] and First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] traveled to JSC on January 31 to speak at a memorial service honoring the astronauts. It was attended by 6,000 NASA employees and 4,000 guests, as well as by the families of the crew. During the ceremony, an Air Force band led the singing of "God Bless America" as NASA [[T-38 Talon]] supersonic jets flew directly over the scene in the traditional [[missing-man formation]]. All activities were broadcast live by the national television and radio networks.

A similar memorial service was held at the Johnson Space Center on February 4, 2003, for the astronauts who perished in the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] three days before, which was attended by President [[George W. Bush]] and First Lady [[Laura Bush]]. Although that service was broadcast live by the national television and radio networks, it was geared mainly to NASA employees and the families of the astronauts. A second service for the nation was led by Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] and his wife [[Lynne Cheney|Lynne]] at [[Washington National Cathedral]] two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0302/06/se.03.html|title=CNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL: Remembering the Columbia 7: Washington National Cathedral Memorial for Astronauts|date=February 6, 2003|accessdate=September 15, 2011|publisher=CNN |first=Judy|last=Woodruff|authorlink=Judy Woodruff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2008, [[Hurricane Ike]] hit [[Galveston]] as a category 2 hurricane and caused minor damage to the Mission Control Center and other buildings at JSC.&lt;ref name="IkeDamage"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Ike Damage To NASA-JSC Light | work = Aviation Week | author = Frank Morring, Jr. | date = 2008-09-16 | accessdate = 2009-10-18 | url = http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/Hurri091608.xml&amp;headline=Ike%20Damage%20To%20NASA-JSC%20Light%20&amp;channel=space }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storm damaged the roofs of several hangars for the T-38 Talons at [[Ellington Field]].&lt;ref name="IkeDamage"/&gt;

==Facilities==
{{Further|List of buildings in the Johnson Space Center}}

The Johnson Space Center is home to [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center]] (MCC-H), the NASA control center that coordinates and monitors all human spaceflight for the United States. MCC-H directed all [[Space Shuttle]] missions, and currently directs American activities aboard the [[International Space Station]]. The [[Apollo Mission Control Center]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], is in Building 30. From the moment a manned spacecraft clears its launch tower until it lands back on Earth, it is in the hands of Mission Control. The MCC houses several Flight Control Rooms, from which [[flight controller]]s coordinate and monitor the spaceflights. The rooms have many computer resources to monitor, command, and communicate with spacecraft. When a mission is underway, the rooms are staffed around the clock, usually in three shifts.

JSC handles most of the planning and training of the US astronaut corps and houses training facilities such as the [[Sonny Carter Training Facility]] and the [[Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory]], a critical component in training astronauts for spacewalks. The Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides a controlled neutral [[buoyancy]] environment—a very large pool containing about 6.2 million US gallons (23,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of water where astronauts train to practice [[extra-vehicular activity]] tasks while simulating [[zero-g]] conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid18619137"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Strauss S |title=Space medicine at the NASA-JSC, neutral buoyancy laboratory |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=79 |issue=7 |pages=732–3 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18619137 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15892545"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strauss S, Krog RL, Feiveson AH |title=Extravehicular mobility unit training and astronaut injuries |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=76 |issue=5 |pages=469–74 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15892545 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2005/00000076/00000005/art00008 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility provides preflight training in becoming familiar with crew activities and with the dynamics of body motion under weightless conditions.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Building 31-N houses the [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]], which stores, analyzes, and processes most of the samples returned from the moon during the Apollo program.

The center is also responsible for direction of operations at [[White Sands Test Facility]] in [[New Mexico]], which served as a backup [[Space Shuttle]] landing site and would have been the coordinating facility for the [[Constellation program]], which was planned to replace the Shuttle program after 2010, but was cancelled in 2009.

The visitor center has been the adjacent [[Space Center Houston]] since 1994; JSC Building 2 previously housed the visitor center.

The [[Johnson Space Center Heliport]] {{Airport codes|||72TX}} is located on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/72TX|title=AirNav: 72TX - Johnson Space Center Heliport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 3,200 civil servants, including 110 [[astronaut]]s, are employed at Johnson Space Center. The bulk of the workforce consists of over 11,000 [[General contractor|contractors]]. Over 15 contracting firms work at JSC; the largest was [[United Space Alliance]], which accounted for about 40% of the JSC employees. As of October 2014, Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies took over United Space Alliance's primary contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/july/nasa-awards-mission-operations-support-contract|title = NASA Awards Mission Operations Support Contract|date = 14 July 2014|accessdate = |website = NASA.gov|publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013, the center's 11th director is former astronaut [[Ellen Ochoa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2012/J12-020.html |title=Ochoa Named Johnson Space Center Director; Coats To Retire |author=NASA |accessdate=2013-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being [[Robert Gilruth]].

NASA's astronaut training is conducted at the Johnson Space Center. Astronaut candidates receive training on shuttle systems and in the basic sciences which include mathematics, guidance and navigation, oceanography, orbital dynamics, astronomy, and physics.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/factsheets/asseltrn.html |title= Astronaut Selection and Training |author=NASA |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates are required to complete military water survival prior to beginning their flying instruction. Candidates are also required to become [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] qualified for extravehicular training and are required to pass a swimming test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitzpatrick DT, Conkin J |title=Improved pulmonary function in working divers breathing nitrox at shallow depths |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med Abstract |volume=30 |issue=Supplement |year=2003 |pmid= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/1273 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fitzpatrick DT, Conkin J |title=Improved pulmonary function in working divers breathing nitrox at shallow depths |journal=Aviat Space Environ Med |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=763–7 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12862332 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/asma/asem/2003/00000074/00000007/art00011 |accessdate=2008-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; EVA training is conducted at the [[Sonny Carter Training Facility]].  Candidates are also trained to deal with emergencies associated with [[hyperbaric]] and [[hypobaric]] atmospheric pressures and are given exposure to the microgravity of space flight.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  Candidates maintain their flying proficiency by flying 15 hours per month in NASA's fleet of T-38 jets based at nearby Ellington Field.

{{Time-context|section|([[Space Shuttle]] training) that ended in August 2011|date=September 2011}}
Additionally, candidates practice Orbiter landings in the [[Shuttle Training Aircraft]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The astronauts begin their formal training program during their year of candidate training by reading manuals and by taking computer-based training lessons on the various orbiter systems. The training process includes practice with the single-systems trainer(SST) where the astronauts are trained to operate each orbiter system and to recognize malfunctions and perform corrective actions.

Following SST training, the astronauts begin training in the shuttle mission simulators (SMSs). The SMSs provide training of shuttle vehicle operations and systems tasks associated with the major flight phases. Astronauts begin their training in the SMSs using training software until they are assigned to a particular mission. Astronauts also train with the flight controllers in the Mission Control Center. The SMS and MCC are linked by computer in the same way the orbiter and MCC are linked during an actual mission.

==Research==
Johnson Space Center leads NASA's human spaceflight-related scientific and medical research programs. Technologies developed for spaceflight are now in use in many areas of [[medicine]], [[energy]], [[transportation]], [[agriculture]], [[communications]], and [[electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/167745main_FS_JSC508c.pdf |format=PDF|title=Johnson Space Center: Exploring the science of space for the future of Earth |author=NASA |accessdate=2008-08-27 |publisher=[[NASA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Bédier''' (28 January 1864 – 29 August 1938) was a French writer and scholar and historian of medieval France.

==Biography==
Bédier was born in [[Paris]], France to Adolphe Bédier, a lawyer of [[Brittany|Breton]] origin, and spent his childhood in [[Réunion]]. He was a professor of medieval French literature at the [[Université de Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]] (1889–1891) and the [[Collège de France]], Paris (c. 1893).

Modern theories of the ''[[fabliaux]]'' and the ''[[chansons de geste]]'' are based on two of Bédier's studies.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Bédier revived interest in several important old French texts, including ''[[Le roman de Tristan et Iseut]]'' (1900), ''[[La chanson de Roland]]'' (1921), and ''[[Les fabliaux]]'' (1893). He was a member of the [[Académie française]] from 1920 until his death.

His ''Tristan et Iseut'' was translated into [[Cornish language|Cornish]] by [[A. S. D. Smith]], into [[English language|English]] by [[Hilaire Belloc]] and [[Paul Rosenfeld]], and into [[German language|German]] by [[Rudolf G. Binding]]. In 2013, a new English translation by Edward J. Gallagher was published by Hackett Publishing Company.

Bédier was also joint editor of the two-volume ''[[Littérature française]]'', one of the most valuable modern general histories of French literature. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bédier died in [[Le Grand-Serre]], France. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Military diaries===
Bédier used the [[diary|diaries]] (''Kriegstagebücher'') of [[German people|German]] soldiers of different [[military rank]]s in [[World War I]] as a source for various articles dealing with what he describes as [[war crime|atrocities]] inflicted upon [[Belgian people|Belgian]] civilians and French soldiers. Some of these diaries had been kept for military reasons: in order to provide daily accounts of troop movements, orders, engagements, losses etc. Others were private diaries. From them Bédier connected together accounts of thirty-six incidents of what he saw as [[sexual crime|sexual]] and [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] crimes by the German soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Horne, John, and Alan Kramer.

'''The Kavli Institute for Cosmology''', [[Cambridge]] ('''KICC''') is a research establishment set up through collaboration of the [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|Kavli Foundation]]. It is operated by two of the University's astronomy groups: the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]] (IoA) and the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]].

==Background==
In August 2006 an agreement was reached between the University of Cambridge and the Kavli Foundation for the establishment of an Institute for [[cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kavlifoundation.org/kavli-news/university-cambridge-and-kavli-foundation-create-pioneering-new-research-center-examine-v| title=The University of Cambridge and The Kavli Foundation Create a Pioneering New Research Center to Examine the Very Beginnings of the Universe| accessdate=28 July 2012| date=1 November 2006| work=Kavli News |publisher=The Kavli Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kavli Foundation will support several 5-year senior research fellowships in perpetuity, and the University committed to provide a building to house the Institute. Operation began in October 2008 with the appointment of the first Kavli Institute Fellows. The building was completed in July 2009, and was officially opened 18 November 2009 by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] as [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor of the University]] in a ceremony with [[Fred Kavli]].

The director of the Institute is Roberto Maiolino; the deputy director is Anthony Challinor. The first director was [[George Efstathiou]] of the IoA.

==Projects==
KICC researchers are involved in the following projects:

* [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]]
* [[Dark Energy Survey]]
* [[Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument]]
* [[Extremely Large Telescope]]
* [[Illustris project]]
* [[James Webb Space Telescope]]
* KLEVER (Kmos LEnsed Velocity and Emission line Review)
* [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]]
* MaNGA sky survey
* MOONS galaxy survey
* Planck cosmological survey
* [[Square Kilometre Array]]
* [[Simons Observatory]]

==Kavli Building==

The Kavli Building is located adjacent to the Hoyle Building, the main building of the IoA. The two are connected via a raised walkway. The building was designed to encourage the occupants to interact with one another as well as with the occupants of the Hoyle building. It is intended to be similar in architectural style to the Hoyle Building, but to be sufficiently distinctive so as to retain an independent identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amarch.co.uk/architecture/kavli-institute-cosmology-cambridge| title=Kavli Institute: Architecture| accessdate=28 July 2012| date=2008|publisher=Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; The architects were Annand and Mustoe. The design includes use of ground source heat pumps and a heat exchanger serving under-floor heating to meet [[Cambridge City Council|City Council]] requirements that at least 10% of the building's energy is generated on-site.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3542">'''Low comedy''', in association to [[comedy]], is a dramatic or literary form of [[entertainment]] with no primary purpose but to create [[laughter]] by [[boasting]], boisterous jokes, [[drunkenness]], scolding, [[fighting]], [[buffoonery]] and other riotous activity.&lt;ref&gt;low comedy. (2013). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349662/low-comedy&lt;/ref&gt; It is also characterized by "horseplay", [[slapstick]] or [[farce]]. Other examples include one throwing a custard pie into another's face. This definition has also expanded to include lewd types of comedy that rely on physical jokes, for example, the [[wedgie]].

== History ==
This type of comedy has been a fixture ever since Greek plays.  Low comedy was first denoted as comedy for the commoners because it was most often practiced by street performers.  Over time as low comedy began to include lewd jokes and more physical comedy, more mainstream performers began to practice this type of comedy: [[stand-up comedians]], [[musicals]], etc.  This type of comedy also was employed in most [[cartoons]].

== Society ==
Low comedy in [[society]] is quite well known; it can be found in a wide range of [[mass media|media]], such as [[television]] and [[theatre]]. It can also be found in public and occupations, such as clowns, mimes and comedians. The term ''low'' is represented in association to [[low culture]]. This form of comedy is targeted and understood towards people who attain non-academic high school education, meaning this form of comedy is not restricted to high levels of education and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;.  Gans, H. J. (1975). Popular culture and high culture; an analysis and evaluation of taste. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Low comedy is well known and popular today because it is considered suitable for all individuals. This form of comedy connects to popular culture by its easy to understand style. 

Low comedy, however, has lacked appreciation from most of society and is looked down upon in contrast to [[high comedy]]. The sole purpose of low comedy is to evoke laughter in people. Because there is no contextual message in most forms of low comedy, it is not highly respected. This does not undermine the fact that it is still an effective form of comedy for its reputation to cause laughter.&lt;ref&gt;By, B. A. (1934, Jan 21). Salute to low comedy. New York Times (1923-Current File). Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/101030559&lt;/ref&gt; 

The classification of things considered to be low comedy constantly changes over time. As society changes, so do the ideas about what high and low comedy are. For example, due to the overdoing of [[sitcoms]] in the past, it is now considered shrill, vulgar, low society where everyone talk-screeches in some sub-human, mock-sophisticated language of incessant insult.&lt;ref&gt;Roush, M. (1995, Oct 30). Low comedy of 'high society'. USA TODAY. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/408705508&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=April 2014}}  Today, low comedy can be seen in almost any production. Sitcoms often base most of the plot on this type of comedy because of society influencing productivity and considering it a low form of comedy. Modern adaptations of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays also use low comedy to convey a different understanding of the play.

In the [[arts]], '''maximalism''', a reaction against [[minimalism]], is an esthetic of excess and redundancy. The philosophy can be summarized as "more is more", contrasting with the minimalist motto "less is more"&lt;ref&gt;http://mofa.cvatd.fsu.edu/resources/archive/pages/learning/resources/moreismore.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The term "maximalism" is sometimes associated with [[Postmodern literature|post-modern novels]], such as those by [[David Foster Wallace]] and [[Thomas Pynchon]], where digression, reference, and elaboration of detail occupy a great fraction of the text. It can refer to anything seen as excessive, overtly complex and "showy", providing redundant overkill in features and attachments, grossness in quantity and quality, or the tendency to add and accumulate to excess.

Novelist [[John Barth]] defines literary maximalism through the medieval Roman Catholic Church's opposition between "two...roads to grace:"
:the ''via negativa'' of the monkʹs cell and the hermitʹs cave, and the ''via affirmativa'' of immersion in human affairs, of being in the world whether or not one is of it. [[Critic]]s have aptly borrowed those terms to characterize the difference between Mr. [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], for example, and his erstwhile master [[James Joyce]], himself a maximalist except in his early works.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, John. “A Few Words About Minimalism”, ''New York Times Book Review'', p.1. Dec.
28, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Takayoshi Ishiwari elaborates on Barth's definition by including a [[postmodern]] approach to the notion [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]. Thus:
:Under this label come such writers as, among others, Thomas Pynchon and Barth himself, whose bulky books are in marked contrast with [[Donald Barthelme|Barthelmeʹs]] relatively thin novels and collections of short stories. These maximalists are called by such an epithet because they, situated in the age of [[epistemology|epistemological]] uncertainty and therefore knowing that they can never know what is authentic and inauthentic, attempt to include in their fiction everything belonging to that age, to take these authentic and inauthentic things as they are with all their uncertainty and inauthenticity included; their work intends to contain the maximum of the age, in other words, to be the age itself, and because of this their novels are often encyclopedic. As Tom LeClair argues in ''The Art of Excess'', the authors of these ʺ[[masterpiece|masterwork]]sʺ even ʺgather, represent, and reform the timeʹs excesses into fictions that exceed the timeʹs literary conventions and thereby master the time, the methods of fiction, and the readerʺ.&lt;ref&gt;Ishiwari, Takayoshi. ʺThe Body That Speaks: Donald Barthelmeʹs ''The Dead Father as Installation''ʺ, Unpublished Masterʹs thesis, p.1. Osaka University, 1996. [http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~KP7T-ISWR/ link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215128/http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~KP7T-ISWR/ |date=2011-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
In music, [[Richard Taruskin]] uses the term "maximalism" to describe the [[Modernism (music)|modernism]] of the period from 1890 to 1914, especially in German-speaking regions, defining it as "a radical intensification of means toward accepted or traditional ends".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Taruskin, Music in the Early Twentieth Century. Oxford History of Western Music 4 (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), p.&amp;nbsp;5.. {{ISBN|978-0-19-522273-9}} {{ISBN|978-0-19-516979-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been challenged, however, on the grounds that Taruskin uses the term merely as an "empty signifier" that is filled with "a range of musical features—big orchestration, motivic and harmonic complexity, and so on—that he takes to be typical of modernism".&lt;ref&gt;J. P. E. Harper-Scott, ''The Quilting Points of Musical Modernism: Revolution, Reaction, and William Walton''. Music in Context (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012), p.&amp;nbsp;22. {{ISBN|9780521765213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin, in any case, did not originate this sense of the term, which had been used by the mid-1960s with reference to Russian composers of the same period, of whom [[Sergei Prokofiev]] was "the last".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Cooper, ''Ideas and Music'' (London: Barrie &amp; Rockliffe, 1965): 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary maximalist music is defined by composer [[David A. Jaffe]] as that which "embraces heterogeneity and allows for complex systems of juxtapositions and collisions, in which all outside influences are viewed as potential raw material".&lt;ref&gt;Jaffe, David. “Orchestrating the Chimera—Musical Hybrids, Technology, and the Development of a 'Maximalist' Musical Style”, ''Leonardo Music Journal''. Vol. 5, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the music of [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Charles Ives]], and [[Frank Zappa]].&lt;ref&gt;Delville, Michel and Norris, Andrew. "Disciplined Excess: The Minimalist / Maximalist Interface in Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart", ''Interval(le)s'', p.4. Vol. I, 1 (Automne 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In a different sense, [[Milton Babbitt]] has been described as a "professed maximalist", his goal being, "to make music as much as it can be rather than as little as one can get away with".&lt;ref&gt;Milton Babbitt, ''Words about Music'', edited by Stephen Dembski and Joseph N. Straus (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1987), p.&amp;nbsp;183. Cited on p.&amp;nbsp;147 of Richard Kurth, (1994). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40213958 Untitled review of ''An Introduction to the Music of Milton Babbitt'' by Andrew Mead (1994)], ''Intégral'' Vol. 8 (1994), pp.&amp;nbsp;147–82 (Subscription access). A similar statement from five years earlier is found in ''Contemporary Music 1982 Catalogue'' (New York: C. F. Peters Corporation, 1982), 10: "the goal of attempting to make music as much as it might be, rather than as little as one obviously can get away with music's being", cited by Joseph Dubiel, "Three Essays on Milton Babbitt (Part Two)", ''Perspectives of New Music'' 29, no. 1 (Winter 1991): 90–122, citation on pp.&amp;nbsp;94 &amp; 119n13. A third citation is found in the sleeve notes to Milton Babbitt, ''Piano Works'', Robert Taub (piano), Harmonia Mundi LP HMC 5160, CD HMC 90 5160, Cassette HMC 405 160 (Los Angeles, Calif.: Harmonia Mundi U.S.A., 1986), cited by Dan Warburton on p. 142 of "A Working Terminology for Minimal Music", ''Intégral'' 2 (1988): 135–59.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Toop, on the other hand, considers that musical maximalism "is to be understood at least partly as 'antiminimalism'".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Toop, "On Complexity", ''Perspectives of New Music'' 31, no. 1 (Winter 1993): 42–57, citation on p.&amp;nbsp;54.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kanye West]]'s ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010) has also been described as a maximalist work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/revisiting-the-radical-black-fever-dream-of-kanye-wests-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-1122 |title=Revisiting the Radical Black Fever Dream of Kanye West's 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' |last=Josephs |first=Brian |publisher=''Vice'' |date=November 22, 2015 |accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caramanica, Jon (November 17, 2010).

==Visual arts==
Maximalism as a term in the [[plastic arts]] is used by art historian [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] to describe a group of artists, including [[Julian Schnabel]] and [[David Salle]], associated with the turbulent beginnings of [[Neo-expressionism]] in the late 1970s. These artist were in part "stimulated out of sheer despair with so long a diet of [[Minimalism|Reductivist Minimalism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pincus-Witten, "Gary Stephan: The Brief Against Matisse", In ''Talking Painting: Dialogues with Twelve Contemporary Abstract Painters'', edited by David Ryan, 208–20. Routledge Harwood Critical Voices (London and New York: Routledge, 2002), p.&amp;nbsp;219. {{ISBN|9780415276290}}&lt;/ref&gt; This maximalism was prefigured in the mid-1960s by certain psychoanalytically oriented paintings by [[Gary Stephan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Pincus-Witten, "Gary Stephan: The Brief Against Matisse", In ''Talking Painting: Dialogues with Twelve Contemporary Abstract Painters'', edited by David Ryan, 208–20. Routledge Harwood Critical Voices (London and New York: Routledge, 2002), p.&amp;nbsp;209. {{ISBN|9780415276290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte Rivers describes how "maximalism celebrates richness and excess in graphic design", characterized by decoration, sensuality, luxury and fantasy, citing examples from the work of illustrator [[Kam Tang]] and artist [[Julie Verhoeven]].&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, Charlotte (2008). ''Maximalism: The Graphic Design of Decadence&amp; Excess'', p.011. {{ISBN|2-88893-019-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[Gao Minglu]] connects maximalism in Chinese visual art to the literary definition by describing the emphasis on "the spiritual experience of the artist in the process of creation as a self-contemplation outside and beyond the artwork itself...These artists pay more attention to the process of creation and the uncertainty of meaning and instability in a work. Meaning is not reflected directly in a work because they believe that what is in the artist's mind at the moment of creation may not necessarily appear in his work." Examples include the work of artists, [[Cao Kai]], [[Ding Yi (artist)|Ding Yi]], [[Gu Dexin]] and [[Li Huasheng]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristin E.M. Riemer (October 9, 2003).

A '''narrative thread''', or '''plot thread''' (or, more ambiguously, a '''storyline'''), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] element or [[subplot]] in the [[Fiction|work of fiction]]. In this sense, each narrative thread is the [[narrative]] portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

By utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters  or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the [[suspension of disbelief]] and engages the reader into the story as it develops.

A classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the [[monomyth]], or [[hero's journey]], with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.

'''Nature''', in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

The word ''nature'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''natura'', or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".&lt;ref name="etymonline-nature"&gt;{{OEtymD|nature|accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Natura'' is a Latin translation of the Greek word ''[[physis]]'' (φύσις), which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the world develop of their own accord.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the pre-Socratic use of the concept of φύσις may be found in Naddaf, Gerard (2006) ''The Greek Concept of Nature'', SUNY Press. The word φύσις, while first used in connection with a plant in Homer, occurs very early in Greek philosophy, and in several senses. Generally, these senses match rather well the current senses in which the English word ''nature'' is used, as confirmed by Guthrie, W.K.C. ''Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'' (volume 2 of his ''History of Greek Philosophy''), Cambridge UP, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first known use of ''physis'' was by [[Homer]] in reference to the intrinsic qualities of a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. (So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its '''nature'''.) ''[[Odyssey]]'' 10.302–3 (ed. A.T. Murray). (The word is dealt with thoroughly in Liddell and Scott's ''[http://archimedes.fas.harvard.edu/pollux Greek Lexicon]''.) For later but still very early Greek uses of the term, see earlier note.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of nature as a whole, the physical [[universe]], is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the advent of modern [[scientific method]] in the last several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Newton's [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), for example, is translated "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", and reflects the then-current use of the words "[[natural philosophy]]", akin to "systematic study of nature"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The etymology of the word "physical" shows its use as a synonym for "natural" in about the mid-15th century: {{OEtymD|physical|accessdate=September 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and [[wildlife]]. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the [[Earth]]. It is often taken to mean the "[[natural environment]]" or [[wilderness]]—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things which can still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being understood as that which has been brought into being by a human [[consciousness]] or a human [[mind]]. Depending on the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the [[Wikt:unnatural|unnatural]] or the [[supernatural]].

Earth is the only [[planet]] known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the [[solar system]], it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest [[terrestrial planet]] and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow [[temperate]] zones, and a wide [[equator]]ial tropical to [[subtropical]] region.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions. The [[Crust (geology)|outer surface]] is divided into several gradually migrating [[tectonic plate]]s. The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and an iron-filled core that generates a [[magnetic field]]. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.

The [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = September 11, 2005|url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/09/050911103921.htm|title = Calculations favor reducing atmosphere for early Earth|work=[[Science Daily]]|accessdate = January 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology}}
Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the [[Earth]]. The field of geology encompasses the study of the composition, [[structural geology|structure]], [[Physical property|physical properties]], dynamics, and [[History of the Earth|history]] of [[Earth materials]], and the processes by which they are formed, moved, and changed. The field is a major [[academic discipline]], and is also important for [[mining|mineral]] and [[petroleum geology|hydrocarbon]] extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of [[natural hazard]]s, some [[Geotechnical engineering]] fields, and understanding [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]] and environments.

====Geological evolution====
[[File:Tectonic plate boundaries.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Three types of geological [[plate tectonic]] boundaries.]]
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and locations.

Rock units are first emplaced either by [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] onto the surface or intrude into the [[Country rock (geology)|overlying rock]]. Deposition can occur when [[sediment]]s settle onto the surface of the Earth and later [[lithification|lithify]] into [[sedimentary rock]], or when as [[volcanic rock|volcanic material]] such as [[volcanic ash]] or [[lava]] flows, blanket the surface. Igneous [[intrusion]]s such as [[batholith]]s, [[laccolith]]s, [[dike (geology)|dikes]], and [[sill (geology)|sills]], push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be [[deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] and/or [[metamorphism|metamorphosed]]. Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, [[extension (geology)|horizontal extension]], or side-to-side ([[strike-slip]]) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], [[divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], and [[transform boundary|transform boundaries]], respectively, between [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]].

Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a [[supercontinent]].

During the [[Neoproterozoic]] era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in [[glacier]]s and ice sheets. This hypothesis has been termed the "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the [[Cambrian explosion]] in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J.L. |last=Kirschvink |date=1992 |chapter=Late Proterozoic Low-Latitude Global Glaciation: The Snowball Earth |chapterurl=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~jkirschvink/pdfs/firstsnowball.pdf |title=The Proterozoic Biosphere |editor=J.W.

Several million years ago, a species of small African [[ape]] gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="Margulis1995" /&gt; The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further [[civilization]] allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.

==Atmosphere, climate, and weather==
[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|[[Rayleigh scattering|Blue light is scattered more]] than other wavelengths by the gases in the [[atmosphere]], giving the Earth a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space]]
{{Main|Atmosphere of Earth|Climate|Weather}}
The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the [[Nature#Ecosystems|ecosystem]]. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[water vapor]], with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The [[ozone layer]] plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the [[troposphere|lower part of the atmosphere]], and serves as a convective system for redistributing heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AJ4SnHbb-ZcC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Environmental Science: Problems, Connections and Solutions|last=Miller|first=G.|last2=Spoolman|first2=Scott|date=September 28, 2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0495383376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are another important factor in determining climate, particularly the major underwater [[thermohaline circulation]] which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the [[polar region]]s much colder.
[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|left|[[Lightning]]]]
Weather can have both beneficial and harmful effects. Extremes in weather, such as [[tornado]]es or [[hurricane]]s and [[cyclone]]s, can expend large amounts of energy along their paths, and produce devastation. Surface vegetation has evolved a dependence on the seasonal variation of the weather, and sudden changes lasting only a few years can have a dramatic effect, both on the vegetation and on the animals which depend on its growth for their food.

Climate is a measure of the long-term trends in the weather. Various factors are known to [[Climate change|influence the climate]], including ocean currents, surface [[albedo]], [[greenhouse gas]]es, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including [[ice age]]s.
[[File:Dszpics1.jpg|thumb|A tornado in central [[Oklahoma]]]]
The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially [[latitude]]. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the [[tropical climate]] at the equator to the [[polar climate]] in the northern and southern extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the [[Earth]]'s [[axis of rotation|axis]] being [[axial tilt|tilted]] relative to its [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the [[sun]]. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the [[northern hemisphere|northern]] and [[southern hemisphere|southern]] hemispheres experience opposite seasons.

Weather is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that is readily modified by small changes to the [[Natural environment|environment]], so accurate [[Meteorology|weather forecasting]] is limited to only a few days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=Harvey|last2=Davidson|first2=Noel|date=May 25, 2015|title=Trends in the skill of weather prediction at lead times of 1–14 days|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society|volume=141|issue=692|pages=2726–36|via=Wiley|doi=10.1002/qj.2559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, two things are happening worldwide: (1) temperature is increasing on the average; and (2) regional climates have been undergoing noticeable changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tropical Ocean Warming Drives Recent Northern Hemisphere Climate Change|publisher=Science Daily|date=April 6, 2001|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/04/010406073554.htm|accessdate=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceans===
[[File:Ocean from Leblon.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the Atlantic Ocean from [[Leblon]], Rio de Janeiro.]]
{{Main|Ocean}}
An ocean is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the [[World Ocean]] or global ocean.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.answers.com/Ocean#Encyclopedia Ocean]". ''The Columbia Encyclopedia.'' 2002. New York: Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNAoO"&gt;"[http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html Distribution of land and water on the planet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531103749/http://www.oceansatlas.com/unatlas/about/physicalandchemicalproperties/background/seemore1.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}".

The major oceanic divisions are defined in part by the [[continent]]s, various [[archipelago]]s, and other criteria: these divisions are (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the [[Southern Ocean]], and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, [[Headlands and bays|gulfs]], [[bay]]s and other names. There are also [[salt lake]]s, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the [[Aral Sea]] and the [[Great Salt Lake]].

===Lakes===
[[File:Lake mapourika NZ.jpeg|thumb|[[Lake Mapourika]], New Zealand]]
{{Main|Lake}}
A lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]] (or [[physical feature]]), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]] (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

====Ponds====
[[File:Mill Pond Sunset.jpg|thumb|The Westborough Reservoir (Mill Pond) in [[Westborough, Massachusetts]].]]
{{Main|Pond}}
A '''pond''' is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via [[current (stream)|current]] speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.

===Rivers===
[[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nile]] river in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]'s capital city]]
{{Main|River}}
A river is a natural [[watercourse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/river River {definition}] from Merriam-Webster. Accessed February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; usually [[freshwater]], flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply flows into the ground or dries up completely before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is ''Burn'' in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river is said to be larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm USGS – U.S. Geological Survey – FAQs], No. 17 What is the difference between mountain, hill, and [[Summit (topography)|peak]]; lake and pond; or river and [[stream|creek]]?&lt;/ref&gt; A river is part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater]] recharge, [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from [[glacier]]s).

===Streams===
[[File:Hawaii Creek.jpg|thumb|A rocky stream in [[Hawaii]]]]
{{Main|Stream}}
A stream is a flowing body of water with a [[Current (stream)|current]], confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s. In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide. Streams are important as conduits in the [[water cycle]], instruments in [[groundwater recharge]], and they serve as corridors for fish and [[wildlife]] migration. The biological [[habitat]] in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a [[riparian zone]]. Given the status of the ongoing [[Holocene extinction]], streams play an important [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] role in connecting [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] and thus in conserving [[biodiversity]]. The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology|fluvial geomorphology]], [[aquatic ecology]], [[Freshwater fish|fish biology]], [[riparian|riparian ecology]], and others.

{{Main|Ecology|Ecosystem}}
Ecosystems are composed of a variety of [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] components that function in an interrelated way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd Edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Introduction to the Ecosystem Concept |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9j.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated. Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem. Some of the more important components are: [[soil]], atmosphere, radiation from the [[sun]], water, and living organisms.
[[File:PenasBlancas, part of the Bosawas Reserve, Jinotega Department, Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|left|Peñas Blancas, part of the [[Bosawás Biosphere Reserve]]. Located northeast of the city of [[Jinotega]] in Northeastern Nicaragua.]]
Central to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s interact with every other element in their local [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;Odum, EP (1971) ''Fundamentals of ecology'', 3rd edition, Saunders New York&lt;/ref&gt; Within the ecosystem, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the [[food chain]], and exchange energy and [[matter]] between themselves as well as with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pidwirny |first=Michael |date=2006 |work=Fundamentals of Physical Geography (2nd edition) |title=Introduction to the Biosphere: Organization of Life |url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9d.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature [[dichotomy]] and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s5oRDUuMSIC&amp;pg=PA237|title=Biotechnology Fundamentals|last=Khan|first=Firdos Alam|date=2011-09-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1439820094|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A smaller unit of size is called a [[microecosystem]]. For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it. A ''macroecosystem'' might involve a whole [[ecoregion]], with its [[drainage basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey |first=Robert G. |date=April 2004 |title=Identifying Ecoregion Boundaries |journal=Environmental Management |volume=34 |pmid=15883869 |issue=Supplement 1 |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00267-003-0163-6 |pages=S14–26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lleZy8MU?url=http://www.fs.fed.us/institute/news_info/Identifying_ecoregion_boundaries.pdf |archivedate=December 4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wilderness===
[[File:Biogradska suma.jpg|thumb|[[Old-growth forest|Old growth]] [[European Beech]] forest in [[Biogradska Gora]] National Park, [[Montenegro]].]]
{{Main|Wilderness}}
'''Wilderness''' is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, [[:Category:national forests|national forests]], [[national park]]s, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], and solitude. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity,&lt;ref name="Man p155-157"&gt;Botkin, Daniel B. (2000) ''No Man's Garden'', Island Press, pp. 155–57, {{ISBN|1559634650}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to be an integral part of the Earth's self-sustaining natural [[ecosystem]] (the [[biosphere]]). They may also preserve historic [[genetics|genetic]] traits and that they provide [[habitat]] for wild [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] that may be difficult or impossible to recreate in [[zoo]]s, [[arboretum]]s, or [[laboratory|laboratories]].

==Life==
{{Life timeline}}
[[File:Malards in Golden Gate Park.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Female mallard and ducklings – [[reproduction]] is essential for continuing life]]
{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}
Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]], and [[reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=January 7, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made [[Artificial life|analogs of life]] may also be considered to be life.

The [[biosphere]] is the part of Earth's outer shell&amp;nbsp;– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere&amp;nbsp;– within which life occurs, and which [[Biology|biotic]] processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest [[Geophysiology|geophysiological]] point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the [[lithosphere]] (rocks), [[hydrosphere]] (water), and [[atmosphere]] (air). The entire Earth contains over 75&amp;nbsp;billion tons (150 ''trillion'' pounds or about 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kilograms) of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;The figure "about one-half of one percent" takes into account the following (See, e.g., {{cite book |last=Leckie |first=Stephen |date=1999 |chapter=How Meat-centred Eating Patterns Affect Food Security and the Environment |chapterurl=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html |title=For hunger-proof cities: sustainable urban food systems |publisher=International Development Research Centre |location=Ottawa |isbn=978-0889368828 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113020336/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-30610-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html }}, which takes global average weight as 60&amp;nbsp;kg.), the total human biomass is the average weight multiplied by the current human population of approximately 6.5&amp;nbsp;billion (see, ''e.g.'', {{cite web |title=World Population Information |url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/world.html |accessdate=September 28, 2006 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau }}): Assuming 60–70&amp;nbsp;kg to be the average human mass (approximately 130–150&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]] on the average), an approximation of total global human mass of between 390&amp;nbsp;billion (390×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) and 455&amp;nbsp;billion kg (between 845&amp;nbsp;billion and 975&amp;nbsp;billion lb, or about 423&amp;nbsp;million–488&amp;nbsp;million [[short ton]]s). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;kg (75&amp;nbsp;billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants and animals===
{{Main|Plant|Animal}}
[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|A selection of diverse [[plant species]]]]
[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|A selection of diverse [[animal species]]]]
Originally [[Aristotle]] divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' system, these became the [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] [[Vegetabilia]] (later [[Plantae]]) and [[Animal]]ia. Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the [[fungus|fungi]] and several groups of [[alga]]e were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=flora |url=http://webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=flora |work=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1998 |title=Status and Trends of the Nation's Biological Resources |chapter=Glossary |chapterurl=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |publisher=Department of the Interior, Geological Survey |location=Reston, VA |id=SuDocs No. I 19.202:ST 1/V.1-2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715060359/http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/zy198.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some classifications use the term ''bacterial flora'' separately from ''plant flora''.

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional [[flora]]s, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include ''fossil flora'', remnants&lt;br&gt; of plant life from a previous era. People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and [[terrain]].

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as ''native flora'' and ''agricultural and garden flora'', the lastly mentioned of which are intentionally grown and cultivated. Some types of "native flora" actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to another, and become an integral part of the native, or natural flora of the place to which they were introduced. This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered nature.

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for ''weeds''. Though the term has fallen into disfavor among [[botanist]]s as a formal way to categorize "useless" plants, the informal use of the word "weeds" to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of nature. Similarly, animals are often categorized in ways such as ''domestic'', ''farm animals'', ''wild animals'', ''pests'', etc. according to their relationship to human life.

Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] and usually [[multicellular]] (although see [[Myxozoa]]), which separates them from bacteria, [[archaea]], and most [[protist]]s. They are [[heterotroph]]ic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and [[alga]]e. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and [[fungus|fungi]] by lacking [[cell wall]]s.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two [[Phylum|phyla]] consisting of [[sponge]]s and [[placozoa]]ns—animals have bodies that are differentiated into [[biological tissue|tissues]]. These include [[muscle]]s, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a [[nervous system]], which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal [[digestion|digestive]] chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of [[collagen]] and elastic [[glycoprotein]]s. This may be calcified to form structures like [[Animal shell|shells]], [[bone]]s, and [[spicule (sponge)|spicules]], a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.

Although humans comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards. In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human [[civilization]] remains closely linked to changes in the environment. There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feedback Loops in Global Climate Change Point to a Very Hot 21st Century|publisher=Science Daily|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/ESD-feedback-loops.html|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made threats to the Earth's natural environment include pollution, [[deforestation]], and disasters such as oil spills. Humans have contributed to the [[extinction]] of many plants and animals.

Humans employ nature for both leisure and economic activities. The acquisition of natural resources for industrial use remains a sizable component of the world's economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|title=Natural Resources contribution to GDP|date=November 2014|website=World Development Indicators (WDI)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223080408/https://knoema.com/zscvyje/natural-resources-contribution-to-gdp|archive-date=December 23, 2014|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html|title=GDP – Composition by Sector|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|work=[[The World Factbook]]|accessdate=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some activities, such as hunting and fishing, are used for both sustenance and leisure, often by different people. [[Agriculture#History|Agriculture]] was first adopted around the [[9th millennium BCE]]. Ranging from food production to energy, nature influences economic wealth.

Although early humans gathered uncultivated plant materials for food and employed the medicinal properties of vegetation for healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nps.gov/plants/medicinal/plants.htm|title = Plant Conservation Alliance – Medicinal Plant Working Groups Green Medicine|publisher = US National Park Services |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; most modern human use of plants is through agriculture. The clearance of large tracts of land for crop growth has led to a significant reduction in the amount available of forestation and wetlands, resulting in the loss of habitat for many plant and animal species as well as increased erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Oosthoek|first = Jan|date = 1999|url = http://www.eh-resources.org/philosophy.html|title = Environmental History: Between Science &amp; Philosophy|publisher = Environmental History Resources|accessdate = December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics and beauty===
[[File:504px-Pinguiculagrandiflora1web.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Pinguicula grandiflora]]'', commonly known as a [[Butterwort]]]]
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and books, filling large sections of libraries and bookstores. That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much art, photography, poetry, and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and beauty. Reasons why this association exists, and what the association consists of, are studied by the branch of philosophy called [[aesthetics]]. Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as beautiful, the opinions are virtually endless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |title=On the Beauty of Nature |publisher=The Wilderness Society |accessdate=September 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909220214/http://www.wilderness.org/Library/Documents/Beauty_Quotes.cfm |archivedate=September 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world history. An early tradition of [[landscape art]] began in China during the [[Tang Dynasty art|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907). The tradition of representing nature ''as it is'' became one of the aims of [[Chinese painting]] and was a significant influence in Asian art.

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the [[Psalms]] and the [[Book of Job]], [[wilderness]] portrayals in art became more prevalent in the 1800s, especially in the works of the [[Romantic movement]]. [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] artists [[John Constable]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their paintings. Before that, paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human beings. [[William Wordsworth]]'s poetry described the wonder of the natural world, which had formerly been viewed as a threatening place. Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western culture.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.spacesfornature.org/greatspaces/conservation.html History of Conservation] BC Spaces for Nature. Accessed: May 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This artistic movement also coincided with the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]] in the Western world. A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word [[mimesis]], the imitation of nature. Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical [[Substantial form|forms]] and more generally by [[patterns in nature]]. As David Rothenburg writes, "The beautiful is the root of science and the goal of art, the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to see".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David |isbn=978-1608192168| date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|281}}

==Matter and energy==
[[File:Hydrogen Density Plots.png|thumb|The first few [[hydrogen atom]] [[Atomic orbital|electron orbitals]] shown as cross-sections with color-coded probability density]]
{{Main|Matter|Energy}}
Some fields of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "[[physics]]"&amp;nbsp;– the name for which is still recognizable as meaning that it is the study of nature.

Matter is commonly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the [[observable universe]]. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 percent of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent [[cold dark matter]] and 68.3 percent [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name="planck_overview"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Planck 2013 results. I.

The behavior of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined [[physical law]]s. These laws have been employed to produce [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe. The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty [[physical constant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Taylor|first = Barry N.|date = 1971|url = http://www.physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/introduction.html|title = Introduction to the constants for nonexperts|publisher = National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate = January 7, 2007

==Beyond Earth==

[[File:NGC 4414 (NASA-med).jpg|thumb|'''[[NGC 4414]]''' is a spiral galaxy in the constellation [[Coma Berenices]] about 56,000 [[light-year]]s in diameter and approximately 60 million light-years from [[Earth]]]]
{{Main|Outer space|Universe|Extraterrestrial life}}
Outer space, also simply called ''space'', refers to the relatively empty regions of the [[universe]] outside the [[atmosphere]]s of celestial bodies. ''Outer'' space is used to distinguish it from [[airspace]] (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the [[Solar System]] is called [[interplanetary space]], which passes over into [[interstellar medium|interstellar space]] at what is known as the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]].

Outer space is sparsely filled with several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]], [[cosmic microwave background radiation|blackbody radiation]] left over from the [[big bang]] and the origin of the universe, and [[cosmic ray]]s, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various [[subatomic particle]]s. There is also some gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and [[dust]], and small [[meteor]]s. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters the atmosphere periodically.

Although the Earth is the only body within the solar system known to support life, evidence suggests that in the distant past the planet [[Mars]] possessed bodies of liquid water on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Bibring, J |display-authors=etal|title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars Express data|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5772|pages = 400–04|date = 2006|pmid = 16627738|doi = 10.1126/science.1122659|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life. At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.
If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Tariq|last = Malik|date = March 8, 2005|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7129347/|title = Hunt for Mars life should go underground|publisher = Space.com via msnbc.msn.com |accessdate=September 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions on the other terrestrial planets, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the fourth-largest moon of [[Jupiter]], may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Turner, Scott |date = March 2, 1998|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/news8.html|title = Detailed Images From Europa Point To Slush Below Surface|publisher = NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomers have started to discover extrasolar [[Earth analog]]s – planets that lie in the [[habitable zone]] of space surrounding a [[star]], and therefore could possibly host life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Charles Q.

{{Orphan|date=June 2016}}

The '''Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program''' (OSNAP) is an international project designed to study the mechanistic link between [[water mass]] transformation at high [[latitude]]s and the [[meridional overturning circulation]] in the North Atlantic ([[Thermohaline circulation|AMOC]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buckley|first1=M|last2=Marshall|first2=J|title=Observations, inferences, and mechanisms of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: A review|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|volume=54|doi=10.1002/2015RG000493}}&lt;/ref&gt;) on interannual time scales.  Though this linkage is evident in climate models on decadal time scales, to date there has been no clear demonstration of AMOC variability in response to changes in deep water formation on interannual and decadal time scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozier|first1=M.S.|title=Overturning in the North Atlantic|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=4|pages=291–315}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OSNAP intends to fill that gap by providing a continuous record of the trans-basin fluxes of heat, mass and freshwater for a comparison to records of convective activity and water mass transformation at high latitudes in the North Atlantic.

The OSNAP observing system, fully deployed in the summer of 2014, consists of [[Mooring (oceanography)|moorings]], [[underwater glider|gliders]] and [[RAFOS float]]s spanning the [[Subarctic climate|subpolar]] North Atlantic from Labrador to Greenland to Scotland.  Measurement contributions come from the US, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, China and France. Vigorous boundary currents crossing the OSNAP line are directly measured in the [[Labrador Sea|Labrador]] and [[Irminger Sea]]s by [[current meter]] arrays, and over the eastern flank of the [[Reykjanes Ridge]] by deep arrays.  [[Geostrophic current]]s in the basin interior are estimated using temperature and [[salinity]] measurements from moorings and gliders.  The AMOC is calculated on the basis of the directly measured [[boundary current]]s, the geostrophic currents and the [[Ekman transport]]s estimated from the surface [[wind stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Meridional Overturning Circulation from the OSNAP array|url=http://www.o-snap.org/observations/technical-report/|website=www.o-snap.org|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with the [[Rapid Climate Change-Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array|RAPID/MOCHA]] array at 26⁰N, the EU THOR/NACLIM program and other observational elements, OSNAP will provide a comprehensive measure of the three-dimensional AMOC in the North Atlantic and an understanding of what drives its variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hand|first1=E|title=New scrutiny for a slowing Atlantic conveyor|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6287/751}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first OSNAP data products are expected in the fall of 2017.

{{about||the asteroid|2674 Pandarus|the sponge genus|Pandaros (sponge)}}
[[File:Kirk-TroilusCressidaAct1.jpg|thumb|Pandarus, centre, with Cressida, illustration to Troilus and Cressida by Thomas Kirk.]]
'''Pandarus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|n|d|ə|r|ə|s}} or '''Pandar''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|n|d|ər}} ([[Ancient Greek]]: Πάνδαρος ''Pándaros'') is a Trojan aristocrat who appears in stories about the [[Trojan War]]. 

In Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' he is portrayed as an energetic and powerful warrior, but in medieval literature he becomes a witty and licentious figure who facilitates the affair between [[Troilus]] and [[Cressida]]. 

In [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', he is portrayed as an aged degenerate and coward who ends the play by telling the audience he will bequeath them his "diseases".

==Classical literature==
In Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', Pandarus is a renowned archer and the son of Lycaon. Pandarus, who fights on the side of [[Troy]] in the [[Trojan War]], first appears in Book Two of the ''Iliad''. In Book Four, he is tricked by Athena, who wishes for the destruction of Troy, to shoot and wound [[Menelaus]] with an arrow, sabotaging a truce that could potentially have led to the peaceful return of [[Helen of Troy]]. He then attempts to kill [[Diomedes]] at close range, since Athena is protecting him from his deadly arrows, while [[Aeneas]] acts as his charioteer. [[Diomedes]] narrowly survives the attack, though, retaliating with a deadly blow that knocks Pandarus out of the chariot. Diomedes then pursues [[Aeneas]], who is saved by his mother [[Aphrodite (mythology)|Aphrodite]].

'''Pandarus''' is also the name of a companion of [[Aeneas]] in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. 

Pandarus is not to be confused with [[Pandareus]].

==Later literature==
Pandarus appears in ''[[Il Filostrato]]'' by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], in which he plays the role of a go-between in the relationship of his cousin Criseyde and the Trojan prince Troilus, the younger brother of Paris and Hector. Boccaccio himself derived the story from ''Le Roman De Troie'', by 12th-century poet [[Benoît de Sainte-Maure]]. This story is not part of [[Greek mythology|classical Greek mythology]]. Both Pandarus and other characters in the medieval narrative who carry names from the ''[[Iliad]]'' are quite different from Homer's characters of the same name.

In [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]’s poem ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' (1370), Pandarus plays the same role; though Chaucer's Pandarus is Criseyde's uncle, not her cousin.  Chaucer's Pandarus is of special interest because he is constructed as an expert rhetorician, who uses dozens of proverbs and proverbial sayings to bring the lovers Troilus and Criseyde together. When his linguistic fireworks fail at the end of the story, the proverb and human rhetoric in general are questioned as reliable means of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Sic et Non'': Zu Funktion und Epistemologie des Sprichwortes bei Geoffrey Chaucer,” ''Das Mittelalter: Perspektiven mediävistischer Forschung'' 2.2 (1997), 31-43.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Shakespeare]] used the medieval story again in his play ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' (1609).  Shakespeare's Pandarus is more of a bawd than Chaucer's, and he is a lecherous and degenerate individual.

In ''[[The Duke's Children]]'' by [[Anthony Trollope]] when the Duke of Omnium suspects Mrs Finn of encouraging his daughter's romance he refers to her as a 'she-Pandarus'.

In "The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea" by Yukio Mishima, Pandarus is mentioned briefly during an internal contemplation by the character Ryuji Tsukazaki.

==Pandering==
The plot function of the aging lech Pandarus in Chaucer's and Shakespeare's famous works has given rise to the English terms ''a pander'' (in later usage ''a panderer''), from Chaucer, meaning a person who furthers other people's illicit sexual amours; and ''to pander'', from Shakespeare, as a verb denoting the same activity. ''A panderer'' is, specifically, a bawd — a male who arranges access to female sexual favors, the manager of prostitutes.  Thus, in law, the charge of ''[[procuring (prostitution)|pandering]]'' is an accusation that an individual has sold the sexual services of another. The verb "to pander" is also used in a more general sense to suggest active or implicit encouragement of someone's weaknesses.

'''Passion Dust Intimacy Capsules''' are a [[novelty]] [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] product, introduced in 2017, that consists of capsules full of small, glittering particles that are intended to be inserted into the [[vagina]] before sex. The product is advertised as making the female genitalia "look, feel and taste soft, sweet and magical", but its use may carry serious health risks.&lt;ref name="The Independent 4 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Sarah|title=Don’t put glitter in your vagina, gynaecologists warn|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women-glitter-vaginas-trend-doctors-warn-health-candy-scent-passion-dust-pretty-woman-inc-discharge-a7822461.html|accessdate=12 July 2017|work=The Independent|date=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Passion Dust was invented by Lola-Butterflie Von-Kerius, an American who sells the product from her home via the Internet under the label '''Pretty Woman Inc.'''&lt;ref name="New York Post 5 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoffman|first1=Jenn|title=How a mother of three invented vaginal glitterbombs|url=https://nypost.com/2017/07/05/how-a-mother-of-three-invented-vaginal-glitterbombs/|accessdate=12 July 2017|work=New York Post|date=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to her website, the "passion dust" is made of [[gelatin]], [[starch]]-based edible [[glitter]], [[gum arabic]], [[zea mays]] starch and vegetable [[stearate]].&lt;ref name="Boston Herald 7 July 2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gynecologist warns against trendy glitter capsules that promise to give you a ‘sparkly, flavored orgasm’|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/lifestyle/health/2017/07/gynecologist_warns_against_trendy_glitter_capsules_that_promise_to_give_you|accessdate=12 July 2017|work=Boston Herald|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
Following reports of the [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] success of Passion Dust in 2017, [[gynecologist]]s interviewed by news media warned that the use of Passion Dust may carry serious health risks.&lt;ref name="Boston Herald 7 July 2017" /&gt; The particles may disturb the bacterial balance of the vagina, and the starch and gelatin they contain may encourage the growth of harmful bacteria and [[fungi]], which may cause [[infection]]s such as [[bacterial vaginosis]] or [[vaginal yeast infection]], and [[inflammation]] of the vagina.&lt;ref name="The Independent 4 July 2017" /&gt; The particles may scratch the [[vaginal mucosa]], allowing infection of the vaginal walls, and they may also migrate up through the [[cervix]] to cause similar damage to the lining of the [[uterus]].&lt;ref name="The Independent 4 July 2017" /&gt; The website of Pretty Woman Inc. states that the product is harmless.&lt;ref name="The Independent 4 July 2017" /&gt;

'''''Physica speculatio'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Universidad de Sevilla|title = Physica speculatio|url = http://fondosdigitales.us.es/fondos/libros/790/1/physica-speculatio/|work = Physica speculatio|language = latin|access-date = 11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a text of scientific character written by [[Alonso Gutiérrez|Alonso de la Vera Cruz]] in 1557 in the capital of [[New Spain]]. It was the first published work in the American continent that specifically addressed the study of physics, and was written to teach the students of the Real University of Mexico.

It introduced the main theoretical concepts of geocentric astronomy and references the [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moreno Corral|first1=M. A.|title=La physica speculatio, primer libro de física escrito y publicado en el continente americano|journal=Revista Mexicana de Física|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fray Alonso de la Vera Cruz published in the capital of New Spain a ''Course of Arts'', constituted in three volumes in Latin. The first form in 1553 under the title of ''Recognitio Summularum'', that had like purpose help to the students of the Real University of Mexico to understand the philosophy by means of the understanding of the formal logic. A year afterwards appeared the second called ''Dialectica Resolutio'', that was a continuation of the previous. The last was ''Physica speculatio''.

They did  four editions, the last 3 of which were for use of the salmantino students and were abbreviated versions of the Mexican one.

== Subjects ==
The ''Physica speculatio'' has by object the study or "investigation" -speculatio- and the exhibition, in general, of subjects of physics  on the nature -Physica-, treated by fray Alonso de la Vera Cruz basically from the philosophical perspective, charasteristic of Aristotle and traditional in the Half Age.

It talks about, in what can be considered like the first part, the subjects treated by [[Aristotle]] in the ''Eight books of physics'', as they are the essence of the physical or natural being, the movement and the infinite, the extension, the continuous, the space, the time, the first engine, etc. The second part treats of the subjects of the generation and the corruption of the living beings, of the mixed and composed being, of the primary qualities and of the elements and their properties. In the third part it exposes the doctrines on the meteors, it talks about the stars and their influence on humans, of the three regions of the air or atmosphere, of the comets, of the tides, of the ray and of a lot of other atmospheric phenomena. The fourth part devotes fray Alonso to comment the books ''De Anima'' by Aristotle. To end the ''Physica speculatio'', there are some reflections on the treatise ''De Caelo'' by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1 = Navarro|first1 = Bernabé|title = Filosofía y culturas novohispanas|date = 1998|publisher = Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|location = México|access-date = 11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal characteristics ==
It consists of 400 pages in paper, in which there are two columns that form 900 sheets in current transcription and nearly 1200 in translation to the Spanish.

It contains the following writings:
* ''Eight books of physics'';
* ''On Generation and Corruption'';
* ''On the meteors'';
* ''On the soul'';
* ''On the sky''.
Titled exactly like the Aristotelian works.

It contains added as appendix the ''Tractatus of Sphera'' of Giovanni Campano of Novara, written by this Italian astronomer in the 13th century, and printed for the first time in 1518.

== Structure and form ==
The main divisions in ''Books'' are in general the ones of the corresponding works of Aristotle.

Each book is divided in ''Speculations'' (particular studies), that can be understood as chapters.

The writing is presented according to the ''scholastic method'', proposing first the opinions or negative affirmations, contrary to the thesis that it will sustain, and afterwards the positive, with foundations and explanations.

The '''problem play''' is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in the arts, especially following the innovations of [[Henrik Ibsen]]. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context.&lt;ref name="Problem plays"&gt;[http://www.theatrelinks.com/problem-play/ Problem Play - ''Theatre Links'']&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Chris Baldick]] writes that the genre emerged "from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts." He summarises it as follows:

{{quote|Rejecting the frivolity of intricately plotted romantic intrigues in the nineteenth-century French tradition of the '[[well-made play]]', it favoured instead the form of the 'problem play', which would bring to life some contemporary controversy of public importance—women's rights, unemployment, penal reform, class privilege—in a vivid but responsibly accurate presentation.&lt;ref name = "cris"&gt;Chris Baldick, ''The Modern Movement: 1910-1940'', Oxford University Press, Oxford,  2004, p.116; 367&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The critic [[F. S. Boas]] adapted the term to characterise [[Shakespeare's problem plays|certain plays]] by [[William Shakespeare]] that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] dramas that do not fit easily into the classical [[Genre|generic]] distinction between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]].&lt;ref name="Problem plays" /&gt;

==Early "problem plays"==
While plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and [[satyr play]]s, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as [[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]].

==Shakespeare==
{{main|Shakespearean problem play}} 
[[F. S. Boas]] used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. He wrote that "throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome".&lt;ref&gt;F. S. Boas, ''Shakespeare and his Predecessors'', John Murray, Third Impression, 1910, pp. 344–408.&lt;/ref&gt; Later critics have used the term for other plays, including ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''.

==19th-century drama==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-1118-005, Berlin, "Gespenster".jpg|thumb|left|A performance of Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', one of the defining Problem plays,  in Berlin, 1983.]]
While social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]], who dealt with the subject of [[prostitution]] in ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]'' (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, "No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. Dickinson, ''An Outline of Contemporary Drama'', Houghton Mifflin, Boston, 1927, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer [[Henrik Ibsen]], whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in ''[[A Doll's House]]'' (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' (1882) and provincial greed in ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and other later dramatists.

==20th century==
The genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's ''[[Hindle Wakes (play)|Hindle Wakes]]'' (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This "resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction "the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment."&lt;ref name = "cris"/&gt;

In America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as [[Angelina Weld Grimké]]'s, ''Rachel''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Fehrenbach, "An Early Twentieth-Century Problem Play of Life in Black America: Angelina Grimké's ''Rachel''," in ''Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance'', ed. Joanne M. Braxton and Andree Nicola McLaughlin ( New Brunswick: Rutgers UP, 1990), pp. 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's ''Paragraph 218'' (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by [[Erwin Piscator]].&lt;ref&gt;Gary Fisher Dawson, ''Documentary Theatre in the United States: An Historical Survey and Analysis of Its Content, Form, and Stagecraft'', Greenwood Press, Westport, CT., 1999, p.126.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Quality of Government (QoG)-institute''' is an independent research institute at the [[University of Gothenburg]]. 

The institute was founded by Professors [[Bo Rothstein]] and [[Sören Holmberg]] in 2004 and is partly financed by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation ([[Riksbankens Jubileumsfond]]), the Swedish Science Council ([[Vetenskapsrådet]]), and the [[Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation]]. 

The main objective the QoG institute´s research is to address the theoretical and empirical problem of how political institutions of high quality can be created and maintained. Another objective is to study the effects of Quality of Government on a number of policy areas, such as health, the environment, social policy, and poverty. 

Since its start in 2004, the QoG institute has continuously gathered various data related to its research field. Since 2008, the institute has also conducted their own web surveys among experts in the public administration. Today, the survey comprises data from 1053 experts over 135 countries. All data is compiled in different databases and are free to download on the institute’s website. On the institute’s website, there is also a data visualization tool available that makes it possible to create interactive maps and scatter plots.

The QoG institute participates in a number of international research projects. During the years 2012-2017, the institute is coordinating a large scale research project - [http://anticorrp.eu ANTICORRP] - financed  by the [[European Commission]]s [[Seventh Framework Programme]].

Most of the scientific articles, reports, and working papers that are produced by the institutes’ researchers are free to download on the institute’s [http://www.qog.pol.gu.se/publications website].

The '''Research School for Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment''' ('''SENSE Research School''') is a joint venture for integrated environmental and sustainability research and multidisciplinary PhD training in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense.nl/ |title=SENSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school was accredited by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) during 1997-2006, was not accredited during 2007, and in 2007 had applied for reaccreditation by a revamped KNAW successor.&lt;ref name=accreditapp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wageningenur.nl/upload_mm/b/8/6/3754724b-117c-4638-8c37-def3408a80af_edepotlink_t4ee5e209_001.pdf |title=Request for Renewal of Accreditation, SENSE Research School, 2008 – 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reacccredited in 2008 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sense.nl/organisation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the program listed 80 Ph.D. courses.&lt;ref name=accreditapp/&gt;{{rp|4}}

In 2013, there were 600 Ph.D. students affiliated with the program.&lt;ref name=vetting&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-014-1145-9#/page-1 |journal=Climatic Change |title=Innovating the IPCC review process--the potential of young talent |author1=Lianne van der Veer |author2=Hans Visser |author3=Arthur Peterson |author4=Peter Janssen  |last-author-amp=yes |year=2014 |publisher=Springer |issue=2 |pages=137–148 |doi=10.1007/s10584-014-1145-9 |volume=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
It is based on a partnership between (departments of) eleven Dutch academic institutions (nine universities and two institutes):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sense.nl/organisation/partners "Partner institutes &amp; participating research groups"], SENSE website. Accessed: November 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
The program was to be subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Environment during 2007-2009 "for the specific purpose of organizing a process of knowledge exchange, which is dedicated to the determination of the 50 most pressing policy-relevant research questions related to environmental and climate change issues in the coming years."&lt;ref name=accreditapp/&gt;{{rp|12}}

The program's large number of Ph.D. students was used in an unusual way in 2013.  They were called upon for use in rapid vetting of a draft climatic change report in a crowd-sourcing mode.  The process initially sought participation students pursuing Ph.Ds in the Netherlands, and ended up obtaining 40 of them plus 50 Ph.D. students from elsewhere.  The students were distributed across 30 teams including at least one Dutch student per team, and the Dutch students earned educational credits plus "blooper bonus" pay and other incentives.&lt;ref name=vetting/&gt;

[[File:Slow sand filter profile.jpg|thumb|upright|A profile of slow sand filter used in a water purification plant.]]

'''Slow sand filters''' are used in [[water purification]] for treating [[raw water]] to produce a [[potable]] product. They are typically 1 to 2 metres deep, can be rectangular or cylindrical in cross section and are used primarily to treat surface water. The length and breadth of the tanks are determined by the flow rate desired by the filters, which typically have a loading rate of 200 to 400 litres per hour per square metre (or 0.2 to 0.4 cubic metres per square metre per hour).

Slow sand filters differ from all other filters used to treat drinking water in that they work by using a complex biological film that grows naturally on the surface of the sand. The sand itself does not perform any filtration function but simply acts as a substrate, unlike its counterparts for UV and pressurized treatments. Although they are often  preferred technology in many developing countries because of their low energy requirements and robust performance, they are also used to treat water in some developed countries, such as the [[UK]], where they are used to treat water supplied to [[London]]. Slow sand filters now are also being tested for pathogen control of nutrient solutions in hydroponic systems.

== History ==

[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of [[cholera]] cases in the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak|London epidemic of 1854]].]]

The first documented use of [[sand filter]]s to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in [[Paisley, Scotland]], John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf2.pdf|title=Filtration of water supplies|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchan, James. (2003). Crowded with genius: the Scottish enlightenment: Edinburgh's moment of the mind. New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; This method was refined in the following two decades by engineers working for private water companies, and it culminated in the first treated public water supply in the world, installed by engineer [[James Simpson (engineer)|James Simpson]] for the [[Chelsea Waterworks Company]] in London in 1829.&lt;ref name="History of the Chelsea Waterworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/1859map/chelsea_waterworks_a2.html|title=BRIEF HISTORY DURING THE SNOW ERA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christman, Keith. (1998). The history of chlorine. Waterworld, 14 (8), 66-67.&lt;/ref&gt; This installation provided filtered water for every resident of the area, and the network design was widely copied throughout the [[United Kingdom]] in the ensuing decades.

The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] during the [[1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak]]. Snow was sceptical of the then-dominant [[miasma theory]] that stated that diseases were caused by noxious "bad airs". Although the [[germ theory of disease]] had not yet been developed, Snow's observations led him to discount the prevailing theory. His 1855 essay ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'' conclusively demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic in [[Soho]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87 |title=Concepts and Practice of Humanitarian Medicine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the use of a [[dot distribution map]] and statistical proof to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases. His data convinced the local council to disable the water pump, which promptly ended the outbreak.

The [[Metropolis Water Act 1852|Metropolis Water Act]] introduced the regulation of the [[water supply]] companies in [[London]], including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. The Act "made provision for securing the supply to the Metropolis of pure and wholesome water", and required that all water be "effectually filtered" from 31 December 1855.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to make better Provision respecting the Supply of Water to the Metropolis'', (15 &amp; 16 Vict. C.84)&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up with legislation for the mandatory inspection of water quality, including comprehensive chemical analyses, in 1858. This legislation set a worldwide precedent for similar state public health interventions across [[Europe]]. The [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] was formed at the same time, water filtration was adopted throughout the country, and new water intakes on the [[Thames]] were established above [[Teddington Lock]].

Water treatment came to the United States in 1872 when [[Poughkeepsie, NY]] opened the first slow sand filtration plant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=George|title=PRESENT DAY WATER FILTRATION PRACTICE|journal=American Water Works Association|date=March 1914|volume=1|issue=1|page=31|jstor=41224153}}&lt;/ref&gt; dramatically reducing instances of cholera and typhoid fever which had been seriously impacting the local community. Poughkeepsie's design criteria were used throughout the country as a model for other municipalities. Poughkeepsie's original treatment facility operated continuously for 87 years before being replaced in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History {{!}} Poughkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility|url=http://pokwater.com/history/|website=pokwater.com|publisher=Poughkeepsies' Water Treatment Facility|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==

[[File:Slow sand filter room.jpg|thumb|The raw water is let in to the filter room slowly from the pipe on the right. The water will pass through the sand layers down to the bottom of this room. The Schmutzdecke layer can be observed in this picture.]]

Slow sand filters work through the formation of a gelatinous layer (or [[biofilm]]) called the [[hypogeal]] layer or ''[[Schmutzdecke]]'' in the top few millimetres of the fine sand layer.  The ''Schmutzdecke'' is formed in the first 10–20 days of operation&lt;ref name=cawst&gt;Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology, Biosand Filter Manual: Design, Construction, &amp; Installation," July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and consists of [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[protozoa]], [[rotifera]] and a range of aquatic insect larvae. As an epigeal biofilm ages, more algae tend to develop and larger aquatic organisms may be present including some [[bryozoa]], [[Mollusca|snails]] and [[Annelid]] worms. The surface biofilm is the layer that provides the effective purification in potable water treatment, the underlying sand providing the support medium for this biological treatment layer. As water passes through the hypogeal layer, particles of foreign matter are trapped in the mucilaginous matrix and soluble organic material is [[adsorbed]]. The contaminants are metabolised by the bacteria, fungi and protozoa. The water produced from an exemplary slow sand filter is of excellent quality with 90-99% bacterial cell count reduction.&lt;ref name=ndwc&gt;National Drinking Water Clearinghouse (U.S.), Morgantown, WV. [http://www.nesc.wvu.edu/pdf/DW/publications/ontap/tech_brief/TB15_SlowSand.pdf "Slow Sand Filtration."] Tech Brief Fourteen, June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slow sand filters slowly lose their performance as the biofilm thickens and thereby reduces the rate of flow through the filter. Eventually, it is necessary to refurbish the filter. Two methods are commonly used to do this. In the first, the top few millimetres of fine sand is scraped off to expose a new layer of clean sand. Water is then decanted back into the filter and re-circulated for a few hours to allow a new biofilm to develop. The filter is then filled to full volume and brought back into service.&lt;ref name="ndwc" /&gt; The second method, sometimes called wet harrowing, involves lowering the water level to just above the hypogeal layer, stirring the sand; thus precipitating any solids held in that layer and allowing the remaining water to wash through the sand. The filter column is then filled to full capacity and brought back into service. Wet harrowing can allow the filter to be brought back into service more quickly.&lt;ref name="cawst" /&gt;

== Features ==

[[File:Slow sand filter EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Typical configuration of a housed slow sand filter system]]

[[File:Vsakovací nádrže umělé infiltrace v ÚV Káraný.jpg|thumb|[[Artificial infiltration]] works on the principles of slow sand filters]]

Slow [[sand filter]]s have a number of unique qualities:

# Unlike other filtration methods, slow sand filters use biological processes to clean the water, and are non-pressurized systems. Slow sand filters do not require chemicals or electricity to operate.
# Cleaning is traditionally done by use of a mechanical scraper, which is usually driven into the filter bed once the bed has been dried out. However, some slow sand filter operators use a method called "wet harrowing", where the sand is scraped while still under water, and the water used for cleaning is drained to waste.
# For municipal systems there usually is a certain degree of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], since it is desirable for the maximum required throughput of water to be achievable with one or more beds out of service.
# Slow sand filters require relatively low [[turbidity]] levels to operate efficiently. In summer conditions with high microbial activity and in conditions when the [[raw water]] is turbid, blinding of the filters due to [[bioclogging]] occurs more quickly and pre-treatment is recommended.
# Unlike other water filtration technologies that produce water on demand, slow sand filters produce water at a slow, constant flow rate and are usually used in conjunction with a storage tank for peak usage. This slow rate is necessary for healthy development of the biological processes in the filter.&lt;ref name="EPA1990"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)(1990). Cincinnati, OH. [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=300048WU.txt "Technologies for Upgrading Existing or Designing New Drinking Water Treatment Facilities."] Document no. EPA/625/4-89/023.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–41}}&lt;ref name="HDR"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Public Water Systems |last=HDR Engineering |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York |isbn=978-0-471-29211-1 |page=353 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieg7lvujyt0C&amp; |accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many municipal [[water treatment]] works will have 12 or more beds in use at any one time, smaller communities or households may only have one or two filter beds.

In the base of each bed is a series of [[Brickwork#Herringbone bond|herringbone]] drains that are covered with a layer of pebbles which in turn is covered with coarse gravel. Further layers of sand are placed on top followed by a thick layer of fine sand. The whole depth of filter material may be more than 1 metre in depth, the majority of which will be fine sand material. On top of the sand bed sits a supernatant layer of unpurified water.

== Advantages ==

* As they require little or no mechanical power, chemicals or replaceable parts, and they require minimal operator training and only periodic maintenance, they are often an [[appropriate technology]] for poor and isolated areas.
* Slow sand filters, due to their simple design, may be created [[DIY]]. DIY-slow sand filters have been used in Afghanistan and other countries to aid the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://learn.tearfund.org/en/resources/publications/footsteps/footsteps_31-40/footsteps_35/the_household_slow_sand_filter/ DIY slow sand filter]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Slow sand filters are recognized by the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf/en/|title=WHO - Slow sand filtration|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406214600/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssf/en/|archivedate=6 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxfam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-ecentre.net/resources/e_library/doc/11-WATER.pdf|title=UNHCR eCentre|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316064200/http://www.the-ecentre.net/resources/e_library/doc/11-WATER.PDF|archivedate=16 March 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/safewater/regs/swtrsms.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; as being superior technology for the treatment of surface water sources. According to the World Health Organization, "Under suitable circumstances, slow sand filtration may be not only the cheapest and simplest but also the most efficient method of water treatment."

== Disadvantages ==

* Due to the low filtration rate, slow sand filters require extensive land area for a large municipal system.&lt;ref name="EPA1990" /&gt; Many municipal systems in the U.S. initially used slow sand filters, but as cities have grown they subsequently installed [[rapid sand filter]]s, due to increased demand for drinking water.

{{Sex and the Law}}
A '''sodomy law''' is a law that defines certain [[Human sexual activity|sexual acts]] as [[Sex and the law|crimes]]. The precise sexual acts meant by the term ''[[sodomy]]'' are rarely spelled out in the law, but are typically understood by courts to include any sexual act deemed to be "unnatural" or immoral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Weeks | first = Jeff | title =Sex, Politics and Society: The Regulation of Sexuality Since 1800 | publisher = Longman Publishing Group |date=January 1981 | location = London | isbn = 0-582-48334-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodomy typically includes [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]], and [[zoophilia|bestiality]].&lt;ref name="Phelps"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shirelle Phelps|title=World of Criminal Justice: N-Z|publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale Group]]|year=2001|page=686|isbn =0787650730|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=izwvAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.&amp;dq=World+of+Criminal+Justice:+N-Z.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheb"&gt;{{cite book|authors=John Scheb, John Scheb, II|title=Criminal Law and Procedure|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2013|page=185|isbn =128554613X|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VZoWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Newton|title=Gay and Lesbian Rights: A Reference Handbook, Second Edition|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2009|page=85|isbn =1598843079|accessdate=January 13, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gjcUFK4RZNcC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, sodomy laws have rarely been enforced against [[heterosexual]] couples, and have mostly been used to target [[homosexuals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/unnatural-law| title=Unnatural Law |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan |date=2003-03-24 |work=The New Republic |accessdate=2009-11-27 |quote=Since the laws had rarely been enforced against heterosexuals, there was no sense of urgency about their repeal.}} (Or {{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sullivan|title=Unnatural Law |journal=The New Republic |volume=228 |issue=11 |date=2003-03-24}})&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2016, 72 countries as well as five sub-national jurisdictions{{efn| These five sub-national jurisdictions are: the provinces of Aceh and South Sumatra (Indonesia), the Cook Islands (New Zealand), Gaza (Palestine) and Marawi City (the Philippines).}} have laws criminalizing homosexuality,&lt;ref name="ILGA"/&gt; with most of them located in the [[Muslim world]]. In 2006 that number was 92.&lt;ref name="ILGA"/&gt;
In 2011, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] passed an [[LGBT rights]] resolution, which was followed up by a report published by the UN Human Rights Commissioner which included scrutinisation of the mentioned codes.

{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}

===Criminalization===
The Middle [[Assyria]]n Law Codes (1075 BC) state: If a man has intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a [[eunuch]]. This is the earliest known law condemning the act of male-to-male intercourse in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/1075assyriancode.html|title=The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Republic]], the ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|freeborn male minor]]. The law may also have been used to prosecute male citizens who willingly played the [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|passive role in same-sex acts]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; John Boswell, ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68; Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; The law was mentioned in literary sources but enforced infrequently; [[Domitian]] revived it during his program of judicial and moral reform.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Butrica, "Some Myths and Anomalies in the Study of Roman Sexuality," in ''Same-Sex Desire and Love in Greco-Roman Antiquity and in the Classical Tradition'' (Haworth Press, 2005), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. For [[Male sexuality in ancient Rome|adult male citizens]] to experience and act on homoerotic desire was considered natural and permissible, as long as their partner was a male [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|of lower social standing]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), p. 225, and "Not before Homosexuality: The Materiality of the ''cinaedus'' and the Roman Law against Love between Men," ''Journal of the History of Sexuality'' 3.4 (1993), p. 525.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pederasty in ancient Rome]] was acceptable only when the younger partner was a [[Prostitution in ancient Rome|prostitute]] or [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slave]].

Most sodomy related laws in [[Western civilization]] originated from the growth of Christianity during [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref name="Gaylaw"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=BZTnDgeygHkC&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=history%20of%20sodomy%20laws%20Christianity&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20sodomy%20laws%20Christianity&amp;f=false | title=Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Eskridge, William N. | year=2009 | page=161| isbn=9780674036581 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that today some [[LGBT-affirming Christian denominations|Christian denominations]] allow [[gay marriage]] and the ordination of [[Ordination of LGBT Christian clergy|gay clergy]].&lt;ref name="GayChurch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaychurch.org/affirming-denominations/ | title=Affirming Denominations | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 12th Century, the Roman Catholic Church launched a massive campaign against sodomites, especially homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ha9GgWNmy0C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;lpg=PA372&amp;dq=fourth%20lateran%20council%20homosexuality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MLMEl8q-Gm&amp;sig=F6FJzjwOj8hpSANdMT1Hil77MKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjx4K6N-qvQAhUKK8AKHZvRDjUQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=fourth%20lateran%20council%20homosexuality&amp;f=false|title=The Origins and Role of Same-Sex Relations in Human Societies|first=James|last=Neill|date=27 October 2008|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the years 1250 and 1300, homosexual activity was radically criminalized in most of Europe, even punishable by death.&lt;ref&gt;John Boswell, Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality (1980) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] introduced the first legislation under English criminal law against sodomy with the [[Buggery Act of 1533]], making [[buggery]] punishable by [[hanging]], a penalty not lifted until 1861.

Following Sir [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|work=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|title=Book the Fourth – Chapter the Fifteenth: Of Offences Against the Persons of Individuals|accessdate=2006-08-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907230432/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/blackstone/bk4ch15.htm|archivedate=7 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crime of sodomy has often been defined only as the "abominable and detestable crime against nature", or some variation of the phrase.  This language led to widely varying rulings about what specific acts were encompassed by its prohibition.

===Decriminalization===
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (which was replaced by prison and hard labour).

In [[France]], it was the French Revolutionary penal code (issued in 1791) which for the first time struck down "sodomy" as a crime, decriminalizing it together with all "victimless-crimes" (sodomy, heresy, witchcraft, blasphemy), according with the concept that if there was no victim, there was no crime. The same principle was held true in the [[French Penal Code of 1810|Napoleon Penal Code]] in 1810, which was imposed on the large part of Europe then ruled by the [[French Empire (1804–1815)|French Empire]] and its cognate kings, thus decriminalizing sodomy in most of Continental Europe.

In 1830, Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil]] signed a law into the Imperial Penal Code. It eliminates all references to sodomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazzil.com/blamar00.htm ''Beyond Carnival'']. Green, James. [[The University of Chicago Press]]. 1999. {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ottoman Empire]], homosexuality was decriminalized in 1858 as part of wider reforms during the [[Tanzimat]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faith-matters.org/images/stories/fm-publications/the-tanzimat-final-web.pdf|title=The Tanzimat: Secular Reforms in the Ottoman Empire|author=Ishtiaq Hussain|publisher=Faith Matters|date=15 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=25 January 2015 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death penalty was not lifted in England and Wales until 1861.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution led by [[V.I. Lenin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Russia]] legalized homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hazard |first1=John N. |title=Unity and Diversity in Socialist Law |journal=Law and Contemporary Problems |publisher=Duke Law |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=270–290 |url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3056&amp;context=lcp |accessdate=21 Jan 2015 |doi=10.2307/1190515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power in 1920's, these laws were reversed until homosexuality was effectively made illegal again by the government.&lt;ref&gt;West, Green.

Our laws proceed from the principle of protection of society and therefore countenance punishment only in those instances when juveniles and minors are the objects of homosexual interest ... while recognizing the incorrectness of homosexual development ... our society combines prophylactic and other therapeutic measures with all the necessary conditions for making the conflicts that afflict homosexuals as painless as possible and for resolving their typical estrangement from society within the collective
:—Sereisky, ''Great Soviet Encyclopedia'', 1930, p. 593&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] (1918–1938), there was a movement to repeal sodomy laws. It has been claimed that this was the first campaign to repeal anti-gay laws that was spearheaded primarily by heterosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Himl |first1=Pavel |title=Oponentský posudek rigorózní práce Jana Seidla „Úsilí o odtrestnění homosexuality za první republiky“ |url=https://is.muni.cz/th/64594/ff_r/hi_seidl_himl.txt |accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the publishing of the [[Wolfenden report]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], which asserted that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence", many western governments, including many U.S. states, have repealed laws specifically against homosexual acts. However by 2003, 13 U.S. states still criminalized homosexuality, along with many Missouri counties, and the territory of Puerto Rico, but in June 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' that [[U.S. state|state]] laws criminalizing private, non-commercial sexual activity between consenting adults at home on the grounds of morality are unconstitutional since there is insufficient justification for intruding into people's liberty and privacy.

As of 2018, sodomy related laws have been repealed or judicially struck down in all of Europe, North America, and South America, except for Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

There have never been Western-style sodomy related laws in the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, North Korea, South Korea, or Vietnam. Additionally, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia were part of the French colony of [[French Indochina|'Indochine']]; so if there had been any laws against male homosexual acts in those countries, they would have been dismantled by French colonial authorities, since male homosexual acts have been legal in France and throughout the French Empire since the issuing of the aforementioned French Revolutionary penal code in 1791.

===Criminalization in modern days===
This trend among Western nations has not been followed in all other regions of the world (Africa, some parts of Asia, Oceania and even western countries in the Caribbean Islands), where sodomy often remains a serious crime. For example, male homosexual acts, at least in theory, can result in life imprisonment in Barbados and Guyana.

In Africa, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Mauritania, Sudan, and some parts of Nigeria and Somalia.  Male and sometimes female homosexual acts are minor to major criminal offences in many other African countries; for example, life imprisonment is a prospective penalty in Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Uganda. A notable exception is South Africa, where same-sex marriage is legal.

In Asia, male homosexual acts remain punishable by death in Brunei, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Additionally, life imprisonment is the formal penalty for male homosexual acts in Bangladesh, the Maldives, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Qatar. But anti-sodomy laws have been repealed in Israel (which recognises but does not perform same-sex marriages), Japan, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, and Thailand.

== Sodomy-related legal positions by country ==

=== Australia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Australia}}

Upon colonisation in 1788, Australia inherited laws from the United Kingdom including the [[Buggery Act]] of 1533.  These were retained in the criminal codes passed by the various colonial parliaments during the 19th century, and by the state parliaments after [[Federation]].&lt;ref name=carbery&gt;{{cite journal |last=Carbery |first=Graham |title=Towards Homosexual Equality in Australian Criminal Law: A Brief History |year=2010 |edition=2nd |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.alga.org.au/files/towardsequality2ed.pdf |publisher=Australian Lesbian and Gay Archives Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Wolfenden report]], the [[Don Dunstan|Dunstan]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government introduced a ''consenting adults in private'' type legal defence in South Australia in 1972. This defence was initiated as a bill by Murray Hill, father of former [[Defence Minister]] [[Robert Hill (Australian politician)|Robert Hill]], and repealed the state's sodomy law in 1975.  The [[Campaign Against Moral Persecution]] during the 1970s raised the profile and acceptance of Australia's gay and lesbian communities, and other states and territories repealed their laws between 1976 and 1990. The exception was [[Tasmania]], which retained its laws until the [[Government of Australia|Federal Government]] and the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] forced their repeal in 1997.

Male homosexuality was decriminalised in the [[Australian Capital Territory]] in 1976, then [[Norfolk Island]] in 1993, following South Australia in 1975 and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1981. At the time of legalization (for the above), the age of consent, rape, defences, etc. were all set gender-neutral and equal {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Western Australia legalised male homosexuality in 1989 – Under the ''Law Reform (Decriminalization of Sodomy) Act 1989'', as did [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] in 1984 with unequal ages of consent of 18 for [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] and 21 for Western Australia. Then since 1997, the states and territories that retained different ages of consent or other vestiges of sodomy laws have tended to repeal them later; Western Australia did so in 2002, and [[New South Wales]] and the [[Northern Territory]] did so in 2003. [[Tasmania]] was the last state to decriminalise sodomy, doing so in 1997 after the groundbreaking cases of [[Toonen v Australia]] and [[Croome v Tasmania]] (it is also notable that Tasmania was the first jurisdiction to recognize same-sex couples in Australia since 2004 under the ''Relationships Act 2003''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/tas/consol_act/ra2003173/|title=RELATIONSHIPS ACT 2003|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In 2016 Queensland became the final Australian jurisdiction to equalise its [[age of consent]] for all forms of sexual activity at 16 years, after reducing the age of consent for [[anal sex]] from 18 years.&lt;ref name="archaic-end"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Gail|title=Queensland lowers anal sex consent age to 16, ending 'archaic' law|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/queensland-standardises-age-of-consent-laws-anal-sex/7850112|accessdate=17 September 2016|work=ABC News|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=15 September 2016|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Brazil|Legal status of homosexuality in Brazil}}
Brazilian criminal law does not punish any sexual act performed by consenting adults, but allows for prosecution, under statutory rape laws, when one of the participants is under 14 years of age and the other an adult, as per Articles 217-A of the Brazilian Penal Code. Pedophilic acts are also criminalized by the Children and Teenager Statute, in articles 241-A to 241-E.
Article 235 of the Brazilian Military Criminal Code – DL 1.001/69-, however, does incriminate any contact deemed to be libidinous,  be it of a homosexual nature or not, made in any location subject to military administration. Since the article is entitled ''Of pederasty or other libidinous acts'', gay rights advocates claim that, since the Brazilian armed forces are composed almost exclusively of males,  the article allows for witch-hunts against homosexuals in the military service. This article of the Military Criminal Code is under scrutiny by the Brazilian Supreme Court (ADPF 291).

=== Canada ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Canada}}
Before 1859, the [[Province of Canada]] prosecuted sodomy under the English Buggery Act.  In 1859, the Province of Canada enacted its own [[buggery]] law in the Consolidated Statutes of Canada as an offence punishable by death.  Buggery remained punishable by death until 1869.  A broader law targeting all homosexual male sexual activity ("gross indecency") was passed in 1892, as part of a larger update to the criminal law of the new dominion of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code, 1892, SC 1892, c 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Changes to the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'' in 1948 and 1961 were used to brand gay men as "criminal sexual psychopaths" and "dangerous sexual offenders."  These labels provided for indeterminate prison sentences.  Most famously, [[George Klippert]], a homosexual, was labelled a dangerous sexual offender and sentenced to life in prison, a sentence confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/4738/index.do?r=AAAAAQAFeW91dGgAAAAAAAAB|title=Klippert v. The Queen - SCC Cases (Lexum)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released in 1971.

Sodomy was decriminalized after the ''[[Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968-69]]'' (Bill C-150) received royal assent on June 27, 1969. The offences of buggery and "gross indecency" were still in force, however the new act introduced exemptions for married couples, and any two consenting adults above the age of 21 regardless of gender or sexual orientation. The bill had been originally introduced in the House of Commons in 1967 by then Minister of Justice [[Pierre Trudeau]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Journals of the House of Commons |volume=CXV |year=1968–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; who famously stated that "there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Pierre Trudeau |date=1967-12-21 |title=The CBC Digital Archives Website |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/politics/rights_freedoms/clip/2671/|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revisions to the ''Criminal Code'' in 1987 repealed the offence of "gross indecency", changed "buggery" to "anal intercourse" and reduced the age exemption from 21 to 18.&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Canada Evidence Act'', R.S.C. 1985 (3d Supp.), c. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 159 of the ''Criminal Code'' continues to criminalize anal sex, with exemptions for husbands and wives, and two consenting parties above the age of 18, provided no more than two people are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#docCont|title=Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46)|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=23 April 2012|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent [[case law]] has held that section 159 is [[constitutionality|unconstitutional]], thus anal sex is ''de facto'' legal between any two or more [[Consent to sexual activity|consenting]] persons above the [[age of consent]] (16). In the 1995 [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] case ''R. v. M. (C.)'' the judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional on the basis that the specific exemptions based on marital status and age infringed on the [[social equality|equality rights]] guaranteed by [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 15]] of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and constituted discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/legal/youth.sodomy.law.ruling.txt |title=Ontario Youth Sodomy Law Ruling |date= |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar decision was made by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in the 1998 case ''R. v. Roy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/1998/1998canlii12775/1998canlii12775.html|title=CanLII - 1998 CanLII 12775 (QC CA)|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 decision regarding a case in which three people were engaged in sexual intercourse. The [[Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta]] declared section 159 in its entirety to be null, including the provisions criminalizing the act when more than two persons are taking part or present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2002/2002abqb145/2002abqb145.html|title=R. v.

[[New Democratic Party|NDP]] [[member of parliament|MP]] [[Joe Comartin]] introduced [[private member's bill]]s in 2007 and 2011 to repeal section 159 of the ''Criminal Code'', however neither passed first reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=2896522&amp;File=4|title=Bill C-438: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (consent)|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=4952816&amp;File=4|title=Bill C-628: An Act to amend the Criminal Code (consent)|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 2016, the [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]]  [[Jody Wilson-Raybould]] introduced a bill to repeal section 159 of the ''Criminal Code''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=8592169|title=Bill C-32: An Act related to the repeal of section 159 of the Criminal Code|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===

Consensual sex between two same-sex adults was decriminalized in 1999. It is still banned if one of the persons is below the age of 18, however, even though the age of consent is 14.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.derecho.uchile.cl/cej/rej14/ABR%20VVAA%20_4_x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in China}}
Sodomy was never explicitly criminalized in China. The [[Chinese Supreme Court]] ruled in 1957 that voluntary sodomy was not a criminal act.&lt;ref name=zhlaw&gt;http://www.law-lib.com/Law/law_view.asp?id=1218 最高人民法院关于成年人间自愿鸡奸是否犯罪问题的批复&lt;/ref&gt; Private sex in any form between two consenting adults does not violate laws.

In a notable case in 2002, a man who had anal intercourse with a teenager was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

=== Denmark ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Denmark}}
In 1933 Denmark became the third country in Europe to fully legalize homosexuality. The age of consent has been set at 15 since 1977.

=== France ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in France}}
Since the [[Penal Code of 1791]], France has not had laws punishing homosexual conduct ''per se'' between over-age consenting adults in private. However, other qualifications such as "offense to good mores" were occasionally retained in the 19th century ''(see [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]])''.

In 1960, a [[:fr:Amendement Mirguet|parliamentary amendment]] by {{ill|Paul Mirguet|fr}} added homosexuality to a list of "social scourges", along with alcoholism and prostitution. This prompted the government to increase the penalties for public display of a sex act when the act was homosexual. [[transvestism|Transvestites]] or homosexuals caught [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] were also the target of police repression.

In 1981, the 1960 law making homosexuality an aggravating circumstance for public indecency was repealed.  Then in 1982, under president [[François Mitterrand]], the law from 1942 ([[Vichy France]]) making the age of consent for homosexual sex higher (18) than for heterosexual sex (15) was also repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=19820805&amp;numTexte=&amp;pageDebut=02502&amp;pageFin=|title=Fac-similé JO du 05/08/1982, page 02502 - Legifrance|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the vocal opposition of [[Jean Foyer]] in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.assemblee-nationale.fr/7/cri/1981-1982-ordinaire1/153.pdf Proceedings of the National assembly], 2nd sitting of 20 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Germany}}
[[Paragraph 175]], which punished "[[fornication]] between men", was eased to an [[age of consent]] of 21 in [[East Germany]] in 1957 and in West Germany in 1969.  This age was lowered to 18 in the East in 1968 and the West in 1973, and all legal distinctions between [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] acts were abolished in the East in 1988, with this change being extended to all of Germany in 1994 as part of the process of [[German Reunification]].

In modern [[German language|German]], the term ''Sodomie'' has a meaning different from the [[English language|English]] word "[[:wiktionary:sodomy|sodomy]]": it does not refer to anal sex, but acts of [[Zoophilia]]. The change occurred mostly in the middle of the 19th century, at least in the last decade of the century. Only the moral theology of the Roman Catholic church changed not until some time after World War II to the term ''homosexuality''.

=== Gibraltar ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Gibraltar}}
In [[Gibraltar]], a [[British overseas territories|British overseas territory]], male homosexual acts (but not heterosexual anal sex) have been decriminalised in [[Gibraltar]] since 1993, where the age of consent was 18 higher for male homosexual acts. Then under a Supreme Court decision in April 2011, the age of consent became 16, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21474 |title=Judge rules: age of consent is 16 for all |work=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]] |date=9 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327061200/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21474 |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, under the same decision heterosexual anal sex was also decriminalised as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21486 |title=Sex debate women's group demands referendum in bid to raise consent age |work=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]] |date=12 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327061214/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=21486 |archivedate=27 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, the new gender-neutral ''Crimes Act 2011'' was approved, which sets an equal age of consent of 16 regardless of sexual orientation, and reflects the decision of the Supreme Court in statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=22526 |title=Age of consent, 16, framed in law |work=[[Gibraltar Chronicle]] |date=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103130416/http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=22526 |archivedate=3 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
{{main article|LGBT rights in Hong Kong}}
"Homosexual Buggery". Before 2014, according to the [[Crimes Ordinance]] Section 118C,&lt;ref&gt;CRIMES ORDINANCE, Chapter 200, Section 118C, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118c-19970630.html.html Homosexual buggery with or by man under 21], hklii.hk&lt;/ref&gt; both of the two men must be at least 16 to commit homosexual buggery legally or otherwise both of them can be liable to life imprisonment.  [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118f-19970630.html.html Sect 118F] states that committing homosexual buggery not privately is also illegal and can be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

"Heterosexual Buggery". A man who commits buggery with a girl under 21 can also be liable for life imprisonment ([http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118d.html Sect 118D]) while no similar laws concerning committing heterosexual buggery in private exist.

In 2005, Judge Hartmann found these 4 laws: Sect 118C, 118F, [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118h.html 118H], and [http://www.hklii.hk/eng/hk/legis/ord/200/s118j.html 118J] were discriminatory towards gay males and unconstitutional under the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and contrary to the Bill of Rights Ordinance in a judicial review filed by a Hong Kong resident.  It was believed that the age of consent had been reduced from 21 to 16 for any kind of homosexual sex acts. In 2014, the ordinance was amended according to the judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/egazettedownload?EGAZETTE_PDF_ID=11146 |title=Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance 2014 |publisher=Elegislation.gov.hk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hungary ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Hungary}}
[[Homosexuality]] in Hungary was decriminalized in 1962, [[Paragraph]] 199 of the [[Hungarian Penal Code]] from then on threatened "only" adults over 20 who engaged themselves in a consensual same-sex relationship with an underaged person between 14 and 20. Then in 1978 the age was lowered to 18. Since 2002, by the ruling of the [[Constitutional Court of Hungary]] repealed Paragraph 199 – Which provided an equal age of consent of '''14''', regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender. Since 1996, the ''Unregistered Cohabitation Act 1995'' was provided for any couple, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation and from 1 July 2009 the ''Registered Partnership Act 2009'' becomes effective, and provides a registered partnership just for same-sex couples – since that opposite-sex already have marriage, this would in-turn create duplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |title=UK Gay News - Gay and Lesbian Marriage, Partnership or Unions Worldwide |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jitR7T5A?url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/marriage_timeline.htm |archivedate=12 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iceland ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Iceland}}
Homosexuality has been legal in Iceland since 1940, but equal age of consent was not approved until 1992. [[Civil union]] was legalised by [[Alþingi]] in 1996 with 44 votes pro, 1 con, 1 neutral and 17 not present. Those laws were changed to allow adoption and [[artificial insemination]] for [[lesbians]] 27 June 2006 among other things. [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Same-sex marriage]] was legalised in 2010.

=== India ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in India}}
India inherited sodomy laws in its criminal code from the [[British Raj]], which were not present in its history of codified or customary legal system before. That section of Indian law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, called for a maximum punishment of life imprisonment for all ''carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal'' (primarily interpreted to be homosexuality, especially sodomy, including between consenting adults). This law had rarely been executed, if at all, in case of consenting adults, although sometimes was in the news when a homosexual rapist was apprehended. Police repression in alleged or real gay bars is common, and is often highlighted by the contemporary media.

On 2 July 2009, in the case of ''[[Naz Foundation v. Govt. of NCT of Delhi|Naz Foundation v National Capital Territory of Delhi]]'', the High Court of Delhi struck down much of S. 377 of the IPC as being unconstitutional. The Court held that to the extent S. 377 criminalised consensual non-vaginal sexual acts between adults, it violated an individual's fundamental rights to equality before the law, freedom from discrimination and to life and personal liberty under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the [[Constitution of India]]. The High Court did not strike down S. 377 completely – it held the section was valid to the extent it related to non-consensual non-vaginal intercourse or to intercourse with minors – and it expressed the hope that Parliament would soon legislatively address the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/21/india-gay-rights-law|title=A New Law for India's Sexual Minorities|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=21 July 2009|author=Yuvraj Joshi|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India does not recognize same-sex unions of any type. On December 11, 2013, the Supreme Court of India overturned the ruling in Naz Foundation v. National Capital Territory of Delhi, effectively re-criminalizing homosexual activity until action was taken by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=J. |last=Venkatesan|title=Homosexuality illegal: SC|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/homosexuality-not-legal-sc/article5446939.ece|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 12th July 2018 a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court of India started hearing a review petition over its 2013 judgment. Then on 6 September 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the part of S. 377 criminalizing consensual homosexual activities, but upheld that other aspects of S. 377 criminalizing unnatural sex with minors and animals will remain in force.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sc-delivers-historic-verdict-section-377-gone-being-gay-no-more-a-crime-in-india/articleshow/65696771.cms?from=mdr|title=Section 377: SC rewrites history, homosexual behaviour no longer a crime|last=Rautray|first=Samanwaya|date=2018-09-06|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Iran}}
Sodomy is illegal in Iran and is punishable by death.

=== Israel ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Israel}}
The State of Israel inherited its sodomy ("buggery") law from the legal code of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], but it was never enforced against homosexual acts that took place between consenting adults in private. In 1963, the Israeli Attorney-General declared that these laws would not be enforced. However, in certain criminal cases, defendants were convicted of "sodomy" (which includes [[oral sex]]), apparently by way of plea bargains; they had originally been indicted for more serious sexual offenses.

In the late 1960s, the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] ruled that these laws could not be enforced against consenting adults. Though unenforced, these laws remained in the penal code until 1988, when they were formally repealed by the [[Knesset]]. The [[age of consent]] for both heterosexuals and homosexuals is 16 years of age.

=== Italy ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Italy}}
In 1786 [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany]], abolishing [[death penalty]] for all crimes, became not only the first Western ruler to do so, but also the first ruler to abolish death penalty for sodomy (though this was replaced with other sentences such as terms in prison or of hard labour).

The Code Napoléon made sodomy legal between consenting adults above the legal age of consent in all Italy except in the Kingdom of Sardinia, the Austria-ruled Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, and the Papal states.

In the newborn (1860) [[Kingdom of Italy]], Sardinia extended its legal code on the whole of Northern Italy, but not in the South, which made homosexual behaviour legal in the South and illegal in the North. However the first Italian penal code (Codice Zanardelli, 1889), decriminalised same-sex intercourse between consenting adults above the legal age of consent for all regions. A law that has not changed since it was enacted.

=== Japan ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Japan}}

In the [[Meiji Period]], sex between men was punishable under the sodomy laws announced in 1872 and revised in 1873. This was changed by laws announced in 1880 ([[:ja:同性愛#同性愛に関する法と政治|同性愛に関する法と政治]]). Since that time no further laws criminalizing homosexuality have been passed.

=== Macau ===
{{main article|LGBT rights in Macau}}
In [[Macau]], according to the [[Código Penal de Macau]] (''Penal Code of Macau'') [https://web.archive.org/web/20080502021527/http://www.imprensa.macau.gov.mo/bo/I/95/46/codpenpt/codpen0101.asp Article 166 &amp; 168], committing anal coitus with whomever under the age of 17 is a crime and shall be punished by imprisonment of up to 10 years (committing with whoever under 14) and 4 years (committing with whoever between 14 and 16) respectively.

=== Malaysia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Malaysia}}
Sodomy is illegal in Malaysia, however still being practiced in private. The sodomy laws are sometimes enforced using Section 377 of the [[Penal Code (Malaysia)|Penal Code]] which prohibit [[carnal intercourse]] against the order of nature.

{{quote|Any person who has sexual connection with another person by the introduction of the penis into the anus or mouth of the other person is said to commit carnal intercourse against the order of nature.}}

The age of consent in Malaysia is 16. Punishment for voluntarily committing carnal intercourse against the order of nature shall be up to twenty years [[imprisonment]] and [[flagellation|whipping]] while committing the same offences but without consent, shall be punished by no less than five years imprisonment and whipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

There was the notable case involving [[Anwar Ibrahim]], former [[Leader of the Opposition (Malaysia)|Leader of the Opposition]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] who was convicted of sodomy crime under Section 377B of the Penal Code. However, it is debatable how the sodomy law can be enforced consistently.

In [[Mauritius]], sodomy is illegal.

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in New Zealand}}

New Zealand inherited the United Kingdom's sodomy laws in 1854.
The Offences Against The Person Act of 1867 changed the penalty of buggery from execution to life imprisonment for "Buggery".  In 1961 in a revision of the Crimes Act, the penalty was reduced to a maximum of 7 years between consenting adult males.

Homosexual sex was legalised in New Zealand as a result of the passage of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Act|Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986]]. The age of consent was set at 16 years, the same as for heterosexual sex.

Since 4 September 2007 two out of the three territories of New Zealand ([[Niue]] and [[Tokelau]]) legalized homosexuality with an equal age of consent as well by the [http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/legis/consol_act/naa2007146.pdf Niue Amendment Act 2007]. [[Cook Islands]] meanwhile still has a sodomy law on the books [http://www.paclii.org/ck/legis/num_act/ca196982/ Crimes Act (1969), s153 and a155].

=== Norway ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Norway}}
Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in Norway since 1972. At the same time of legalization, the age of consent became equal regardless of gender or sexual orientation, at 16.

=== Poland ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Poland}}
Poland is one of the few countries where homosexuality has never been considered a crime. Forty years after Poland [[Partitions of Poland|lost its independence]], in 1795, the sodomy laws of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] came into force in the occupied Polish lands. Poland retained these laws after independence in 1918, but they were never enforced, and were officially abandoned in 1932.

=== Russia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Russia}}
In the past, in Russia sexual activity between males was criminalized by state law on March 4, 1934. Sexual activity between females was not mentioned in the law. On May 27, 1993, homosexual acts between consenting males were decriminalized.

=== Serbia ===
{{Main article|LGBT rights in Serbia}}
The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia later restricted the offense in 1959 to only apply to homosexual anal intercourse; but with the maximum sentence reduced from 2 to 1 year imprisonment. In 1994, male homosexual sexual intercourse was officially decriminalised in the [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Republic of Serbia]], a part of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[age of consent]] was set at 18 years for anal intercourse between males and 14 for other sexual practices. An equal age of consent of 14 was later introduced on 1 January 2006, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.

Despite the abolition of sodomy as a crime, the [[Sexual Offences Act, 1957]] set the [[age of consent]] for same-sex activities at 19, whereas for opposite-sex activities it was 16.

[[Sodomy]] was historically known in England and Wales as '''[[buggery]]''', and is usually interpreted as referring to anal intercourse between two males or a male and a female. In England and Wales buggery was made a [[felony]] by the [[Buggery Act]] in 1533, during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. The punishment for those convicted was the death penalty until 1861 in England and Wales, and 1887 in Scotland. [[James Pratt and John Smith]] were the last two to be executed for sodomy in 1835. A lesser offence of "attempted buggery" was punished by 2 years of jail and some time on the [[pillory]]. In 1885, Parliament enacted the [[Labouchere Amendment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/englaw.html|title=The Law in England, 1290–1885|accessdate=2006-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited ''gross indecency'' between males, a broad term that was understood to encompass most or all male homosexual acts. Following the [[Wolfenden report]], sexual acts between two adult males, with no other people present, were made legal in [[England and Wales]] in 1967, in Scotland in 1980, [[Northern Ireland]] in 1982, [[Crown Dependency|UK Crown Dependencies]] [[Guernsey]] in 1983, [[Jersey]] in 1990 and [[Isle of Man]] in 1992.

In the 1980s and 1990s,  [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|gay rights]] organizations made attempts to equalize the [[age of consent]] for heterosexuals and homosexuals, which had previously been 21 for homosexuals but only 16 for heterosexual acts. Efforts were also made to modify the "no other person present" clause so that it dealt only with minors. In 1994, Conservative MP [[Edwina Currie]] introduced an amendment to Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill which would have lowered the age of consent to 16. The amendment failed, but a compromise amendment which lowered the age of consent to 18 was accepted. The July 1, 1997 decision in the case ''[[Sutherland v. United Kingdom]]'' resulted in the [[Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000]] which further reduced it to 16, and the "no other person present" clause was modified to "no minor persons present". Today, the universal age of consent is 16 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2008/510/contents/made|title=Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (Commencement) Order 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United Kingdom on 2 February 2009 (prior to that, the age of consent for both heterosexuals and homosexuals was 17).

In September 1995, Zimbabwe's parliament introduced legislation banning homosexual acts.&lt;ref name="ZIB"/&gt; In 1997, a court found [[Canaan Banana]], Mugabe's predecessor and the first President of Zimbabwe, guilty of 11 counts of sodomy and indecent assault.&lt;ref name="BANANAtrial"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN9042016264&amp;id=PFvYzAUheGkC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;ots=0hbU6n9tV1&amp;dq=Canaan+Banana+homosexual&amp;sig=2cfQK_-ufIaV-egJ-ob6Wfu2kkQ Page 93] ''Body, Sexuality, and Gender v. 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Banana's trial proved embarrassing for Mugabe, when Banana's accusers alleged that Mugabe knew about Banana's conduct and had done nothing to stop it.&lt;ref name="bananadeath"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/zimbabwe/article/0,2763,1082496,00.html Canaan Banana, president jailed in sex scandal, dies] ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Banana fled Zimbabwe only to return in 1999 and served one year in prison for his homosexual acts. Banana was also stripped of his priesthood.

'''Therapy freedom''' is the freedom of [[physicians]] to apply whichever therapy their medical knowledge makes them believe to be appropriate. That often means:
# Physician have the [[legal right]] to prescribe an unlicensed drug.
# A [[health insurance company]] is obliged to pay for the treatment, regardless of whether or not it considers the treatment to be appropriate.

Therapy freedom, however, is limited to cases of no treatment existing that is both well-established and more [[efficacious]].

Therapy freedom is established in [[Germany]], where it is known as ''[[:de:Therapiefreiheit|Therapiefreiheit]]''.

'''Venom-induced consumption coagulopathy''' (VICC) is a medical condition caused by the effects of some [[snake]] and caterpillar [[venom]]s on the blood. Important [[coagulation factors]] are activated by the specific [[serine protease]]s in the venom and as they become exhausted [[coagulopathy]] develops.

== Summary ==
In a world of [[Unemployment|non-work]], ruined by human-created [[climate change]] and [[pollution]], and where people are under [[surveillance]] and ruled over by a mega-rich [[elite]], Hubert, Etc, his friend Seth, and Natalie, decide that they have nothing to lose by turning their backs and walking away from the everyday world or "default reality".&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

With the advent of [[3D printing]] – and especially the ability to use these to fabricate even better fabricators – and with machines that can search for and reprocess waste or discarded materials, they no longer have need of Default for the basic essentials of life, such as food, clothing and shelter.&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

As more and more people choose to "walkaway", the ruling elite do not take these social changes sitting down. They use the military, police and [[mercenaries]] to attack and disrupt the walkaways' new [[Intentional communities|settlements]].&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

One thing that the elite are especially interested in is scientific research that the walkaways are carrying out which could finally put an end to death – and all this leads to revolution and eventual war.&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WalkAway" /&gt;

== Reception ==
Writing on ''[[NPR]]'' online, Jason Sheehan is of the opinion that Doctorow's writing is "super weird in the best possible way."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

The reviewer says that ''Walkaway'' is a remarkable "story of a utopia in progress, as messy as every new thing ever is, told in the form of people talking to each other, arguing with each other and working together to solve problems. It's all about the deep, disturbing, recognizable weirdness of the future that must come from the present we have already made for ourselves, trying to figure out what went wrong and what comes next."&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt;

In ''[[The Verge]]'', Adi Robertson writes: "''Walkaway'' imagines a future shaped by the same problems and possibilities Doctorow's been playing with for years: the threat of ubiquitous surveillance and artificial scarcity, and the promise that almost any technology can be repurposed and turned against its creator".&lt;ref name="the_verge" /&gt;

Robertson goes on to say that "one of Doctorow's core themes in ''Walkaway'' is subverting what he described as the popular 'man against man against nature' pulp plot."&lt;ref name="the_verge" /&gt;

In ''[[Ars Technica]]'', Sean Gallagher writes that "the future is open source in this optimistic sci-fi disaster epic full of big ideas."&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt; He and Doctorow see ''Walkaway'' as a prequel to the author's debut novel ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]''.&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;

Gallagher concludes that ''Walkaway'' "shows us a world trying to make things right after having made all the wrong decisions about how to use technology. But Walkaway executes that move beautifully. And like all great performances, it's worth witnessing over and over again."&lt;ref name="ars_technica" /&gt;

It is an online service that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from externally sourced "curated data",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About Wolfram{{!}}Alpha: Making the World's Knowledge Computable|url = http://www.wolframalpha.com/about.html|website=wolframalpha.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a [[search engine]] might.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/09/search-engine-google |title=British search engine 'could rival Google' |last=Johnson |first=Bobbie |date=March 9, 2009 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |location=UK |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Users submit queries and computation requests via a text field.  Wolfram Alpha then computes answers and relevant visualizations from a [[knowledge base]] of [[Data curation|curated]], [[structured data]] that come from other sites and books. The site "use[s] a portfolio of automated and manual methods, including statistics, visualization, source cross-checking, and expert review."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data in Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/faqs5.html |website=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curated data makes Alpha different from [[semantic search]] engines, which index a large number of answers and then try to match the question to one.

Wolfram Alpha can only provide robust query results based on computational facts, not queries on the social sciences, cultural studies or even many questions about history where responses require more subtlety and complexity. It is able to respond to particularly-phrased [[natural language understanding|natural language]] fact-based questions such as "Where was [[Mary Robinson]] born?" or more complex questions such as "How old was [[Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1974?" It displays its "Input interpretation" of such a question, using standardized phrases such as "age | of Queen Elizabeth II (royalty) | in 1974", the answer of which is "Age at start of 1974: 47 years", and a biography link. Wolfram Alpha does not answer queries which require a narrative response such as "What is the difference between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars?" but will answer factual or computational questions such as "June 1 in Julian calendar".

Mathematical symbolism can be parsed by the engine, which typically responds with more than the numerical results. For example, "lim(x-&gt;0) (sin x)/x" yields the correct [[limit (functions)|limit]]ing value of 1, as well as a plot, up to 235 terms ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) of the [[Taylor series]], and (for registered users) a possible derivation using [[L'Hôpital's rule]]. It is also able to perform calculations on data using more than one source. For example, "What is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|fifty-second smallest]] country by [[GDP per capita]]?" yields [[Nicaragua]], $1160 per year.

Wolfram Alpha is written in 15 million lines of [[Wolfram Language]] code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WolframResearch |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56ISaies6Ws#t=927s |title=Stephen Wolfram: The Background and Vision of Mathematica |publisher=Youtube.com |date=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and runs on more than 10,000 CPUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Frederic |last=Lardinois |url=http://readwrite.com/2009/04/25/wolframalpha_our_first_impressions |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha: Our First Impressions |date=April 25, 2009 |publisher=ReadWriteWeb |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wolfram |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/05/15/wolframalpha-is-launching-made-possible-by-mathematica/ |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Is Launching: Made Possible by ''Mathematica'' |work=WolframAlpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database currently includes hundreds of datasets, such as "All Current and Historical Weather."

One example of a live dataset that Wolfram Alpha can use is the profile of a [[Facebook]] user, through inputting the "facebook report" query. If the user authorizes Facebook to share his or her account details with the Wolfram site, Alpha can generate a "personal analytics" report containing the age distribution of friends, the frequency of words used in status updates and other detailed information.&lt;ref name=techland&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas E. |last=Weber |url=http://techland.time.com/2012/09/05/wolfram-alphas-facebook-analytics-tool-digs-deep-into-your-social-life/ |title=Wolfram Alpha's Facebook Analytics Tool Digs Deep into Your Social Life |work=Tech |publisher=Time Magazine |date=September 5, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two weeks of launching the Facebook analytics service, 400,000 users had used it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=R. |first=A. |title=Visualising Facebook Who am I? |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2012/09/visualising-facebook |publisher=The Economist |work=Graphic detail |date=September 21, 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downloadable query results are behind a pay wall but summaries are accessible to free accounts.&lt;ref name=publiclibraries&gt;{{cite web |url=http://publiclibrariesonline.org/2013/03/a-wolf-or-a-ram-what-is-wolfram-alpha/ |title=A Wolf or a Ram?

== Licensing partners ==
Wolfram Alpha has been used to power some searches in the [[Microsoft]] [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[DuckDuckGo]] search engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Krazit |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10315117-265.html |title=Bing strikes licensing deal with Wolfram Alpha |publisher=CNET |date=August 21, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Team |date=April 18, 2011 |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2011/04/18/wolframalpha-and-duckduckgo-partner-on-api-binding-and-search-integration/ |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha and DuckDuckGo Partner on API Binding and Search Integration |work=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the first release on July 21, 2017, [[Brave (web browser)|Brave]] web browser features Wolfram Alpha as one of its default search engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brave Browser Github page|url=https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop|website=Github|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For factual [[question answering]], it is also queried by Apple's [[Siri (software)|Siri]], Samsung's [[S Voice]], as well as Dexetra's [[speech recognition]] software for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform, Iris, and the voice control software on [[BlackBerry 10]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berryreview.com/2013/10/21/blackberry-teams-up-with-wolfram-alpha-for-blackberry-10-voice-control/|title=BlackBerry Teams Up with Wolfram Alpha For BlackBerry 10 Voice Control|work=BerryReview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Launch preparations began on May 15, 2009 at 7&amp;nbsp;pm [[Central Daylight Time (North America)#Central Daylight Time|CDT]] and were broadcast live on [[Justin.tv]]. The plan was to publicly launch the service a few hours later, with expected issues due to extreme load. The service was officially launched on May 18, 2009.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8052798.stm |title=Wolfram 'search engine' goes live |publisher=BBC News |date=May 18, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram Alpha has received mixed reviews.&lt;ref name="spivack"&gt;{{cite web |first=Nova |last=Spivack |title=Wolfram Alpha is Coming – and It Could be as Important as Google |date=March 7, 2009 |url=http://www.novaspivack.com/uncategorized/wolfram-alpha-is-coming-and-it-could-be-as-important-as-google |accessdate=2013-02-09 |publisher=Nova Spivack – Minding the Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ryan |last=Singel |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Fails the Cool Test |date=May 18, 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/05/wolframalpha-fails-the-cool-test/ |publisher=Wired |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram Alpha advocates point to its potential, some even stating that how it determines results is more important than current usefulness.&lt;ref name="spivack"/&gt;

On December 3, 2009, an [[iPhone]] app was introduced. Some users&lt;ref name="ios-price"&gt;{{cite web |first=MG |last=Siegler |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/03/wolfram-alpha-iphone-app/ |title=Nice Try, Wolfram Alpha. Still Not Paying $50 For Your App. |publisher=TechCrunch |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the initial $50 price of the [[iOS]] app unnecessarily high, since the same features could be freely accessed by using a web browser instead. They also complained about the simultaneous removal of the mobile formatting option for the site.&lt;ref name="mobile-format"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tuaw.com/2009/12/03/wolframalpha-iphone-formatted-web-page-no-longer-available/ |first=TJ |last=Luoma |title=WolframAlpha iPhone-formatted web page no longer available |publisher=TUAW |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram responded by lowering the price to $2, offering a refund to existing customers&lt;ref name="refund"&gt;{{cite web|last=Broida |first=Rick |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10471978-233.html |title=Get Wolfram Alpha app for $1.99-and a refund if you paid more |publisher=CNET |date=April 1, 2010 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and re-instating the mobile site.

On October 6, 2010, an Android version of the app was released&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/wolframalphas-android-app-now-available/ |title=Wolfram Alpha's Android app now available |first=Leena |last=Rao |publisher=TechCrunch |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is now available for Kindle Fire and Nook. (The Nook version is not available outside the US). A further 71 apps are available which use the Wolfram Alpha engine for specialized tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://products.wolframalpha.com/mobile/ |title=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha: Mobile &amp; Tablet Apps |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-02-09 |publisher=Wolfram Alpha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2018, the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] version of Wolfram Alpha was released.&lt;ref name="Japanese version"&gt;{{cite web |first=Hideto |last=Tarai |title="WolframAlpha" which answers any difficult calculations and questions, the Japanese version is released |date=June 19, 2018 |url=https://forest.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1128271.html |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |publisher=Windows Forest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wolfram Alpha Pro ==
On February 8, 2012, Wolfram Alpha Pro was released,&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce"&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Wolfram |url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2012/02/08/announcing-wolframalpha-pro/ |title=Announcing Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Pro |date=February 8, 2012 |work=Wolfram&amp;#124;Alpha Blog |publisher=Wolfram Alpha |accessdate=2013-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering users additional features for a monthly subscription fee. A key feature is the ability to upload many common file types and data—including raw tabular data, images, audio, XML, and dozens of specialized scientific, medical, and mathematical formats—for automatic analysis. Other features include an extended keyboard, interactivity with [[Computable Document Format|CDF]], data downloads, in-depth step by step solution, the ability to customize and save graphical and tabular results&lt;ref name="Hachman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hachman |first=Mark |title=Data Geeks, Meet Wolfram Alpha Pro |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |date=February 7, 2012 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2399911,00.asp |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extra computation time.&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce" /&gt;

Along with new premium features, Wolfram Alpha Pro led to some changes in the free version of the site:
* An increase in advertisements on the free site.
* Text and PDF export options now require the user to set up a free account&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce" /&gt; even though they existed before the introduction of Wolfram Alpha accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hplusmagazine.com/2009/06/24/users-guide-wolframalpha/|title=A User's Guide to Wolfram Alpha|first=Surfdaddy|last=Orca|publisher=H+ Magazine|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The option to request extra time for a long calculation is no longer available to free users.&lt;ref name="extra-time-before"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mst.edu/~jkmq53/school/Fall_2011/English_160/files/Marlowe_Usability_Test.docx|title=Wolfram Alpha Usability Test Survey|first=James|last=Marlowe|year=2011|accessdate=2013-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WAProAnnounce" /&gt;
* Step-by-step solving of math problems is limited to three steps for free users (previously uncapped). It has since been reduced to only one step with a preview of the second.&lt;ref name="StepByStep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2009/12/01/step-by-step-math/|title=Step-by-Step Math}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright claims ==
''[[InfoWorld]]'' published an article&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite web |last=McAllister |first=Neil |url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/how-wolfram-alpha-could-change-software-248 |title=How Wolfram Alpha could change software |publisher=InfoWorld |date=July 29, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; warning readers of the potential implications of giving an automated website proprietary rights to the data it generates. [[Free software movement|Free software]] advocate [[Richard Stallman]] also opposes the idea of recognizing the site as a copyright holder and suspects that Wolfram would not be able to make this case under existing copyright law.&lt;ref name="fsf"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/2009-August/004865.html |title=How Wolfram Alpha's Copyright Claims Could Change Software |date=August 4, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-17 |mailinglist=Access 2 Knowledge|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130428041345/http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/2009-August/004865.html |archivedate=April 28, 2013 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
