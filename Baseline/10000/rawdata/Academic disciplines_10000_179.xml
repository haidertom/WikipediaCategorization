'''Absolute magnitude''' is a measure of the [[luminosity]] of a [[celestial object]], on a [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] [[Magnitude (astronomy)|astronomical magnitude]] scale. An object's absolute magnitude is defined to be equal to the [[apparent magnitude]] that the object would have if it were viewed from a distance of exactly 10&amp;nbsp;[[parsecs]] (32.6 [[light-year]]s), with no [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] (or dimming) of its light due to absorption by [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] particles. By hypothetically placing all objects at a standard reference distance from the observer, their luminosities can be directly compared on a magnitude scale. As with all astronomical [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitudes]], the absolute magnitude can be specified for different [[wavelength]] ranges corresponding to specified [[Filter (optics)|filter]] bands or [[passband]]s; for stars a commonly quoted absolute magnitude is the '''absolute visual magnitude''', which uses the visual (V) band of the spectrum (in the [[UBV photometric system]]). Absolute magnitudes are denoted by a capital M, with a subscript representing the filter band used for measurement, such as M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; for absolute magnitude in the V band.

The more luminous an object, the smaller the numerical value of its absolute magnitude. A difference of 5 magnitudes between the absolute magnitudes of two objects corresponds to a ratio of 100 in their luminosities, and a difference of n magnitudes in absolute magnitude corresponds to a luminosity ratio of 100&lt;sup&gt;(n/5)&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, a star of absolute magnitude M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;=3 would be 100 times more luminous than a star of absolute magnitude M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;=8 as measured in the V filter band. The [[Sun]] has absolute magnitude M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;=+4.83.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Fact Sheet|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|publisher=[[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]]|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly luminous objects can have negative absolute magnitudes: for example, the [[Milky Way]] galaxy has an absolute B magnitude of about −20.8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karachentsev|first1=I. D.|display-authors=etal|title=A Catalog of Neighboring Galaxies|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2004|volume=127|pages=2031–2068|doi=10.1086/382905|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/382905/meta|accessdate=27 February 2017|bibcode = 2004AJ....127.2031K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An object's '''absolute bolometric magnitude''' represents its total [[luminosity]] over all [[wavelengths]], rather than in a single filter band, as expressed on a logarithmic magnitude scale. To convert from an absolute magnitude in a specific filter band to absolute bolometric magnitude, a [[bolometric correction]] is applied.

For [[Solar System]] bodies that shine in reflected light, a different definition of absolute magnitude (H) is used, based on a standard reference distance of one [[astronomical unit]].

== Stars and galaxies ({{mvar|''M''}}) ==
In stellar and galactic astronomy, the standard distance is 10 parsecs (about 32.616 light-years, 308.57 petameters or 308.57 [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)#1012|trillion]] kilometres). A star at 10 parsecs has a [[parallax]] of 0.1″ (100 milli[[minute of arc|arcseconds]]). Galaxies (and other [[nebula|extended objects]]) are much larger than 10 parsecs, their light is radiated over an extended patch of sky, and their overall brightness cannot be directly observed from relatively short distances, but the same convention is used. A galaxy's magnitude is defined by measuring all the light radiated over the entire object, treating that integrated brightness as the brightness of a single point-like or star-like source, and computing the magnitude of that point-like source as it would appear if observed at the standard 10 parsecs distance. Consequently, the absolute magnitude of any object ''equals'' the apparent magnitude it ''would have'' if it were 10 parsecs away.

The measurement of absolute magnitude is made with an instrument called a [[bolometer]]. When using an absolute magnitude, one must specify the type of [[electromagnetic radiation]] being measured. When referring to total energy output, the proper term is [[bolometer|bolometric]] magnitude. The bolometric magnitude usually is computed from the visual magnitude plus a [[bolometric correction]], {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''M''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; + BC}}. This correction is needed because very hot stars radiate mostly ultraviolet radiation, whereas very cool stars radiate mostly infrared radiation (see [[Planck's law]]).

Some stars visible to the naked eye have such a low absolute magnitude that they would appear bright enough to outshine the [[planet]]s and cast shadows if they were at 10 parsecs from the Earth. Examples include [[Rigel]] (−7.0), [[Deneb]] (−7.2), [[Zeta Puppis|Naos]] (−6.0), and [[Betelgeuse]] (−5.6). For comparison, [[Sirius]] has an absolute magnitude of 1.4, which is brighter than the [[Sun]], whose absolute visual magnitude is [[fifth magnitude star|4.83]] (it actually serves as a reference point). The Sun's absolute bolometric magnitude is set arbitrarily, usually at 4.75.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Absolute magnitudes of stars generally range from −10 to +17. The absolute magnitudes of galaxies can be much lower (brighter). For example, the giant [[elliptical galaxy M87]] has an absolute magnitude of −22 (i.e. as bright as about 60,000 stars of magnitude −10).

=== Apparent magnitude ===
{{Main article|Apparent magnitude}}

The Greek astronomer Hipparchus established a numerical scale to describe the brightness of each star appearing in the sky. The brightest stars in the sky were assigned an apparent magnitude {{math|''m'' {{=}} 1}}, and the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye are assigned {{math|''m'' {{=}} 6}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Bradley W.|last2=Ostlie|first2=Dale A.|title=An Introduction to Modern Astrophysics|edition=2nd|publisher=Pearson|isbn=0-321-44284-9|pages=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between them corresponds to a factor of 100 in brightness. For objects within the immediate neighborhood of the Sun, the absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}} and apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}} from any distance {{mvar|d}} (in [[parsec]]s) is related by:

:&lt;math&gt; 100^{\frac{m-M}{5}}=\frac{F_{10}}{F} = \left(\frac{d}{10\;\mathrm{pc}}\right)^{2}, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|F}} is the radiant flux measured at distance {{mvar|d}} (in parsecs), {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;}} the radiant flux measured at distance {{math|10 pc}}. The relation can be written in terms of logarithm:

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - 5 \left(\log_{10}(d_\text{pc}) - 1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the insignificance of [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction by gas and dust]] is assumed. Typical extinction rates within the galaxy are 1 to 2 magnitudes per kiloparsec, when [[Dark nebula|dark clouds]] are taken into account.&lt;ref name=Unsoeld2013&gt;{{citation

For objects at very large distances (outside the Milky Way) the luminosity distance {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;}} must be used instead of {{mvar|d}} (in parsecs), because the Euclidean approximation is invalid for distant objects and [[general relativity]] must be taken into account. Moreover, the [[cosmological redshift]] complicates the relation between absolute and apparent magnitude, because the radiation observed was shifted into the red range of the spectrum. To compare the magnitudes of very distant objects with those of local objects, a [[K correction]] might have to be applied to the magnitudes of the distant objects.

The absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}} can also be approximated using apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}} and [[stellar parallax]] {{mvar|p}}:

:&lt;math&gt; M = m + 5 \left(\log_{10}p+1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

or using apparent magnitude {{mvar|m}} and [[distance modulus]] {{mvar|μ}}:

:&lt;math&gt; M = m - \mu&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Examples ====
[[Rigel]] has a visual magnitude {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} of 0.12 and distance about 860 light-years
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{V} = 0.12 - 5 \left(\log_{10} \frac{860}{3.2616} - 1 \right) = -7.0.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Vega]] has a parallax {{mvar|p}} of 0.129″, and an apparent magnitude {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} of 0.03
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{V} = 0.03 + 5 \left(\log_{10}{0.129} + 1\right) = +0.6.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Alpha Centauri A]] has a parallax {{mvar|p}} of 0.742″ and an apparent magnitude {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} of −0.01
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{V} = -0.01 + 5 \left(\log_{10}{0.742} + 1\right) = +4.3.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Black Eye Galaxy]] has a visual magnitude {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}} of 9.36 and a distance modulus {{mvar|μ}} of 31.06
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{V} = 9.36 - 31.06 = -21.7.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Bolometric magnitude ===

The [[Bolometer|bolometric]] magnitude {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;}}, takes into account [[electromagnetic radiation]] at all [[wavelengths]]. It includes those unobserved due to instrumental [[Passband|pass-band]], the Earth's atmospheric absorption, and [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction by interstellar dust]]. It is defined based on the [[luminosity]] of the stars. In the case of stars with few observations, it must be computed assuming an [[effective temperature]].

Classically, the difference in bolometric magnitude is related to the luminosity ratio according to:

:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{bol,\star} - M_\mathrm{bol,\odot} = -2.5 \log_{10} \left(\frac{L_\star}{L_\odot}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which makes by inversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_\star}{L_\odot} = 10^{0.4\left(M_\mathrm{bol,\odot} - M_\mathrm{bol,\star}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;#x2299;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the Sun's luminosity (bolometric luminosity)
:{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;★&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the star's luminosity (bolometric luminosity)
:{{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol,&amp;#x2299;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the bolometric magnitude of the Sun
:{{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol,★&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the bolometric magnitude of the star.

In August 2015, the [[International Astronomical Union]] passed Resolution B2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/news/announcements/detail/ann15023/ |title=IAU XXIX General Assembly Draft Resolutions Announced |deadurl=no|accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; defining the zero points of the absolute and apparent [[bolometric magnitude]] scales in SI units for power ([[watt]]s) and irradiance (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), respectively. Although bolometric magnitudes had been used by astronomers for many decades, there had been systematic differences in the absolute magnitude-luminosity scales presented in various astronomical references, and no international standardization. This led to systematic differences in bolometric corrections scales.&lt;ref name="IAU2015B2"&gt;{{cite journal |author= IAU Inter-Division A-G Working Group on Nominal Units for Stellar &amp; Planetary Astronomy |title=IAU 2015 Resolution B2 on Recommended Zero Points for the Absolute and Apparent Bolometric Magnitude Scales |url=https://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2015_English.pdf |journal=Resolutions adopted at the General Assemblies |publisher=International Astronomical Union |date=13 August 2015 |arxiv=1510.06262|bibcode=2015arXiv151006262M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with incorrect assumed absolute bolometric magnitudes for the Sun could lead to systematic errors in estimated stellar luminosities (and stellar properties calculated which rely on stellar luminosity, such as radii, ages, and so on).

Resolution B2 defines an absolute bolometric magnitude scale where {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} corresponds to luminosity {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} }}{{val|3.0128|e=28|u=W}}, with the zero point [[luminosity]] {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} set such that the Sun (with nominal [[luminosity]] {{val|3.828|e=26|u=W}}) corresponds to absolute [[bolometric magnitude]] {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol,&amp;#x2299;&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} }}4.74. Placing a [[radiation]] source (e.g. star) at the standard distance of 10 [[parsecs]], it follows that the zero point of the apparent [[bolometric magnitude]] scale {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} corresponds to [[irradiance]] {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} }}{{val|2.518021002|e=-8|u=W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Using the IAU 2015 scale, the nominal total [[solar irradiance]] ("[[solar constant]]") measured at 1 [[astronomical unit]] ({{val|1361|u=W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) corresponds to an apparent [[bolometric magnitude]] of the [[Sun]] of {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;bol,&amp;#x2299;&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} }}−26.832.&lt;ref name="IAU2015B2" /&gt;

Following Resolution B2, the relation between a star's absolute bolometric magnitude and its luminosity is no longer directly tied to the Sun's (variable) luminosity:

:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{bol} = -2.5 \log_{10} \frac{L_\star}{L_0} \approx -2.5 \log_{10} L_\star + 71.197425&lt;/math&gt;

where
:{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;★&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the star's luminosity (bolometric luminosity) in [[watt]]s
:{{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the zero point luminosity {{val|3.0128|e=28|u=W}}
:{{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the bolometric magnitude of the star

The new IAU absolute magnitude scale permanently disconnects the scale from the variable Sun. However, on this SI power scale, the nominal solar luminosity corresponds closely to {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} }}4.74, a value that was commonly adopted by astronomers before the 2015 IAU resolution.&lt;ref name="IAU2015B2" /&gt;

The luminosity of the star in watts can be calculated as a function of its absolute bolometric magnitude {{math|''M''&lt;sub&gt;bol&lt;/sub&gt;}} as:

:&lt;math&gt;L_\star = L_0 10^{-0.4 M_\mathrm{bol}}&lt;/math&gt;

using the variables as defined previously.

{{For|an introduction|Magnitude (astronomy)}}

For [[planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s a definition of absolute magnitude that is more meaningful for non-stellar objects is used. The absolute magnitude for a planet, {{mvar|Mv}}, or an asteroid, {{mvar|H}}, is defined as the [[apparent magnitude]] that the object would have if it were one [[astronomical unit]] (AU) from both the [[Sun]] and the observer, and in conditions of ideal solar opposition. In fact, one has to take into account that Solar System bodies are illuminated by the Sun, therefore the magnitude varies as a function of illumination conditions, described by the [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]]. This relationship is referred to as the [[Phase curve (astronomy)|phase curve]]. The absolute magnitude is defined for the ideal case of phase angle equal to zero.

To convert a stellar or a galactic absolute magnitude into a planetary one, subtract 31.57. A comet's nuclear magnitude ({{mvar|M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}) is a different scale and can not be used for a size comparison with an asteroid's ({{mvar|H}}) magnitude.

=== Apparent magnitude ===
[[File:Diffuse_reflector_sphere_disk.png|thumb|Diffuse reflection on sphere and flat disk]]

The absolute magnitude ({{mvar|H}}) can be used to help calculate the apparent magnitude of a body under different conditions.
:&lt;math&gt;m = H + 2.5 \log_{10}{\left(\frac{d_\mathrm{BS}^2 d_\mathrm{BO}^2}{p(\chi) d_0^4}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is 1&amp;nbsp;AU, {{mvar|χ}} is the [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], the angle between the body-Sun and body–observer lines. By the [[law of cosines]], we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos{\chi} = \frac{ d_\mathrm{BO}^2 + d_\mathrm{BS}^2 - d_\mathrm{OS}^2 } {2 d_\mathrm{BO} d_\mathrm{BS}}.&lt;/math&gt;
{{math|''p''(''χ'')}} is the [[Bond albedo#Phase integral|phase integral]] (integration of reflected light; a number in the 0 to 1 range).

Example: [[Lambertian diffuse lighting model|Ideal diffuse reflecting]] [[sphere]]. A reasonable first approximation for planetary bodies
:&lt;math&gt;p(\chi) = \frac23 \left( \left(1 - \frac{\chi}{\pi}\right) \cos{\chi} + \frac{1}{\pi} \sin{\chi} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
A full-phase diffuse sphere reflects {{sfrac|2|3}} as much light as a diffuse disc of the same diameter.

Distances:
* {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;BO&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the distance between the observer and the body
* {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;BS&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the distance between the Sun and the body
* {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the distance between the observer and the Sun

Note: because Solar System bodies are never perfect diffuse reflectors, astronomers use empirically derived relationships to predict apparent magnitudes when accuracy is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8160 |title=Planetary magnitudes Calculator – update |dead-url=yes |accessdate=2013-05-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419060236/http://www.shatters.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8160 |archivedate=April 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Example ====
Moon:
* {{math|''H''&lt;sub&gt;Moon&lt;/sub&gt;}} = +0.25
* {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;OS&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;BS&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 1&amp;nbsp;AU
* {{math|''d''&lt;sub&gt;BO&lt;/sub&gt;}} = {{val|3.845|e=8|u=m}} = {{val|0.00257|u=AU}}
How bright is the Moon from Earth?
* Full moon: {{math|''χ'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''p''(''χ'')  ≈ {{sfrac|2|3}}}}
*: &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{Moon} = 0.25 + 2.5 \log_{10}\left(\frac32\cdot 0.00257^2\right) = -12.26&lt;/math&gt;
*: Actual value: −12.7. A full Moon reflects 30% more light than a perfect diffuse reflector predicts.
* Quarter moon: {{math|''χ'' {{=}} 90° {{=}} {{sfrac|π|2}}}}, {{math|''p''(''χ'') ≈ {{sfrac|2|3π}}}} (if diffuse reflector)
*: &lt;math&gt;m_\mathrm{Moon} = 0.25 + 2.5 \log_{10}\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}\cdot 0.00257^2\right) = -11.02&lt;/math&gt;
*: Actual value: approximately −11. The diffuse reflector formula does well for smaller phases.

'''''Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays''''' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1957) is a book by Canadian literary critic and theorist, [[Herman Northrop Frye|Northrop Frye]], which attempts to formulate an overall view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of [[literary criticism]] derived exclusively from literature. Frye consciously omits all specific and practical criticism, instead offering classically inspired theories of modes, symbols, myths and genres, in what he termed "an interconnected group of suggestions." The literary approach proposed by Frye in ''Anatomy'' was highly influential in the decades before [[deconstruction|deconstructivist criticism]] and other expressions of [[postmodernism]] came to prominence in American academia circa 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Frank Lentricchia]], ''After the New Criticism'' (1980), in which Chapter One, 'The Place of Northrop Frye's ''Anatomy of Criticism'' ', begins by calling the book 'monumental'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye's four essays are sandwiched between a "Polemical Introduction" and a "Tentative Conclusion." The four essays are titled "Historical Criticism: A Theory of Modes", "Ethical Criticism: a Theory of [[Symbol]]s", "[[Archetypal]] Criticism: A Theory of [[mythology|Myth]]s", and "Rhetorical Criticism: A Theory of [[Genre]]s."

==Contents==
===Polemical Introduction===
The purpose of the introduction is to defend the need for literary criticism, to distinguish the nature of genuine literary criticism from other forms of criticism, and to clarify the difference between direct experience of literature and the systematic study of literary criticism.

There are a number of reasons why the introduction is labeled as a '[[polemic]]'. In defending the need for literary criticism, Frye opposes a notion common to [[Tolstoy]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] thought that 'natural taste' is superior to scholarly learning (and by extension, criticism). Frye also accuses a number of methods of criticism (e.g. [[Marxist]], [[Freud]]ian, [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian, [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]], etc.) as being embodiments of the deterministic fallacy. He is not opposed to these ideologies in particular, but sees the application of any external, ready-made ideology to literature as a departure from genuine criticism. This results in subjecting a work of literature to an individual's pet philosophy and an elevation or demotion of authors according to their conformity to the pet philosophy.

Another point is to distinguish the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic's society at that point in history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is the same as that of consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of [[John Milton]] are more fruitful than [[R. D. Blackmore]] (to use Frye's example), a critic contributes little by saying so. In other words, value judgments contribute little to meaningful criticism.

In place of meaningless criticism, Frye proposes a genuine literary criticism which draws its method from the body of literature itself. Literary criticism ought to be a systematic study of works of literature, just as physics is of nature and history is of human action. Frye makes the explicit assumption that in order for systematic study to be possible, the body of literature must already possess a systematic nature. Frye claims that we know very little about this system as yet and that the systematic study of literature has progressed little since [[Aristotle]].

Frye concludes his introduction by addressing the weaknesses of his argument. He mentions that the introduction is a polemic, but written in first person to acknowledge the individual nature of his views. He concedes that the following essays can only give a preliminary, and likely inexact, glimpse of the system of literature. He admits to making sweeping generalities that will often prove false in light of particular examples. Finally, he stresses that while many feel an "emotional repugnance" to schematization of [[poetry]], the schematization should be regarded as an aspect of criticism, not the vibrant, personal, direct experience of the work itself—much as the geologist turns away from his or her systematic work to enjoy the beauty of the mountains.

==="Historical Criticism: Theory of Modes"===
Frye's systemization of literature begins with three aspects of poetry given by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': ''mythos'' (plot), ''ethos'' (characterization/setting), and ''dianoia'' (theme/idea). Frye sees works of literature as lying somewhere on a continuum between being [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] driven, as in most [[fiction]], and [[idea]] driven, as in [[essay]]s and [[Lyrics|lyric]]al poetry. The First essay begins by exploring the different aspects of fiction (subdivided into tragic and comic) in each mode and ends with a similar discussion of thematic literature.

Frye divides his study of tragic, comic, and thematic literature into five "modes", each identified with a specific literary epoch: mythic, romantic, high [[mimesis|mimetic]], low mimetic, and ironic. This categorization is a representation of ''[[ethos]]'', or characterization and relates to how the protagonist is portrayed in respect to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment. Frye suggests that Classical civilizations progressed historically through the development of these modes, and that something similar happened in Western civilization during medieval and modern times. He speculates that contemporary fiction may be undergoing a return to myth, completing a full circle through the five modes. Frye argues that when irony is pushed to extremes, it returns to the mode of myth; this concept of the ''recursion'' of [[cyclic history|historical cycles]] is familiar from [[Giambattista Vico]]&lt;ref&gt;Cotrupi, Caterina Nella [https://books.google.com/books?id=rh8gcNF9YXkC ''Northrop Frye and the poetics of process''] p.18&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oswald Spengler]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgcnAQAAIAAJ ''Spiritus Mundi: Essays on Literature, Myth, and Society''] p.113 quotation: {{quotation|The demonic aspect of historical time is clearer in Vico than in Spengler, though Vico came later into my readig. In Vico there is also a projecting of authority, first on gods, then on "heroes" or human leaders, then on the people themselves. Vico lived at a time when there had been no permanently successful example of a democracy, and from his study of Roman history he concluded that the people cannot recover the authority they project on others, and hence the third age of the people is followed by a ''ricorso'' that starts the cycle over again. In Spengler there is no general cyclical movement of this kind, but there is one latent in his argument. Spengler's sense of a historically finite culture, exploiting and exhausting a certain range of imaginative possibilities, provided the basis for the conception of modes outlined in the first essay of Anatomy of Criticism. I soon scrapped his loaded term "decline" for a more neutral conception of cultural aging, but his vision of cultural history superseded the onward- and-upward people I had read still earlier in youth, such as Bernard Shaw and HG Wells, who had obviously got it wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm review]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403220409/http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm |date=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy is concerned with the hero's separation from society.
*Mythic tragedy deals with the death of gods.
*Romantic tragedy features elegies mourning the death of heroes such as [[King Arthur|Arthur]] or [[Beowulf]].
*High mimetic tragedy presents the death of a noble human such as [[Othello]] or [[Oedipus]].
*Low mimetic tragedy shows the death or sacrifice of an ordinary human being and evokes pathos, as with [[Thomas Hardy]]'s [[Tess of the d'Urbervilles|Tess]] or [[Henry James]]'s [[Daisy Miller]].
*The ironic mode often shows the death or suffering of a protagonist who is both weak and pitiful compared to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment; [[Franz Kafka]]'s works provide many examples of such. At other times, the protagonist is not necessarily weaker than the average person yet suffers severe persecution at the hands of a deranged society. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s Hester Prynne, and Hardy's Tess exemplify this treatment.

Comedy is concerned with integration of society.
*Mythic comedy deals with acceptance into the society of gods, often through a number of trials as with [[Hercules]] or through [[salvation]] or assumption as in the [[Bible]].
*In romantic comic modes, the setting is pastoral or idyllic, and there is an integration of the hero with an idealized simplified form of nature.
*High mimetic comedy involves a strong central protagonist who constructs his or her own society by brute force, fending off all opposition until the protagonist ends up with all honor and riches due him or her—the plays of [[Aristophanes]] or something like [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Prospero]] are examples.
*Low mimetic comedy often shows the social elevation of the hero or heroine and often ends in marriage.
*Ironic comedy is perhaps more difficult, and Frye devotes a good deal more space to this than the other comedic modes. At one extreme, ironic comedy borders on savagery, the inflicting of pain on a helpless victim. Some examples of this include tales of [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s, [[Crime fiction|murder mysteries]], or human sacrifice. Yet ironic comedy may also offer biting satire of a society replete with snobbery. It may even depict a protagonist rejected by society (thus failing the typical comic reintegration) yet who appears wiser than the rejecting society. Aristophanes, [[Ben Jonson]], [[Molière]], [[Henry Fielding]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[Graham Greene]] offer examples of the wide range of ironic comic possibility.

Finally, Frye explores the nature of thematic literature in each mode. Here, the intellectual content is more important than the plot, so these modes are organized by what is considered more authoritative or educational at the time. Also, these modes tend to organize by societal structure.
*In the mythical mode scripture, literature claiming divine inspiration is prevalent.
*In the romantic, the gods have retreated to the sky and it is up to chroniclers in a nomadic society to remember the lists of names of the patriarchs, the proverbs, traditions, charms, deeds, etc.
*In the high mimetic mode society is structured around a capital city, and "national" epics such as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[The Lusiad]]'' are typical.
*In the low mimetic, thematic exposition tends toward individualism and romanticism. The individual author's own thoughts and ideas are now the center of authority, as instanced by [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[The Prelude|Prelude]]''.
*Finally, in the ironic mode, the poet figures as a mere observer rather than an authoritative commentator, producing writing that tends to emphasize discontinuity and anti-epiphany. [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' exemplify this thematic mode.

==="Ethical Criticism: Theory of Symbols"===
Now that Frye has established his theory of modes, he proposes five levels, or ''phases'', of symbolism, each phase independently possessing its own ''mythos'', ethos, and ''dianoia'' as laid out in the first essay. These phases are based on the four levels of [[medieval allegory]] (the first two phases constituting the first level). Also, Frye relates the five phases with the ages of man laid out in the first essay. Frye defines a literary symbol as: "[A]ny unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention."

Symbolic phases:
* Literal/descriptive (motifs and signs)
* Formal (image)
* Mythical (archetype)
* Anagogic (monad)

The '''descriptive''' phase exhibits the centrifugal, or outward, property of a symbol. For example, when a word such as 'cat' evokes a definition, image, experience or any property connected with the word 'cat' external to the literary context of the particular usage, we have the word taken in the descriptive sense. Frye labels any such symbol a ''sign''. He does not define the sign beyond this sense of pointing to the external, nor does he refer to any particular semiotic theory. In opposition to the sign stands the ''motif'' which is a symbol taken in the '''literal''' phase. This phase demonstrates the inward, or centripetal, direction of meaning, best described as the contextual meaning of the symbol. To Frye, ''literal'' means nearly the opposite of its usage in common speech; to say that something "literally" means something generally involves referring to a definition external to the text. Instead, ''literal'' refers to the symbol's meaning in its specific literary situation while ''descriptive'' refers to personal connotation and conventional definition. Finally, Frye draws an analogy between rhythm and harmony with the literal and descriptive phases respectively. The literal phase tends to be horizontal, dependent on what comes before and after the symbol while the descriptive phase tends to be laid out in space, having external meanings that vary in nearness to the contextual meaning.

Frye next introduces the '''formal''' phase, embodied by the image, in order to define the layer of meaning that results from the interplay of the harmony and rhythm of the signs and motifs. The  most frequently repeated imagery sets the tone of the work (as with the color red in ''[[Macbeth]]''), with less repeated imagery working in contrast with this tonal background. This section of the essay gives a faithful representation of literary formalism (also known as [[New Criticism]]). Frye's representation of formalism here is unique; however, its setting as part of the larger system of literary criticism Frye outlines in the entire work. The notion of form (and perhaps Frye's literal phase) relies heavily on the assumption of inherent meaning within the text—a point contested by deconstructionist critics.

The '''mythical''' phase is the treatment of a symbol as an archetype. This concept relates most closely with [[intertextuality]] and considers the symbol in a work as interconnected with similar symbolism throughout the entire body of literature. While Frye deals with myths and archetypes from a broader perspective in the third essay, in this section he focuses on the critical method of tracing a symbol's heritage through literary works both prior and subsequent to the work in question. Frye argues that convention is a vital part of literature and that copyright  is deleterious to the process of literary creation. Frye points to the use of convention in Shakespeare and Milton as examples to strengthen his argument that even verbatim copying of text and plot does not entail a death of creativity. Further, Frye argues that romantic, anti-conventional writers such as [[Walt Whitman]] tend to follow convention anyway. In criticism, the study of the archetypal phase of a symbol is akin to the "nature" perspective in the psychological debate over [[nature versus nurture]]. Rather than viewing the symbol as a unique achievement of the author or some inherent quality of the text, the archetypeal phase situates the symbol in its society of literary kindred as a product of its conventional forebears.

Finally, Frye proposes an '''anagogic''' phase wherein a symbol is treated as a monad. The anagogic level of medieval allegory treated a text as expressing the highest spiritual meaning. For example, Dante's Beatrice in the [[Divine Comedy]] would represent the bride of Christ. Frye makes the argument that not only is there a lateral connection of archetypes through intertextuality, but that there is a transcendent almost spiritual unity within the body of literature. Frye describes the anagogic in literature as "the imitation of infinite social action and infinite human thought, the mind of a man who is all men, the universal creative word which is all words."

==="Archetypal Criticism: Theory of Myths"===
Frye begins the essay regarding [[myth]] as the source of all [[literature]] (as a visual, auditory and textual art form), paintings (as visual art form) and music (as an auditory art form). The underlying structures and patterns of all these forms are similar, though they have a unique style of their own.

The third essay is the culmination of Frye's theory in that it unites the elements of characterization and each of the five symbolic phases presented in the first two essays into an organic whole. This whole is organized around a metaphor of human desire and frustration as manifested in the [[Great Chain of Being]] (divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral and water) by analogy to the four [[season]]s.

At one pole we have apocalyptic imagery which typifies the revelation of [[heaven]] and ultimate [[wikt:fulfillment|fulfillment]] of human desire. In this state, the literary structure points toward unification of all things in a single analogical symbol. The ultimate of the divine is the deity, of the human is [[Christ]] (or any other being that embodies the oneness of humanity in its spiritual culmination), of the animal is the [[Domestic sheep|lamb]], of the vegetable is the [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]] or [[vine]], and of the mineral is the [[New Jerusalem|heavenly Jerusalem]] or city of God.

At the opposite pole lies [[demon]]ic imagery which typifies the unfulfillment, perverion, or opposition of human desire. In this state, things tend toward [[anarchy]] or [[tyranny]]. The divine is an angry, inscrutable God demanding sacrifice, the human is the tyrannical [[anti-christ|anti-Christ]], the animal is a predator such as a [[lion]], the vegetable is the evil wood as found at the beginning of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' or Hawthorne's "[[Young Goodman Brown]]", and the city is the [[dystopia]] embodied by [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''1984'' or [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]''.

Finally we have the analogical imagery, or more simply, depictions of states that are similar to paradise or [[hell]], but not identical. There is a great deal of variety in the imagery of these structures, but tame animals and wise rulers are common in structures analogical to the apocalyptic (analogy of innocence), while predatory aristocrats and masses living in squalor characterize analogy to the demonic (analogy of experience).

Frye then identifies the mythical mode with the apocalyptic, the ironic with the demonic, and the romantic and [[Mimesis|low mimetic]] with their respective analogies. The [[Mimesis|high mimetic]], then, occupies the center of all four. This ordering allows Frye to place the modes in a circular structure and point to the cyclical nature of myth and archetypes. In this setting, literature represents the natural cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, [[resurrection]], rebirth, and the repetition of the cycle. The remainder of the chapter deals with the cycle of the four seasons as embodied by four mythoi: [[comedy]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[tragedy]], and [[irony]] or [[satire]].

==="Rhetorical Criticism: Theory of Genres"===
In the first three essays, Frye deals mainly with the first three elements of Aristotle's elements of poetry (i.e. mythos, ethos, dianoia). In the fourth essay, he explores the last three elements:
* ''melos'' - the element dealing with the tonal, musical aspect of literature
* ''lexis'' - the written word, lying somewhere between musical and visual aspects. It may be referred to as diction (ear) or imagery (eye) depending on the critical focus.
* ''opsis'' - the element dealing with visual aspects of literature

Whereas mythos is the verbal imitation of action and dianoia the verbal imitation of thought (ethos being composed of the two), melos and opsis (with lexis composed of the two) correspond, though seen from a different (rhetorical) perspective. Frye identifies the connection as such: "The world of social action and event . . . has a particularly strong association with the ear. . . . The world of individual thought and idea has a correspondingly close connection with the eye . . ." (Frye, 243).

Rhetoric means two things: ornamental (opsis) speech and persuasive (melos) speech. Rhetorical criticism, then, is the exploration of literature in the light of melos, opsis, and their interplay as manifested in lexis.

The ''radical of presentation''—the relation (or idealized relation) between author and audience—is a further consideration. Difference in genre relies not on topical considerations (science fiction, romance, mystery), nor in length (e.g. epics are long, lyrics are short), but in the radical of presentation. As such, Frye proposes a total of four distinct genres:
* epos - Author speaks directly to audience (e.g. story telling, formal speech).
* fiction - Author and audience are hidden from each other (e.g. most novels).
* drama - Author is hidden from the audience; audience experiences content directly.
* lyric - Audience is "hidden" from author; that is, the speaker is "overheard" by hearers.

These four genres form the organizing principle of the essay, first examining the distinctive kind of rhythm of each, then looking at specific forms of each more closely. As Frye describes each genre, he explains the function of melos and opsis in each. To understand Frye's melos, it is important to note{{According to whom|date=May 2011}} his counter-intuitive usage of the term "musical". He contends that the common usage of the term is inaccurate for purposes of criticism, drawn from analogy with harmony, a stable relationship. Music, however, does not consist of a plastic, static, continuously stable relationship, but rather a series of dissonances resolving at the end into a stable relationship. Poetry containing little dissonance, then, has more in common with the plastic arts than with music.

The original presentation of the epic was ''ta epe'' (that which is spoken), and when an author, speaker, or storyteller addresses a visible audience directly, we have epos. The rhythm of epos is that of recurrence (i.e. accent, meter, sound patterns). These are the rhythms most commonly associated with poetry.

"Fiction" is a vague term which Frye uses to avoid introducing too many new terms. Part of the difficulty comes from fact that this is the only of the four genres which has no precedent in antiquity. He acknowledges having used the term previously in a different sense. In this essay, the term refers to literature in which the author addresses the audience through a book, or more simply stated, prose. The rhythm of prose is that of continuity of meaning.

Drama lies halfway between epos and fiction, or more accurately, its diction must fit the setting and the character. Some characters may be melos-oriented, speaking in meter or with various rhetorical effects in song and banter. Others may be opsis-oriented, speaking more in prose and conveying ideological content. Most characters alternate according to the dramatic situation. Such a marriage of the appropriate language with the character and setting (ethos) defines a rhythm of decorum, the distinctive rhythm of drama.

Classical lyrical poetry often presents a shepherd speaking of his love; he is overheard by his audience. However, the distinctiveness of lyric comes more from its peculiar rhythm than from this radical of representation. Frye describes this rhythm as associative rather than logical and is the stuff of dreams and the subconscious. It is closely related to the chant, and though it is found in all literature, it is more apparent in certain kinds of literature than others. At this point Frye suggests a connection between the four historical modes and the four genres. In this sense, the lyrical is typical of the ironic age—just as the ironic protagonist has turned away from society, the lyrical poet makes utterances without regard to the audience. The lyrical rhythm is very clearly seen in Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', a work based almost entirely on associative babbles and dream utterance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4001">The '''Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences''' — known as '''AFRIMS''' — is a [[United States Army]] project that started as a collaboration with the [[government of Thailand]] to fight a [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Bangkok]] in 1958 and '59. It subsequently expanded to cover [[Military medicine|military medical]] research projects (primarily involving [[infectious diseases]]) across much of Southeast Asia and the Indian Subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AFRIMS: History of AFRIMS|url = http://www.afrims.org/afrims-history.html|website = www.afrims.org|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and history==
The mission of the [[US Army]] Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) is to conduct basic and applied research for development of diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines for [[infectious diseases]] of military importance. First formed as the SEATO Lab following the 1956-8 [[Cholera]] pandemic, USAMC-AFRIMS is an agency of the US Embassy Thailand residing at the [[Royal Thai Army Medical Center]] in Bangkok. AFRIMS is a special foreign activity of the [[Walter Reed Army Institute of Research]] (WRAIR) and part of the [[United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command]] (MRMC). AFRIMS is part of a global network of Department of Defense overseas medical research laboratories located in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia; [[Lima]], Peru; [[Nairobi]], Kenya; and Cairo, Egypt. USAMC-AFRIMS has nearly 300 staff members (Thai and USA) and a research budget of approximately $5–7 million annually.&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/embassy/usamc.html |title=US Army Medical Component of the Armed Forces Research Institute of the Medical Sciences (USAMC-AFRIMS) |work=[[United States Foreign Service]] |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127222904/http://bangkok.usembassy.gov/embassy/usamc.html |archivedate=January 27, 2016 }} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The major infectious disease threats to soldiers in South East Asia include [[drug resistant]] malaria, diarrhea and dysentery, [[dengue fever]], HIV, hepatitis, and [[scrub typhus]]. These agents pose health risks to soldiers as well as to the civilian population, and thus form the major areas of research at AFRIMS. Research is predominantly applied research aimed towards finding, developing and testing new drugs and vaccines. New medications currently under development are for the treatment and prevention of multiple drug resistant malaria. Vaccines for dysentery, dengue fever, hepatitis E and HIV are also under development at AFRIMS. Products originally field tested or developed at AFRIMS include Hepatitis A Vaccine, Japanese B Encephalitis Vaccine, doxycycline prophylaxis for malaria, mefloquine antimalarial drug prevention, and [[halofantrine]] antimalarial drug treatment.&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"/&gt;

AFRIMS also conducts surveillance of emerging diseases such as drug resistant P falciparum malaria, Diarrhea agents: Campylobacter, Cholera O139, Cyclospora, E coli, Hepatitis E, HIV 1 E clade, drug resistant scrub typhus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and influenza. The laboratory has over 30 field sites in Thailand, Nepal, Cambodia, [[Vietnam]] and [[Bangladesh]]. AFRIMS also has the largest medical library in Southeast Asia and a modern research animal facility, which is accredited by the [[Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International]] (AAALAC).&lt;ref name="United States Foreign Service"/&gt;

'''Astronomical year numbering''' is based on [[Anno Domini|AD]]/[[Common Era|CE]] year numbering, but follows normal [[decimal]] [[integer]] numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a [[0 (year)|year 0]]; the years before that are designated with [[negative number]]s and the years after that are designated with positive numbers.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html|title=Year Dating Conventions|last=Espenak|first=Fred|work=NASA Eclipse Web Site|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208212742/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html| archivedate= 8 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers use the [[Julian calendar]] for years before 1582, including the year 0, and the [[Gregorian calendar]] for years after 1582, as exemplified by [[Jacques Cassini]] (1740),&lt;ref name=Cassini&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA10 Tables Astronomiques]'' (1740), Explication et Usage pp. 5 (PA5), 7 (PA7), Tables pp. 10 (RA1-PA10), 22 (RA1-PA22), 63 (RA1-PA63), 77 (RA1-PA77), 91 (RA1-PA91), 105 (RA1-PA105), 119 (RA1-PA119). {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Newcomb]] (1898)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Newcomb, [https://archive.org/details/06AstronomicalPapersPreparedForTheUse "Tables of the Motion of the Earth on its Axis and Around the Sun"] in ''Astronomical Papers Prepared for the Use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, Volume&amp;nbsp;VI: Tables of the Four Inner Planets'', (United States Naval Observatory, 1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;27 &amp;amp; 34&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Espenak]] (2007).&lt;ref name=Espanak&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html Phases of the Moon: −99 to 0 (100 to 1 BCE)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605101653/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html |date=5 June 2009 }} ''NASA Eclipse web site''&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or Before Common Era) are dropped.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; The year 1 BC/BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered −1, and in general the year ''n'' BC/BCE is numbered "−(''n'' − 1)"&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; (a negative number equal to 1 − ''n''). The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no sign or a positive sign; thus in general ''n'' AD/CE is simply ''n'' or +''n''.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; For normal calculation a [[0 (number)|number zero]] is often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in [[astronomy]]. Few other disciplines outside [[history]] deal with the time before year 1, some exceptions being [[dendrochronology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geology]], the latter two of which use '[[Before Present|years before the present]]'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like [[eclipses]] or [[planetary conjunction]]s to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.

==Year zero usage==
{{Main|Year zero}}
In his [[Rudolphine Tables]] (1627), [[Johannes Kepler]] used a prototype of year zero which he labeled ''Christi'' (Christ's) between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (Before Christ) and ''Post Christum'' (After Christ) on the mean motion tables for the Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae]'' (1627) Pars secunda, 42 (Zu Seite 191), 48 (197), 54 (203), 60 (209), 66 (215), 72 (221), 78 (227). (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1702, the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), and immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae - Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4. (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick Teresi, [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm "Zero"], ''The Atlantic'', July 1997 (see under Calendars and the Cosmos).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, [http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html "Calendars"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210184836/http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html |date=10 February 2012 }}, ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', ed. P. Kenneth Seidelmann, (Sausalito, California: University Science Books, 1992/2005) 579.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of Julian years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (before Jesus Christ or BC), and immediately before Julian years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (after Jesus Christ or AD).&lt;ref name=Cassini/&gt;

Cassini gave the following reasons for using a year 0:&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PT30 Tables Astronomiques]'', Explication et Usage 5, translated by Wikipedia from the French:&lt;br&gt; "L'année 0 est celle dans laquelle on suppose qu'est né J. C. que plusieurs Chronologistes marquent 1 avant la naissance de J. C. &amp; que nous avons marquée 0, afin que la somme des années avant &amp; après J. C. donne l'intervalle qui est entre ces années, &amp; que les nombres disibles par 4 marquent les années bissextiles tant avant qu'après J. C."&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The year 0 is that in which one supposes that Jesus Christ was born, which several chronologists mark 1 before the birth of Jesus Christ and which we marked 0, so that the sum of the years before and after Jesus Christ gives the interval which is between these years, and where numbers divisible by 4 mark the leap years as so many before or after Jesus Christ.|Jacques Cassini}}

Fred Espanak of [[NASA]] lists 50 phases of the moon within year 0, showing that it is a full year, not an instant in time.&lt;ref name=Espanak/&gt; Jean Meeus gives the following explanation:&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms'' (Richmod, Virginia: Willmann-Bell, 1991) 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a disagreement between astronomers and historians about how to count the years preceding year 1. In [''Astronomical Algorithms''], the 'B.C.' years are counted astronomically. Thus, the year before the year +1 is the year zero, and the year preceding the latter is the year −1. The year which historians call 585 B.C. is actually the year −584.
The astronomical counting of the negative years is the only one suitable for arithmetical purpose. For example, in the historical practice of counting, the rule of divisibility by 4 revealing Julian leap-years no longer exists; these years are, indeed, 1, 5, 9, 13, ... B.C. In the astronomical sequence, however, these leap-years are called 0, −4, −8, −12, ..., and the rule of divisibility by 4 subsists.|Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms''}}

==Signed years without year 0==
Although he used the usual French terms "avant J.-C." (before Jesus Christ) and "après J.-C." (after Jesus Christ) to label years elsewhere in his book, the Byzantine historian [[Venance Grumel]] used negative years (identified by a minus sign, −) to label BC years and unsigned positive years to label AD years in a table. He did so possibly to save space and put no year 0 between them.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1958) 30. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 1.0 of the [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema language]], often used to describe data interchanged between computers in [[XML]], includes built-in primitive datatypes '''date''' and '''dateTime'''. Although these are defined in terms of [[ISO 8601]] which uses the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] and therefore should include a year 0, the XML Schema specification states that there is no year zero. Version 1.1 of the defining [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]] realigned the specification with ISO 8601 by including a year zero, despite the problems arising from the lack of [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Biron, P.V. &amp; Malhotra, A. (Eds.). (28 October 2004). [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime ''XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes'' (2nd ed.).] World Wide Web Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5679">'''Camfecting''', in the field of [[computer security]], is the process of attempting to hack into a person's [[webcam]] and activate it without the webcam owner's permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kiyuna|first1=A.|last2=Conyers|first2=L.|title=CYBERWARFARE SOURCEBOOK|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329063945|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=riH5CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remotely activated webcam can be used to watch anything within the webcam's field of vision, sometimes including the webcam owner themselves. Camfecting is most often carried out by infecting the victim's computer with a virus that can provide the hacker access to their webcam. This attack is specifically targeted at the victim's webcam, and hence the name ''camfecting'', a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''camera'' and ''infecting''.

Typically, a webcam hacker or a camfecter sends his victim an innocent-looking application which has a hidden [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan software]] through which the camfecter can control the victim's webcam. The camfecter virus installs itself silently when the victim runs the original application. Once installed, the camfecter can turn on the webcam and capture pictures/videos. The camfecter software works just like the original webcam software present in the victim computer, the only difference being that the camfecter controls the software instead of the webcam's owner.

== Notable cases ==
Marcus Thomas, former assistant director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s Operational Technology Division in Quantico, said in a 2013 story in The Washington Post that the FBI had been able to covertly activate a computer’s camera — without triggering the light that lets users know it is recording — for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Timberg |first1=Craig |title=FBI’s search for ‘Mo,’ suspect in bomb threats, highlights use of malware for surveillance |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2013/12/06/352ba174-5397-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story_2.html |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=7 December 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221174239/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2013/12/06/352ba174-5397-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story_2.html |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, American teenager Jared James Abrahams pleaded guilty to hacking over 100-150 women and installing the highly invasive malware [[Blackshades]] on their computers in order to obtain nude images and videos of them.  One of his victims was Miss Teen USA 2013 [[Cassidy Wolf#Victim of sextortion|Cassidy Wolf]].&lt;ref name="Hacker Who 'Sextorted' Miss Teen USA Gets 18 Months In Prison"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/jared-james-abrahams-gets-18-months-in-prison-2014-3 | title=Hacker Who 'Sextorted' Miss Teen USA Gets 18 Months In Prison | publisher=Business Insider | date=March 18, 2014 | accessdate=March 19, 2014 | author=Moss, Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from Johns Hopkins University have shown how to covertly capture images from the iSight camera on MacBook and iMac models released before 2008, by reprogramming the microcontroller's [[firmware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Soltani|first1=Ashkan|title=Research shows how MacBook Webcams can spy on their users without warning|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/12/18/research-shows-how-macbook-webcams-can-spy-on-their-users-without-warning/|accessdate=27 September 2016|date=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventative software ==
Recently webcam privacy software has been introduced by such companies such as Stop Being Watched or Webcamlock. The software exposes access to a webcam, and prompts the user to allow or deny access by showing what program is trying to access the webcam. Allowing the user to accept a trusted program the user recognizes, or terminate the attempt immediately. Other companies on the market such as soomz.io manufacture and sell sliding lens covers that allow users to retrofit the computer and close access to the camera lens.

== Risk sources ==
A computer that does not have a reasonably up-to-date webcam software or any ''anti-virus'' (or firewall) software installed and operational may be at increased risk for Camfecting. [[Softcam]]s may nominally increase this risk, if not maintained or configured properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39131">'''Captive breeding''' is the process of maintaining plants or animals in controlled environments, such as wildlife reserves, [[zoo]]s, [[Botanical garden|botanic gardens]], and other [[Conservation biology|conservation]] facilities. It is sometimes employed to help species that are being threatened by human activities such as habitat loss, [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], over hunting or fishing, [[pollution]], [[predation]], [[disease]], and [[parasitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/rep.1.00074 |pmid=15016951 |title=Wildlife conservation and reproductive cloning |journal=Reproduction |volume=127 |issue=3 |pages=317–24 |year=2004 |last1=Holt |first1=W. V |last2=Pickard |first2=A. R |last3=Prather |first3=R. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases a captive breeding program can save a species from [[extinction]], but for success, breeders must consider many factors—including  genetic, ecological, behavioral, and ethical issues. Most successful attempts involve the cooperation and coordination of many institutions.

== History ==
[[Image:Red wolf pups - captive breeding.jpg|thumb|[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|USFWS]] staff with two [[red wolf]] pups bred in captivity]]
[[File:Arabian oryx (oryx leucoryx).jpg|thumb|The Arabian Oryx is one of the first animals reintroduced via a captive breeding program.]]
Captive breeding techniques began with the first human domestication of animals such as goats, and plants like wheat, at least 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/domestication/|title=domestication|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices were then expanded with the rise of the first [[zoo]]s, which started as royal menageries in Egypt&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://daily.jstor.org/leopards-hippos-cats-oh-worlds-first-zoo/|title=The World's First Zoo {{!}} JSTOR Daily|date=2015-11-12|work=JSTOR Daily|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its popularity, which led to the increase in zoos worldwide. The first actual captive breeding programs were only started in the 1960s. These programs, such as the [[Arabian oryx|Arabian Oryx]] breeding program from The Phoenix Zoo in 1962, were aimed at the reintroduction of these species into the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/the-loneliest-animals/captive-breeding-success-stories/4920/|title=The Loneliest Animals {{!}} Captive Breeding Success Stories {{!}} Nature {{!}} PBS|date=2009-04-01|work=Nature|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs expanded under The [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] of the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|Nixon Administration]], which focused on protecting endangered species and their habitats to preserve biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animallaw.info/articles/dduszoos.htm|title=Detailed Discussion of the Laws Affecting Zoos {{!}} Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, research and conservation centers have been housed in zoos, such as the Institute for Conservation Research at the San Diego Zoo founded in 1975 and expanded in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2008-06-28|title=BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF SAN DIEGO|journal=International Zoo Yearbook|volume=3|issue=1|pages=126–127|doi=10.1111/j.1748-1090.1962.tb03439.x|issn=0074-9664}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have contributed to the successful conservation efforts of species such as the [[Hawaiian crow|Hawaiian Crow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://institute.sandiegozoo.org/species/alala|title='Alala|date=2015-09-18|work=San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordination==
The breeding of species of conservation concern is coordinated by cooperative breeding programs containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective. These studbooks contain information on birth date, gender, location, and lineage (if known), which helps determine survival and reproduction rates, number of founders of the population, and inbreeding coefficients.&lt;ref name=smithsonian&gt;{{cite web| title = Captive Breeding Populations| work = [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]]| url = http://nationalzoo.si.edu/scbi/endangeredspecies/capbreedpops/default.cfm| deadurl = yes| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100612095538/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm| archive-date = 2010-06-12| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A species coordinator reviews the information in studbooks and determines a breeding strategy that would produce most advantageous offspring.

If two compatible animals are found at different zoos, the animals may be transported for mating, but this is stressful, which could in turn make mating less likely. However, this is still a popular breeding method among European zoological organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = European Association of Zoos and Aquaria| title = EEPs and ESBs| date = 2015-02-05| url=http://www.eaza.net/activities/cp/Pages/EEPs.aspx | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205074701/http://www.eaza.net/activities/cp/Pages/EEPs.aspx | archive-date=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artificial fertilization]] (by shipping semen) is another option, but male animals can experience stress during semen collection, and the same goes for females during the artificial insemination procedure. Furthermore, this approach yields lower-quality semen, because shipping requires extending the life of the sperm for the transit time.

== Challenges ==

===Genetics===
The objective of many captive populations is to hold similar levels of  genetic diversity to what is found in wild populations. As captive populations are usually small and maintained in artificial environments, genetics factors such as adaptation, inbreeding and loss of diversity can be a major concern.

==== [[Domestication]] (Adaptation) ====
Adaptive differences between plant and animal populations arise due to variations in environmental pressures. In the case of captive breeding prior to reintroduction into the wild, it's possible for species to evolve to adapt to the captive environment, rather than their natural environment.[11] Reintroducing a plant or animal to an environment dissimilar to the one they were originally from can cause fixation of traits that may not be suited for that environment leaving the individual disadvantaged. Selection intensity, initial genetic diversity, and effective population size can impact how much the species adapts to its captive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2007.03399.x |pmid=18173504 |title=Genetic adaptation to captivity in species conservation programs |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=325–33 |year=2008 |last1=Frankham |first1=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modeling works indicate that the duration of the programs (i.e., time from the foundation of the captive population to the last release event) is an important determinant of reintroduction success. Success is maximized for intermediate project duration allowing the release of a sufficient number of individuals, while minimizing the number of generations undergoing relaxed selection in captivity.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2009.07.016 |title=Captive breeding genetics and reintroduction success |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=142 |issue=12 |pages=2915–22 |year=2009 |last1=Robert |first1=Alexandre }}&lt;/ref&gt; Can be minimized by reducing the number of generations in captivity, minimizing selection for captive adaptations by creating environment similar to natural environment and maximizing the number of immigrants from wild populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to conservation genetics |year=2010 |first1=Richard |last1=Frankham |first2=J D |last2=Ballou |first3=David A |last3=Briscoe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87847-0 |edition=2nd |location=Cambridge |oclc=268793768 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Genetic diversity ====
One consequence of small captive population size is the increased impact of [[genetic drift]], where genes have the potential to fix or disappear completely by chance, thereby reducing genetic diversity. Other factors that can impact genetic diversity in a captive population are bottlenecks and initial population size. [[Population bottleneck|Bottlenecks]], such as rapid decline in the population or a small initial population impacts genetic diversity. Loss can be minimized by establishing a population with a large enough number of founders to genetically represent the wild population, maximize population size, maximize ratio of effective population size to actual population size, and minimize the number of generations in captivity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== [[Inbreeding]] ====
Inbreeding is when organisms mate with closely related individuals, lowering [[Zygosity|heterozygosity]] in a population. Although inbreeding can be relatively common, when it results in a reduction in fitness it is known as [[inbreeding depression]]. The detrimental effects of inbreeding depression are especially prevalent in smaller populations and can therefore be extensive in captive populations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalinowski|first=Steven T.|date=2018|title=Inbreeding Depression in the Speke's Gazelle Captive Breeding Program|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=14|pages=1375–1384|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make these populations the most viable, it is important to monitor and reduce the effects of deleterious allele expression caused by inbreeding depression and to restore genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Comparing inbred populations against non-inbred or less-inbred populations can help determine the extent of detrimental effects if any are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grueber|first=Catherine E.|date=2015|title=Impacts of early viability selection on management if inbreeding and genetic diversity in conservation|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|pages=962–1083|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely monitoring the possibility of inbreeding within the captive bred population is also key to the success of reintroduction into the species' native habitat. [[File:Speke's Gazelle.jpg|thumb|The Speke's Gazelle was the focus of a captive breeding program centered on determining the effect of selection on reducing genetic load.]]

===== [[Outbreeding depression|Outbreeding]] =====
Outbreeding is when organisms mate with unrelated individuals, increasing heterozygosity in a population. Although new diversity is often beneficial, if there a large genetic differences between the two individuals it can result in outbreeding depression. This is a reduction in fitness, similar to that of inbreeding depression, but arises from a number of different mechanisms, including taxonomic issues, chromosomal differences, sexual incompatibility, or adaptive differences between the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=Richard|date=2011|title=Predicting the Probability of Outbreeding Depression|url=|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=25|pages=465–475|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common cause is chromosomal ploidy differences and hybridization between individuals leading to sterility. The best example is in the [[orangutan]], which, prior to taxonomic revisions in the 1980s would be commonly mated in captive populations producing [[hybrid orangutan]]s with lower fitness {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}. If chromosomal ploidy is ignored during reintroduction, restoration efforts would fail due to sterile hybrids in the wild. If there are large genetic differences between individuals originally from distant populations, those individuals should only be bred in circumstances where no other mates exist.

====Behavior Changes====
Captive breeding can contribute to changes in behavior in animals that have been reintroduced to the wild. Released animals are commonly less capable of hunting or foraging for food, which leads to [[starvation]], possibly because the young animals spent the critical learning period in captivity. Released animals often display more risk-taking behavior and fail to avoid [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McPhee|first=M. Elsbeth|date=2003|title=Generations in captivity increases behavioral variance: considerations for captive breeding and reintroduction programs|url=https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/mcpheem/private-docs/cv-documents/McPhee%202003%20BC.pdf|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=115|pages=71–77|via=|doi=10.1016/s0006-3207(03)00095-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Golden lion tamarin]] mothers often die in the wild before having [[offspring]] because they cannot climb and forage. This leads to continuing population declines despite [[reintroduction]] as the species are unable to produce [[:wikt:viable|viable]] [[offspring]]. Training can improve anti-predator skills, but its effectiveness varies.&lt;ref name="JJWPT91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CB2000" /&gt;

Salmon bred in captivity have shown similar declines in caution and are killed by predators when young. However, salmon that were reared in an enriched environment with natural prey showed less risk-taking behaviors and were more likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-07-01|title=Environmental enrichment reduces maladaptive risk-taking behavior in salmon reared for conservation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711001571|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=144|issue=7|pages=1972–1979|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2011.04.017|issn=0006-3207|last1=Roberts|first1=L.J.|last2=Taylor|first2=J.|last3=Garcia De Leaniz|first3=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[Mouse|mice]] has found that after captive breeding had been in place for multiple generations and these mice were "released" to breed with wild mice, that the captive-born mice bred amongst themselves instead of with the wild mice. This suggests that captive breeding may affect mating preferences, and has implications for the success of a reintroduction program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slade B, Parrott ML, Paproth A, Magrath MJ, Gillespie GR, Jessop TS | title = Assortative mating among animals of captive and wild origin following experimental conservation releases | journal = Biology Letters | volume = 10 | issue = 11 | pages = 20140656 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25411380 | pmc = 4261860 | doi = 10.1098/rsbl.2014.0656 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Black Robin on Rangatira Island.jpg|thumb|Chatham Island Black Robin on Rangatira Island, New Zealand.]]
Human mediated recovery of species can unintentionally promote maladaptive behaviors in wild populations. In 1980 the number of wild Chatham Island Black Robins was reduced to a single mating pair. Intense management of populations helped the population recover and by 1998 there were 200 individuals. During recovery scientists observed "rim laying" an egg laying habit where individuals laid eggs on the rim of the nest instead of the center. Rim laid eggs never hatched. To combat this land managers pushed the egg to the center of the nest, which greatly increased reproduction. However, by allowing this maladaptive trait to persist, over half the population were now rim layers. Genetic studies found that this was an autosomal dominant mendelian trait that was selected for due to human intervention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massaro|first=Melanie|last2=Sainudiin|first2=Raazesh|last3=Merton|first3=Don|last4=Briskie|first4=James V.|last5=Poole|first5=Anthony M.|last6=Hale|first6=Marie L.|date=2013-12-09|title=Human-Assisted Spread of a Maladaptive Behavior in a Critically Endangered Bird|journal=PLOS One|language=en|volume=8|issue=12|pages=e79066|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079066|pmid=24348992|pmc=3857173|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successes==
[[File:Cheetah at De Wildt Cheetah Farm, Hartbeespoort, North West Province (6253206366).jpg|thumb|A cheetah at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre.]]
The [[De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre]], established in [[South Africa]] in 1971, has a [[cheetah]] captive breeding program. Between 1975 and 2005, 242 litters were born with a total of 785 cubs. The [[survival rate]] of cubs was 71.3% for the first twelve months and 66.2% for older cubs, validating the fact that cheetahs can be bred successfully (and their [[endangerment]] decreased). It also indicated that failure in other breeding habitats may be due to "poor" sperm [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref name=RDA08/&gt;

Wild [[Tasmanian devil]]s have declined by 90% due to a [[Transmissible cancers|transmissible cancer]] called [[Devil Facial Tumor Disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://discovermagazine.com/2014/may/13-the-immortal-devil|title = Fatal Cancer Threatens Tasmanian Devil Populations|last = Rehmeyer|first = Julie|date = March 31, 2014|work = [[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A captive insurance population program has started, but the captive breeding rates at the moment are lower than they need to be. Keeley, Fanson, Masters, and McGreevy (2012) sought to "increase our understanding of the [[estrous cycle]] of the devil and elucidate potential causes of failed male-female pairings" by examining temporal patterns of fecal [[progestogen]] and [[corticosterone]] [[metabolite]] concentrations. They found that the majority of unsuccessful females were captive-born, suggesting that if the species' survival depended solely on captive breeding, the population would probably disappear.&lt;ref name=keeley2012/&gt;

In 2010, the [[Oregon Zoo]] found that [[Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit]] pairings based on familiarity and preferences resulted in a significant increase in breeding success.&lt;ref name=oz130214/&gt;

== Methods Used in Captive Breeding ==
{{See also|Artificial_insemination#In_animals}}
[[File:Californian Condor 50 MC.jpg|thumb|Every known individual of the California condor population has been captured and then bred using research from microsatellite regions in their genome.]]
To found a captive breeding population with adequate [[genetic diversity]], breeders usually select individuals from different source populations—ideally, at least 20-30 individuals. Founding populations for captive breeding programs have often had fewer individuals than ideal because of their threatened state, leaving them more susceptible to challenges such as inbreeding depression.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

To overcome challenges of captive breeding such as adaptive differences, loss of genetic diversity, inbreeding depression, and outbreeding depression and get desired results, captive breeding programs use many monitoring methods. [[Artificial insemination]] is used to produce the desired offspring from individuals who don't mate naturally to reduce effects of mating closely related individuals such as inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Conservation Genetics . Cambridge University Press. Kindle Edition.|last=Frankham|first=Richard|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-87847-0|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods as seen in [[panda pornography]] allow programs to mate chosen individuals by encouraging mating behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/22/AR2006112202039.html|title=Pandas Getting New View of Mating Ritual|last=Gray|first=Denis D.|date=2006-11-23|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a concern in captive breeding is to minimize the effects of breeding closely related individuals, [[microsatellite]] regions from an organisms genome can be used to determine amounts of relationship among founders to minimize relatedness and pick the most distant individuals to breed.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; This method has successfully been used in the captive breeding of the [[California condor]] and the [[Guam rail]]. The maximum avoidance of inbreeding (MAI) scheme allows control at a group level rather than an individual level by rotating individuals between groups to avoid inbreeding.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

==New technologies==

=== Assisted reproduction technology (ART): Artificial insemination ===

Getting captive wild animals to breed naturally can be a difficult task. Giant panda for example lose interest in [[mating]] once they are captured, and female giant pandas only experience estrus once a year, which only lasts for 48 to 72 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/2015/03/11/giant-panda-undergoes-artificial-insemination-procedure-at-the-san-diego-zoo|title=Giant Panda Undergoes Artificial Insemination Procedure at the Sand Diego Zoo|last=|first=|date=2015-03-11|website=Zoonooz|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers have turned to artificial insemination in an attempt to increase the populations of endangered animals. It may be used for many reasons, including to overcome physical breeding difficulties, to allow a male to inseminate a much larger number of females, to control the paternity of offspring, and to avoid injury incurred during natural mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/insemination.htm|title=Artificial Insemination of the Mare|last=|first=|date=|website=Equine Artificial Insemination|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates more genetically diverse captive populations, enabling captive facilities to easily share genetic material with each other without the need to move animals. Scientist of the Justus-Liebig-University of Giessen, Germany, from the working group of Michael Lierz, developed a novel technique for semen collection and artificial insemination in parrots producing the world's first macaw by assisted reproduction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.realclearscience.com/journal_club/2013/06/25/finally_a_way_to_collect_semen_from_parrots_106573.html|title=Finally: A Way to Collect Semen from Parrots|last=Pomeroy|first=Ross|date=June 24, 2013|website=Real Clear Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryopreservation ===

Animal species can be preserved in [[Genebank|gene banks]], which consist of [[cryogenic|a cryogenic]] facilities used to store live [[Spermatozoon|sperm]], [[Ovum|eggs]], or [[embryo]]s in ultracold conditions. The Zoological Society of San Diego has established a "[[frozen zoo]]" to store frozen tissue from the world's rarest and most endangered species samples using [[cryopreservation]] techniques. At present, there has been more than 355 species, including mammals, reptiles, and birds.[[Cryopreservation]] can be performed as [[oocyte cryopreservation]] before fertilization, or as [[embryo cryopreservation]] after fertilization. Cryogenically preserved specimens can potentially be used to revive breeds that are [[Endangered species|endangered]] o r[[Extinction|extinct]], for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. This method can be used for virtually indefinite storage of material without deterioration over a much greater time-period relative to all other methods of ex situ conservation. However, cryo-conservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. Cryo-conservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3017e/i3017e00.htm|title=Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cryobiology is a field of active research and many studies concerning plants are underway.

An example of the use of cryoconservation to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the [[Hungarian Grey cattle]], or Magya Szurke. Hungarian Grey cattle were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9 million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of [[World War II]] and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12581284|title=Economic and ecological importance of indigenous livestock and the application of assisted reproduction to their preservation| vauthors = Solti L, Crichton EG, Loskutoff N, Cseh S | date = 2000-02-01|volume=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the [[Mechanised agriculture|mechanization of agriculture]] and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwf.hu/en/hungarian-grey-cattle|title=WWF|website=wwf.hu|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the cryopreservation of semen and embryos.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using cryoconservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/dad-is/en/|title=Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) {{!}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloning ===

The best current cloning techniques have an average success rate of 9.4 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ono T, Li C, Mizutani E, Terashita Y, Yamagata K, Wakayama T | title = Inhibition of class IIb histone deacetylase significantly improves cloning efficiency in mice | journal = Biology of Reproduction | volume = 83 | issue = 6 | pages = 929–37 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20686182 | doi = 10.1095/biolreprod.110.085282 | url = https://academic.oup.com/biolreprod/article/83/6/929/2530195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when working with familiar species such as mice, while cloning wild animals is usually less than 1 percent successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cloning-endangered-animals/|title=Will Cloning Ever Save Endangered Animals?|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last bucardo ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah. However, cloning of animals is opposed by animal-groups due to the number of cloned animals that suffer from malformations before they die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1333206/Clone-farming-introduce-cruelty-massive-scale-say-animal-welfare-groups.html|title=Clone farming would introduce cruelty on a massive scale, say animal welfare groups|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interspecific pregnancy ===

A potential technique for aiding in reproduction of endangered species is [[interspecific pregnancy]], implanting embryos of an endangered species into the womb of a female of a related species, carrying it to term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Niasari-Naslaji A, Nikjou D, Skidmore JA, Moghiseh A, Mostafaey M, Razavi K, Moosavi-Movahedi AA |date=2009-01-29|title=Interspecies embryo transfer in camelids: the birth of the first Bactrian camel calves (Camelus bactrianus) from dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius)|url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/rd/RD08140|journal=Reproduction, Fertility and Development|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=333–337|doi=10.1071/RD08140|issn=1448-5990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used for the Spanish Ibex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02900547 |title=Advances in interspecific pregnancy |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |volume=46 |issue=21 |pages=1772–8 |year=2001 |last1=Wang |first1=Xichao |last2=Dai |first2=Bojie |last3=Duan |first3=Enkui |last4=Chen |first4=Dayuan }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Houbara bustard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wernery U, Liu C, Baskar V, Guerineche Z, Khazanehdari KA, Saleem S, Kinne J, Wernery R, Griffin DK, Chang IK | title = Primordial germ cell-mediated chimera technology produces viable pure-line Houbara bustard offspring: potential for repopulating an endangered species | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 12 | pages = e15824 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21209914 | pmc = 3012116 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0015824 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical Considerations ==
With successes such as in 1986 when a population only of 18 black ferrets left in the world was brought back up to 500 in the wild, and when the Arabian oryx was brought back from extinction in 1972 to a population of 1,000 in the deserts of the Middle East, captive breeding programs have proven successful throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://psmag.com/environment/is-breeding-endangered-species-in-captivity-the-right-way-to-go|title=Is Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity the Right Way to Go?|work=Pacific Standard|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While captive breeding sounds like an ideal solution for preventing endangered animals from facing serious threats of extinction there are still reasons to believe that these programs can occasionally do more harm than good. Some detrimental effects include delays in understanding optimal conditions required for reproduction, failure to reach self-sustaining levels or provide sufficient stock for release, loss of genetic diversity due to inbreeding, and poor success in reintroductions despite available captive-bred young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12449 |title=Ark or park: The need to predict relative effectiveness ofex situandin situconservation before attempting captive breeding |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=841–50 |year=2015 |last1=Dolman |first1=Paul M |last2=Collar |first2=Nigel J |last3=Scotland |first3=Keith M |last4=Burnside |first4=Robert. J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it has been proven that captive breeding programs have yielded negative genetic effects in decreasing the fitness of captive-bred organisms, there is no direct evidence to show that this negative effect also decreases the overall fitness of their wild-born descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0315 |pmid=19515651 |pmc=2781957 |title=Carry-over effect of captive breeding reduces reproductive fitness of wild-born descendants in the wild |journal=Biology Letters |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=621–4 |year=2009 |last1=Araki |first1=H |last2=Cooper |first2=B |last3=Blouin |first3=M. S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is reason to demand for the release of animals from captivity programs for four main reasons: a lack of sufficient space due to overly successful breeding programs, closure of facilities due to financial reasons, pressure from animal rights advocacy groups, and to aid the conservation of endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waples|first=Kelly A.|last2=Stagoll|first2=Clifford S. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1997|title=Ethical Issues in the Release of Animals from Captivity|journal=BioScience|volume=47|issue=2|pages=115–121|doi=10.2307/1313022|jstor=1313022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there are many ethical complications to reintroducing animals born in captivity back into the wild. For example, when scientists were reintroducing a rare species of toad back into the Mallorcan wild in 1993, a potentially deadly fungus that could kill frogs and toads was unintentionally introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/09/080922122427.htm|title=Captive Breeding Introduced Infectious Disease To Mallorcan Amphibians|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to maintain the organism’s original habitat, or replicate that specific habitat for species survival.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12923">A '''center of origin''' (or '''center of diversity''') is a geographical area where a group of organisms, either domesticated or wild, first developed its distinctive properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture |url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i0510e.pdf |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=2009|page=Article 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also considered centers of diversity. Centers of origin were first identified in 1924 by [[Nikolai Vavilov]].

==Plants==
Locating the origin of crop plants is basic to [[plant breeding]].  This allows one to locate wild relatives, related species, and new genes (especially dominant [[genes]], which may provide resistance to diseases).
Knowledge of the origins of crop plants is important in order to avoid [[genetic erosion]], the loss of germplasm due to the loss of ecotypes and landraces, loss of habitat (such as rainforests), and increased urbanization. Germplasm preservation is accomplished through [[gene banks]] (largely seed collections but now frozen stem sections) and preservation of natural habitats (especially in centers of origin).

A Vavilov Center (of Diversity) is a region of the world first indicated by [[Nikolai Vavilov]] to be an original center for the domestication of plants.&lt;ref name="cornell2000"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cornell and Polish research scientists lead effort to save invaluable potato genetic archive in Russia |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/July00/Vavilov.bpf.html |author=Blaine P.

Vavilov argued that plants were not domesticated somewhere in the world at random, but that there were regions where domestication started. The center of origin is also considered the center of diversity.

Vavilov centers are regions where a high diversity of [[crop wild relative]]s can be found, representing the natural relatives of domesticated crop plants. Later in 1935 Vavilov divided the centers into 12, giving the following list:

# Chinese center
# Indian center
# Indo-Malayan center
# Central Asiatic center
# Persian center
# Mediterranean center
# Abyssinian center
# South American center
# Central American center
# Chilean center
# Brazilian-Paraguayan center
# North American center

==Importance==

In 2016, researchers linked the origins and primary regions of diversity ("areas typically including the locations of the initial domestication of crops, encompassing the primary geographical zones of crop variation generated since that time, and containing relatively high species richness in crop wild relatives") of food and agricultural crops with their current importance around the world in modern national food supplies and agricultural production. The results indicated that foreign crops were 68.7% of national food supplies as a global mean, and their usage has greatly increased in the last fifty years.&lt;ref name=Khouryorigins&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Achicanoy, H.A. |author3=Bjorkman, A.D. |author4=Navarro-Racines, C. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Flores-Palacios, X. |author7=Engels, J.M.M. |author8=Wiersema, J.H. |author9=Dempewolf, H. |author10=Sotelo, S. |author11=Ramírez-Villegas, J. |author12=Castañeda-Álvarez, N.P. |author13=Fowler, C. |author14=Jarvis, A. |author15=Rieseberg, L.H. |author16=Struik, P.C. |title=Origins of food crops connect countries worldwide |journal=Proc.

*metal objects, from the controlled area and maintenance of [[Nuclear decommissioning|nuclear decommissioning;]]
*waste fuels, mainly gloves and coveralls;
*liquid [[Wastewater|waste]] such as washing solutions, [[oil]]s, [[solvent]]s, and resins and sludge from nuclear installations.

== Waste Treatment ==

The main goal is to minimize the volume before packaging, plant Centraco consists of two main units that deal with waste by type:

*The melting of metals
*The incineration plant for fuel and effluents.

Residues from each unit are mixed with a matrix and then packaged. The final volume of waste is reduced by a factor of 10 to 17.

=== The incineration plant ===

This furnace consists of three rooms:

*The primary chamber: the temperature there is 900-1000&amp;nbsp;°C
*The secondary chamber: the temperature of 1100–1200&amp;nbsp;°C
*The tertiary room

Solid waste is fed into the primary chamber. By cons, liquid waste is injected either in the primary chamber, or in the secondary chamber according to their chemical composition.

The [[Wood ash|ash]] and [[Clinker (waste)|slag]] are collected and linked in a "glue" by the method of inerting cold. They are then packed in metal drums and shipped to the National Agency for Radioactive Waste (ANDRA).

The incinerator has a rated capacity of 5000&amp;nbsp;tons / year of waste.

An explosion September 12, 2011 caused the death of an employee, and injured four others. This has happened in a furnace at the site of reprocessing nuclear waste Marcoule. It was an "industrial accident" and not "nuclear accident".

=== The furnace ===

The [[Foundry|smelter]] includes an [[induction furnace]] for the manufacture of [[ingots]] and metal [[ferrules]]. The metals are melted in the furnace at 1600&amp;nbsp;°C. Impurities are removed manually, then the molten metal is poured into a ladle and is then cast into ingots or centrifuged in a tube.

The ingots, conical cylinders of about 1.5 t are considered as final waste and are sent to the Center of storage l'Aube in [[Soulaines-Dhuys]] for a long-term storage.

The tubes are reused for the manufacture of packaging for medium-level waste such as concrete shells or internal shielding of barrels, allowing the partial recovery of the waste.

A shuttle bus travels between the two units to transfer the waste into the proper unit after sorting.

The '''Chief of Naval Research''' is the senior military officer in charge of scientific research in the [[United States Navy]].  The Chief of Naval Research has a rank of Rear Admiral, and is in charge of the [[Office of Naval Research]].&lt;ref name="USC"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|10|5022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief of Naval Research has responsibility for [[basic research]], [[applied research]], and advanced technology development components of the Navy's [[research and development]] programs (the first three of the seven categories used in the Department of Defense research and development budget, often referred to as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively), as well as the Navy's [[intellectual property]] policy.  The Chief of Naval Research also coordinates with other research and development agencies within the Department of the Navy, such as the Naval Warfare Centers of the Naval [[Systems command|Systems Command]]s.&lt;ref name="USC"/&gt;

Other positions in the Office of Naval Research leadership include the Vice Chief of Naval Research (a one-star admiral), the Assistant Chief of Naval Research and Commanding Officer of ONR Global (both captains), and the Executive Director and Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Research (both civilians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/About-ONR/Leadership.aspx|publisher=U.S. Office of Naval Research|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chief of Naval Research reports directly to the civilian [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition)]], and is thus not organizationally subordinate to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], the senior military officer in the entire Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy Organization: The Secretary of the Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/organization/org-sec.asp|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASN(RDA) Overall Structure|url=http://www.secnav.navy.mil/rda/Pages/ASNRDAOrgChart.aspx|publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition)|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sapolsky2014" /&gt;

==History==
The predecessor to the Office of Naval Research was the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development, an institution within the Navy during [[World War II]] meant to coordinate between the military-wide [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD), [[United States Navy bureau system|Navy materiel bureaus]], and civilian research organizations.  The organization was formed in 1941 and was nicknamed the "Bird Dogs" due to their skill at finding and solving interorganizational problems.  [[Jerome Clarke Hunsaker]] was interim chief, followed by Rear Admiral [[Julius A. Furer]].  OSRD was disbanded after the war, and the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development was incorporated into the new Navy Office of Research and Inventions, headed by Harold Bowen, which became the Office of Naval Research in 1945.&lt;ref name="OCRD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buderi|first1=Robert|title=Naval innovation for the 21st century : the Office of Naval Research since the end of the Cold War|date=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|isbn=9781612513065|pages=21–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWRVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

==Circassian features==

An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989. [http://johncolarusso.net/pdf/Prometheus_among_the_Circassians.pdf  "Prometheus among the Circassians"]. In ''The World &amp; I''. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a lithe and erect physique were favored for Circassians, and many villages had large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colarusso |first=John |date=March 1989 |title=Prometheus among the Circassians: A modern oral tale from a little known people of the Caucasus shows striking parallels with myths from Ancient Greece, Ancient India and the pagan Germanic world |magazine=[[World and I]] |publisher=[[The Washington Times|Washington Times Publishing Corporation]] |volume= |issue= |pages=644–651 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Henry Lindlahr]]'s words in the early 20th century, "Blue-eyed Caucasian regiments today form the cream of the Sultan's army. Circassian beauties are admired for their abundant and luxuriant yellow hair and blue eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindlahr |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Lindlahr |date=1974 |orig-year=1919 |chapter=Iris color and Mental Characteristics |title=Natural Therapeutics: Iridiagnosis and Other Diagnostic Methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ky6m_hnfaIC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;vq=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;dq=Blue-eyed%20Caucasian%20regiments%20today%20form%20the%20cream%20of%20the%20Sultan's%20army.&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;f=false |location=Pomeroy, WA |publisher=Health Research Books |page=32 |isbn=978-0-787-30563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

== Activities ==

=== Alternative Energy Summit ===

The Alliance organizes an Alternative Energy Summit annually to discuss energy and climate policy issues.

In a April 2016 media report over the future of [[RWE]], an Alliance expert stated that the power company had become completely unprofitable after failing to adapt to the [[Energiewende in Germany|German Energiewende]].&lt;ref name="muenten-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berlin Climate Talks ===

Since November 2015, the Alliance has organized the Berlin Climate Talks.  The format is now four per year, each with a different theme.  The launch event was devoted to civil society proposals for a more climate-friendly aviation concept for Germany.

=== Anti-Coal Campaign ===

Started in 2008, the most important campaign for the Alliance is the Anti-Coal Campaign.  The campaign coordinates and supports civil society activities to prevent new coal power plants from being built in Germany.  Coal is more carbon intensive than other fossil fuels, so that even the most advanced lignite-fired power plant discharges twice as much {{co2}} as a gas-fired power plant.  Coal power plants have a lifetime of 40–50 years and create high {{co2}} emissions throughout their lives.  Without a coal phase-out, the Alliance questions whether the German government can meet its future {{co2}} emissions targets.

Following a [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[lignite]] mining in the [[Lusatia|Lausitz]] in September 2013, a petition of 112,157 signatures in support was handed to the Lausitz authorities.  Daniela Setton, an energy policy speaker from the Alliance, commented that it was the most successful collection of signatures against a new German opencast mine ever.&lt;ref name="deutschlandradio-2013"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Alliance co-authored and co-published a report on the top 30 most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe and called for their decommissioning.&lt;ref name="gutmann-etal-2014"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The report, co-authored by [[:de:Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies|IASS Potsdam]], argues that the financial resources needed to remedy the damage caused by lignite mining are not adequately backed up by the existing mining operators [[Vattenfall]] (who later sold its lignite-fired plants and mines to [[Energetický a průmyslový holding|EPH]]), [[RWE]], and [[:de:MIBRAG|MIBRAG]].

=== Global Climate Day of Action ===

For the annual Global Climate Day of Action, the Alliance organizes nationwide demonstrations for the general public, to protest at the lack of environmental awareness in politics and the economy and to encourage climate protection measures.

Alliance spokesperson Katharina Reuter, in an interview with [[Deutschlandfunk]] in December 2011, criticized the exit by [[Canada]] from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="geers-2011"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Networking and training ===

In addition to activist activities, the Alliance mediates and maintains the substantive and tactical networks of its member organizations and with other civil society actors.  In addition, the Alliance offers its members opportunities for further development, for example through specific seminars.

The ''' conservation and restoration of vinyl discs''' refers to the preventive measures taken to defend against damage and slow degradation, and to maintain [[fidelity]] of singles, 12" singles, EP, LP in  45 or 33⅓ rpm [[Gramophone record|disc]] [[Sound recording and reproduction|recordings]]. LPs are most often in the 12” format, although very early [[gramophone record|vinyl]] recordings were 10”. Vinyl LP preservation is generally considered separate from conservation, which refers to the repair and stabilization of individual discs. Commonly practiced in major sound archives and research [[libraries]] that house large collections of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] recordings, it is also frequently followed by [[audiophiles]] and home record collectors. Because [[Vinyl group|vinyl]]—a virtually unbreakable light plastic made up of polyvinyl chloride acetate copolymer, or [[PVC]]—is considered the most stable of analog recording media, it is seen as less a concern for deterioration than earlier sound recordings made from more fragile materials such as acetate, vulcanite, or [[shellac]]. This hardly means that vinyl recordings are infallible, however, and research—both expert and evidential—has shown that the way in which discs are handled and cared for can have a profound effect on their [[longevity]]. Though some [[Gramophone record|45s]] (7”s) are also made from vinyl, many of them are actually [[polystyrene]]—a more fragile medium that is prone to fracturing from internal stress.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 42. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979. '', page 42&lt;/ref&gt; Still, many of the recommendations for the care of vinyl LPs can be applied to 45s.

== Historical development and standards ==

In 1959—roughly a decade after [[gramophone record|vinyl]] LPs first became widely available to [[consumer]]s—the [[Library of Congress]] published ''Preservation of Sound Recordings'' (A.G. Pickett and M.M. Lemcoe), the first and most extensive investigation of the deterioration of grooved discs and [[magnetic tape]]. Funded by a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], the purpose of the investigation was to establish suitable guidelines for the storage and preservation of [[sound recordings]] for libraries. Conducted at the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, the study involved subjecting sound recordings to a series of lab tests, from accelerated aging to fungal exposure. Though considered the definitive study in the field, the chemical makeup of [[plastics]] and how they perform under stress was the primary focus of the report, whereas playback deterioration—a significant concern to sound archivists and record collectors—was excluded from the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Pickett, A. G., and M. M. Lemcoe. ''Preservation and Storage of Sound Recordings,'' page iv. Washington: Library of Congress, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings'' (Jerry McWilliams), published in 1979 by the American Association of State and Local History, did include information about disc wear through playback, and is still a practical source of information on sound recording preservation. A comprehensive manual based on reports gathered from library professionals, sound [[archivists]], audio engineers, and other experts, it included information on such topics as disc damage from frequency of use, stylus wear, and inferior or improperly adjusted equipment.

In 1986 the Association of Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC) Associated Archives (AAA) Committee received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] to conduct an in-depth study in order to identify the problems of preservation and access for sound recordings. Their 860-page report, titled ''Audio Preservation, A Planning Study'' was published in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Swartzburg, Susan G. ''Preserving Library Materials: A Manual," page 201. N.J.: Scarecrow Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the shift from [[Analog signal|analog]] to [[digital recording]], research in the preservation of sound recordings has been in serious decline. Gerald L. Gibson, the head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the [[Library of Congress]] expressed his concern on this issue in 1991, by referencing an investigation on the effects of fire on sound and audiovisual recordings as some of the only new research being done on the topic, stating, “Comparatively little is known about the preservation, conservation, aging problems, or properties of sound recordings…virtually no independent work is going on in these areas.” (Gerald L. Gibson, Head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 27 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though guidelines and recommendations for the care, handling, and proper storage of vinyl LPs are available from such resources as The Library of Congress and the [[National Library of Canada]], to this date there are no nationally agreed upon standards for audio preservation.&lt;ref name=arl&gt;Association of Research Libraries, [http://www.arl.org/bm~doc/stsrfinal.pdf Letter to National Recording Preservation Board], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2007, a five-page letter was sent to the National Recording Preservation Board at the Library of Congress on behalf of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) in support of a study on the current state of recorded sound preservation in the United States, stating “the lack of agreed upon standards and commonly accepted best practices presents a major barrier to effective audio preservation.”(Prudence S. Adler, Associate Executive Director and Karla L. Hahn, Director, Office of Scholarly Communication, Association of Research Libraries, Jan. 2007)&lt;ref name=arl /&gt;

== Recommendations ==

Though recommendations for LP preservation differ among professionals, the majority are in agreement on some basic [[guidelines]]: discs need to be kept clean, stored in such a way to prevent distortion, and maintained in a stable, climate-controlled environment. Routine [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of [[Phonograph|turntable]] equipment including regular inspection of the weight, tracking, and condition of the [[stylus]] is also advised.

=== Cleaning ===

Though proper methods are debated, [[Parts cleaning|cleaning]] is extremely important in maintaining the [[fidelity]] of LPs. As Gibson stated, “As with most things in the field, there is very little certainty regarding cleaning. What is known is based on trial-and-error, not upon controlled, scientific study…however, one thing is certain: playing a dirty recording, regardless of its format, is one of the most damaging things you can do to it.”(Gerald L. Gibson, Head of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, 1991)&lt;ref name="Gibson, Gerald D. 1991"&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 32 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is imperative that LPs be kept free from foreign matter deposits. [[Oils]] from fingerprints, adhesives, and soot are damaging, as are air [[pollutants]] like cigarette smoke. Even [[Petroleum|grease]] from cooking can deposit itself on LPs. Probably the number one contributor to damage, however, is ordinary household [[dust]]. Dust can become embedded permanently into the disc’s grooves, causing distortion of the transmitting signal, ticks, pops, and inferior sound quality. Vinyl discs can become so dirty and scratched that they are virtually unlistenable.

It is recommended that discs be cleaned before—and after—each playback, carbon-fibre brushes are quite effective. Records should be cleaned in a circular motion, in the direction of the grooves. [[Distilled water]] (not tap water as it will leave behind mineral deposits) and a soft, lint-free cloth is a common method of cleaning. Another method is to clean the LP on the turntable with a disc cleaning brush (the Discwasher system is frequently recommended by the audio press).&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 60. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple "cleaning bath" device called the Spin Clean gives good results,{{according to whom|date=November 2015}}  and there are also vacuum machines on the market such as the Nitty Gritty, Keith Monks, Clearaudio, and VPI, which are recommended for more a thorough cleaning.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Gerald D. 1991"/&gt; In recent years, ultrasonic cleaning machines from manufacturers such as Klaudio (Korea) and Audio Desk Systeme (Germany) have also been used with great success. The effectiveness of the ultrasonic machines coupled with their premium price tags (both $4,000 US in January 2015) has opened the door for companies to offer professional ultrasonic cleaning at an affordable cost of just a few dollars per record.&lt;ref&gt;Stereophile review of Audio Desk Systeme Vinyl Cleaner [http://www.stereophile.com/content/audio-desk-systeme-vinyl-cleaner] Websites for professional ultrasonic cleaning service  [http://originalsvinyl.com][http://recordgenie.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Another cleaning product recently released called Record Revirginizer uses a polymer that is applied to record surface then left to dry, the polymer is then peeled from the surface taking the microscopic contaminants with it.&lt;ref&gt;Queensland university student restores retro records [http://newsmaker.com.au/news/2741] Official Website [http://recordrevirginizer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Though in the past, using [[alcohol]] on vinyl LPs was considered safe, experts now caution against it unless absolutely necessary, as alcohol threatens the loss of the plasticizer or stabilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 33 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; As vinyl is often prone to electrostatic charges that cause dust and debris to be attracted to its surface, anti-static products can be used if needed.

Other recommendations for the care, handling, and storage of LPs include the following:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/preserv/care/record.html Cylinder, Disc, and Tape Care in A Nutshell], Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/6/28/s28-10190e.html The Preservation of Recorded Sound Materials], National Library of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Handling ===
* When possible, use clean, white, lint-free gloves for handling.
* Handle by edge and label areas only, with the third and fourth fingers balancing the label and the thumb supporting the rim.
* Remove from jacket by bowing the jacket open and holding it against the body and letting the LP with its inner sleeve slide out gently (following the same method for removing the inner sleeve).
* Do not expose to air or light unnecessarily. Return LPs to their jackets immediately after playback.

=== Storing ===
* Store exactly vertically to prevent [[wikt:warp|warp]]ing. Spacers are recommended for every four to six inches.
* Store LPs with other LPs. Avoid mixing with other sizes such as 10″ and 7″ discs. Never use bookends.
* Store on metal shelves (as opposed to wood, which expands and contracts).
* Do not allow LPs to hang over the edge of shelves.
* Remove shrink wrap from dust jackets immediately after acquiring.
* Use polyethylene inner sleeves. Never use PVC sleeves as their chemical makeup is too close to vinyl and may cause imprints or fuse to the LP.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Gerald D. “Preservation and Conservation of Sound Recordings,” page 34 in ''Conserving and Preserving Materials in Nonbook Formats''. Henderson, Kathryn L. and William T., editors. Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Replace paper sleeves as paper deteriorates, leaving oil and paper residue.
* Store in-use LPs at a temperature of {{convert|65|to|70|F|C}}. Those in long-term storage should be kept at {{convert|45|to|50|F|C}}. Though [[relative humidity]] (RH) is considered less an issue for vinyl than other recorded media,&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 42. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; it is recommended that LPs be stored at 45 to 50% RH.

=== Playback equipment ===

* The stylus tip should be kept clean at all times. A soft, camelhair brush is recommended with a drop of Discwasher solution. Only clean from back to front.
* The stylus should be periodically inspected as it is gradually worn by use. Never play LPs with a worn stylus.
* Maintain proper tracking force. If too high, the stylus will bear down on the groove walls of the LP; if too low, the stylus will bounce in the groove.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, Jerry. ''The Preservation and Restoration of Sound Recordings,'' page 74. Nashville: American Association for State and Local History, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reformatting ===

As vinyl recordings are known to degrade after repeated playback, preservation copying is recommended for archival purposes. This is especially true for rare recordings or those that have special value. A general guideline is to digitise the recording using the appropriate stylus, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasa-web.org/tc04/audio-preservation ''Guidelines on the Production and Preservation of Digital Audio Objects'' (IASA TC04)]  International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A service copy of the recording can then be created (on CD or other format) from the preservation master. A second option is to create three copies, the second copy acting as a duplicating master and the third for public use.

A '''de Sitter universe''' is a [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], named after [[Willem de Sitter]]. It models the universe as spatially flat and neglects ordinary matter, so the dynamics of the universe are dominated by the [[cosmological constant]], thought to correspond to [[dark energy]] in our universe or the [[inflaton field]] in the [[early universe]]. According to the models of [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] and current observations of the [[accelerating universe]], the [[Lambda-CDM|concordance models of physical cosmology]] are converging on a consistent model where our universe was best described as a de Sitter universe at about a time &lt;math&gt;t = 10^{-33}&lt;/math&gt; seconds after the fiducial [[Big Bang]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]], and far [[Ultimate fate of the universe|into the future]].

==Mathematical expression==

A de Sitter universe has no ordinary matter content but with a positive [[cosmological constant]] (&lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt;) that sets the expansion rate, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. A larger cosmological constant leads to a larger expansion rate:
:&lt;math&gt;H \propto \sqrt{\Lambda} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the constants of proportionality depend on conventions.

[[File:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|Evolution of the de Sitter universe (dark blue, top curve) compared to other models.]]
It is common to describe a patch of this solution as an expanding universe of the [[Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric|FLRW]] form where the scale factor is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adler|first=Ronald|title=Introduction to General Relativity|year=1965|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|location=NY|pages=468|author2=Maurice Bazin |author3=Menahem Schiffer }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a(t) = e^{Ht} ,&lt;/math&gt;
where the constant &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble expansion rate and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time. As in all FLRW spaces, &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt;, the [[scale factor (Universe)|scale factor]], describes the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of physical spatial distances]].

Unique to universes described by the FLRW metric, a de Sitter universe has a [[Hubble Law]] that is not only consistent through all space, but also through all time (since the [[deceleration parameter]] is &lt;math&gt;q=-1&lt;/math&gt;), thus satisfying the [[perfect cosmological principle]] that assumes isotropy and homogeneity throughout space and time.  There are ways to cast de Sitter space with static coordinates (see [[de Sitter space]]), so unlike other FLRW models, de Sitter space can be thought of as a static solution to [[Einstein's equations]] even though the [[geodesic]]s followed by observers necessarily diverge as expected from the expansion of physical spatial dimensions. As a model for the universe, de Sitter's solution was not considered viable for the [[observable universe|observed universe]] until models for [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] and [[dark energy]] were developed. Before then, it was assumed that the [[Big Bang]] implied only an acceptance of the weaker [[cosmological principle]], which holds that isotropy and homogeneity apply spatially but not temporally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodelson|first=Scott|title=Modern Cosmology|year=2003|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=San Diego|isbn=978-0-12-219141-1|edition=4. [print.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential for the Universe==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
{{Weasel|section|date=April 2011}}

Because our Universe entered the [[Dark Energy Dominated Era]] about five billion years ago, our universe is probably approaching a de Sitter universe in the infinite future. If the current [[cosmic acceleration|acceleration]] of our universe is due to a cosmological constant then as the universe continues to expand all of the matter and radiation will be diluted. Eventually there will be almost nothing left but the [[vacuum energy]], tiny [[thermal fluctuations]], [[quantum fluctuations]] and our universe will have become a de Sitter universe.

==Relative expansion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
{{Weasel|section|date=April 2011}}

The exponential expansion of the scale factor means that the physical distance between any two non-accelerating observers will eventually be growing faster than the [[speed of light]]. At this point those two observers will no longer be able to make contact. Therefore, any observer in a de Sitter universe would see [[event horizon]]s beyond which that observer can never see nor learn any information. If our universe is approaching a de Sitter universe then eventually we will not be able to observe any [[galaxy|galaxies]] other than our own [[Milky Way]] (and any others in the gravitationally bound [[Local Group]], assuming they were to somehow survive to that time without merging).

==Modelling cosmic inflation==

Another application of de Sitter space is in the [[early universe]] during [[cosmic inflation]]. Many inflationary models are approximately de Sitter space and can be modelled by giving the Hubble parameter a mild time dependence. For simplicity, some calculations involving inflation in the early universe can be performed in de Sitter space rather than a more realistic inflationary universe. By using the de Sitter universe instead, where the expansion is truly exponential, there are many simplifications.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41883">'''Failure mode and effects analysis''' ('''FMEA''')—also "'''failure modes'''", plural, in many  publications—was one of the first ''highly structured, systematic'' techniques for [[failure analysis]]. It was developed by [[Reliability engineering|reliability engineers]] in the late 1950s to study problems that might arise from malfunctions of military systems. An FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study. It involves reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify failure modes, and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. There are numerous variations of such worksheets. An FMEA can be a qualitative analysis,&lt;ref&gt;System Reliability Theory: Models, Statistical Methods, and Applications, Marvin Rausand &amp; Arnljot Hoylan, Wiley Series in probability and statistics—second edition 2004, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; but may be put on a quantitative basis when mathematical [[failure rate]] models&lt;ref name="KMTay2"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tay K. M.|author2=Lim C.P. | title=n On the use of fuzzy inference techniques in assessment models: part II: industrial applications |journal=Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making  |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10700-008-9037-y |doi=10.1007/s10700-008-9037-y |volume=7 |pages=283–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; are combined with a statistical failure mode ratio database.

A few different types of FMEA analyses exist, such as:
* Functional
* Design
* Process

Sometimes FMEA is extended to [[FMECA]] (failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis) to indicate that criticality analysis is performed too.

FMEA is an [[inductive reasoning]] (forward logic) single point of failure analysis and is a core task in [[reliability engineering]], [[safety engineering]] and [[quality engineering]].

A successful FMEA activity helps identify potential failure modes based on experience with similar products and processes—or based on common physics of failure logic. It is widely used in development and manufacturing industries in various phases of the product life cycle. ''Effects analysis'' refers to studying the consequences of those failures on different system levels.

Functional analyses are needed as an input to determine correct failure modes, at all system levels, both for functional FMEA or Piece-Part (hardware) FMEA. An FMEA is used to structure Mitigation for Risk reduction based on either failure (mode) effect severity reduction or based on lowering the probability of failure or both. The FMEA is in principle a full inductive (forward logic) analysis, however the failure probability can only be estimated or reduced by understanding the ''failure mechanism''. Hence, FMEA may include information on causes of failure (deductive analysis) to reduce the possibility of occurrence by eliminating identified [[Root cause|''(root) causes'']].

== Introduction ==
The FME(C)A is a design tool used to systematically analyze postulated component failures and identify the resultant effects on system operations. The analysis is sometimes characterized as consisting of two sub-analyses, the first being the failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), and the second, the criticality analysis (CA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

FMEAs can be performed at the system, subsystem, assembly, subassembly or part level. The [[FMECA]] should be a living document during development of a hardware design. It should be scheduled and completed concurrently with the design. If completed in a timely manner, the FMECA can help guide design decisions. The usefulness of the FMECA as a design tool and in the decision-making process is dependent on the effectiveness and timeliness with which design problems are identified. Timeliness is probably the most important consideration. In the extreme case, the FMECA would be of little value to the design decision process if the analysis is performed after the hardware is built. While the FMECA identifies all part failure modes, its primary benefit is the early identification of all critical and catastrophic subsystem or system failure modes so they can be eliminated or minimized through design modification at the earliest point in the development effort; therefore, the FMECA should be performed at the system level as soon as preliminary design information is available and extended to the lower levels as the detail design progresses.

Remark: For more complete scenario modelling another type of Reliability analysis may be considered, for example [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA); a ''deductive'' (backward logic) failure analysis that may handle multiple failures within the item and/or external to the item including maintenance and logistics. It starts at higher functional / system level. A FTA may use the basic failure mode FMEA records or an effect summary as one of its inputs (the basic events). Interface hazard analysis, Human error analysis and others may be added for completion in scenario modelling.

=== Functional Failure mode and effects analysis ===
The analysis may be performed at the functional level until the design has matured sufficiently to identify specific hardware that will perform the functions; then the analysis should be extended to the hardware level. When performing the hardware level FMECA, interfacing hardware is considered to be operating within specification. In addition, each part failure postulated is considered to be the only failure in the system (i.e., it is a single failure analysis). In addition to the FMEAs done on systems to evaluate the impact lower level failures have on system operation, several other FMEAs are done. Special attention is paid to interfaces between systems and in fact at all functional interfaces. The purpose of these FMEAs is to assure that irreversible physical and/or functional damage is not propagated across the interface as a result of failures in one of the interfacing units. These analyses are done to the piece part level for the circuits that directly interface with the other units. The FMEA can be accomplished without a CA, but a CA requires that the FMEA has previously identified system level critical failures. When both steps are done, the total process is called a FMECA.

=== Ground rules ===
The ground rules of each FMEA include a set of project selected procedures; the assumptions on which the analysis is based; the hardware that has been included and excluded from the analysis and the rationale for the exclusions. The ground rules also describe the indenture level of the analysis, the basic hardware status, and the criteria for system and mission success. Every effort should be made to define all ground rules before the FMEA begins; however, the ground rules may be expanded and clarified as the analysis proceeds. A typical set of ground rules (assumptions) follows:&lt;ref&gt;

Major benefits derived from a properly implemented FMECA effort are as follows:

# It provides a documented method for selecting a design with a high probability of successful operation and safety.
# A documented uniform method of assessing potential failure mechanisms, failure modes and their impact on system operation, resulting in a list of failure modes ranked according to the seriousness of their system impact and likelihood of occurrence.
# Early identification of single failure points (SFPS) and system interface problems, which may be critical to mission success and/or safety. They also provide a method of verifying that switching between redundant elements is not jeopardized by postulated single failures.
# An effective method for evaluating the effect of proposed changes to the design and/or operational procedures on mission success and safety.
# A basis for in-flight troubleshooting procedures and for locating performance monitoring and fault-detection devices.
# Criteria for early planning of tests.

From the above list, early identifications of SFPS, input to the troubleshooting procedure and locating of performance monitoring / fault detection devices are probably the most important benefits of the FMECA. In addition, the FMECA procedures are straightforward and allow orderly evaluation of the design.

The automotive industry began to use FMEA by the mid 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=K.|year=1975|title=Reliability Analysis of Catalytic Converter as an Automotive Emission Control System|url=http://papers.sae.org/750178|journal=SAE Technical Paper 750178|doi=10.4271/750178|author2=T.

Goto|accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Motor Company]] introduced FMEA to the automotive industry for safety and regulatory consideration after the [[Ford Pinto#Design flaws and ensuing lawsuits|Pinto affair]]. Ford applied the same approach to processes (PFMEA) to consider potential process induced failures prior to launching production. In 1993 the [[Automotive Industry Action Group]] (AIAG) first published an FMEA standard for the automotive industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis|last=AIAG|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.aiag.org/source/Orders/index.cfm?search=FMEA-4|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), 4th Edition|last=AIAG|publisher=Automotive Industry Action Group|year=2008|isbn=9781605341361}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SAE first published related standard J1739 in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1739_199407/|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Design (Design FMEA), Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (Process FMEA), and Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for Machinery (Machinery FMEA)|last=SAE|publisher=SAE International|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard is also now in its fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://standards.sae.org/j1739_200208/|title=Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Design (Design FMEA) and Potential Failure Mode and Effects Analysis in Manufacturing and Assembly Processes (Process FMEA) and Effects Analysis for Machinery (Machinery FMEA)|last=SAE|publisher=SAE International|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although initially developed by the military, FMEA methodology is now extensively used in a variety of industries including semiconductor processing, food service, plastics, software, and healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 31, 2007|title=Performing Failure Mode and Effect Analysis|url=http://www.embeddedtechmag.com/component/content/article/6134|journal=Embedded Technology|first1=Erik|last1=Fadlovich|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117172649/http://www.embeddedtechmag.com/component/content/article/6134|archivedate=2011-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota]] has taken this one step further with its [[Design Review Based on Failure Mode]] (DRBFM) approach. The method is now supported by the [[American Society for Quality]] which provides detailed guides on applying the method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asq.org/learn-about-quality/process-analysis-tools/overview/fmea.html|title=Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)|publisher=ASQ|accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA)
procedures identify the product failure mechanisms, but may not model them without specialized software. This limits their applicability to provide a meaningful input to critical procedures such as virtual qualification, root cause analysis, accelerated test programs, and to remaining life assessment. To overcome the shortcomings of FMEA and FMECA a Failure Modes, Mechanisms and Effect Analysis (FMMEA) has often been used.

== Basic terms ==
The following covers some basic FMEA terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Langford |first1=J. W. |title=Logistics: Principles and Applications |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1995 |page=488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Failure
: The loss of a function under stated conditions.
;Failure mode
:The specific manner or way by which a failure occurs in terms of failure of the item (being a part or (sub) system) ''function'' under investigation; it may generally describe the way the failure occurs. It shall at least clearly describe a (end) failure state of the item (or function in case of a Functional FMEA) under consideration. It is the result of the failure mechanism (cause of the failure mode). ''For example; a fully fractured axle, a deformed axle or a fully open or fully closed electrical contact are each a separate failure mode of a DFMEA, they would not be failure modes of a PFMEA. Here you examine your process, so process step x - insert drill bit, the failure mode would be insert wrong drill bit, the effect of this is too big a hole or too small a hole.''
;Failure cause and/or mechanism
:Defects in requirements, design, process, quality control, handling or part application, which are the underlying cause or sequence of causes that initiate a process (mechanism) that leads to a failure mode over a certain time. A failure mode may have more causes. ''For example; "fatigue or corrosion of a structural beam" or "fretting corrosion in an electrical contact" is a failure mechanism and in itself (likely) not a failure mode. The related failure mode (end state) is a "full fracture of structural beam" or "an open electrical contact". The initial cause might have been "Improper application of corrosion protection layer (paint)" and /or "(abnormal) vibration input from another (possibly failed) system".
;Failure effect
:Immediate consequences of a failure on operation, function or functionality, or status of some item.
;Indenture levels (bill of material or functional breakdown)
:An identifier for system level and thereby item complexity. Complexity increases as levels are closer to one.
;Local effect
:The failure effect as it applies to the item under analysis.
;Next higher level effect
:The failure effect as it applies at the next higher indenture level.
;End effect
:The failure effect at the highest indenture level or total system.
;Detection
:The means of detection of the failure mode by maintainer, operator or built in detection system, including estimated dormancy period (if applicable) 
;Probability
:The likelihood of the failure occurring.
; Risk Priority Number (RPN)
:Severity (of the event) * Probability (of the event occurring) * Detection (Probability that the event would not be detected before the user was aware of it) 
;Severity
:The consequences of a failure mode. Severity considers the worst potential consequence of a failure, determined by the degree of injury, property damage, system damage and/or time lost to repair the failure.
;Remarks / mitigation / actions
:Additional info, including the proposed mitigation or actions used to lower a risk or justify a risk level or scenario.

=== Probability (P) ===
It is necessary to look at the cause of a failure mode and the likelihood of occurrence. This can be done by analysis, calculations / FEM, looking at similar items or processes and the failure modes that have been documented for them in the past. A failure cause is looked upon as a design weakness. All the potential causes for a failure mode should be identified and documented. This should be in technical terms. Examples of causes are: Human errors in handling, Manufacturing induced faults, Fatigue, Creep, Abrasive wear, erroneous algorithms, excessive voltage or improper operating conditions or use (depending on the used ground rules).
A failure mode is given a ''Probability Ranking''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Rating
!Meaning
|-
| A
| Extremely Unlikely (Virtually impossible or No known occurrences on similar products or processes, with many running hours)
|-
| B
| Remote (relatively few failures)
|-
| C
| Occasional (occasional failures)
|-
| D
| Reasonably Possible (repeated failures)
|-
| E
| Frequent (failure is almost inevitable)
|}

=== Severity (S) ===
Determine the Severity for the worst-case scenario adverse end effect (state). It is convenient to write these effects down in terms of what the user might see or experience in terms of functional failures. Examples of these end effects are: full loss of function x, degraded performance, functions in reversed mode, too late functioning, erratic functioning, etc. Each end effect is given a Severity number (S) from, say, I (no effect) to V (catastrophic), based on cost and/or loss of life or quality of life. These numbers prioritize the failure modes (together with probability and detectability). Below a typical classification is given. Other classifications are possible. See also [[hazard analysis]].

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Rating
!Meaning
|-
| I
| No relevant effect on reliability or safety
|-
| II
| Very minor, no damage, no injuries, only results in a maintenance action (only noticed by discriminating customers)
|-
| III
| Minor, low damage, light injuries (affects very little of the system, noticed by average customer)
|-
| IV
| Critical (causes a loss of primary function; Loss of all safety Margins, 1 failure away from a catastrophe, severe damage, severe injuries, max 1 possible death )
|-
| V
| Catastrophic (product becomes inoperative; the failure may result in complete unsafe operation and possible multiple deaths)
|}

=== Detection (D) ===
The means or method by which a failure is detected, isolated by operator and/or maintainer and the time it may take. This is important for maintainability control (availability of the system) and it is especially important for multiple failure scenarios. This may involve dormant failure ''modes'' (e.g. No direct system effect, while a redundant system / item automatically takes over or when the failure only is problematic during specific mission or system states) or latent failures (e.g. deterioration failure ''mechanisms'', like a metal growing crack, but not a critical length). It should be made clear how the failure mode or cause can be discovered by an operator under normal system operation or if it can be discovered by the maintenance crew by some diagnostic action or automatic built in system test. A dormancy and/or latency period may be entered.

|-
| 3
| High 
|-
| 4
| Moderate 
|-
| 5
| Low 
|-
| 6
| Fault is undetected by Operators or Maintainers 
|}

=== Dormancy or Latency Period ===
The average time that a failure mode may be undetected may be entered if known. For example:

* Seconds, auto detected by maintenance computer
* 8 hours, detected by turn-around inspection
* 2 months, detected by scheduled maintenance block X
* 2 years, detected by overhaul task x

=== Indication ===
If the undetected failure allows the system to remain in a ''safe'' / working state, a second failure situation should be explored to determine whether or not an indication will be evident to all ''operators'' and what corrective action they may or should take.

Indications to the operator should be described as follows:

* Normal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system or equipment is operating normally.
* Abnormal. An indication that is evident to an operator when the system has malfunctioned or failed.
* Incorrect. An erroneous indication to an operator due to the malfunction or failure of an indicator (i.e., instruments, sensing devices, visual or audible warning devices, etc.).

PERFORM DETECTION COVERAGE ANALYSIS FOR TEST PROCESSES AND MONITORING (From ARP4761 Standard):

This type of analysis is useful to determine how effective various test processes are at the detection of latent and dormant faults. The method used to accomplish this involves an examination of the applicable failure modes to determine whether or not their effects are detected, and to determine the percentage of failure rate applicable to the failure modes which are detected. The possibility that the detection means may itself fail latently should be accounted for in the coverage analysis as a limiting factor (i.e., coverage cannot be more reliable than the detection means availability). Inclusion of the detection coverage in the FMEA can lead to each individual failure that would have been one effect category now being a separate effect category due to the detection coverage possibilities. Another way to include detection coverage is for the FTA to conservatively assume that no holes in coverage due to latent failure in the detection method affect detection of all failures assigned to the failure effect category of concern. The FMEA can be revised if
necessary for those cases where this conservative assumption does not allow the top event probability requirements to be met.

After these three basic steps the Risk level may be provided.

=== Risk level (P*S) and (D) ===
'''Risk is the combination of End Effect Probability And Severity''' where probability and severity includes the effect on non-detectability ('''dormancy time'''). This may influence the end effect probability of failure or the worst case effect Severity. The exact calculation may not be easy in all cases, such as those where multiple scenarios (with multiple events) are possible and detectability / dormancy plays a crucial role (as for redundant systems). In that case Fault Tree Analysis and/or Event Trees may be needed to determine exact probability and risk levels.

Preliminary Risk levels can be selected based on a Risk Matrix like shown below, based on Mil. Std. 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/MIL-STD-882E_41682/|title=MIL-STD-882 E SYSTEM SAFETY|website=www.everyspec.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The higher the Risk level, the more justification and mitigation is needed to provide evidence and lower the risk to an acceptable level. High risk should be indicated to higher level management, who are responsible for final decision-making.

* After this step the FMEA has become like a [[FMECA]].

== Timing ==
The FMEA should be updated whenever:
* A new cycle begins (new product/process)
* Changes are made to the operating conditions
* A change is made in the design
* New regulations are instituted
* Customer feedback indicates a problem

== Uses ==
* Development of system requirements that minimize the likelihood of failures.
* Development of designs and test systems to ensure that the failures have been eliminated or the risk is reduced to acceptable level.
* Development and evaluation of diagnostic systems
* To help with design choices (trade-off analysis).

== Advantages ==
{{Prose|section|date=January 2017}}
* Catalyst for teamwork and idea exchange between functions
* Collect information to reduce future failures, capture engineering knowledge
* Early identification and elimination of potential failure modes
* Emphasize problem prevention
* Improve company image and competitiveness
* Improve production yield
* Improve the quality, reliability, and safety of a product/process
* Increase user satisfaction
* Maximize profit
* Minimize late changes and associated cost
* Reduce impact on company profit margin
* Reduce system development time and cost
* Reduce the possibility of same kind of failure in future
* Reduce the potential for warranty concerns

== Limitations ==
While FMEA identifies important hazards in a system, its results may not be comprehensive and the approach has limitations.&lt;ref name="potts2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Potts H.W.W. |author2=Anderson J.E. |author3=Colligan L. |author4=Leach P. |author5=Davis S. |author6=Berman J. | title=Assessing the validity of prospective hazard analysis methods: A comparison of two techniques |journal=BMC Health Services Research |volume=14 |year=2014 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/14/41 |doi=10.1186/1472-6963-14-41 |pmid= |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin BD, Shebl NA, Barber N: "Failure mode and effects analysis: too little for too much?" BMJ Qual Saf 2012, 21: 607–611&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shebl NA, Franklin BD, Barber N: "Is failure mode and effect analysis reliable?" J Patient Saf 2009, 5: 86–94&lt;/ref&gt; In the healthcare context, FMEA and other risk assessment methods, including SWIFT ([[Structured What If Technique]]) and retrospective approaches, have been found to have limited validity when used in isolation. Challenges around scoping and organisational boundaries appear to be a major factor in this lack of validity.&lt;ref name="potts2014" /&gt;

If used as a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] tool, FMEA may only identify major failure modes in a system. [[Fault tree analysis|Fault tree analysis (FTA)]] is better suited for "top-down" analysis. When used as a "bottom-up" tool FMEA can augment or complement FTA and identify many more causes and failure modes resulting in top-level symptoms. It is not able to discover complex failure modes involving multiple failures within a subsystem, or to report expected failure intervals of particular failure modes up to the upper level subsystem or system.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Additionally, the multiplication of the severity, occurrence and detection rankings may result in rank reversals, where a less serious failure mode receives a higher RPN than a more serious failure mode.&lt;ref name='Kmenta2004-11'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1115/1.1799614 |title=Scenario-Based Failure Modes and Effects Analysis Using Expected Cost |year=2004 |last1=Kmenta |first1=Steven |last2=Ishii |first2=Koshuke |journal=Journal of Mechanical Design |volume=126 |issue=6 |page=1027}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is that the rankings are [[ordinal scale]] numbers, and multiplication is not defined for ordinal numbers. The ordinal rankings only say that one ranking is better or worse than another, but not by how much. For instance, a ranking of "2" may not be twice as severe as a ranking of "1," or an "8" may not be twice as severe as a "4," but multiplication treats them as though they are. See [[Level of measurement]] for further discussion. Various solutions to this problems have been proposed, e.g., the use of [[fuzzy logic]] as an alternative to classic RPN model.&lt;ref name="KMTay"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jee T.L. |author2=Tay K.

Process FMEA can be challenging for participants who have not completed many PFMEAS, often confusing FAILURE MODES with EFFECTS and CAUSES.  To clarify, a Process FMEA shows how the process can go wrong.  Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list the steps of the process being reviewed.  The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step can go wrong.  Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part.  Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.)  FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location.  The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job.  Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process?  When a process is examined or if we ask what can go wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y.  Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time.  If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained.  Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained.  New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it can go wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.

Besides, two shortcomings are

== Types ==
*'''Functional''': before design solutions are provided (or only on high level) functions can be evaluated on potential functional failure effects. General Mitigations ("design to" requirements) can be proposed to limit consequence of functional failures or limit the probability of occurrence in this early development. It is based on a functional breakdown of a system. This type may also be used for Software evaluation.
*'''Concept Design / Hardware''': analysis of systems or subsystems in the early design concept stages to analyse the failure mechanisms and lower level functional failures, specially to different concept solutions in more detail. It may be used in trade-off studies.
*'''Detailed Design / Hardware''': analysis of products prior to production. These are the most detailed (in mil 1629 called Piece-Part or Hardware FMEA) FMEAs and used to identify any possible hardware (or other) failure mode up to the lowest part level. It should be based on hardware breakdown (e.g. the BoM = Bill of Material). Any Failure effect Severity, failure Prevention (Mitigation), Failure Detection and Diagnostics may be fully analyzed in this FMEA.
*'''Process''': analysis of manufacturing and assembly processes. Both quality and reliability may be affected from process faults. The input for this FMEA is amongst others a work process / task Breakdown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20983">[[Fluorescence]] is used in the life sciences generally as a non-destructive way of tracking or analysing biological molecules by means of fluorescence.
Some [[protein]]s or [[small molecule]]s in cells are naturally fluorescent, which is called intrinsic fluorescence or [[autofluorescence]] (such as [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]], [[tryptophan]] or endogenous [[chlorophyll]], [[phycoerythrin]] or [[green fluorescent protein]]). Alternatively, specific or general proteins, [[nucleic acid]]s, [[lipids]] or small molecules can be "labelled" with an extrinsic [[fluorophore]], a fluorescent [[dye]] which can be a small molecule, protein or [[quantum dot]]. Several techniques exist to exploit additional properties of [[fluorophore]]s, such as [[Förster resonance energy transfer|fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], where the energy is passed non-radiatively to a particular neighbouring dye, allowing proximity or protein activation to be detected; another is the change in properties, such as intensity, of certain dyes depending on their environment allowing their use in structural studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph R.

{{Main|fluorescence}}
The principle behind fluorescence is that the [[fluorophore|fluorescent moiety]] contains [[electrons]] which can absorb a [[photon]] and briefly enter an [[excited state]] before either dispersing the energy non-radiatively or [[Spontaneous emission|emitting it as a photon]], but with a lower energy, i.e., at a longer wavelength (wavelength and energy are inversely proportional).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/03/animation-for-the-principle-of-fluorescence-and-uv-visible-absorbance/ Animation for the principle of fluorescence and UV-visible absorbance]&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference in the excitation and emission wavelengths is called the [[Stokes shift]], and the time that an excited electron takes to emit the photon is called a [[Exponential decay|lifetime]]. The [[quantum yield]] is an indicator of the efficiency of the dye (it is the ratio of emitted photons per absorbed photon), and the extinction coefficient is the amount of light that can be absorbed by a fluorophore. Both the quantum yield and extinction coefficient are specific for each fluorophore and multiplied together calculates the brightness of the fluorescent molecule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=4DD9D52E-5056-8A76-4E6E-E217FAD0D86B#brightness Fluorescent Probes]. Piercenet.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labelling==

===Reactive dyes===
{{Main|fluorophore}}

Fluorophores can be attached to proteins via specific functional groups, such as
* [[amino]] groups (''e.g.'' via [[succinimide]], [[Isothiocyanate]] or [[hydrazine]])
* [[carboxyl]] groups (''e.g.'' via [[carbodiimide]])
* [[thiol]] (''e.g.'' via [[maleimide]] or [[acetyl bromide]])
* [[azide]] (''e.g.'' via [[click chemistry]])
or non-specificately ([[glutaraldehyde]]) or non-covalently (''e.g.'' via [[hydrophobicity]], etc.).

These fluorophores are either small molecules, protein or quantum dots.

Organic fluorophores fluoresce thanks to delocalized electrons which can jump a band and stabilize the energy absorbed, hence most fluorophores are [[conjugated system]]s. Several families exits and their excitations range from the [[infrared]] to the [[ultraviolet]]. &lt;br&gt;Lanthanides (chelated) are uniquely fluorescent metals, which emit thanks to transitions involving 4''f'' orbits, which are forbidden, hence they have very low [[absorption coefficient]]s and slow emissions, requiring exitation through fluorescent organic [[chelation|chelators]] (''e.g.'' [[Dipicolinic acid|dipicolinate]]-based [[Terbium|Terbium (III)]] chelators &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7711110|year=1995|last1=Lamture|first1=JB|last2=Wensel|first2=TG|title=Intensely luminescent immunoreactive conjugates of proteins and dipicolinate-based polymeric Tb (III) chelates|volume=6|issue=1|pages=88–92|journal=Bioconjugate Chemistry|doi=10.1021/bc00031a010}}&lt;/ref&gt;). &lt;br&gt;A third class of small molecule fluorophore is that of the [[transition metal]]-ligand [[Coordination complex|complexes]], which display molecular fluorescence from a [[MLCT|metal-to-ligand charge transfer state]] which is partially forbidden, these are generally complexes of [[Ruthenium]], [[Rhenium]] or [[Osmium]].

===Quantum dots===
[[Quantum dots]] are fluorescent semiconductor [[nanoparticles]].

===Fluorescent proteins===
Several fluorescent protein exist in nature{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, but the most important one as a research tool is [[Green Fluorescent Protein]] (GFP) from the jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8303295|year=1994|last1=Chalfie|first1=M|last2=Tu|first2=Y|last3=Euskirchen|first3=G|last4=Ward|first4=WW|last5=Prasher|first5=DC|title=Green fluorescent protein as a marker for gene expression|volume=263|issue=5148|pages=802–5|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.8303295}}&lt;/ref&gt; which spontaneously fluoresces upon folding via specific serine-tyrosine-glycine residues. The benefit that GFP and other fluorescent proteins have over [[organic dye]]s or quantum dots is that they can be expressed exogenously in cells alone or as a [[fusion protein]], a protein that is created by ligating the fluorescent gene (e.g., GFP) to another gene and whose expression is driven by a housekeeping gene [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] or another specific promoter. This approach allows fluorescent proteins to be used as reporters for any number of biological events, such as [[sub-cellular localization]] and [[Spatiotemporal gene expression|expression patterns]].
A variant of GFP is naturally found in [[coral]]s, specifically the [[Anthozoa]], and several mutants have been created to span the visible spectra and fluoresce longer and more stably.
Other proteins are fluorescent but require a fluorophore cofactor, and hence can only be used ''in vitro''; these are often found in plants and algae (phytofluors, [[phycobiliprotein]] such as [[allophycocyanin]]).

==Bioluminescence and fluorescence==

[[Fluorescence]], [[chemiluminescence]] and [[phosphorescence]] are 3 different types of [[luminescence]] properties, i.e. emission of light from a substance.
Fluorescence is a property where light is absorbed and remitted within a few nanoseconds (approx. 10ns&lt;!-- Lakowicz' book on page 1, not really an average but a guestimate--&gt;) at a lower energy (=higher wavelength), while [[bioluminescence]] is biological [[chemiluminescence]], a property where light is generated by a chemical reaction of an enzyme on a substrate.
[[Phosphorescence]] is a property of materials to absorb light and emit the energy several milliseconds or more later (due to forbidden transitions to the [[ground state]] of a [[triplet state]], while fluorescence occurs in exited [[singlet state]]s). Until recently was not applicable to life science research due to the size of the inorganic particles. However the boundary between the fluorescence and phosphorescence is not clean cut as [[transition metal]]-ligand complexes, which combine a metal and several organic moieties, have long lifetimes, up to several microseconds (as they display mixed singlet-triplet states).

==Comparison with radioactivity==
{{See also|Radioactivity in biological research}}
Prior to its widespread use in the past three decades [[radioactivity]] was the most common label.

The advantages of fluorescence over radioactive labels are as follows:
* Fluorescence is safer to use and does not require radiological controls
* Several fluorescent molecules can be used simultaneously given that they do not overlap, cf. FRET, whereas with radioactivity two [[isotopes]] can be used ([[tritium]] and a low energy isotope such as [[Phosphorus-33|&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;P]] due to different intensities) but require special machinery (a tritium screen and a regular phosphor-imaging screen or a specific dual channel detector)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html |title=The Micro Imager by Biospace Lab |website=Biospacelab.com |accessdate=2011-06-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105194225/http://www.biospacelab.com/html/microimager.html |archivedate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Note: a [[Channel (digital image)|channel]] is similar to "colour" but distinct, it is the pair of excitation and emission filters specific for a dye, e.g. agilent microarrays are dual channel, working on cy3 and cy5, these are colloquially referred to as green and red.

Fluorescence is not necessarily more convenient to use because it requires specialized detection equipment of its own.  For non-quantitative or relative quantification applications it can be useful but it is poorly suited for making absolute measurement because of fluorescence [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]], whereas measuring radioactively labeled molecules is always direct and highly sensitive.

Disadvantages of fluorophores include:
* Significantly changes the properties of a fluorescently-labeled molecule
* Interference with normal biological processes
* Toxicity

==Additional useful properties==

The basic property of fluorescence are extensively used, such as a marker of labelled components in cells ([[fluorescence microscopy]]) or as an indicator in solution ([[Fluorescence spectroscopy]]), but other additional properties, not found with radioactivity, make it even more extensively used.

===FRET===

{{Main|Förster resonance energy transfer}}
[[File:Squid's fret.svg|thumb|380px|right|Cartoon of FRET between two protein interacting protein, labelled with [[fluorescein]] and tetramethyl[[rhodamine]]]]
FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) is a property in which the energy of the excited electron of one fluorphore, called the donor, is passed on to a nearby acceptor dye, either a [[dark quencher]] or another fluorophore, which has an excitation spectrum which overlaps with the emission spectrum of the donor dye resulting in a reduced fluorescence.
This can be used to
* detect if two labelled protein or nucleic acids come into contact or a doubly labelled single molecules is hydrolysed
* detect changed in conformation
* measure concentration by a competitive binding assay

===Sensitivity to environment===

{{See also|Solvatochromism}}
[[File:Badan.svg|thumb|380px|Example of an environmentally sensitive dye,  Badan, which having a tertiary amine and a ketone at opposite ends displays a large change in dipole momentum when exited (including an internal charge transfer), which results in turn in a significant lowering of the energy when solvent relaxation occurs]]
Environment-sensitive dyes change their properties (intensity, half-life, and excitation and emission spectra) depending on the polarity (hydrophobicity and charge) of their environments. examples include: [[Indole]], Cascade Yellow, prodan, Dansyl, Dapoxyl, NBD, PyMPO, Pyrene and diethylaminocumarin.&lt;br /&gt;
This change is most pronounced when electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups are placed at opposite ends of an aromatic ring system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nmeth0305-160b|title=A 'flaky' but useful fluorophore|year=2005|last1=Evanko|first1=Daniel|journal=Nature Methods|volume=2|issue=3|pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this results in a large change in [[Electron electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] when excited.

When a fluorophore is excited, it generally has a larger dipole moment (μ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;) than in the ground state (μ&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). Absorption of a photon by a fluorophore takes a few picoseconds. Before this energy is released (emission: 1–10 ns), the solvent molecules surrounding the fluorophore reorient (10–100 ps) due to the change in polarity in the excited singlet state; this process is called solvent relaxation. As a result of this relaxation, the energy of the excited state of the fluorophore is lowered (longer wavelength), hence fluorophores that have a large change in dipole moment have larger stokes shift changes in different solvents. The difference between the energy levels can be roughly determined with the Lipper-Mataga equation.

It should be noted that a [[hydrophobic]] dye is a dye which is insoluble in water, a property independent of solvatochromism. &lt;br&gt;Additionally, The term [[chromism|environment-sensitive]] in chemistry actually describes changes due to one of a variety of different environmental factors, such as pH or temperature, not just polarity; however, in biochemistry environment-sensitive fluorphore and solvatochromic fluorophore are used interchangeably: this convention is so widespread that suppliers describe them as environment-sensitive over solvatochromic.

===Fluorescence lifetime===
{{Main|Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy|l1=Fluorescent lifetime}}
Fluorescent moieties emit photons several nanoseconds after absorption following an exponential decay curve, which differs between dyes and depends on the surrounding solvent. When the dye is attached to a macromolecules the decay curve becomes multiexponential. Conjugated dyes generally have a lifetime between 1–10 ns, a small amount of longer lived exceptions exist, notably pyrene with a lifetime of 400ns in degassed solvents or 100ns in lipids and [[coronene]] with 200ns. On a different category of fluorphores are the fluorescent organometals (lanthanides and transition metal-ligand complexes) which have been [[Fluorescence in the life sciences#Reactive dyes|previously described]], which have much longer lifetimes due to the restricted states: lanthanides have lifetimes of 0.5 to 3 ms, while transition metal-ligand complexes have lifetimes of 10 ns to 10 µs. Note that fluorescent lifetime should not be confused with the photodestruction lifetime or the "shelf-life" of a dye.

===Multiphoton excitation===
{{Main|Two-photon excitation microscopy}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Multiphoton excitation is a way of focusing the viewing plane of the microscope by taking advantage of the phenomenon where two simultaneous low energy photons are absorbed by a fluorescent moiety which normally absorbs one photon with double their individual energy: say two NIR photons (800&amp;nbsp;nm) to excite a UV dye (400&amp;nbsp;nm).

===Fluorescence anisotropy===
{{Main|Fluorescence anisotropy}}
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
A perfectly immobile fluorescent moiety when exited with [[polarized light]] will emit light which is also polarized. However, if a molecule is moving, it will tend to "scramble" the polarization of the light by radiating at a different direction from the incident light.

==Methods==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

{{Further|Nucleic acid methods}}
{{Further|Protein methods}}

* [[fluorescence microscope|Fluorescence microscopy]] of tissues, cells or subcellular structures is accomplished by labeling an antibody with a fluorophore and allowing the antibody to find its target antigen within the sample. Labeling multiple antibodies with different fluorophores allows visualization of multiple targets within a single image.
* Automated sequencing of [[DNA]] by the [[chain termination method]]; each of four different chain terminating bases has its own specific fluorescent tag. As the labeled DNA molecules are separated, the fluorescent label is excited by a UV source, and the identity of the base terminating the molecule is identified by the wavelength of the emitted light.
[[File:AgarosegelUV.jpg|thumb|right|Ethidium bromide stained [[agarose gel electrophoresis|agarose gel]]. Ethidium bromide fluoresces orange when [[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalating]] [[DNA]] and when exposed to [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light.]]
* DNA detection: the compound [[ethidium bromide]], when free to change its conformation in solution, has very little fluorescence. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced when it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]]. Ethidium bromide can be toxic – a purportedly safer alternative is the dye [[SYBR Green]].
* The [[DNA microarray]]
* Immunology: An antibody has a fluorescent chemical group attached, and the sites (e.g., on a microscopic specimen) where the antibody has bound can be seen, and even quantified, by the fluorescence.
* FACS ([[fluorescent-activated cell sorting]])
* [[Microscale Thermophoresis]] (MST) uses fluorescence as readout to quantify the directed movement of biomolecules in microscopic temperature gradients.
* Fluorescence has been used to study the structure and conformations of DNA and proteins with techniques such as [[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer]], which measures distance at the angstrom level. This is especially important in complexes of multiple biomolecules.
* Fluorescence can be applied to study colocalization of various proteins of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.proghi.2009.03.001|title=Recent advances in quantitative colocalization analysis: Focus on neuroscience|year=2009|last1=Zinchuk|first1=Grossenbacher-Zinchuk|journal=Prog Histochem Cytochem|volume=44|issue=3|pages=125–172|pmid=19822255}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then can be analyzed using a specialized software, like [[CoLocalizer Pro]].

Also, many biological molecules have an intrinsic fluorescence that can sometimes be used without the need to attach a chemical tag. Sometimes this intrinsic fluorescence changes when the molecule is in a specific environment, so the distribution or binding of the molecule can be measured. [[Bilirubin]], for instance, is highly fluorescent when bound to a specific site on serum albumin. [[Zinc protoporphyrin]], formed in developing red blood cells instead of hemoglobin when iron is unavailable or lead is present, has a bright fluorescence and can be used to detect these problems.

The number of fluorescence applications in the biomedical, biological and related sciences continuously expands. Methods of analysis in these fields are also growing, often with nomenclature in the form of acronyms such as: [[Fluorescence lifetime imaging|FLIM]], FLI, [[Fluorescence loss in photobleaching|FLIP]], CALI, FLIE, [[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer|FRET]], [[Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching|FRAP]], [[Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy|FCS]], PFRAP, smFRET, FIONA, FRIPS, SHREK, SHRIMP or [[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|TIRF]]. Most of these techniques rely on fluorescence microscopes, which use high intensity light sources, usually mercury or xenon lamps, LEDs, or lasers, to excite fluorescence in the samples under observation. Optical filters then separate excitation light from emitted fluorescence to be detected by eye or with a (CCD) camera or other light detector (e.g., photomultiplier tubes, spectrographs). Considerable research is underway to improve the capabilities of such microscopes, the fluorescent probes used, and the applications they are applied to. Of particular note are confocal microscopes, which use a pinhole to achieve [[optical sectioning]], which affords a quantitative, 3D view of the sample.

Saint John described the scene,
:before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1149&amp;tabview=work The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description].

[[File:The Four and Twenty Elders (William Blake).jpg|thumb|''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne'', c. 1803–5. [[William Blake]], [[Tate]]. 354 x 293 mm.]]

In the centre of a huge hall is placed a throne: round about the Throne are four and twenty seats on which sit four and twenty Elders, robed in white and wearing crowns of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienvr_jFYAEC|p=2902|title=Complete Evangelical Parallel Bible-PR-KJV/NKJV/NIV/NLT|isbn=9781598569506|author1=Bibles|first1=Hendrickson|date=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Assembly is introduced the Lamb that is to be initiated. In front of the Throne are four remarkable beasts ([[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]): one of them is like a lion, another resembles an eagle, the third has the appearance of a calf, and the fourth has the face of a man. These beasts have six wings each, and are full of eyes all over; and they rest not night and day, but keep on blessing the One on the Throne.

== Interpretation ==
The word "Elder" in the majority of places where it is used in the Scriptures means the representative head of a city, family, tribe or nation, so the "Four and Twenty Elders" are representative of the redeemed human race. But why 24 Elders? Twenty-four is the number of the Priestly Courses as given in 1. Chron. 24:1-19. When David distributed the Priests into "Courses" he found there were 24 Heads of the Priestly families, and these 24 Heads he made representative of the WHOLE PRIESTHOOD. As the "Elders" are representative of both the Old and New Testament Saints, and the Old Testament Saints are represented by the Twelve Tribes of Israel, and the New Testament Saints' by the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, they together make up 24 representative characters. This distinction is clearly brought out in the description of the New Jerusalem, where the 12 Foundation Stones are named after the Twelve Apostles of the Lamb, and the 12 Gates after the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Rev. 21:10-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/tbr/tbr022.htm|title=The Book of Revelation: III. The Things Which Shall Be Hereafter: 3.

== Allegorical interpretation ==
[[Champat Rai Jain]], a 20th-century Jain writer claimed that the "Four and Twenty Elders" mentioned in the [[Christian Bible]] are "Twenty-four Jain ''[[Tirthankara]]s''".{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78}} In his book, Jainism Christianity and Science, he wrote:{{quote|Briefly, the beasts represent the different kinds of souls that are embodied in the four elements (of matter), namely, the earth-bodied (represented by the lion, since he walks on earth), the air-bodied (represented by the eagle who flies in the air), the water-bodied (represented by the calf, which here is the young of the sea-mammals), and the fire-bodied (represented by the sun which is painted as the face of a man). Wings are a symbol for time, since it flies; and the number six is descriptive of the six ''aras'' (spokes) or a half-cycle in which four and twenty ''Tirthamkaras'' appear and preach the Truth. Plainly put, the significance of the secret teaching is only this that Life is Divine, and its divinity is manifested most perfectly and fully in the case of four and twenty ''Tirihamkaras'', who appear in a half-cycle of time, consisting of six aras, and preach the Noble Truth to and for the benefit of the souls embodied in material bodies.{{sfn|Jain|1930|p=78-79}}}}

'''Funk art''' is an American [[art movement]] that was a reaction against the nonobjectivity of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; An [[anti-establishment]] movement, Funk art brought [[figurative art|figuration]] back as subject matter in [[painting]] again rather than limiting itself to the non-figurative, abstract forms that abstract expressionists such as [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Mark Rothko]] were depicting. The movement’s name was derived from the [[jazz]] musical term "[[funk]]y", describing the passionate, sensuous, and quirky. During the 1920s, jazz was thought of as very basic, unsophisticated music, and many people believed Funk was an unrefined style of art as well.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The term [[funk]] also had negative connotations because the word had an association with a foul odor.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Funk was a popular art form, mainly in California's [[Bay Area]] in the United States. Although discussed as a cohesive movement, Funk artists did not feel as if they belonged to a [[collective]] art style or group.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"&gt;Karlstrom, Paul J. ''Peter Selz: Sketches of a Life in Art''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because while its artists shared the same attitudes and created similar works, they were not necessarily working together.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt;

==History==

===Bay Area===
The Funk art movement was a regional art movement, most predominant in [[Northern California]]. Some notable cities where the Funk movement was concentrated in consisted of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[Marin County]], [[Big Sur]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many Funk artists began as [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] painters in the 1950s. The movement originated from the bohemian underground in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"&gt;Engelbach, Barbara ''Looking for Mushrooms: Beat Poets, Hippies, Funk, Minimal Art San Francisco 1955-68''. Köln König: Museum Ludwig, Köln, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the Bay Area, specifically [[San Francisco]], was a free and spiritual environment due to its [[beatnik]] art culture and the youth political activism reacting against the [[Vietnam War]] going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Engelbach"/&gt; A variety of different cultures existed in the city, including poetry, jazz, and art. The freedom of thinking and culture was one of the main reasons that Funk art, a combination of both painting and sculpture, could develop and prosper in the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

The Funk art that occurred throughout Northern California was the exact opposite of the "Fetish Finish" sculptures made in [[Southern California]] and the "primary structures" constructed in New York at the time.&lt;ref name="Selz"&gt;Selz, Peter. ''Funk''. Berkeley: The Regents of the University of California, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Funk art in the Bay Area was unique and not similar to any other movement of the 1960s.  [[Jess Collins|Jess]], [[Wally Hedrick]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Viola Frey]], [[Wallace Berman]] and [[Bruce Conner]] were notable Funk artists who emerged from the Bay Area. Jess was one of the earliest and most influential Funk artists.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; In 1967, [[Peter Selz]], the first director of the University of Art Museum in Berkeley, California, organized a Funk Show there. Selz wanted to showcase the strange mindset in California through an array of Funk pieces.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; The exhibition featured works from [[Peter Voulkos]], [[Mowry Baden]] and [[Bruce Conner]], and it brought national recognition to the movement for the first time.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;Albright, Thomas. ''[[Art in the San Francisco Bay Area (book)|Art in the San Francisco Bay Area 1945-1980]]''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985. {{ISBN|0520051939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this show, not many people outside of the Bay Area had seen or heard of Funk works, which relieved artists of pressures to become successful.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt;

==Characteristics and techniques==
The characteristics and techniques of Funk art works were more important than the subject matter.

===Self-identification===
Unlike earlier movements, such as [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], Funk art was not concerned with public [[morality]]. Its artists were committed to identifying with their works on a personal level instead of the social or existential. Through their absurdist works, Funk artists demonstrated personal feelings, emotions and processes and in this way their work had a closer [[nature v culture|relationship to nature rather than to culture]]. The works had creative freedom and demonstrated the artists' lives, personalities and experiences.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Funk artists treated their work with a sense of humor, senselessness, confrontation, vulgar sexuality and [[autobiographical]] references.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; In their pieces, Funk artists are sometimes self-deprecating and [[ironic]].  Although the works are humorous, they sometimes cover a more serious undertone.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; Since there was no clear meaning in many pieces, Funk art contains a sense of ambiguity.

===Found objects===
Funk art was inspired by [[popular culture]], contains attitude and uses an unlikely mixture of materials and techniques. One of the movement's main characteristics is that it incorporates found objects from [[Consumerism|consumer culture]]. It was a part of the larger movement called [[Assemblage (art)|Assemblage]], which also included paintings that were composed of three-dimensional objects.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; [[Bruce Conner]] was known for his assemblage works, including ''Arachne'', ''Spider Lady'', ''For Marilyn'', ''Cosmic Death Song'', and ''Tick Tock Jelly Clock Cosmotron''.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Many of the Funk [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] pieces were composed of thrown out garbage to demonstrate that Funk art was not a part of consumer culture.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; The pieces are usually three dimensional, but they resemble paintings more than sculptures.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; [[Jess Collins|Jess]] and [[Wally Hedrick]] were two of the first Funk artists to use found objects in their works.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; The objects used tended to be items that were not meant to be noticed.&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; The idea of using ordinary subject matter and common objects in art was influenced by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]].&lt;ref name="Selz"/&gt; This concept is also influenced by the pieces of the [[Dada]] movement because both art movements use everyday objects and have a sense of freedom.The objects and debris used in works symbolized decay many of the time.&lt;ref name="Karlstrom"/&gt; Due to the artists lack of concern with impeccable technique, durability or form, the works each possessed a somewhat sloppy finish.

==Ceramics==
Non-functional ceramic art was an important element in the Funk art movement, especially in Regina{{Where|date=June 2015}} and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; Funk art ceramics were primarily composed from clay and possessed themes that were thought of as inappropriate by artists belonging to other movements.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;  Similar to its three dimensional paintings, Funk ceramics contained vulgar male humor, as well as sexual references.&lt;ref name="Shields"&gt;Shields, Scott A. "California Funk." ''Ceramics Monthly 56.9'' (2008): 38-41. Academic Search Complete. Web. 12 Mar. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Like other Funk works, the ceramics also used funny and absurd styles and images to relay the message that people should not take art or themselves too seriously. The ceramics were unrefined and blatant, and they all possessed the idea of a functionless sculpture for sculptures sake.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;

===Robert Arneson===
[[Robert Arneson]] started the ceramic art movement within Funk art in the Bay Area.  Before him, ceramics were considered more of a craft rather than a prestigious art form.&lt;ref name="Albright"/&gt; After him, ceramics caught on as a serious form of art nationally.{{cn|date=June 2015}} [[Robert Arneson]] created many ceramic sculptures, which eventually became a common work of Funk artists. Some believe his ceramics were influenced by [[pop art]] sculptures because they were of mundane, everyday objects. A main difference was that [[Robert Arneson]] also included personal elements to his sculptures, which was a defining factor of Funk art.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt; His works were playful and full of color.&lt;ref name="Shields"/&gt;
[[Robert Arneson]], along with other Funk artists, such as [[Roy De Forest]], [[Manuel Neri]], and [[William T. Wiley]] taught at the [[University of California, Davis]], which was a center for the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art, Interview with Bruce Nauman http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/oralhistories/transcripts/nauman80.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Students from [[University of California, Davis]], such as Margaret Dodd, [[David Gilhooly]], [[Victor Cicansky]], Chris Unterseher, and Peter Vandenberge, continued Arneson's ceramics tradition.

In 1967, [[Robert Arneson]] drafted ceramicist [[Clayton Bailey]] to cover his classes at [[University of California, Davis]] while he took a [[sabbatical]].&lt;ref name=WOW&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L. Daniels ; with essays by Philip E.|title=Clayton Bailey's world of wonders|year=2011|publisher=Crocker Art Museum|location=Sacramento, CA|isbn=978-1-8840-3822-8|pages=22|author2=Frank, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey, who hailed from [[Wisconsin]], had been pursuing a personal, but similar artistic vision to what had been happening with the Funk art movement in northern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L. Daniels ; with essays by Philip E.|title=Clayton Bailey's world of wonders|year=2011|publisher=Crocker Art Museum|location=Sacramento, CA|isbn=978-1-8840-3822-8|pages=21|author2=Frank, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Bailey permanently relocated to the Bay Area,&lt;ref name="WOW"/&gt; where he soon became a key figure in the region's  developing Funk art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

==Exhibitions==

Founded in [[Folsom, California]], in 1962, the [[Candy Store Gallery]] played a key role in promoting Funk art by means of regular exhibitions until its closure in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L.

Gaps in bold font mean that the gender gap is [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] ([[p value|p]]&lt;0.05). A positive mathematics gap means that boys outperform girls, a negative mathematics gap means that girls outperform boys. A positive reading gap means that girls outperform boys (no country has a negative reading gap). There is a negative [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] between the mathematics and reading gender gaps, that is, nations with a larger mathematics gap have a smaller reading gap and vice versa.&lt;ref name="stoetgeary2013-se"/&gt;

[[File:Junges Gras.jpg|thumb|Germinating [[Festuca|fescue grass]] with long, blade-like leaves]]

In [[botany]] and [[ecology]], '''graminoid''' refers to a [[herbaceous plant]] with a grass-like morphology, i.e. elongated [[culm (botany)|culms]] with long, blade-like leaves. They are contrasted to [[forbs]], herbaceous plants without grass-like features.

The plants most often referred to include the families [[Poaceae]] (grasses in the strict sense), [[Cyperaceae]] (sedges), and [[Juncaceae]] (rushes). These are not closely related but belong to different [[clade]]s in the order [[Poales]]. The grasses (Poaceae) are by far the largest family with some 12,000 species.

Besides their similar morphology, graminoids share the widespread occurrence and often dominance in open habitats such as [[grasslands]] or [[marshes]]. They can however also be found in the [[understory]] of forests. Sedges and rushes tend to prefer wetter habitats than grasses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7150">'''Gravitational biology''' is the study of the effects [[gravity]] has on [[life|living organisms]]. Throughout the history of the Earth life has [[evolution|evolved]] to survive changing conditions, such as changes in the [[climate]] and [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. However, one constant factor in evolution since life first began on Earth is the [[force]] of gravity. As a consequence, all [[biological process]]es are accustomed to the ever-present force of gravity and even small variations in this force can have significant impact on the health and function and the system of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/print.php?page=human03 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831083511/http://library.thinkquest.org/C003763/print.php?page=human03 |archivedate=2007-08-31 |df= }} Astrobiology: The Living Universe - Gravitational Biology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gravity and life on Earth ==
The force of gravity on the surface of the Earth, normally denoted [[Standard gravity|''g'']], has remained constant in both direction and magnitude since the formation of the planet.{{Fact|date=November 2007}} As a result, both [[plant]] and [[animal]] life have evolved to rely upon and cope with it in various ways.

=== Plant use of gravity ===
{{main|Gravitropism}}
Plant [[tropism]]s are directional movements of a plant with respect to a directional stimulus. One such tropism is [[gravitropism]], or the growth or movement of a plant with respect to gravity. Plant roots grow towards the pull of gravity and away from sunlight, and shoots and stems grow against the pull of gravity and towards sunlight.

=== Animal struggles with gravity ===
Gravity has had an effect on the development of animal life since the first [[single-celled organism]].
The size of single biological cells is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Inverse proportionality|inversely proportional]] to the strength of the gravitational field exerted on the cell. That is, in stronger gravitational fields the size of cells decreases, and in weaker gravitational fields the size of cells increases. Gravity is thus a limiting factor in the growth of individual cells.

Cells which were naturally larger than the size that gravity alone would allow for had to develop means to protect against internal sedimentation. Several of these methods are based upon [[protoplasm]]ic motion, thin and elongated shape of the cell body, increased [[cytoplasm]]ic [[viscosity]], and a reduced range of [[specific gravity]] of cell components relative to the ground-plasma.&lt;ref&gt;"Gravitational Zoology: How Animals Use and Cope with Gravity" Ralf H. Anken, Hinrich Rahmann. 2001. {{cite web |url=http://www.dlr.de/me/Institut/Abteilungen/Strahlenbiologie/pdf/astrobiologie/P4_20.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928041012/http://www.dlr.de/me/Institut/Abteilungen/Strahlenbiologie/pdf/astrobiologie/P4_20.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of gravity on many-celled organisms is considerably more drastic. During the period when animals first evolved to survive on land some method of directed locomotion and thus a form of [[endoskeleton|inner skeleton]] or [[exoskeleton|outer skeleton]] would have been required to cope with the increase in the force of gravity due to the weakened upward force of [[buoyancy]]. Prior to this point, most lifeforms were small and had a worm- or jellyfish-like appearance, and without this evolutionary step would not have been able to maintain their form or move on land.

In larger terrestrial [[vertebrates]] gravitational forces influence [[musculoskeletal system]]s, fluid distribution, and [[hydrodynamics]] of the [[Circulatory system|circulation]].

== Gravity and life elsewhere ==
{{further|Weightlessness#Human health effects|G-force#Human tolerance of g-force}}
Every day the realization of [[space habitat]]ion becomes closer, and even today [[space station]]s exist and are home to long-term, though not yet permanent, residents. Because of this there is a growing scientific interest in how changes in the gravitational field influence different aspects of the [[physiology]] of living organisms, especially [[mammals]] since these results can normally be closely related to the expected effects on humans. All current research in this field can be classified into two groups.&lt;ref&gt;"Models to Study Gravitational Biology of Mammalian Reproduction". Janet Tou, April Ronca, Richard Grindeland, and Charles Wade. ''Biology of Reproduction'' vol. 67. 2002. {{cite web |url=http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/content/abstract/biolreprod.102.007252v1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630072749/http://www.biolreprod.org/cgi/content/abstract/biolreprod.102.007252v1 |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group consists of the experiments that involve gravitational fields of less than one ''g'', termed ''hypogravity'', without [[artificial gravity]], or ''microgravity''. A space station or a spacecraft in a [[spaceflight]] will be in hypogravity. Therefore, understanding of the effects of hypogravity on the human body is necessary for prolonged space travel and colonization.

The second group consist of those involving gravitational fields of more than one ''g'', termed ''hypergravity''. For brief periods during take-off and landing of space craft [[astronauts]] are under the influence of hypergravity. Understanding the effects of hypergravity are also necessary if colonization of planets larger than the Earth is ever to take place.

===Recent experiments===
Recent experiments have proven that alterations in [[metabolism]], [[immune cell]] function, [[cell division]], and cell attachment all occur in the hypogravity of space. For example, after a matter of days in [[Weightlessness#Microgravity|microgravity]] (&lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ''g''), human immune cells were unable to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into mature cells. One of the large implications of this is that if certain cells cannot differentiate in space, organisms may not be able to reproduce successfully after exposure to zero gravity.

Scientists believe that the stress associated with space flight is responsible for the inability of some cells to differentiate. These stresses can alter metabolic activities and can disturb the chemical processes in living organisms. A specific example would be that of bone cell growth. Microgravity impedes the development of bone cells. Bone cells must attach themselves to something shortly after development and will die if they cannot. Without the downward pull of a gravitational force on these bone cells, they float around randomly and eventually die off. This suggests that the direction of gravity may give the cells clues as to where to attach themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">The '''highly accelerated stress test''' (HAST) method was first proposed by Jeffrey E. Gunn, Sushil K. Malik, and Purabi M. Mazumdar of IBM. 

The acceleration factor for elevated humidity is empirically derived to be

:&lt;math&gt;AF_\text{H} = e^{\text{const} \cdot (RH_\text{s}^n - RH_\text{o}^n)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stressed humidity, ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the operating-environment humidity, and ''n'' is an empirically derived constant (usually 1 &lt; ''n'' &lt; 5).

The acceleration factor for elevated temperature is derived to be

:&lt;math&gt;AF_T = e^{(E_\text{a}/k)(1/T_\text{o} - 1/T_\text{s})},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the activation energy for the temperature-induced failure (most often 0.7&amp;nbsp;eV for electronics), ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[operating temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stressed temperature.

Therefore the total acceleration factor for unbiased HAST testing is

:&lt;math&gt;AF_\text{HAST} = AF_\text{H} \cdot AF_T =
 e^{\text{const} \cdot (RH_\text{s}^n - RH_\text{o}^n)}
 e^{(E_\text{a}/k)(1/T_\text{o} - 1/T_\text{s})}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Paper]], a thin unwoven material made from milled plant fibers, is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white. The first [[papermaking]] process was documented in China during the [[Eastern Han]] period (25–220 CE), traditionally attributed to the court official [[Cai Lun]]. During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the [[Islamic world]], where [[pulp mill]]s and [[paper mill]]s were used for papermaking and money making. By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe. By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing [[waterwheel]]s in Spain. Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of [[Wood pulp|wood-based]] papers.

Although precursors such as [[papyrus]] and [[amate]] existed in the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean world]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian Americas]], respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper. Nor is true [[parchment]] considered paper{{efn|Confusingly, parchment ''paper'' is a treated paper used in baking, and unrelated to true parchment.}}; used principally for writing, parchment is heavily prepared animal skin that predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper" was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates, and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties. 

==Precursors: papyrus==
[[File:Papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|In contrast to paper, papyrus has an uneven surface that visibly retains the original structure of the ribbon-like strips that make it up. As the papyrus is worked, it tends to break apart along the seams, leading to long linear cracks and eventually falling apart.]]
[[File:Busto maschile.JPG|thumb|[[Roman portraiture]] fresco of a young man with a [[papyrus]] [[scroll]], from [[Herculaneum]], 1st century CE]]
The word "paper" is etymologically derived from ''papyrus'', [[Ancient Greek]] for the ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' plant. [[Papyrus]] is a thick, paper-like material produced from the pith of the ''Cyperus papyrus'' plant which was used in [[ancient Egypt]] and other [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean societies]] for [[History of writing|writing]] long before paper was used in China.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Papyrus
|title=Papyrus definition
| work=Dictionary.com
|accessdate=2008-11-20
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Papyrus is prepared by cutting off thin ribbon-like strips of the interior of the ''Cyperus papyrus'', and then laying out the strips side-by-side to make a sheet. A second layer is then placed on top, with the strips running at right angle to the first. The two layers are the pounded together into a sheet. The result is very strong, but has an uneven surface, especially at the edges of the strips. When used in scrolls, repeated rolling and unrolling causes the strips to come apart again, typically along vertical lines. This effect can be seen in many ancient papyrus documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper contrasts with papyrus in that the plant material is broken down through maceration or disintegration before the paper is pressed. This produces a much more even surface, and no natural weak direction in the material which falls apart over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|It is lucky chance that the date of CE 105 was recorded, because Cai Lun, the official involved, who seems to have introduced some improvements in paper manufacture, worked at the palace as a eunuch. Yet just because the new technology was not trumpeted at the time does not mean that it had no effect. On the contrary: up to this point China was lagging behind those Mediterranean societies where papyrus was used and where light, inexpensive scrolls could be created. But thereafter the advantage swung the other way, since papyrus, which is composed of organic material not as highly processed as paper, was prone to splitting and deterioration at a much greater rate; this may be why vellum eventually came to dominate, especially in the harsher climate of Northern Europe. Paper, by contrast, gave a good, uniform writing surface that could be smoothly rolled and unrolled without damage, while remaining relatively durable.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}|T.H. Barrett}}

{{Further|Cai Lun#Invention of paper|Science and technology of the Han Dynasty}}

Archaeological evidence of [[papermaking]] predates the traditional attribution given to [[Cai Lun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an imperial eunuch official of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – CE 220), thus the exact date or inventor of paper can not be deduced. The earliest extant paper fragment was unearthed at [[Fangmatan]] in [[Gansu]] province, and was likely part of a map, dated to 179–141 BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"&gt;
{{Citation|author=David Buisseret|title=Envisaging the City|year=1998|publisher=U Chicago Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBvl1wHRTX0C|page=12|isbn=978-0-226-07993-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of paper have also been found at Dunhuang dated to 65 BCE and at Yumen pass, dated to 8 BCE.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}

"Cai Lun's" invention, recorded hundreds of years after it took place, is dated to 105 CE. The innovation is a type of paper made of [[mulberry]] and other [[bast fibre]]s along with [[fishing nets]], old rags, and [[hemp]] waste which reduced the cost of paper production, which prior to this, and later, in the West, depended solely on rags.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}}&lt;ref&gt;Papermaking. (2007). In: ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved April 9, 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}}

===Techniques===
During the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] (1600–1050 BCE) and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (1050–256 BCE) dynasties of [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]], documents were ordinarily written on bone or [[bamboo]] (on tablets or on bamboo strips sewn and rolled together into scrolls), making them very heavy, awkward, and hard to transport. The light material of [[silk]] was sometimes used as a recording medium, but was normally too expensive to consider. The [[Han dynasty]] Chinese court official [[Cai Lun]] (c. 50–121 CE) is credited as the inventor of a method of papermaking (inspired by wasps and bees) using rags and other plant fibers in 105 CE.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=34}} However, the discovery of specimens bearing written [[Chinese character]]s in 2006 at [[Fangmatan]] in north-east China's [[Gansu]] Province suggests that paper was in use by the ancient Chinese military more than 100 years before Cai, in 8 BCE, and possibly much earlier as the map fragment found at the Fangmatan tomb site dates from the early 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="buisseret 1998 p12"/&gt; It therefore would appear that "Cai Lun's contribution was to improve this skill systematically and scientifically, fix a recipe for papermaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-08/08/content_4937457.htm|title=eNewsletter|publisher=World Archeological Congress|date=August 2006|accessdate=2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The record in the ''[[Twenty-Four Histories]]'' says&lt;ref name=needham&gt;
{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=40}} uses Wade-Giles transcription&lt;/ref&gt;
:In ancient times writings and inscriptions were generally made on tablets of bamboo or on pieces of silk called chih. But silk being costly and bamboos heavy they were not convenient to use. Tshai Lun then initiated the idea of making paper from the bark of trees, remnants of hemp, rags of cloth and fishing nets. He submitted the process to the emperor in the first year of Yuan-Hsing (105 CE) and received praise for his ability. From this time, paper has been in use everywhere and is universally called the paper of Marquis Tshai.

The production process may have originated from the practice of pounding and stirring rags in water, after which the matted fibres were collected on a mat. The bark of [[paper mulberry]] was particularly valued and high quality paper was developed in the late Han period using the bark of ''tan'' (檀; [[sandalwood]]). In the [[Eastern Jin]] period a fine bamboo screen-mould treated with insecticidal dye for permanence was used in papermaking. After [[printing]] was popularized during the [[Song dynasty]] the demand for paper grew substantially. In the year 1101, 1.5 million sheets of paper were sent to the capital.&lt;ref name=needham /&gt;

Among the earliest known uses of paper was padding and wrapping delicate bronze mirrors according to archaeological evidence dating to the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] from the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padding doubled as both protection for the object as well as the user in cases where poisonous "medicine" were involved, as mentioned in the official history of the period.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122"/&gt; Although paper was used for writing by the 3rd century CE,&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 1"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper continued to be used for wrapping (and other) purposes. [[Toilet paper]] was used in China from around the late 6th century.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 589, the Chinese scholar-official [[Yan Zhitui]] (531–591) wrote: "Paper on which there are quotations or commentaries from [[Five Classics]] or the names of [[Wise old man|sage]]s, I dare not use for toilet purposes".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; An [[Arab]] traveler who visited China wrote of the curious Chinese tradition of toilet paper in 851, writing: "...&amp;nbsp;[the Chinese] do not wash themselves with water when they have done their necessities; but they only wipe themselves with paper".&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt;

During the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) paper was folded and sewn into square bags to preserve the flavor of [[tea]]. In the same period, it was written that tea was served from baskets with multi-colored paper cups and paper napkins of different size and shape.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 122" /&gt; During the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the government produced the world's first known paper-printed money, or [[banknote]] (''see [[Jiaozi (currency)|Jiaozi]] and [[Huizi (currency)|Huizi]]''). Paper money was bestowed as gifts to government officials in special paper [[envelope]]s.&lt;ref name="needham volume 5 123"/&gt; During the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368), the first well-documented [[Europeans in Medieval China]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] merchant [[Marco Polo]] remarked how the Chinese burned paper [[effigy|effigies]] shaped as male and female servants, camels, horses, suits of clothing and armor while [[Cremation|cremating]] the dead during [[Funerary art|funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of paper===
According to Timothy Hugh Barrett, paper played a pivotal role in early Chinese written culture, and a "strong reading culture seems to have developed quickly after its introduction, despite political fragmentation."{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=36}} Indeed the introduction of paper had immense consequences for the book world. It meant books would no longer have to be circulated in small sections or bundles, but in their entirety. Books could now be carried by hand rather than transported by cart. As a result individual collections of literary works increased in the following centuries.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=909}}

Textual culture seems to have been more developed in the south by the early 5th century, with individuals owning collections of several thousand scrolls. In the north an entire palace collection might have been only a few thousand scrolls in total.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=37}} By the early 6th century, scholars in both the north and south were capable of citing upwards of 400 sources in commentaries on older works.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=37-38}} A small compilation text from the 7th century included citations to over 1,400 works.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=38}}

The personal nature of texts was remarked upon by a late 6th century imperial librarian. According to him, the possession of and familiarity with a few hundred scrolls was what it took to be socially accepted as an educated man.{{sfn|Barrett|2008|p=39}} 

According to Endymion Wilkinson, one consequence of the rise of paper in China was that "it rapidly began to surpass the Mediterranean empires in book production."{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=908}} During the Tang dynasty, China became the world leader in book production. In addition the gradual spread of [[woodblock printing]] from the late Tang and Song further boosted their lead ahead of the rest of the world.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}

{{quotation|From the fourth century CE to about 1500, the biggest library collections in China were three to four times larger than the largest collections in Europe. The imperial government book collections in the Tang numbered about 5,000 to 6,000 titles (89,000 ''juan'') in 721. The Song imperial collections at their height in the early twelfth century may have risen to 4,000 to 5,000 titles. These are indeed impressive numbers, but the imperial libraries were exceptional in China and their use was highly restricted. Only very few libraries in the Tang and Song held more than one or two thousand titles (a size not even matched by the manuscript collections of the grandest of the great cathedral libraries in Europe).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

However despite the initial advantage afforded to China by the paper medium, by the 9th century its spread and development in the middle east had closed the gap between the two regions. Between the 9th to early 12th centuries, libraries in Cairo, Baghdad, and Cordoba held collections larger than even the ones in China, and dwarfed those in Europe. From about 1500 the maturation of paper making and printing in Southern Europe also had an effect in closing the gap with the Chinese. The Venetian [[Domenico Grimani]]'s collection numbered 15,000 volumes by the time of his death in 1523. After 1600, European collections completely overtook those in China. The Bibliotheca Augusta numbered 60,000 volumes in 1649 and surged to 120,000 in 1666. In the 1720s the Bibliotheque du Roi numbered 80,000 books and the Cambridge University 40,000 in 1715. After 1700, libraries in North America also began to overtake those of China, and toward the end of the century, [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s private collection numbered 4,889 titles in 6,487 volumes. The European advantage only increased further into the 19th century as national collections in Europe and America exceeded a million volumes while a few private collections, such as that of Lord Action, reached 70,000.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=934}}

{{quotation|European book production began to catch up with China after the introduction of the mechanical printing press in the mid fifteenth century. Reliable figures of the number of imprints of each edition are as hard to find in Europe as they are in China, but one result of the spread of printing in Europe was that public and private libraries were able to build up their collections and for the first time in over a thousand years they began to match and then overtake the largest libraries in China.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2012|p=935}}|Endymion Wilkinson}}

Paper became central to the three arts of China – poetry, painting, and calligraphy. In later times paper constituted one of the 'Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio,' alongside the brush, the ink, and the inkstone.{{sfn|Barret|2008|p=40}}

==Paper in Asia==

{{see|Dunhuang manuscripts}}

After its origin in central [[China]], the production and use of paper spread steadily. It is clear that paper was used at [[Dunhuang]] by 150 CE, in [[Loulan]] in the modern-day province of [[Xinjiang]] by 200, and in [[Turpan]] by 399.  Paper was concurrently introduced in [[Japan]] sometime between the years 280 and 610.&lt;ref&gt;DeVinne, Theo. L. ''The Invention of Printing''.

In Muslim countries they made books lighter—sewn with silk and bound with leather-covered paste boards; they had a flap that wrapped the book up when not in use. As paper was less reactive to humidity, the heavy boards were not needed.

Since the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, paper manufacturing in Damascus had been interrupted by wars, but its production continued in two other centres.

The oldest known paper document in the West is the [[Mozarab]] [[Missal of Silos]] from the 11th century, probably using paper made in the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic part of the Iberian Peninsula]]. They used [[hemp]] and [[linen]] rags as a source of fiber. The first recorded paper mill in the Iberian Peninsula was in [[Xàtiva]] in 1056.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Leslie Hills: ''Papermaking in Britain 1488–1988: A Short History.''

Papermaking reached [[Europe]] as early as 1085 in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and was firmly established in [[Xàtiva]], [[Spain]] by 1150.  It is clear that [[France]] had a paper mill by 1190, and by 1276 mills were established in [[Fabriano]], [[Italy]] and in [[Treviso]] and other northern Italian towns by 1340.  Papermaking then spread further northwards, with evidence of paper being made in [[Troyes]], [[France]] by 1348, in [[Holland]] sometime around 1340–1350, in [[Mainz]], [[Germany]] in 1320, and in [[Nuremberg]] by 1390 in a mill set up by [[Ulman Stromer]].&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Neathery Batsell|title=A Brief history of paper|year=2002|url=http://users.stlcc.edu/nfuller/paper/|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was just about the time when the [[woodcut]] [[printmaking]] technique was transferred from fabric to paper in the [[old master print]] and [[popular prints]]. There was a paper mill in [[Switzerland]] by 1432 and the first mill in [[England]] was set up by [[John Tate (papermaker)|John Tate]] in 1490 near [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manufactura.cz/historie.htm Historie ručního papíru&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the first commercially successful paper mill in [[Great Britain|Britain]] did not occur before 1588 when [[John Spilman]] set up a mill near [[Dartford]] in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartfordarchive.org.uk/technology/paper.shtml|title=Dartford, cradle of Britain's papermaking industry|accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, paper making spread to [[Poland]] by 1491, to [[Austria]] by 1498, to [[Russia]] by 1576, to the [[Netherlands]] by 1586, to [[Denmark]] by 1596, and to [[Sweden]] by 1612.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Arab prisoners who settled in a town called [[Borgo Saraceno]] in the Italian [[Province of Ferrara]] introduced [[Fabriano]] artisans in the [[Province of Ancona]]{{huh|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- is this the wrong Borgo Saraceno? they seem very far apart--&gt; the technique of making paper by hand.  At the time they were renowned for their wool-weaving and manufacture of cloth.  Fabriano papermakers considered the process of making paper by hand an art form and were able to refine the process to successfully compete with parchment which was the primary medium for writing at the time.  They developed the application of stamping hammers to reduce rags to pulp for making paper, [[sizing]] paper by means of [[animal glue]], and creating watermarks in the paper during its forming process. The Fabriano used glue obtained by boiling scrolls or scraps of animal skin to size the paper; it is suggested that this technique was recommended by the local [[tannery|tanneries]]. The introduction of the first European watermarks in Fabriano was linked to applying metal wires on a cover laid against the mould which was used for forming the paper.&lt;ref name="gasparinetti"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10079/bibid/11263265|title=Early Italian papermaking : a crucial technical revolution|last1=Hills|first1=Richard|date=1936|pages=37–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==

[[File:Huex_codex_1a_loc.jpg|thumb|[[Amate]] is similar to modern paper but has a more fibrous texture.]]

In the Americas, archaeological evidence indicates that a similar bark-paper writing material was used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns no later than the 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathcs.duq.edu/~tobin/maya/ The Construction of the Codex In Classic- and post classic-Period Maya Civilization] Maya Codex and Paper Making&lt;/ref&gt; Called ''[[amatl]]'' or ''[[amate]]'', it was in widespread use among [[Mesoamerican]] cultures until the [[Spanish conquest]]. The earliest sample of [[amate]] was found at [[Huitzilapa]] near the [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco]], Mexico, belonging to the [[shaft tomb culture]]. It is dated to 75 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Benz, Bruce; Lorenza Lopez Mestas; Jorge Ramos de la Vega (2006). "Organic Offerings, Paper, and Fibers from the Huitzilapa Shaft Tomb, Jalisco, Mexico". Ancient Mesoamerica.== 17 (2). pp. 283–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of amate is much more similar to paper than papyrus. The bark material is soaked in water, or in modern methods [[boiled]], so that it breaks down into a mass of fibres. They are then laid out in a frame and pressed into sheets. It is a true paper product in that the material is not in its original form, but the base material has much larger fibres than those used in modern papers. As a result, amate has a rougher surface than modern paper, and may dry into a sheet with hills and valleys as the different length fibres shrink.

European papermaking spread to the Americas first in [[Mexico]] by 1575 and then in [[Philadelphia]] by 1690.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Gimpel goes on to say : "This is convincing evidence of how technologically minded the Europeans of that era were. Paper had traveled nearly halfway around the world, but no culture or civilization on its route had tried to mechanize its manufacture."'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general absence of the use of water-powered paper mills in Muslim papermaking prior to the 11th century is suggested by the habit of Muslim authors at the time to call a production center not a "mill", but a "paper manufactory".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}: {{quote|Indeed, Muslim authors in general call any "paper manufactory" a ''wiraqah'' – not a "mill" (''tahun'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrialisation of the paper production the most common fibre source was recycled fibres from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from [[hemp]], [[linen]] and [[cotton]].&lt;ref name=PST1&gt;{{Citation |last1=Göttsching|first1=Lothar|authorlink1= |last2=Pakarinen |first2=Heikki |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Recycled Fiber and Deinking|url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 7 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-07-1 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= 12–14 |chapter= 1|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A process for removing printing inks from [[recycled paper]] was invented by German jurist [[Justus Claproth]] in 1774.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt; Today this method is called [[deinking]]. It was not until the introduction of [[wood pulp]] in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from [[ragpicker]]s.&lt;ref name=PST1 /&gt;

==19th-century advances in papermaking==
Although cheaper than vellum, paper remained expensive, at least in book-sized quantities, through the centuries, until the advent of steam-driven paper making machines in the 19th century, which could make paper with [[fibres]] from [[wood pulp]]. Although older machines predated it, the [[Fourdrinier machine|Fourdrinier]] papermaking machine became the basis for most modern papermaking. [[Robert brothers|Nicholas Louis Robert]] of [[Essonnes]], [[France]], was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine in 1799. At the time he was working for [[Leger Didot]] with whom he quarrelled over the ownership of the invention. Didot sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, to meet  Sealy and [[Henry Fourdrinier]], stationers of [[London]], who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British [[patent]] 2487 on 20 October 1801. With the help particularly of [[Bryan Donkin]], a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], [[Hertfordshire]], in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers' own mill at [[Two Waters]]. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at [[St Neots]] intending to install two machines there and the process and machines continued to develop.

However, experiments with wood showed no real results in the late 18th century and at the start of the 19th century. By 1800, [[Matthias Koops]] (in London, England) further investigated the idea of using wood to make paper, and in 1801 he wrote and published a book titled ''Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper.''&lt;ref&gt;Koops, Matthias. Historical account of the substances which have been used to describe events, and to convey ideas, from the earliest date, to the invention of paper. London: Printed by T. Burton, 1800.&lt;/ref&gt; His book was printed on paper made from wood shavings (and adhered together). No pages were fabricated using the pulping method (from either rags or wood). He received financial support from the royal family to make his printing machines and acquire the materials and infrastructure needed to start his printing business. But his enterprise was short lived. Only a few years following his first and only printed book (the one he wrote and printed), he went bankrupt. The book was very well done (strong and had a fine appearance), but it was very costly.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, George. Paper in the Making. Toronto: The Garden City Press Co-Operative, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison. "Koops. Matthias." Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: from the earliest times to the year 2000, Vol. 32. London: Oxford University Press, 2004: 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}} pp.30–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Then in the 1830s and 1840s, two men on two different continents took up the challenge, but from a totally new perspective. Both [[Friedrich Gottlob Keller]] and [[Charles Fenerty]] began experiments with wood but using the same technique used in paper making; instead of pulping rags, they thought about pulping wood. And at about the same time, by mid-1844, they announced their findings. They invented a machine which extracted the fibres from wood (exactly as with rags) and made paper from it. Charles Fenerty also bleached the pulp so that the paper was white. This started a new era for paper making. By the end of the 19th-century almost all printers in the [[western world]] were using wood in lieu of rags to make paper.&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-9783318-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the invention of the practical [[fountain pen]] and the mass-produced [[pencil]] of the same period, and in conjunction with the advent of the steam driven rotary [[printing press]], wood based paper caused a major transformation of the 19th century economy and society in industrialized countries. With the introduction of cheaper paper, schoolbooks, fiction, non-fiction, and newspapers became gradually available by 1900. Cheap wood based paper also meant that keeping personal diaries or writing letters became possible and so, by 1850, the [[clerk (position)|clerk]], or writer, ceased to be a high-status job.

The original wood-based paper was acidic due to the use of [[alum]] and more prone to disintegrate over time, through processes known as [[slow fires]]. Documents written on more expensive rag paper were more stable. Mass-market paperback books still use these cheaper mechanical papers (see below), but book publishers can now use [[acid-free paper]] for [[hardback]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] books.

==Determining provenance==
Determining the provenance of paper is a complex process that can be done in a variety of ways.  The easiest way is using a known sheet of paper as an exemplar.  Using known sheets can produce an exact identification.  Next, comparing watermarks with those contained in catalogs or trade listings can yield useful results.  Inspecting the surface can also determine age and location by looking for distinct marks from the production process.  Chemical and fiber analysis can be used to establish date of creation and perhaps location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book: A Global History|first1=Michael F.|last1= Suarez, S.J.| last2=Woudhuysen|first2=H.R.|isbn=9780199679416|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sbacAQAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5363">Policy '''Impact Assessments''' (IAs) are formal, evidence-based procedures that assess the economic, social, and environmental effects of [[public policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adelle|first=Camilla|author2=Weiland, Sabine |title=Policy assessment: the state of the art|journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal|date=2012|volume=30|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1080/14615517.2012.663256}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been incorporated into policy making in the [[OECD]] countries and the [[European Commission]].

Key types of impact assessments include global assessments (global level), policy impact assessment (policy level), strategic environmental assessment (programme and plan level), and [[environmental impact assessment]] (project level). Impact assessments can focus on specific themes, such as [[social impact assessment]]s and gender impact assessments.

IAs can improve legislation by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Klaus|author2=Ferretti, Johanna |author3=Guske, Anna-Lena |author4=Turnpenny, John |author5=Jordan, Andrew |author6= Adelle, Camilla |title=Sustainability in Impact Assessments A Review of Impact Assessment Systems in selected OECD countries and the European Commission|journal=OECD|date=2011|volume=SG/SD(2011)6/FINAL|url=http://www.oecd.org/gov/regulatory-policy/Sustainability%20in%20impact%20assessment%20SG-SD%282011%296-FINAL.pdf|accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Informing policy makers about potential economic, social, and environmental ramifications
* Improving transparency so that contributions to sustainability and "better regulation" are disclosed and [[Special Interest Group|special interest]] [[lobbying]] is discouraged
* Increasing public participation in order to reflect a range of considerations, thereby improving the legitimacy of policies
* Clarifying how public policy helps achieve its goals and priorities through policy indicators
* Contributing to continuous learning in policy development by identifying causalities that inform ex-post review of policies

== Procedure ==
The department which is responsible for the policy proposal usually has to carry out the IA. Although the purpose and orientation of IA procedures differ, IA guidelines in the various jurisdictions all follow a similar set of steps to be followed by desk officers:
# Planning of the IA
# Carrying out the impact analysis
# Consultation of affected stakeholders and the general public
# Coordination with affected departments
# Summary and presentation of findings in a report
# Forwarding findings to decision makers
# Publication of the IA report (not in all countries)

The analytical steps, which mainly relate to step 2, can be set out as
i.	Problem definition
ii.	Definition of policy objectives
iii.	Development of policy options
iv.	Analysis of impacts
v.	Comparison of policy options and recommendation of one option
vi.	Defining monitoring measures.

== Methods ==
Throughout the IA process, methods can be used for support. In recent years governments have increasingly invested in developing and applying methods and tools for IA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Podhora|first=Aranka |author2=Helming, K |author3=Adenäuer, L. |author4=Heckelei, T. |author5=Kautto, P. |author6=Reidsma, P. |author7=Rennings, K. |author8=Turnpenny, J. |author9=Jansen, J.|title=).

Depending on usage, IA methods can be classified as methods for
* Scoping (e.g., checklists)
* For qualitative analysis (e.g., [[focus groups]])
* For quantitative analysis (e.g., [[life-cycle assessment]], [[material flow accounting]], modelling)
* Aggregation and comparison of options (e.g., [[cost–benefit analysis]])
* Analysing coherence (e.g., Gender IA)
* Supporting participation and involvement (e.g., internet consultation)

The '''Institute of Solid State Physics''' ('''ISSP'''; {{lang-ru|Институт физики твердого тела}}) of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] is a research institution, located in the small town of [[Chernogolovka]] near [[Moscow]] in [[Russia]]. Founded on February 15, 1963, the institute has grown to become one of the largest [[physics]] institutes in the country. Its main fields of research are [[condensed matter physics]] and [[materials science]].

==About the institute==
The Institute of Solid State Physics was established on February 15, 1963 by the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (now the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]). The main organizers of the institute were [[Georgii Kurdyumov]], [[Yuri Osipyan]], and [[Cheslav Kopetsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khalatnikov|first1=Isaak M.|title=From the Atomic Bomb to the Landau Institute: Autobiography.

The institute has 22 laboratories, and more than 200 physical scientists and engineers. It carries out research in theoretical and experimental [[condensed matter physics]] and [[physical metallurgy]]. The fundamental insights gained in these fields are also applied to develop new technologies. The institute is one of the leaders in areas such as [[superconductivity]], physics of [[fullerenes]], physics of defects, [[crystal growth]], [[amorphous]] and [[nanocrystalline]] materials, and other areas of condensed matter physics.&lt;ref name="AboutISSP"/&gt;

The institute is also an educational center; it provides education and training to undergraduate as well as [[doctorate]] students in physical sciences.&lt;ref name="AboutISSP"/&gt; Students from [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]], [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]], and Faculty of Physics and Division of Physical Chemistry of Lomonosov Moscow State University are allowed to study and train at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education|url=http://www.issp.ac.ru/engl/education|publisher=Institute of Solid State Physics|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of General and Applied Physics of MIPT collaborates with the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership Sections|url=http://mipt.ru/en/education/partnership-sections/|publisher=Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The institute also organizes conferences and seminars on various areas of condensed matter physics.

[[Andre Geim]] obtained his PhD from the institute in 1987, he would go on to win the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2010 "for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics - Press Release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.html|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Intraspecific antagonism''' means a disharmonious or antagonistic interaction between two [[individual]]s of the same [[species]]. As such, it could be a [[sociology|sociological]] term, but was actually coined by [[Alan Rayner]] and [[Norman Kalmer Todd|Norman Todd]] working at [[Exeter University]] in the late 1970s, to characterise a particular kind of [[zone line]] formed between [[wood-rotting fungus|wood-rotting fungal]] [[mycelium|mycelia]]. Intraspecific antagonism is one of the expressions of a phenomenon known as vegetative or somatic incompatibility.&lt;ref name=Worral1997/&gt;

==Fungal individualism==

Zone lines form in [[wood]] for many reasons, including host reactions against [[parasite|parasitic]] encroachment, and inter-specific interactions, but the lines observed by Rayner and Todd when transversely-cut sections of [[Birch bracket|brown-rotted birch]] tree trunk or branch were incubated in plastic bags appeared to be due to a reaction between different individuals of the same species of [[fungus]].&lt;ref name=Rayner1979/&gt;

This was a startling inference at a time when the prevailing orthodoxy within the [[Mycology|mycological]] community was that of the "unit mycelium". This was the theory that when two different individuals of the same species of [[basidiomycete]] wood rotting fungi grew and met within the substratum, they fused, cooperated, and shared nuclei freely.&lt;ref name=Burnett1976/&gt; Rayner and Todd's insight was that basidiomycete fungi individuals do, in most "adult" or [[dikaryon|dikaryotic]] cases anyway, retain their individuality.&lt;ref name=Rayner1977/&gt;

A small stable of postgraduate and postdoctoral students helped elucidate the mechanisms underlying these intermycelial interactions, at [[Exeter University]] (Todd) and the [[University of Bath]] (Rayner), over the next few years.

==Applications of intraspecific antagonism==

[[Image:fungalzoneline.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Zone lines in driftwood'']] Although the attribution of individual status to the mycelia confined by intraspecific zone lines is a comparatively new idea, zone lines themselves have been known since time immemorial. The term [[spalting]] is applied by woodworkers to wood showing strongly-figured zone lines, particularly those cases where the area of "no-man's land" between two antagonistic conspecific mycelia is colonised by another species of fungus. [[Dematiaceous]] hyphomycetes, with their dark-coloured mycelia, produce particularly attractive black zone lines when they colonise the areas occupied by two antagonistic basidiomycete individuals. Spalted wood can be difficult to work, since different individual wood-rotting fungi have different decay efficiencies, and thus produce zones of different softness, and the zone lines themselves are usually unrotted and hard.

Instraspecific antagonism can also sometimes be of assistance in quickly recognising the membership of clones in those fungi, particularly root-rots such as [[Honey fungus|Armillarea]] where individual mycelia may colonise large areas, or more than one tree.

It is even the subject of a recent patent.[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4698305.html]

== Stevens's typology ==
=== Overview ===
Stevens proposed his typology in a 1946 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article titled "On the theory of scales of measurement".&lt;ref name="Stevens 1946"/&gt; In that article, Stevens claimed that all [[measurement]] in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called "nominal," "ordinal," "interval," and "ratio," unifying both "[[Qualitative property|qualitative]]" (which are described by his "nominal" type) and "[[Quantitative property|quantitative]]" (to a different degree, all the rest of his scales). The concept of scale types later received the mathematical rigour that it lacked at its inception with the work of mathematical psychologists Theodore Alper (1985, 1987), Louis Narens (1981a, b), and [[R. Duncan Luce]] (1986, 1987, 2001). As Luce (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;395) wrote:
{{quote|S. S. Stevens (1946, 1951, 1975) claimed that what counted was having an interval or ratio scale. Subsequent research has given meaning to this assertion, but given his attempts to invoke scale type ideas it is doubtful if he understood it himself&amp;nbsp;... no measurement theorist I know accepts Stevens's broad definition of measurement&amp;nbsp;... in our view, the only sensible meaning for 'rule' is empirically testable laws about the attribute.}}

==== Comparison ====
To give a better overview the values in 'Mathematical Operators', 'Advanced operations' and 'Central tendency' are only the ones this level of measurement introduces. The complete list includes the values of previous levels. This is inverted for the 'Measure property'.

=== Nominal level ===
The nominal type differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the [[Constructivist epistemology|construction of classifications]] as well as the classification of items. Discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship:  for example, a [[globally unique identifier]].

Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form.&lt;ref&gt;Nominal measures are based on sets and  depend on categories, a la Aristotle: {{cite web |url=http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/gmartin/geog476/Lecture/BeySt.htm |title=Beyond Stevens: A revised approach to measurement for geographic information |first=Nicholas |last=Chrisman |date=March 1995 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ...  Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", – pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-63-032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a university one could also use hall of affiliation as an example. Other concrete examples are 
* in [[grammar]], the [[parts of speech]]: noun, verb, preposition, article, pronoun, etc.
* in politics, [[power projection]]: hard power, soft power, etc.
* in biology, the [[taxonomic rank]]s below domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya
* in [[software engineering]], type of [[Trap (computing)|faults]]: specification faults, design faults, and code faults

Nominal scales were often called qualitative scales, and measurements made on qualitative scales were called qualitative data. However, the rise of qualitative research has made this usage confusing. The numbers in nominal measurement are assigned as labels and have no specific numerical value or meaning. No form of arithmetic computation (+,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;etc.) may be performed on nominal measures. The nominal level is the lowest measurement level  used from a statistical point of view.

====Mathematical operations====
[[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and other operations that can be defined in terms of equality, such as [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] and [[set membership]], are the only [[non-trivial]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s that generically apply to objects of the nominal type.

====Central tendency====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], i.e. the ''most common'' item, is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]] for the nominal type. On the other hand, the [[median]], i.e. the ''middle-ranked'' item, makes no sense for the nominal type of data since ranking is meaningless for the nominal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manikandan|first1=S.|title=Measures of central tendency: Median and mode|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|date=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–5|doi=10.4103/0976-500X.83300|pmc=3157145|pmid=21897729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinal scale===
{{anchor |Ordinal scale}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[IQ classification]] and other articles --&gt;
{{further|Ordinal data}}

The ordinal type allows for [[rank order]] (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative ''degree of difference'' between them. Examples include, on one hand, '''dichotomous''' data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'not-guilty' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring [[truth value]], and, on the other hand, '''non-dichotomous''' data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring [[opinion]].

; Central tendency
The [[median]], i.e. ''middle-ranked'', item is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]]; however, the mean (or average) as the measure of [[central tendency]] is not allowed. The [[mode (statistics)|mode]] is allowed.

In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no [[Validity (logic)|validity]], but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve [[operationalization]] of variables used in [[questionnaire]]s. Most psychological data collected by [[psychometric]] instruments and tests, measuring [[cognitive]] and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |title=Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores |last1=Lord |first1=Frederic M. |last2=Novick |first2=Melvin R. |last3=Birnbaum |first3=Allan |year=1968 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading (MA) |lccn=68011394 |laysummary=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1162101 |laydate=24 June 2013 |page=21 |quote=Although, formally speaking, interval measurement can always be obtained by specification, such specification is theoretically meaningful only if it is implied by the theory and model relevant to the measurement procedure. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures |last=Sheskin |first=David J. |year=2007 |edition=Fourth |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton (FL) |isbn=978-1-58488-814-7 |page=3 |laysummary=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781584888147 |laydate=27 July 2010 |quote=Although in practice IQ and most other human characteristics measured by psychological tests (such as anxiety, introversion, self esteem, etc.) are treated as interval scales, many researchers would argue that they are more appropriately categorized as ordinal scales.

===Interval scale===
The interval type allows for the ''degree of difference'' between items, but not the ratio between them. Examples include ''temperature'' with the [[degree Celsius|Celsius scale]], which has two defined points (the freezing and boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated into 100 intervals, ''date'' when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD), ''percentage'' such as a percentage return on a [[stock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Ken | chapter = Introduction | title = Business Statistics: Contemporary Decision Making | publisher = Wiley | edition = 6th | date = 2010 | location = Hoboken, NJ | pages = 2–135 | isbn = 0-470-40901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''location'' in Cartesian coordinates, and ''direction'' measured in degrees from true or magnetic north. Ratios are not meaningful since 20&amp;nbsp;°C cannot be said to be "twice as hot" as 10&amp;nbsp;°C, nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, ''ratios of differences'' can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another. Interval type variables are sometimes also called "scaled variables", but the formal mathematical term is an [[affine space]] (in this case an [[affine line]]).

====Central tendency and statistical dispersion====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], and [[arithmetic mean]] are allowed to measure central tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion include [[range (statistics)|range]] and [[standard deviation]]. Since one can only divide by ''differences'', one cannot define measures that require some ratios, such as &lt;!--- the studentized range or. --- Error: studentized range is a ratio of a difference (range) to a root-mean-square difference (standard DEVIATION from the mean ---&gt; the [[coefficient of variation]]. More subtly, while one can define [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define [[Standardized_moment|standardized moments]], since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin, unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central moment.

=== Ratio scale ===
The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value.  Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include [[mass]], [[length]], [[Time|duration]], [[plane angle]], [[energy]] and [[electric charge]]. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has "twice the length."  Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying "how much" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or "how many" (a count). The [[Kelvin]] temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called [[absolute zero]].  &lt;!-- The zero point of the Celsius scale is at 273.15 kelvins, so Celsius is not a ratio scale. --&gt;

; Central tendency and statistical dispersion
The [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]] are allowed to measure the central tendency, in addition to the mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The [[studentized range]] and the [[coefficient of variation]] are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.

== Debate on Stevens's typology ==
While Stevens's typology is widely adopted, it is still being challenged by other theoreticians, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal types (Michell, 1986).&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velleman |first1=Paul F. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Leland |journal=The American Statistician | title=Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading |volume=47 | number=1 | year = 1993 |pages=65–72 |doi=10.2307/2684788 |publisher=American Statistical Association | jstor=2684788 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan (1986) objected to the use of the word ''measurement'' in relation to the nominal type, but Stevens (1975) said of his own definition of measurement that "the assignment can be any consistent rule. The only rule not allowed would be random assignment, for randomness amounts in effect to a nonrule". However, so-called nominal measurement involves arbitrary assignment, and the "permissible transformation" is any number for any other. This is one of the points made in Lord's (1953) satirical paper ''On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1= Frederic M. |journal=American Psychologist |title = On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers |volume=8 |number=12 |date=December 1953  | pages=750–751 |doi=10.1037/h0063675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the mean as a measure of the central tendency for the ordinal type is still debatable among those who accept Stevens's typology. Many behavioural scientists use the mean for ordinal data, anyway. This is often justified on the basis that the ordinal type in behavioural science is in fact somewhere between the true ordinal and interval types; although the interval difference between two ordinal ranks is not constant, it is often of the same order of magnitude.

For example, applications of measurement models in educational contexts often indicate that total scores have a fairly linear relationship with measurements across the range of an assessment. Thus, some argue that so long as the unknown interval difference between ordinal scale ranks is not too variable, interval scale statistics such as means can meaningfully be used on ordinal scale variables. Statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] requires the user to select the appropriate measurement class for each variable. This ensures that subsequent user errors cannot inadvertently perform meaningless analyses (for example correlation analysis with a variable on a nominal level).

[[L. L. Thurstone]] made progress toward developing a justification for obtaining the interval type, based on the [[law of comparative judgment]]. A common application of the law is the [[analytic hierarchy process]]. Further progress was made by [[Georg Rasch]] (1960), who developed the probabilistic [[Rasch model]] that provides a theoretical basis and justification for obtaining interval-level measurements from counts of observations such as total scores on assessments.

===Other proposed typologies===
Typologies aside from Stevens's typology has been proposed. For instance, [[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] and [[John Tukey|Tukey]] (1977), Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J. A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mosteller and Tukey's typology (1977) ====
Mosteller and Tukey&lt;ref name="Mosteller"/&gt; noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed:
# Names
# Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
# Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
# Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
# Counts (non-negative integers)
# Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
# Balances (any real number)

For example, percentages (a variation on fractions in the Mosteller-Tukey framework) do not fit well into Stevens’s framework: No transformation is fully admissible.&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993" /&gt;

==== Chrisman's typology (1998) ====
Nicholas R. Chrisman &lt;ref name="Chrisman"/&gt; introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens's original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:
# Nominal
# Gradation of membership
# Ordinal
# Interval
# Log-interval
# Extensive ratio
# Cyclical ratio
# Derived ratio
# Counts
# Absolute

While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography,&lt;ref name = "Wolman 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement and meaningfulness in conservation science |journal=Conservation Biology |year=2006 |last=Wolman |first=Abel G |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster-Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens' original work.

=== Scale types and Stevens's "operational theory of measurement" ===
The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens's "operational theory of measurement", which was to become definitive within psychology and the [[behavioral sciences]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} despite Michell's characterization as its being quite at odds with measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences. This committee, which became known as the ''Ferguson committee'', published a Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;245) in which Stevens's [[sone]] scale (Stevens &amp; Davis, 1938) was an object of criticism:

{{quote | …any law purporting to express a quantitative relation between sensation intensity and stimulus intensity is not merely false but is in fact meaningless unless and until a meaning can be given to the concept of addition as applied to sensation.}}

That is, if Stevens's ''[[sone]]'' scale genuinely measured the intensity of auditory sensations, then evidence for such sensations as being quantitative attributes needed to be produced. The evidence needed was the presence of ''additive structure'' – a concept comprehensively treated by the German mathematician [[Otto Hölder]] (Hölder, 1901). Given that the physicist and measurement theorist [[Norman Robert Campbell]] dominated the Ferguson committee's deliberations, the committee concluded that measurement in the social sciences was impossible due to the lack of [[concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] operations. This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the [[theory of conjoint measurement]] by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964). However, Stevens's reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:

{{quote|Paraphrasing N. R. Campbell (Final Report, p.340), we may say that measurement, in the broadest sense, is defined as the assignment of numerals to objects and events according to rules (Stevens, 1946, p.677).}}

Stevens was greatly influenced by the ideas of another Harvard academic, the [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist [[Percy Bridgman]] (1927), whose doctrine of ''operationism'' Stevens used to define measurement. In Stevens's definition, for example, it is the use of a tape measure that defines length (the object of measurement) as being measurable (and so by implication quantitative). Critics of operationism object that it confuses the relations between two objects or events for properties of one of those of objects or events (Hardcastle, 1995; Michell, 1999; Moyer, 1981a,b; Rogers, 1989).

The Canadian measurement theorist [[William Rozeboom]] (1966) was an early and trenchant critic of Stevens's theory of scale types.

==== Same variable may be different scale type depending on context ====
Another issue is that the same variable may be a different scale type depending on how it is measured and on the goals of the analysis. For example, hair color is usually thought of as a nominal variable, since it has no apparent ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/nominal_ordinal_interval.htm|title=What is the difference between categorical, ordinal and interval variables?|work=Institute for Digital Research and Education|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to order colors (including hair colors) in various ways, including by hue; this is known as [[colorimetry]]. Hue is an interval level variable.

'''Logic optimization''', a part of [[logic synthesis]] in [[electronics]], is the process of finding an equivalent representation of the specified [[logic circuit]] under one or more specified constraints. Generally the circuit is constrained to minimum chip area meeting a prespecified delay.

==Introduction==
With the advent of [[logic synthesis]], one of the biggest challenges faced by the [[electronic design automation]] (EDA) industry was to find the best [[netlist]] representation of the given design description. While [[two-level logic optimization]] had long existed in the form of the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]], later followed by the [[Espresso heuristic logic minimizer]], the rapidly improving chip densities, and the wide adoption of [[Hardware description language|HDLs]] for circuit description, formalized the logic optimization domain as it exists today.

Today, logic optimization is divided into various categories:

'''Based on circuit representation''' 
* Two-level logic optimization
* Multi-level logic optimization

'''Based on circuit characteristics'''
* Sequential logic optimization
* Combinational logic optimization

'''Based on type of execution'''
*Graphical optimization methods

While a [[two-level circuit representation]] of circuits strictly refers to the flattened view of the circuit in terms of SOPs ([[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|sum-of-products]]) &amp;mdash; which is more applicable to a [[Programmable logic array|PLA]] implementation of the design{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} &amp;mdash; a [[multi-level representation]] is a more generic view of the circuit in terms of arbitrarily connected SOPs, POSs ([[Canonical form (Boolean algebra)|product-of-sums]]), factored form etc. Logic optimization algorithms generally work either on the structural (SOPs, factored form) or functional ([[Binary decision diagram|BDDs]], ADDs) representation of the circuit.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}

==Two-level versus multi-level representations==
If we have two functions ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;F_1 = AB + AC + AD,\,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;F_2 = A'B + A'C + A'E.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The above 2-level representation takes six product terms and 24 transistors in CMOS Rep.{{Why|date=February 2010}}

A functionally equivalent representation in multilevel can be:

: ''P'' = ''B'' + ''C''.

: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''AP'' + ''AD''.

: ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;P'' + ''A&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;E''.

While the number of levels here is 3, the total number of product terms and literals reduce {{Quantify|date=February 2010}} because of the sharing of the term B + C.

Similarly, we distinguish between [[Sequential logic|sequential]] and [[Combinational logic|combinational circuits]], whose behavior can be described in terms of [[finite-state machine]] state tables/diagrams or by Boolean functions and relations respectively.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}}

==Circuit minimization in Boolean algebra==
In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], '''circuit minimization''' is the problem of obtaining the smallest [[logic circuit]] (Boolean formula) that represents a given [[Boolean function]] or [[truth table]].  For the case when the boolean function is specified by a circuit (that is, we want to find an equivalent circuit of minimum size possible), the unbounded circuit minimization problem was long-conjectured to be [[polynomial hierarchy|&lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2^P&lt;/math&gt;-complete]], a result finally proved in 2008,&lt;ref name="Buchfuhrer_2011"/&gt; but there are effective heuristics such as [[Karnaugh map]]s and the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]] that facilitate the process.

===Purpose===
The problem with having a complicated [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] (i.e. one with many elements, such as [[logic gate]]s) is that each element takes up physical space in its implementation and costs time and money to produce in itself. Circuit minimization may be one form of logic optimization used to reduce the area of complex logic in [[integrated circuit]]s.

===Example===
While there are many ways to minimize a circuit, this is an example that minimizes (or simplifies) a boolean function. Note that the boolean function carried out by the circuit is directly related to the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented.&lt;ref name="Mano_2014"/&gt;
Consider the circuit used to represent &lt;math&gt;(A \wedge \bar{B}) \vee (\bar{A} \wedge B)&lt;/math&gt;. It is evident that two negations, two conjunctions, and a disjunction are used in this statement. This means that to build the circuit one would need two [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverters]], two [[AND gate]]s, and an [[OR gate]].

We can simplify (minimize) the circuit by applying logical identities or using intuition. Since the example states that A is true when B is false or the other way around, we can conclude that this simply means &lt;math&gt;A \neq B&lt;/math&gt;. In terms of logical gates, [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] simply means an [[XOR gate]] (exclusive or). Therefore, &lt;math&gt;(A \wedge \bar{B}) \vee (\bar{A} \wedge B) \iff A \neq B&lt;/math&gt;. Then the two circuits shown below are equivalent:

You can additionally check the correctness of the result using a [[truth table]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7461">The '''MIRIAM Registry''', a by-product of the [[MIRIAM]] Guidelines, is a database of namespaces and associated information that is used in the creation of [[URI|uniform resource identifiers]]. It contains the set of community-approved namespaces for databases and resources serving, primarily, the biological sciences domain. These shared namespaces, when combined with 'data collection' identifiers, can be used to create globally unique identifiers for knowledge held in data repositories. For more information on the use of URIs to annotate models, see the specification of [http://sbml.org/wiki/ SBML Level 2 Version 2] (and above).

A 'data collection' is defined as a set of data which is generated by a provider. A 'resource' is defined as a distributor of that data. Such a description allows numerous resources to be associated with a single collection, allowing accurate representation of how biological information is available on the World Wide Web; often the same information, from a single data collection, may be mirrored by different resources, or the core information may be supplemented with other data.

[[Image:Registry Gene Ontology entry.png|thumb|Example of an entry stored in the MIRIAM Registry]]

* data collection identifier: MIR:00000022
* data collection synonyms: GO
* data collection identifier pattern: ^GO:\d{7}$

The MIRIAM Registry is a curated resource, which is freely available and open to all. Submissions for new collections can be made through the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/main/mdb?section=submit |title=New Collection Submission page |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identifiers using the MIRIAM system ==

The MIRIAM Guidelines require the use of uniform resource identifiers in the annotation of model components. These are created using the shared list of namespaces defined in the MIRIAM Registry.

===MIRIAM URIs===

Using the namespaces defined in the MIRIAM Registry, it is possible to create identifiers in both a URN and a URL forms. This requires a unique collection-specific identifier, as well as a namespace to globally constrain the information space. Both the namespace and the root of each URI form are given for each data collection in the Registry. It should be noted that both forms are derived from the same namespace. For example:

* urn form: &lt;code&gt;urn:miriam:pubmed:16333295&lt;/code&gt;
* url form: &lt;code&gt;http://identifiers.org/pubmed/16333295&lt;/code&gt;

In this example, the collection-specific identifier is 16333295, and the namespace is pubmed.

The URN form of identifiers requires the use of Web Services or programmatic means to access the referenced record. This means that one cannot simply put the URN form into a browser window and arrive at the referenced information. The URL form is directly resolvable, and relies on a resolving layer provided by [[Identifiers.org]].

===Supporting features and availability===

To enable efficient use of the MIRIAM Registry and the rapid adoption of the annotation scheme, a number of supporting features are provided.&lt;ref name="pmid18078503"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1752-0509-1-58 |title=MIRIAM Resources: Tools to generate and resolve robust cross-references in Systems Biology |year=2007 |last1=Laibe |first1=Camille |last2=Le Novère |first2=Nicolas |journal=BMC Systems Biology |volume=1 |page=58 |pmid=18078503 |pmc=2259379}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include [[Web Services]], a website interface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam/ |title=MIRIAM Resources Website |publisher=Ebi.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to access the Registry itself, and a Java library&lt;ref name="pmid19939940"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bib/bbp056 |title=BioModels.net Web Services, a free and integrated toolkit for computational modelling software |year=2009 |last1=Li |first1=C. |last2=Courtot |first2=M. |last3=Le Novere |first3=N. |last4=Laibe |first4=C. |journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=270–7 |pmid=19939940 |pmc=2913671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">Maritime Studies is an interdisciplinary academic field that embraces the liberal arts as the foundation for exploring humankind's critical and continually evolving connections with the world's waterways and watersheds.  Maritime Studies encompasses the liberal arts in recognized humanities and social science disciplines such as History, English, Geography, Economics, Political Science and Anthropology.  Maritime Studies highlights the social and cultural side of the human/water relationship, but recognizes and explores the links between human activities and the composition and the condition of the coastal and marine environments.  Incorporating history, literature, poetry, and film, maritime studies is able to cover a broader scope than traditional [[maritime history]] or [[seamanship]].  

Some of the institutions providing maritime studies combine a broad grounding in technical and scientific coursework with the study of courses in arts and humanities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.com/new-york/suny-maritime-new-york SUNY Maritime Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Maritime Academy|maritime academies]] frequently prepare cadets for careers in the [[merchant marine]], maritime studies programs prepare students for a variety of careers in the civilian maritime industrial and service sectors.  Graduate and undergraduate programs are offered at the following institutions:

* [[The University of Connecticut#Avery Point Campus|The University of Connecticut /Avery Point Campus]]
* [[East Carolina University]]
* [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]
* [[Texas A&amp;M University at Galveston|Texas A &amp; M Galveston]]
* [[University of West Florida]]

The '''Max-Reger-Institute''' (MRI) is a musicological [[research institute]] and archive in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany, dedicated to the work of the composer [[Max Reger]], a representative of German music around the turn of the 20th century. An associated foundation, the Elsa-Reger-Stiftung, is named after his wife, [[Elsa Reger]], who founded the foundation and the institute. It has a substantial archive of manuscripts and documents related to Reger.

== History ==
Reger's widow and biographer, Elsa Reger, installed in 1947 a foundation, run by the Max-Reger-Institut in [[Bonn]]. A main objective was to collect the autographs which had been dispersed during two world wars, and to establish an archive as a base for research.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt; The institute moved to Karlsruhe in 1996, first to the building of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museum für Literatur am Oberrhein|de}}. The state [[Baden-Württemberg]] and the town [[Karlsruhe]] have funded the institute since. In 1998 it moved to the [[Karlsburg Castle|Karlsburg]] in [[Durlach]]. It collaborates with the Musikhochschule and with the [[Baden State Library]].&lt;ref name="AsKI" /&gt;

== Archive ==
The archive holds [[autograph]]s of sketches, scores and corrections from all periods and genres of Reger's composions, also many of his handwritten letters and postcards to friends, publishers, performers and notable contemporaries. It also keeps the correspondence of his widow, and documents, photos, paintings, caricatures, concert programs and other memorabilia. From 2003, the BrüderBuschArchiv, an archive of the brothers [[Fritz Busch]] and [[Adolf Busch]] with many documents related to their work is part of the MRI.&lt;ref name="Foundation" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Busch" /&gt; The library holds prints of first editions as well as later ones, international literature about Reger and related topics, sound documents, and copies of manuscripts that are not part of the MRI's archive.&lt;ref name="AsKI" /&gt;

== Publications ==
The MRI is the centre of research of the composer, publishing research in its own ''Schriftenreihe'' ([[monographic series]]), including [[dissertation]]s written with scientific guidance by the MRI. A new edition of Reger's works, the Reger-Werk-Ausgabe, was begun in 2008. The new Reger-Werk-Verzeichnis appeared in 2011, funded in part by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]].&lt;ref name="AsKI" /&gt;

== Other activities ==
A focus of the MRI has been to provide access to the material related to Reger, to researchers, musicians and music lovers. The institute organizes regularly exhibitions, conventions, lecture concerts, and concert series in collaboration with international music schools and universities. In 2005 the MRI established a biennial European chamber music competition, the {{Interlanguage link multi|Europäischer Kammermusikwettbewerb Karlsruhe|de}}, together with [[Karlsruhe]] and the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe.&lt;ref name=AsKI /&gt;

'''Mishra Yantra''' is one of the four distinct [[Astronomy|astronomical]] [[Scientific instrument|instrument]]s of the [[Jantar Mantar (Delhi)|Jantar Mantar]] [[observatory]] located in [[New Delhi, India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharma |first=Virendra Nath |year=1994 |title=Míshra Yantra of the Delhi observatory |journal=Indian Journal of History of Science |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=477–487 |issn=0019-5235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each instrument at the Jantar Mantar are separate brilliant architectures constructed based on mathematical observations, and help in calculating different aspects of celestial objects and time. It is widely believed that the Jantar Mantar was constructed in the year 1724. The four instruments of Jantar Mantar are '''Samrat Yantra''' (a large [[sundial]] for calculating time), '''Jay Prakash Yantra''' (2 [[Lens (optics)#Types of simple lenses|concave]] [[hemispherical]] structures, used to ascertain the position of Sun and other heavenly bodies), '''Ram Yantra''' (two large [[cylindrical]] structures with open top, used to measure the altitude of stars based on the [[latitude]] and the [[longitude]] on the earth) and the '''Mishra Yantra''' (meaning ''mixed instrument'', since it is a compilation of five different instruments).

== Historical and cultural importance of the Misra Yantra ==
[[File:Plaque at Jantar Mantar, Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque at Jantar Mantar, Delhi (Zoom in to read)]]
The Mishra or composite Yantra is composed of five different instruments. This Yantra is unique to the Delhi observatory. It is believed to have been constructed by Maharaja Madho Singh (1751–68), the son of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II. The five component yantras are the '''Dakshinottara Bhitti''', '''Samrat''' (a smaller version of the large sundial, attached to Misra Yantra, in two halves), '''Niyat Chakra''', '''Karka Rasivalaya''', and the '''Western Quadrant'''.

The Dakshinottara Bhitti was also built in the [[Jaipur]], [[Ujjain]], [[Varanasi]] and [[Mathura]] observatories. It is a modified version of the Portable Meridian Dial present in [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Arab (etymology)|Arabic]], [[Hindu]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europe]]an systems of astronomy. The Dakshinottara Bhitti of the Mishra Yantra is in the form of a graduated semicircle located on the eastern wall.

== In orchids ==
A distinction between monandrous and other flowers is particularly relevant in the classification of [[orchid]]s.

== In animals ==
In animals, a monandrous system occurs when females have one mate at a time. For example, a female [[Speckled Wood (butterfly)|speckled wood]] butterfly will typically only mate once within her short lifetime.&lt;ref name="Lauwers 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauwers|first=K.|author2=Van Dyck, H.|title=The Cost of Mating with a Non-Virgin Male in a Monandrous Butterfly: Experimental Evidence from the Speckled Wood, Pararge aegeria|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2006|volume=60|issue=1|pages=69–76|doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0142-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also common in certain bee species, like ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'' and ''[[Bombus pratorum]]'', where a female will only mate with one male during her nuptial flight and use the sperm reserves for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baer, B. and P.

'''Narrative medicine''' is a [[medicine|medical]] approach that utilizes people's [[narrative]]s in [[clinical practice]], research, and education as a way to promote healing. It aims to address the relational and psychological dimensions that occur in tandem with physical illness, with the attempt to treat patients as humans with individual stories, rather than purely based on symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.law.nyu.edu/experientiallearninglab/methods/narrativemedicine/
| title = Narrative Medicine {{!}} NYU School of Law
| website = www.law.nyu.edu
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, narrative medicine aims not only to validate the experience of the patient, but also to encourage creativity and self-reflection in the physician.
==History==

In 1910, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created Flexner's report, which set out to redefine medical educational practices. In this report, it argued that the proper goal of medicine is "to attempt to fight the battle against disease."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flexner|first=|date=1910|title=Medical Education in the United States and Canada|url=|journal=Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the late 20th century, critics alleged that [[Western medicine]] had fallen victim to the professionalism movement. They argued that many [[medical schools]] and residency programs train physicians to treat medical problems purely on their symptoms without taking into account the specific psychological and personal history of the patient. The emergence of narrative medicine came as a contemporary effort to rehumanize medicine.

One prominent medical school that first began a program on narrative medicine was [[Columbia University Medical Center]] with their opening of the first Program in Narrative Medicine. Built within their College of Physicians and Surgeons, they believe that narrative medicine can make profound changes to the way medical treatment is administered:

“Narrative Medicine fortifies clinical practice with the narrative competence to recognize, absorb, metabolize, interpret, and be moved by the stories of illness. Through narrative training, the Program in Narrative Medicine helps physicians, nurses, social workers, mental health professionals, chaplains, social workers, academics, and all those interested in the intersection between narrative and medicine improve the effectiveness of care by developing these skills with patients and colleagues. Our research and outreach missions are conceptualizing, evaluating, and spear-heading these ideas and practices nationally and internationally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Columbia University Medical Center {{!}} Program in Narrative Medicine

[[Rita Charon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the executive director of this program and has published and lectured on the benefits of doctors receiving narrative training as a way to increase empathy and reflection in the medical professional field.

As of the late 1990s, physicians like [[Rachel Naomi Remen]] and [[Rita Charon]] have argued that medical practice should be structured around the narratives of patients. Charon stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Sick people need physicians who can understand their diseases, treat their medical problems, and accompany them through their illnesses."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Educational Programs==
The number of schools in the United States that offer advanced classes in narrative medicine has been growing.
* The [[Columbia University Medical Center]] has been the leading pioneer of developing educational programs for the field of narrative medicine. In addition to lectures and seminars given throughout the year, Columbia University created the Master of Science in Narrative Medicine program for graduate students in 2009, making it one of the first graduate programs devoted strictly to narrative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/03/education/edlife/03narrative.html "Learning to Listen"] New York Times (2009-12-29)&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Montefiore Medical Center]] is the academic medical center and University Hospital for [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]]. This medical center created a program in Narrative Medicine as a subset of the Department of Family and Social Medicine. Residents at this school attend programs where they learn how to use personal narrative to enhance empathy, as well as topics including stress, loss, and balance.
* The [[Ohio State University]] Humanities Institute is also supporting the multidisciplinary initiative of narrative medicine. This program runs concurrently with their other undergraduate and graduate programs, where students "strive to develop narrative competence that enables them to deliver care that is not only more empathetic and compassionate, but also more effective." 
* The [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]] College of Medicine has created an Integrative Medicine Program within the Department of Family Medicine. This program "strives to change the focus of healthcare and medical education for our residents, medical students and faculty to include a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach that emphasizes wellness, prevention, and self-care skills, and the adoption of the principles for creating optimal healing environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Integrative Medicine Program {{!}} Department of Family Medicine {{!}} University of California, Irvine
| website = www.familymed.uci.edu
| access-date = 2016-03-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2011, Western University created the Narrative Medicine Initiative (NMI) and has incorporated narrative medicine into the undergraduate, postgraduate, and continuing medical education departments. They work to answer questions such as "How does the art of storytelling improve health care education and the experience of patient care?"
* Lenoir-Rhyne University has established the Thomas Wolfe Center for Narrative, with the slogan "Heeding the call for narrative in a fragmented world." This program offers graduate-level and certification courses in several narrative training disciplines, one of which is narrative medicine.
* Saybrook University takes a broad approach to narrative medicine through their mind-body medicine program. This seeks to approve the mind-body approach to health and wellness as a way to improve quality of life for patients.

This growing field of narrative medicine extends beyond the United States: The British Medical Journal have begun adding their own writing seminars to promote this type of narrative in its emerging physicians.

==Obstacles==
Rachel Remen asserts,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
People who are physicians have been trained to believe that it is a scientific objectivity that makes them most effective in their efforts to understand and resolve the pain that others bring them, and a mental distance that protects them from becoming wounded from this difficult work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| publisher = Riverhead Books
| isbn = 9781594482090
| last = Remen
| first = Rachel Naomi
| title = Kitchen Table Wisdom: Stories That Heal
| date = 2006-08-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Objectivity, empathy, and global thinking are stated to not be incompatible with a degree of dissociation from the patient's suffering that is sufficient to protect oneself.

'''Papilionaceous flowers''' (from [[Latin]]: ''papilion'', a butterfly) are flowers with the characteristic [[zygomorphic|irregular]] and butterfly-like corolla found in many, though not all, plants of the species-rich [[Faboideae]] subfamily of [[Fabaceae|legumes]]. [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|Tournefort]] suggested that the term ''Flores papilionacei'' originated with [[Valerius Cordus]],&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; who applied it to the flowers of the [[Phaseolus vulgaris|bean]].&lt;ref name=cordus&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordus|first1=Valerius |title=Historia Stirpium et Sylva |chapter=162 |date=1561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
===Corolla===
The flowers have a [[Floral symmetry|bilateral symmetry]] with the [[corolla (botany)|corolla]] consisting of five [[petal]]s. A single, large, upper petal is known as the banner (also vexillum or standard petal). The semi-cylindrical base of the banner embraces and compresses two equal and smaller lateral wings (or alae). The wings in turn enclose a pair of small [[keel]] [[petal]]s, that are situated somewhat lower than the wings, but are interior to them.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; They have concave sides and correspond with the shape of the wings. The two keel petals are fused at their bases&lt;ref name=reddy/&gt; or stuck together&lt;ref name=nswfs&gt;{{cite web |title=Botanical term: papilionaceous |url=http://www.nswildflora.ca/glossary/papilionaceous.html |website=nswildflora.ca |publisher=Nova Scotia Wild Flora Society |date=2007 | accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form a boat-shaped structure that encloses the essential flower organs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gupta |first1=P.K. |title=Genetics: classical to modern |date=2007 |publisher=Rastogi Publications |location=Meerut, India |isbn=8171338968 |pages=146–147 |edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely the [[androecium]] and [[gynoecium]]. Typically these flowers have a vexillary (i.e. descendingly imbricate or overlapping) [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivation]].&lt;ref name=reddy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reddy |first1=S. M. |title=University Botany III: (Plant Taxonomy, Plant Embryology, Plant Physiology) |volume = 3 |date=2007 |publisher=New Age International |isbn=9788122415476 |pages=60–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stamens===
The stamens often have a diadelphous morphology, meaning that they are united in two sets with a distinct filament shape in each set.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; The inferior set forms a membranous sheath at its base, that envelops the single, superior [[pistil]] in a tube. The tube divides into nine filaments, which trace the base of the keel petals that enclose them.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; The single free filament lies above them. In ''[[Smithia]]'' the two sets are equal, with 5 stamens in each.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

Many papilionaceous flowers however have ten distinct stamens. Genera that conform to the latter morphology include ''[[Sophora]]'', ''[[Anagyris]]'', ''[[Cercis]]'', ''[[Daviesia]]'', ''[[Dillwynia]]'', ''[[Gompholobium]]'', ''[[Mirbelia]]'' and ''[[Pultenaea]]''.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

==Biology==
[[Charles Darwin]] observed that the fertility of plants with papilionaceous flowers depend to an important extent on visits by bees,&lt;ref name=darw&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or, The preservation of favored races in the struggle for life | chapter = IV: On the advantage |date=2007 |publisher=Cosimo Classics |location=New York |isbn=1602061440 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is accepted that this corolla structure evolved under selective pressure of bee pollinators.&lt;ref name=swj&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aronne |first1=Giovanna |last2=Giovanetti |first2=Manuela |last3=De Micco |first3=Veronica |title=Morphofunctional Traits and Pollination Mechanisms of Coronilla emerus L. Flowers (Fabaceae) |journal=The Scientific World Journal |date=2012 |volume=2012 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1100/2012/381575}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] remarked that they produce hardly any scent, but the flowers of [[Spartium junceum|Spanish broom]], [[Lathyrus odoratus|sweet pea]], [[Coronilla valentina|scorpion vetch]], [[Lupinus luteus|European yellow lupine]], [[Vicia faba|fava bean]] and various species of [[Trifolium|clover]] are notable exceptions.&lt;ref name=Rees&gt;{{cite book | last1=Rees | first1=Abraham | title=The Cyclopædia: Or, Universal Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and Literature | date=1819 | publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown [etc.] | page=PAP |volume= 26 |accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four different mechanisms of pollen release are known in papilionaceous flowers, which are respectively known as the explosive, valvular, piston and brush mechanisms.&lt;ref name=swj/&gt; In the explosive or tripping mechanism (''cf.'' [[Medicago sativa|alfalfa]], [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]], [[Mucuna|ox-eye bean]]&lt;ref name=mos&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mosquin |first1=Ted |title=The explosive pollination mechanism in Cornus canadensis L. |url=http://www.ou.edu/cas/botany-micro/ben/ben194.html |website=Botanical Electronic News |publisher=The Canadian Field-Naturalist, Volume 99, Number I, Jan.-Mar. 1985 |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) all pollen is instantly released when pressure on the staminal column is permanently released (usually by an insect) causing it to snap against the standard petal. In the valvular mechanism pollen is released repeatedly when pollinators unseal the upper rim of the keel petals, and force them downwards. In the piston mechanism (''cf.'' [[Hippocrepis emerus|scorpion senna]]&lt;ref name=swj/&gt;) pollen is released repeatedly when the keel tip is moved by an insect so as to release pollen through a hole in the tip. The brush mechanism employs a pistil which is longer than the stamens, so as to avoid self-pollination. When a pollinator presses against the standard and wing petals, a brush on the temporarily lifted pistil brushes pollen onto the pollinator, while the stigma receives external pollen.&lt;ref name=swj/&gt;

==Examples and exceptions==
Well-known plant genera in the Faboideae which exhibit this corolla morphology include  [[Phaseolus|beans]], [[Pisum|peas]], [[Lathyrus|sweet peas]], [[alfalfa]] (lucerne), [[Trifolium|clovers]], [[Lupinus|lupines]], [[Dalea|smoke trees]], [[Robinia|black locust]]s, [[Astragalus|locoweed]]s and [[Erythrina|coral trees]].&lt;ref name=ww1&gt;{{cite web |last1=Armstrong |first1=W.

The [[Amorpha|false indigo]] genus, though belonging to the Faboideae, does not exhibit a papilionaceous corolla morphology, as it has only one petal per flower,&lt;ref name=aquatic&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wooten |first1=Robert K. Godfrey; Jean, W.|title=Aquatic and wetland plants of southeastern United States: Dicotyledons |date=1981 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |location=Athens, Ga. |isbn=0820342432|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; namely the banner.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref name=reddy/&gt; The corolla of [[Trifolium|clover]]s tends to be monopetalous, as all five petals are often fused below to form a tube.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Other legume subfamilies==
To the contrary, plants in the [[Mimosoideae]] subfamily of legumes have the petals reduced, and have numerous stamens arranged in showy spikes. In the [[Caesalpinioideae]] subfamily of legumes the upper petal is initially enveloped by the lateral petals, before the petals unfold to assume a radial five-fold symmetry.&lt;ref name=ww1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

==Philosophical issues==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, London|isbn=0393045358|page=524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;lpg=PA534|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that in the years since has served as a challenge to the musicologists and psychologists who believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/survival_of_the_harmonious/?page=1|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Survival of the harmonious|accessdate=2008-03-15|last= Bennett |first=Drake|  date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to note this stir was [[Philip Ball]] in his book ''The Music Instinct'' &lt;ref name="The Music Instinct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=The Music Instinct|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199896429|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Music-Instinct-Works-Without/dp/0199896429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he noted that music seems to reach to the very core of what it means to be human:  "There are cultures in the world where to say 'I'm not musical' would be meaningless," Ball writes, "akin to saying 'I'm not alive'." In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics of music===
{{main article|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

The '''precedence effect''' or '''law of the first wavefront''' is a [[Sound localization|binaural]] [[psychoacoustics|psychoacoustical]] effect. When a sound is followed by another sound separated by a sufficiently short time delay (below the listener's echo threshold), listeners perceive a single auditory event; its [[perception|perceived]] spatial location is dominated by the location of the first-arriving sound (the first [[wave front]]). The lagging sound also affects the perceived location. However, its effect is suppressed by the first-arriving sound.

The '''Haas effect''' is a [[psychoacoustical]] effect, described in 1949&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/par/h/#Haas_Effect (After Helmut Haas's doctorate dissertation presented to the University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany as "Über den Einfluss eines Einfachechos auf die Hörsamkeit von Sprache;" translated into English by Dr. Ing. K.P.R. Ehrenberg, Building Research Station, Watford, Herts., England Library Communication no. 363, December, 1949; reproduced in the United States as "The Influence of a Single Echo on the Audibility of Speech," J. Audio Eng. Soc., Vol. 20 (Mar. 1972), pp. 145-159.)]&lt;/ref&gt; by Helmut Haas in his Ph.D. thesis. It is often equated with the underlying precedence effect.

== History ==

The "law of the first wavefront" was described and named in 1948 by [[Lothar Cremer]].&lt;ref&gt;
Cremer, L. (1948): "Die wissenschaftlichen Grundlagen der Raumakustik", Bd. 1. Hirzel-Verlag Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "precedence effect" was described and named in 1949 by [[Hans Wallach|Wallach et al.]]&lt;ref&gt;Wallach, H., Newman, E. B., &amp; Rosenzweig, M. R. (1949). "The precedence effect in sound localization,"  The American Journal of Psychology, 62, 315–336.&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that when two identical sounds are presented in close succession they will be heard as a single fused sound. In their experiments, fusion occurred when the lag between the two sounds was in the range 1 to 5 ms for clicks, and up to 40 ms for more complex sounds such as speech or piano music.  When the lag was longer, the second sound was heard as an echo.

Additionally, Wallach et al. demonstrated that when successive sounds coming from sources at different locations were heard as fused, the apparent location of the perceived sound was dominated by the location of the sound that reached the ears first (i.e. the first-arriving wavefront).  The second-arriving sound had only a very small (albeit measurable) effect on the perceived location of the fused sound. They designated this phenomenon as the ''precedence effect'', and noted that it explains why sound localization is possible in the typical situation where sounds reverberate from walls, furniture and the like, thus providing multiple, successive stimuli.  They also noted that the precedence effect is an important factor in the perception of stereophonic sound.

Wallach et al. did not systematically vary the intensities of the two sounds, although they cited research by Langmuir et al.&lt;ref&gt;Langmuir, I., Schaefer, V. J., Ferguson, C. V., &amp; Hennelly, E. F. (1944). "A study of binaural perception of the direction of a sound source,"  OSRD Report 4079, PB number 31014, Office of Technical Services, U. S. Department of Commerce.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggested that if the second-arriving sound is at least 15 dB louder than the first, the precedence effect breaks down.

The "Haas effect" derives from a 1951 paper by Helmut Haas.&lt;ref&gt;Haas, H. (1951). "Uber den Einfluss eines Einfachechos auf die Horsamkeit von Sprache," Acustica, 1, 49–58.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1951 Haas examined how the perception of speech is affected in the presence of a single, coherent [[Sound reflection#Sound reflection|sound reflection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of musical acoustics |author=Arthur H. Benade |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1990 |page=204 |isbn=978-0-486-26484-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; To create [[Anechoic chamber|anechoic]] conditions, the experiment was carried out on the rooftop of a freestanding building. Another test was carried out in a room with a [[reverberation time]] of 1.6 ms. The test signal (recorded speech) was emitted from two similar loudspeakers at locations 45° to the left and to the right  in 3 m distance to the listener.

Haas found that humans  [[Sound localization|localize]] sound sources in the direction of the first arriving sound despite the presence of a single reflection from a different direction. A single [[auditory event]] is perceived. A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the direct sound increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving within 5 to 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the direct sound without being perceived as a secondary auditory event ([[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the direct sound is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection's direction has no significant effect on the results. A reflection with attenuated higher frequencies expands the time span that [[echo suppression]] is active.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}  Increased room reverberation time also expands the time span of echo suppression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2093 Haas, H. "The Influence of a Single Echo on the Audibility of Speech", JAES Volume 20 Issue 2 pp. 146-159; March 1972]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The precedence effect appears if the subsequent wave fronts arrive between 2 ms and about 50 ms later than the first wave front. This range is signal dependent. For speech the precedence effect disappears for delays above 50 ms, but for music the precedence effect can also appear for delays of some 100 ms.&lt;ref&gt;
Blauert, J.: Spatial hearing - the psychophysics of human sound localization; MIT Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts (1983), chapter 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In two-click lead–lag experiments, localization effects include aspects of ''summing localization'', ''localization dominance'', and ''lag discrimination suppression''.  The last two are generally considered to be aspects of the precedence effect:&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Summing localization: for time delays below 2 ms, listeners only perceive one sound; its direction is between the locations of the lead and lag sounds. An application for summing localization is the [[intensity stereo]]phony, where two loudspeakers emit the same signal with different [[Sound pressure#Sound pressure level|levels]], resulting in the localized sound direction between both loudspeakers. The localized direction depends on the level difference between the loudspeakers.
* Localization dominance: for delays between 2 and 5 ms, listeners also perceive one sound; its location is determined by the location of the leading sound.
* Lag discrimination suppression: for short time delays, listeners are less capable of discriminating the location of the lagging sound.

For time delays above 50 ms (for speech) or some 100 ms (for music) the delayed sound is perceived as an echo of the first-arriving sound. Both sound directions are localized correctly. The time delay for perceiving echoes depends on the signal characteristics. For signals with impulse characteristics, echoes are perceived for delays above 50 ms. For signals with a nearly constant amplitude, the echo threshold can be enhanced up to time differences of 1 to 2 seconds.

A special appearance of the precedence effect is the Haas effect. Haas showed that the precedence effect appears even if the level of the delayed sound is up to 10 dB higher than the level of the first wave front. In this case, the range of delays, where the precedence effect works, is reduced to delays between 10 and 30 ms.

== Applications ==
The precedence effect is important for the hearing in enclosed rooms. With the help of this effect, it remains possible to determine the direction of a sound source (e.g. the direction of a speaker) even in the presence of wall [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]].

===Sound reinforcement systems===
Haas' findings can be applied to [[sound reinforcement system]]s and [[public address]] systems. The signal for loudspeakers placed at distant locations from a stage may be [[Delay (audio effect)#Straight delay|delayed electronically]] by an amount equal to [[speed of sound|the time sound takes to travel through the air]] from the stage to the distant location, plus about 10 to 20 milliseconds and played at a level up to 10&amp;nbsp;dB louder than sound emanating from the stage. The first arrival of sound from the source on stage determines perceived localization whereas the slightly later sound from delayed loudspeakers simply increases the perceived sound level without negatively affecting localization. In this configuration, the listener will localize all sound from the direction of the direct sound, but he will benefit from the higher sound level, which has been enhanced by the loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/Portals/0/data/en/NTi-Audio-QuickGuide-FOH.pdf|title=How To Setup for a Live Sound Event|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ambience extraction===
The precedence effect can be employed to increase the perception of ambience during the playback of stereo recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=1481 |title=Extraction of Ambiance Information from Ordinary Recordings |last=Madsen |first=E. Roerbaek |journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society |date=October 1970 |pages=490–496 |volume=18 |number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; If two speakers are placed to the left and right of the listener (in addition to the main speakers), and fed with the program material delayed by 10 to 20 milliseconds, the random-phase ambience components of the sound will become sufficiently decorrelated that they cannot be localized. This effectively extracts the recording's existing ambience, while leaving its foreground "direct" sounds still appearing to come from the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.stereophile.com/content/extraction-ivsi-generation |title=Extraction vs Generation |journal=Stereophile |last=Katz |first=Bob |date=March 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mastering Audio: The Art and the Science |last=Katz |first=Bob |year=2007 |pages=229–237 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0240808376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multichannel audio decoding ===
The effect was taken into account and exploited in the psychoacoustics of the Fosgate Tate 101A SQ decoder, developed by [[Jim Fosgate]] in consultation with [[Peter Scheiber]] and [[Martin Willcocks]], to produce much better spatiality and directionality in matrix decoding of 4-2-4 &lt;small&gt;([[Quadraphonic sound#SQ / Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ quadraphonic]])&lt;/small&gt; audio.

=== Haas kicker ===
Many older LEDE ("live end, dead end") [[Recording studio|control room]] designs featured so-called "Haas kickers" – reflective panels placed at the rear to create specular reflections which were thought to provide a wider stereo listening area or raise intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Patronis "Sound System Engineering", Focal Press; 3 edition (September 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, what is beneficial for one type of sound is detrimental to others, so Haas kickers, like [[compression ceiling]]s, are no longer commonly found in control rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Newell "Recording Studio Design", Focal Press; 2 edition (December 22, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radon mitigation''' is any process used to reduce [[radon]] gas concentrations in the breathing zones of occupied buildings, or radon from water supplies. Radon is a [[radium and radon in the environment|significant contributor]] to [[environmental radioactivity]].

Mitigation of radon in the air is accomplished through ventilation, either collected below a concrete floor slab or a membrane on the ground, or by increasing the [[air changes per hour]] in the building. Treatment systems using aeration or activated charcoal are available to remove radon from domestic water supplies.

==Testing==
[[File:Radon test kit.jpg|thumb|A typical radon test kit]]
[[File:Radon-indoor-one-week.svg|thumb|Fluctuation of ambient air radon concentration over one week, measured in a laboratory]]
The first step in mitigation is testing to see if the indoor-air and/or domestic water radon concentrations should be reduced. No level of radiation is considered completely safe but it cannot be totally eliminated so governments around the world have set various ''action levels'' to provide guidance on when radon concentrations should be reduced while recognizing that radon cannot be eliminated. The World Health Organization's [[International Radon Project]] has recommended an action level of 2.7 pCi/l for radon in the air. Radon in the air is considered to be a larger health threat than radon in domestic water so the US Environmental Protection Agency recommendation is to not test for radon in water unless a radon in air test is above the action level. However, some US states, such as Maine where radon levels are higher than the national average, recommend all well water should be tested for radon. The US government has not set an action level for radon in water.

Air-radon levels fluctuate naturally on a daily and seasonal basis. A short term test (90 days or less) might not be an accurate assessment of a home's average radon level, but are recommended for initial testing to quickly determine unhealthy conditions. Transient weather such as wind and changes in barometric pressure can affect short-term concentrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radon.com/radon/mitigation.html |title=You've found radon in your home—what should you do? |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=Air Chek, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224030656/http://www.radon.com/radon/mitigation.html |archivedate=2007-12-24 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ventilation such as open windows and the operation of exhaust fans.

Testing for radon in the air is accomplished using passive or active devices placed in the building. Some devices are promptly sent to a laboratory for analysis, others calculate the results on-site. Radon-in-water testing requires a water sample being sent to a laboratory.

Retesting is recommended in several situations such as to double check test results before spending money on the installation of a mitigation system. Test results which exceed accuracy tolerances also require re-testing. When a mitigation system installation is warranted, a retest after the system is functional is advised to be sure the system is effectively reducing the radon concentration below the action level, and after any mitigation system repairs such as replacing a fan unit. Retesting is also recommended every ten years.

===Testing in the United States===
[[File:USradonmapforhouses.jpg.png|thumb|Radon map of the United States]]
[[ASTM International|ASTM]] E-2121 is a US standard for reducing air-born radon in homes as far as practicable below the action level of 4 [[picocurie]]s per liter (pCi/L) (148 [[becquerel|Bq]]/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html |title=Recommended Residential Radon Mitigation Standard of Practice |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2008-02-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116184748/http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon/pubs/mitstds.html |archivedate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/DATABASE.CART/REDLINE_PAGES/E2121.htm?L+mystore+xyan5063| title = ASTM E2121-03 Standard Practice for Installing Radon Mitigation Systems in Existing Low-Rise Residential Buildings |publisher = ASTM International |date = |accessdate = 2008-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states recommend achieving 2.0 pCi/L or less.

Radon test kits are commercially available&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drhomeair.com/order/drha_order1.php |title=Commercially Available Radon Kits |accessdate=2012-04-19 |publisher=Alpha Energy Labs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712143535/http://www.drhomeair.com/order/drha_order1.php |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used by homeowners, tenants and in limited cases by landlords, except when a property is for sale.

Commercially available test kits includes a passive collector that the user places in the lowest livable floor of the house for 2 to 7 days. The user then sends the collector to a laboratory for analysis. Long-term kits, taking collections from 91 days to one year, are also available.  Open land test kits can test radon emissions from the land before construction begins, but are not recommended by the EPA because they do not accurately predict the final indoor radon level.  The EPA and the National Environmental Health Association have identified 15 types of radon test devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radongas.org/device.htm |title=Radon Measurement Method Definitions |accessdate=2008-02-02 |publisher=The National Environmental Health Association—National Radon Proficiency Program |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224165447/http://www.radongas.org/device.htm |archivedate=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Lucas cell]] is one type of device.

Retesting is specifically recommended in several situations. Measurements between 4 and 10 pCi/L (148 and 370 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) warrant a follow-up short term or long-term radon test before mitigation. Measurements over 10 pCi/L (370 Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) warrant only another short-term test (not a long term test) so that abatement measures are not unduly delayed.

Purchasers of real estate may delay or decline a purchase if the seller has not successfully abated radon to less than 4 pCi/L.

It should be noted that the accuracy of the residential radon test depends upon the lack of ventilation in the house when the sample is being obtained.  Thus the occupants will be instructed not to open windows, etc., for ventilation during the pendency of test, usually two days or more.  However, the occupants, if the present owners, will be motivated to pass the test and insure the sale, so they might be tempted to open a window to get a lower radon score.  Moreover, there may be children or immature teens or young adults in the house who will open a window for ventilation notwithstanding instructions not to do so, particularly in uncomfortably hot weather.  Accordingly, whether the potential purchaser should trust the result of such a test is problematic.

Management of radon service provider certification has evolved since being introduced by the EPA in 1986. In the 1990s this service was "privatized" and the National Environmental Health Association (NEHA) helped transition the voluntary National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP) to be administered by private firms. {{As of|2012}}, the NRPP is administered by the American Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrpp.info/history.shtml |title=National Radon Proficiency Program - NEHA and NEHA-NRPP History |publisher=Nrpp.info |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states, such as Maine, require landlords to test their rental properties and turn the results in to the state. In limited cases the landlord or tenant(s) may do the testing themselves. The rules in each state vary. In many cases there are private contractors that will inspect hired by the city.

===Testing in Canada===
Canadian Government, in conjunction with the territories and provinces, developed the guideline&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radoncontrol.ca/radon-gas--vancouver%2c-bc%2c-canada.html |title=Radon Gas &amp;#124; Vancouver, BC, Canada |publisher=Radoncontrol.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; to indicate when remedial action should be taken was originally set at 800 Bq/m³ ([[becquerel]]s per cubic meter) and since reduced to 200 Bq/m³. This new guideline was approved by the Federal Provincial Territorial Radiation Protection Committee in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/radiation/radon/faq_fq-eng.php#reaction |title=Radon Frequently Asked Questions - Health Canada |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=2014-07-30 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of radon gas mitigation==
[[File:Connecticut Radon Mitigation.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of a radon mitigation system including the fan and vent pipe is visible near the gutter downspout.]]Because high levels of radon have been found in every state of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.radonrid.com/comp/myth-vs-fact| title = Radon: Myth vs Fact| accessdate = 2009-11-13| publisher = Radon-Rid/EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; testing for radon and installing radon mitigation systems has become a specialized industry since the 1980s.  Many states have implemented programs that affect home buying and awareness in the real estate community, however radon testing and mitigation systems are not generally mandatory unless specified by the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/rrnc/code_listing.html| title = Listing of States and Jurisdictions with RRNC Codes| accessdate = 2009-11-13| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the EPA's "A Citizen's Guide to Radon",&lt;ref name="A Citizen's Guide to Radon"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/citguide.html#lower| title = A Citizen's Guide to Radon| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method to reduce radon "primarily used is a vent pipe system and fan, which pulls radon from beneath the house and vents it to the outside", which is also called sub-slab depressurization, active soil depressurization, or soil suction. Generally indoor radon can be mitigated by sub-slab depressurization and exhausting such radon-laden air to the outdoors, away from windows and other building openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |title=Radon Mitigation Methods |accessdate=2008-12-02 |publisher=Radon Solution |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215190050/http://radon-solution.com/pg_mitigation_methods.php |archivedate=2008-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "EPA generally recommends methods which prevent the entry of radon. Soil suction, for example, prevents radon from entering your home by drawing the radon from below the home and venting it through a pipe, or pipes, to the air above the home where it is quickly diluted" and "EPA does not recommend the use of sealing alone to reduce radon because, by itself, sealing has not been shown to lower radon levels significantly or consistently" according to the EPA's "Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home".&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.epa.gov/radon/pubs/consguid.html#reductiontech| title = Consumer's Guide to Radon Reduction: How to fix your home| accessdate = 2010-04-03| publisher = EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventilation systems can utilize a heat exchanger or energy recovery ventilator to recover part of the energy otherwise lost in the process of exchanging air with the outside.  For crawlspaces, the EPA states,&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; "An effective method to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes involves covering the earth floor with a high-density plastic sheet. A vent pipe and fan are used to draw the radon from under the sheet and vent it to the outdoors. This form of soil suction is called submembrane suction, and when properly applied is the most effective way to reduce radon levels in crawlspace homes."

The most common approaches are active soil depressurization (ASD) and [[ventilation (architecture)|mechanical ventilation]] (MV). Experience has shown that ASD is applicable to most buildings since radon usually enters from the soil and rock underneath and MV is used when the indoor radon is emitted from the building materials. A less common approach works efficiently by reducing air pressures within cavities of exterior and demising walls where radon emitting from building materials, most often concrete blocks, collects. 
*Above slab air pressure differential barrier technology (ASAPDB) requires that the interior pressure envelope, most often [[drywall]], as well as all ductwork for air conditioning systems, be made as airtight as possible. A small blower, often no more than 15 cubic feet per minute (0.7 l/s) may then extract the radon-laden air from these cavities and exhaust it to the out of doors. With well-sealed [[HVAC]] ducts, very small negative pressures, perhaps as little as 0.5 [[pascal (unit)|pascal]] (0.00007 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]]), will prevent the entry of highly radon-laden wall cavity air from entering into the breathing zone. Such ASAPDB technology is often the best radon mitigation choice for high-rise condominiums as it does not increase indoor humidity loads in hot humid climates, and it can also work well to prevent mold growth in exterior walls in heating climates.
*In hot, humid climates, [[heat recovery ventilator]]s (HRV) as well as [[energy recovery ventilator]]s (ERV) have a record of increasing indoor relative humidity and dehumidification demands on air conditioning systems. Mold problems have originated in homes that have been radon mitigated with HRV and ERV installations in hot, humid climates.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} HRVs and ERVs have an excellent record in heating climates.
*A recent technology is based on [[building science]]. It includes a variable rate mechanical ventilation system that prevents indoor relative humidity from rising above a preset level such as 50% which is currently suggested by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US Environmental Protection Agency]] and others as an upper limit for the prevention of mold. It has proven to be especially effective in hot, humid climates. It controls the air delivery rate so that the air conditioner is never overloaded with more moisture than it can effectively remove from the indoor air.
*It is generally assumed that air conditioner operation will remove excess moisture from the air in the breathing zone, but it is important to note that just because the air conditioner cools does not mean that it is also dehumdifying. If Δ''t'' is 14 degrees or less, it may not dehumidify at all even though it is cooling.
*Factors that are likely to aggravate indoor humidity problems from mechanical ventilation–based radon installations are as follows and an expert radon mitigator/building scientist will check for and correct any and all of the following when he or she performs radon mitigation procedures:
** Air conditioner duct leaks located outside the breathing zone, such as in the attic.
** Excessive exhaust fan operation
** Oversize or over-capacity air conditioners
** AC air handler fans that do not stop running when the air conditioner compressor stops running.
** Delta ''t'' (Δ''t''), which is the amount that the air is cooled as it is passed through the air conditioner's cooling coils. A good Δ''t'' performance figure for home air conditioners is about 20&amp;nbsp;°F (11&amp;nbsp;°C). In comparison, automobile air conditioners deliver Δ''t'' performance of 32 to 38&amp;nbsp;°F (18 to 21&amp;nbsp;°C). A Δ''t'' of 14&amp;nbsp;°F (8&amp;nbsp;°C) will dehumidify poorly if at all.

In South Florida, most radon mitigation is performed by use of fixed rate mechanical ventilation. Radon mitigation training in Florida does not include problems associated with mechanical ventilation systems, such as high indoor humidity, mold, moldy odors, property damage or health consequences of human occupation in high humidity of moldy environments{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. As a result, most Florida radon mitigators are unaware of and do not incorporate existing building science moisture management technology into mechanical ventilation radon installations. Home inspectors may not necessarily be aware of the mold risks associated with radon mitigation by mechanical ventilation.

The average cost for an ASD radon mitigation system in Minnesota is $1500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/eh/indoorair/radon/mitigationsystem.html |title=Radon Mitigation System - EH: Minnesota Department of Health |publisher=Health.state.mn.us |date=2014-12-10 |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These costs are very dependent on the type of home and age of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radonreductioninc.com/tag/featured-radon-mitigation-system/ |title=Featured Radon Mitigation System Archives |publisher=Radonreductioninc.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of radon-in-water mitigation==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
Radon removal from water supplies may be at a treatment plant, point of entry, or point of use. Public water supplies in the United States were required to treat for radionuclides beginning in 2003 but private wells are not regulated by the federal government {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. The radon can be captured by granular activated charcoal (GAR) or released into the air through aeration of the water. Radon will naturally dissipate from water over a period of days, but the quantity of storage needed to treat the water in this manner makes home systems of this type impracticably large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/drinkingwater/dws/radon/upload/2001_01_09_radon_hrrcafr.pdf|format=PDF|title="Radon in Drinking Water Health Risk Reduction and Cost Analysis: Notice"|journal=''Federal Register''|volume= 64|date=February 26, 1999|accessdate=2015-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activated carbon systems capture radon from the water. The amount of radiation accumulates over time and the filter material may reach the level of requiring disposal as a [[radioactive waste]]. However, in the United States there are no regulations concerning radiation levels and disposal of radon treatment waste {{as of|2014|lc=y}}.

Aeration systems move the radon from the water to the air. Radon gas discharged into the air is the release of a pollutant, and may become regulated in the United States.

An '''oil skimmer''' is a device that is designed to remove oil floating on a liquid surface. Depending on the specific design they are used for a variety of applications such as [[oil spill]] response, as a part of oily water treatment systems, removing oil from machine tool coolant and aqueous parts washers, and collecting fats oils and greases in wastewater treatment in food manufacturing industries.

Oil skimmers were used to great effect to assist in the remediation of the [[Exxon Valdez]] [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|spill]] in 1989. Oil skimmers are different to [[Swimming pool sanitation]] skimmers that are designed for a related but different purpose.

==Limitation and design factors==
There are many different types of oil skimmer. Each type has different design features and therefore results in different applications and use. It is important to understand the design features before employing a particular skimmer type.

Some factors to consider are:
* Oil removal flow rate: Alternative Skimmer designs have different oil removal flow rates. Volume removal rates for Oleophilic skimmer types (drum, brush, disc, belt) are comparatively low. Weir type skimmers are capable of very high oil and water removal rates. ASTM F2709 standard establishes the test procedure for determining oil recovery rate (ORR).
* Oil removal concentration: It is a common misconception that oil skimmers remove concentrated or pure 'oil'; when in fact they remove a mixture of oil and water. In most situations the 'oil' mixture removed is an emulsion of oil and water more like a 'mousse'. Oleophilic and Non-Oleophilic skimmers can provide a more concentrated oil in the removal stream, however still collect entrained water.
* Effectiveness with different oils: Oleophilic and Non-Oleophilic skimmers are not equally effective with all oil types due to the changing nature of the attraction forces with different oils and materials.
* Effectiveness with chemicals in the water: Oleophilic skimmers may not work as effectively if there are detergents, cleaners or other surfactants in the water that interfere with the oleophilic attraction. Weir skimmers are not affected by chemicals.
* Effects of trash and debris: Trash and debris may block or interfere with the operation of oil skimmers.
* Skimming direction: Some skimmers only remove oil from one direction. In some situations, such as skimming from pits and tanks, it can be important to remove oil from all directions.
* Service Access: Some skimmers such as disc skimmers, or weir skimmers with skimmer mounted pumps, contain heavy serviceable items of equipment mounted on the skimmer. This may require special lifting equipment and confined space entry safety considerations before servicing.

==Applications==
The use of skimmers in industrial applications is often required to remove oils, grease and fats prior to further treatment for environmental discharge compliance. By removing the top layer of oils, water stagnation, smell and unsightly surface scum can be reduced. Placed before an [[Oil–water separator|oily water treatment system]] an oil skimmer may give greater overall oil separation efficiency for improved discharge wastewater quality. It should be noted that all oil skimmers will pick up a percentage of water with the oil which will need to be decanted to obtain concentrated oil.

==Types==
There are four main types of oil skimmer: weir (manual or self-adjusting) and belt and oleophilic and non-oleophilic (disc, drum, belt, tube, brush,mop, grooved disc, grooved drum):

===Weir===
Weir skimmers function by allowing the oil floating on the surface of the water to flow over a [[weir]]. There are two main types of weir skimmer, those that require the weir height to be manually adjusted and those where the weir height is automatic or self-adjusting.&lt;ref name="Weir Oil Skimmers"&gt;[http://www.ultraspin.com.au/products/skimmers/. Weir Type Oil Skimmers]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst manually adjusted weir skimmer types can have a lower initial cost, the requirement for regular manual adjustment makes self-adjusting weir types more popular in most applications. Weir skimmers will collect water if operating when oil is no longer present. To overcome this limitation most weir type skimmers contain an automatic water drain on the oil collection tank. [[File:Self adjusting weir type oil skimmer, Ultraspin.jpg|thumbnail|Industrial weir type oil skimmer]].
===Belt===
Belt oil skimmers is one of the most reliable and economical equipment removing liquid surface floating oil, low electric consumption, no need any consumable, can effective remove all kinds of floating oil (contain machine oil, kerosene, diesel oil, lubricating oil,plant oil and other liquid specific weight less than water, no matter the water surface oil layer thick or thin, all can absorb), can make oil-water separation and waste oil reuse, its principle is adopt different gravity and surface tension etc characteristic, when the oil skimming belt pass water surface can absorb and take away the surface all kinds of floating oil.

===Oleophilic===
Oleophilic skimmers function by using an element such as a drum, disc, rope or mop to which the oil [[adhesion|adheres]]. The oil is wiped from the oleophilic surface and collected in a tank. As the oil is adhering to a collection surface the amount of water collected when oil is not present will be limited.

===Non-oleophilic===
[[File:Oil Skimmer for StingRay Parts Washer.jpg|thumbnail|Smooth industrial disc oil skimmer]]
Non-oleophilic skimmers are distinguished by the component used to collect the oil. A metal disc, belt or drum is used in applications where an oleophilic material is inappropriate, such as in a hot alkaline aqueous parts washer.&lt;ref name="non-oleophilic"&gt;[http://www.stingraypartswasher.com/Parts_Washer_Option_Oil_Skimmer.html non-oleophilic parts washer skimmer]&lt;/ref&gt; The skimmer is generally turned off whenever there is no oil to skim thus minimizing the amount of water collected.  Metal skimming elements are nearly as efficient as oleophilic skimmers when oil is present.

==Wendy Schmidt Challenge==
Some oil skimming designs entered the Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE in 2011. The winning technology utilized Grooves placed on the surface of rotating discs manufactured by Elastec Inc of the USA. The revolutionary oil skimming technology won the X Prize Foundation’s Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE by recovering oil at a rate of 4,760 gallons per minute and an oil-to-water efficiency rate of 89.5% &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iprizecleanoceans.org/ Wendy Schmidt Oil Cleanup X CHALLENGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows the net movement of water down its potential energy gradient, from highest water potential in the soil to lowest water potential in the air.]]
The '''soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC)''' is the pathway for water moving from [[soil]] through [[plant]]s to the [[atmosphere]]. Continuum in the description highlights the continuous nature of water connection through the pathway. The low [[water potential]] of the atmosphere, and relatively higher (i.e. less negative) water potential inside leaves, leads to a diffusion gradient across the [[Stoma|stomatal]] pores of leaves, drawing water out of the leaves as vapour. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As water vapour [[Transpiration|transpires]] out of the leaf, further water molecules evaporate off the surface of [[Leaf|mesophyll]] cells to replace the lost molecules since water in the air inside leaves is maintained at [[saturation vapour pressure]]. Water lost at the surface of cells is replaced by water from the [[xylem]], which due to the [[Cohesion-tension theory|cohesion-tension]] properties of water in the xylem of plants pulls additional water molecules through the xylem from the roots toward the leaf.  

==Components==
The transport of water along this pathway occurs in components, variously defined among scientific disciplines:
* [[Soil physics]] characterizes [[soil moisture|water in soil]] in terms of [[water potential|tension]], 
* [[Physiology]] of plants and animals characterizes water in organisms in terms of ''diffusion pressure deficit'', and
* [[Meteorology]] uses [[vapour pressure]] or [[relative humidity]] to characterize atmospheric water. 

SPAC integrates these components and is defined as a:
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;...concept recognising that the field with all its components (soil, plant, animals and the ambient atmosphere taken together) constitutes a physically integrated, dynamic system in which the various flow processes involving energy and matter occur simultaneously and independently like links in the chain. &lt;ref&gt; [[John R. Philip]] (1966). Plant water relations: some physical aspects. ''Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.'' 17, 245–268.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This characterises the state of water in different components of the SPAC as expressions of the energy level or [[water potential]] of each. Modelling of water transport between components relies on SPAC, as do studies of water potential gradients between segments.

'''Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop''' is a [[workshop]] for [[science fiction]] writers. Since its origin in 1985, it has been held in Raleigh, [[North Carolina]]; Bryn Mawr, [[Pennsylvania]]; and most recently in Little Switzerland, North Carolina.

Currently organized by Richard Butner, Sycamore Hill was started by [[John Kessel]] and [[Mark L. Van Name]]. It is an invitation-only workshop for established SF, fantasy, and slipstream writers. Attendees have included [[Kelly Link]], [[Carol Emshwiller]], [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Connie Willis]], [[Karen Joy Fowler]], [[Jonathan Lethem]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Robert Frazier (writer)|Robert Frazier]], [[Ted Chiang]], [[Benjamin Rosenbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000278.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Don Webb (writer)|Don Webb]], among many others.

A collection of original stories from the 1994 workshop was published as the anthology ''Intersections: The Sycamore Hill Anthology'', edited by John Kessel, Mark L. Van Name and Richard Butner ([[Tor Books]], 1996). It includes works by Richard Butner, Carol Emshwiller, Karen Joy Fowler, Robert Frazier, Gregory Frost, Alexander Jablokov, James Patrick Kelly, John Kessel, Nancy Kress, Jonathan Lethem, Maureen F. McHugh, Michaela Roessner, Bruce Sterling, and Mark L. Van Name.

[[Orson Scott Card]] wrote about his experience at the Sycamore Hill Writer's Workshop in the essay "On Sycamore Hill." Scholars such as Michael Collins identify Card's Sycamore Hill experience as marking a critical "turning point" in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toward Other Worlds: Perspectives on John Milton, C.

In mathematical or [[statistical model|statistical mode]]ling a '''threshold model''' is any model where a threshold value, or set of threshold values, is used to distinguish ranges of values where the behaviour predicted by the model varies in some important way. A particularly important instance arises in toxicology, where the model for the effect of a drug may be that there is zero effect for a dose below a critical or threshold value, while an effect of some significance exists above that value.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-850994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain types of regression model may include threshold effects.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

== Collective Behavior ==
Threshold models are often used to model the behavior of groups, ranging from social insects to animal herds to human society.

Classic threshold models were developed by Schelling, Axelrod, and [[Mark Granovetter|Granovetter]] to model [[collective behavior]]. Schelling attempted to model the dynamics of segregation  motivated by individual interactions in America (Schelling, 1971) by constructing two simulation models. Schelling demonstrated that “there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results,” and that the dynamics of movement influenced patterns of segregation. In doing so Schelling highlighted the significance of “a general theory of ‘tipping’”.

Mark Granovetter, following Schelling, proposed the threshold model (Granovetter &amp; Soong, 1983, 1986, 1988), which assumes that individuals’ behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaging in that behavior (both Schelling and Granovetter classify their term of “threshold” as behavioral threshold.). He used the threshold model to explain the riot, residential segregation, and the spiral of silence. In the spirit of Granovetter’s threshold model, the “threshold” is “the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so”. 
It is necessary to emphasize the determinants of threshold. Different individuals have different thresholds. Individuals' thresholds may be influenced by many factors: social economic status, education, age, personality, etc. Further, Granovetter relates “threshold” with utility one gets from participating in collective behavior or not, using the utility function, each individual will calculate his or her cost and benefit from undertaking an action. And situation may change the cost and benefit of the behavior, so threshold is situation-specific.
The distribution of the thresholds determines the outcome of the aggregate behavior (for example, public opinion).

==Segmented Regression analysis==

The models used in [[segmented regression analysis]] are threshold models.

==Fractals==

Certain deterministic recursive multivariate models which include threshold effects have been shown to produce [[fractal]] effects.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;Tong, H. (1990) ''Non-linear Time Series: A Dynamical System Approach'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-852224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time series analysis==

Several classes of [[nonlinear]] [[autoregressive]] models formulated for [[time series]] applications have been threshold models.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

==Toxicology==
A threshold model used in [[toxicology]] posits that anything above a certain dose of a [[toxin]] is dangerous, and anything below it safe. This model is usually applied to non-[[carcinogen]]ic health hazards.

An alternative type of model in toxicology is the [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT), while [[hormesis]] correspond to the existence of opposite effects at low vs. high dose, which usually gives a U- or inverted U-shaped dose response curve.

== Liability threshold model ==

The '''liability-threshold model''' is a threshold model of categorical (usually binary) outcomes in which a large number of variables are summed to yield an overall 'liability' score; the observed outcome is determined by whether the [[latent variable|latent]] score is smaller or larger than the threshold. The liability-threshold model is frequently employed in medicine and genetics to model risk factors contributing to disease.

In a genetic context, the variables are all the genes and different environmental conditions, which protect against or increase the risk of a disease, and the threshold ''z'' is the biological limit past which disease develops. The threshold can be estimated from population prevalence of the disease (which is usually low). Because the threshold is defined relative to the population &amp; environment, the liability score is generally considered as a N(0, 1) [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]].

Early genetics models were developed to deal with very rare genetic diseases by treating them as [[Mendelian disease]]s caused by 1 or 2 genes: the presence or absence of the gene corresponds to the presence or absence of the disease, and the occurrence of the disease will follow predictable patterns within families. Continuous traits like height or intelligence could be modeled as [[normal distribution]]s, influenced by a large number of genes, and the heritability and effects of selection easily analyzed. Some diseases, like alcoholism, epilepsy, or [[Schizophrenia#Genetic|schizophrenia]], cannot be Mendelian diseases because they are common; do not appear in Mendelian ratios; respond slowly to selection against them; often occur in families with no prior history of that disease; however, relatives and adoptees of someone with that disease are far more likely (but not certain) to develop it, indicating a strong genetic component. The liability threshold model was developed to deal with these non-Mendelian binary cases; the model proposes that there is a continuous normally-distributed trait expressing risk polygenically influenced by many genes, which all individuals above a certain value develop the disease and all below it do not.

The first threshold models in genetics were introduced by [[Sewall Wright]], examining the propensity of [[guinea pig]] strains to have an extra hind toe, a phenomenon which could not be explained as a dominant or recessive gene, or continuous "blinding inheritance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208511/pdf/506.pdf | pmc=1208511 | pmid=17246735 | volume=19 | title=An Analysis of Variability in Number of Digits in an Inbred Strain of Guinea Pigs | journal=Genetics | pages=506–36 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208512/pdf/537.pdf | pmc=1208512 | pmid=17246736 | volume=19 | title=The Results of Crosses between Inbred Strains of Guinea Pigs, Differing in Number of Digits | journal=Genetics | pages=537–51 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern liability-threshold model was introduced into human research by geneticist [[Douglas Scott Falconer]] in his textbook&lt;ref&gt;ch18, "Threshold characters", [https://archive.org/details/introductiontoq00falc ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''], Falconer 1960&lt;/ref&gt; and two papers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to certain diseases, estimated from the incidence among relatives"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815214451/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to diseases with variable age of onset, with particular reference to diabetes mellitus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815203446/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Falconer had been asked about the topic of modeling 'threshold characters' by [[Cyril Clarke]] who had [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/167/4/1529 "D. S. Falconer and ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''"], Hill &amp; Mackay 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

An early application of liability-threshold models was to schizophrenia by [[Irving Gottesman]] &amp; James Shields, finding substantial heritability &amp; little shared-environment influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC335617/pdf/pnas00677-0218.pdf | pmc=335617 | pmid=5231600 | volume=58 | title=A polygenic theory of schizophrenia | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=199–205 | last1 = Gottesman | first1 = II | last2 = Shields | first2 = J | doi=10.1073/pnas.58.1.199 | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and undermining the "cold mother" theory of schizophrenia.

In both road and rail [[vehicle]]s, the '''wheelbase''' is the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels. For road vehicles with more than two axles (e.g. some trucks), the wheelbase is  the distance between the steering (front) axle and the centerpoint of the driving axle group. In the case of a tri-axle truck, the wheelbase would be the distance between the steering axle and a point midway between the two rear axles.

[[File:Wheelbase and Track.png|thumb|320px|Wheelbase (measured between rotational centers of wheels)]]

== Vehicles ==

The '''wheelbase''' of a [[vehicle]] equals the distance between its front and rear wheels.  At equilibrium, the total [[torque]] of the forces acting on a vehicle is zero.   Therefore, the wheelbase is related to the [[force]] on each pair of tires by the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;F_f = {d_r \over L}mg&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_r = {d_f \over L}mg&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_f&lt;/math&gt; is the force on the front tires, &lt;math&gt;F_r&lt;/math&gt; is the force on the rear tires, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the wheelbase, &lt;math&gt;d_r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the [[center of mass]] (CM) to the rear wheels, &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the center of gravity to the front wheels (&lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;d_r&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass]] of the vehicle, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Standard gravity|gravity constant]]. So, for example, when a truck is loaded, its center of gravity shifts rearward and the force on the rear tire increases.  The vehicle will ride lower.  The amount the vehicle sinks will depend on counter acting forces like the size of the tires, tire pressure, and the stiffness of the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]].
If the vehicle is [[acceleration|accelerating]] or decelerating, extra torque is placed on the rear or front [[tire]] respectively.  The equation relating the wheelbase, height above the ground of the CM, and the force on each pair of tires becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;F_f = {d_r \over L}mg - {h_{cm} \over L}ma&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F_r = {d_f \over L}mg + {h_{cm} \over L}ma&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_f&lt;/math&gt; is the force on the front tires, &lt;math&gt;F_r&lt;/math&gt; is the force on the rear tires, &lt;math&gt;d_r&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the CM to the rear wheels, &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt; is the distance from the CM to the front wheels, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the wheelbase, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the vehicle, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration of gravity (approx. 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;math&gt;h_{cm}&lt;/math&gt; is the height of the CM above the ground, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration (or deceleration if the value is negative). So, as is common experience, when the vehicle accelerates, the rear usually sinks and the front rises depending on the suspension. Likewise, when braking the front noses down and the rear rises.:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the effect the wheelbase has on the weight distribution of the vehicle, wheelbase dimensions are crucial to the balance and steering. For example, a [[Automobile|car]] with a much greater weight load on the rear tends to [[understeer]] due to the lack of the load (force) on the front tires and therefore the grip ([[friction]]) from them. This is why it is crucial, when towing a single-axle caravan, to distribute the caravan's weight so that down-thrust on the tow-hook is about 100 pounds force (400 N). Likewise, a car may [[oversteer]] or even "spin out" if there is too much force on the front tires and not enough on the rear tires. Also, when turning there is lateral torque placed upon the tires which imparts a turning force that depends upon the length of the tire distances from the CM. Thus, in a car with a short wheelbase, the short lever arm from the CM to the rear wheel will result in a greater lateral [[force]] on the rear tire which means greater acceleration and less time for the driver to adjust and prevent a spin out or worse.

Wheelbases provide the basis for one of the most common [[vehicle size class]] systems.

===Varying wheelbases within nameplate===

Some [[luxury vehicle]]s are offered with long-wheelbase variants to increase the spaciousness and therefore the luxury of the vehicle. This practice can often be found on [[full-size car]]s like the [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]], but [[Luxury vehicle#Ultra-luxury cars|ultra-luxury vehicles]] such as the [[Rolls-Royce Phantom (2003)|Rolls-Royce Phantom]] and even [[large family cars]] like the [[Rover 75]] came with 'limousine' versions.  Prime Minister of the United Kingdom [[Tony Blair]] was given a long-wheelbase version of the Rover 75 for official use.&lt;ref name="Biggs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biggs|first1=Henry|title=Rover 75|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-reviews/15966/rover-75|website=autoexpress.co.uk|publisher=Auto Express|accessdate=May 8, 2017|language=en|date=October 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and even some SUVs like the [[VW Tiguan]] and [[Jeep Wrangler]] come in LWB models

In contrast, [[coupé]] varieties of some vehicles such as the [[Honda Accord]] are usually built on shorter wheelbases than the [[Sedan (automobile)|sedans]] they are derived from.

=== Bikes ===
{{main|Bicycle and motorcycle geometry}}

The [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Wheelbase|wheelbase]] on many commercially available [[bicycle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s is so short, relative to the height of their [[center of gravity|centers of mass]], that they are able to perform [[stoppie]]s and [[wheelie]]s.

=== Skateboards ===

In skateboarding the word 'wheelbase' is used for the distance between the two inner pairs of mounting holes on the deck. This is different from the distance between the rotational centers of the two wheel pairs. A reason for this alternative use is that decks are sold with prefabricated holes, but usually without trucks and wheels. It is therefore easier to use the prefabricated holes for measuring and describing this characteristic of the deck. 

A common misconception is that the choice of wheelbase is influenced by the height of the skateboarder. However, the length of the deck would then be a better candidate, because the wheelbase affects characteristics useful in different speeds or terrains regardless of the height of the skateboarder. For example, a deck with a long wheelbase, say {{convert|22|in|cm|1}}, will respond slowly to turns, which is often desirable in high speeds. A deck with a short wheelbase, say {{convert|14|in|cm|1}}, will respond quickly to turns, which is often desirable when skating backyard pools or other terrains requiring quick or intense turns.

== Rail ==

In rail vehicles, the wheelbase follows a similar concept. However, since the wheels may be of different sizes (for example, on a [[steam locomotive]]), the measurement is taken between the points where the wheels contact the rail, and not between the centers of the wheels.

On vehicles where the [[Wheelset (railroad)| wheelsets (axles)]] are mounted inside the vehicle frame (mostly in steam locomotives), the wheelbase is the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets.

On vehicles where the wheelsets are mounted on [[bogie|bogies (amer.: trucks)]], three wheelbase measurements can be distinguished:
* the distance between the pivot points of the front-most and rear-most bogie;
* the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of the vehicle;
* the distance between the front-most and rear-most wheelsets of each bogie.

The wheelbase affects the rail vehicle's capability to negotiate curves. Short-wheelbased vehicles can negotiate sharper curves. On some larger wheelbase locomotives, inner wheels may lack [[flange]]s in order to pass curves.

The wheelbase also affects the load the vehicle poses to the track, track infrastructure and bridges. All other conditions being equal, a shorter wheelbase vehicle represents a more concentrated load to the track than a longer wheelbase vehicle. As railway lines are designed to take a pre-determined maximum load per unit of length (tonnes per meter, or pounds per foot), the rail vehicles' wheelbase is designed according to their intended gross weight. The higher the gross weight, the longer the wheelbase must be.

'''World domination''' (also called '''global domination''' or '''world conquest''') is a hypothetical [[power structure]], either achieved or aspired to, in which a single political authority holds the power over all or virtually all the inhabitants of the planet Earth. Various individuals or regimes have tried to achieve this goal throughout history, without ever attaining it.
The theme has been often used in works of [[fiction]], particularly in [[political fiction]], as well as in [[conspiracy theories]] (which may posit that some person or group has already secretly achieved this goal), particularly those fearing the development of a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" involving a [[world government]] of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature.&lt;ref name="Camp 1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Camp, Gregory S.|title=Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia|publisher=Commish Walsh|year=1997|asin=B000J0N8NC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlet and Lyons 2000"&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Chip Berlet|Berlet Chip]]; Lyons, Matthew N.|title=Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort |url=http://www.publiceye.org/tooclose/index.html|publisher=Guilford Press|year=2000|isbn=1-57230-562-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg 2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goldberg, Robert Alan|title=Enemies Within: The Culture of Conspiracy in Modern America|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-300-09000-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barkun 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barkun, Michael|title=[[A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America]]|publisher=University of California Press; 1 edition|year=2003|isbn=0-520-23805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fenster 2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fenster, Mark|title=Conspiracy Theories: Secrecy and Power in American Culture|publisher=University of Minnesota Press; 2nd edition|year=2008|isbn=0-8166-5494-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|World government}}
[[File:Achaemenid Empire (flat map).svg|thumb|right|By 500 BC, [[Darius the Great]] had created the largest empire up until that time, but it was still only a fraction of the land and people of the Earth.]]

Historically, world domination has been thought of in terms of a [[nation]] expanding its power to the point that all other nations are subservient to it. This may be achieved by establishing a [[hegemony]], an indirect form of government and of imperial dominance in which the ''hegemon'' (leader state) rules geopolitically subordinate states by means of its implied power—by the threat of force, rather than by direct military force. However, domination can also be achieved by direct military force. In the 4th century BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] notably expressed a desire to conquer the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Green|first=Peter| authorlink=Peter Green (historian)| year=2007| title= Alexander the Great and the Hellenistic Age|page= 23|publisher=Phoenix|location=London| isbn=978-0-7538-2413-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a legend persists that after he completed his military conquest of the known [[ancient world]], he "wept because he had no more worlds to conquer",&lt;ref&gt;Eric Donald Hirsch, William G. Rowland, Michael Stanford, ''The New First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'' (2004), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; although he was unaware of China farther to the east and had no way to know about civilizations in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bruun, Millicent Haines, ''The World Story'' (1963), p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the full size and scope of the world known, it has been said that "world domination is an impossible goal", and specifically that "no single nation however big and powerful can dominate a world" of well over a hundred interdependent nations and billions of people.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Atlantic Community Quarterly]]'' (1979), Volume 17, p. 287. At the time, the source specified that there were about 140 nations and about four billion people.&lt;/ref&gt;

An opposite view was expressed by [[Hans Morgenthau]]. He stressed that the mechanical development of weapons, transportation, and communication makes "the conquest of the world technically possible, and they make it technically possible to keep the world in that conquered state." Its lack was the reason why great ancient empires, though vast, failed to complete universal conquest of their world and perpetuate the conquest. Now, however, this is possible. Technology undoes both geographic and climatic barriers. "Today no technological obstacle stands in the way of a world-wide empire," as "modern technology makes it possible to extend the control of mind and action to every corner of the globe regardless of geography and season."&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations|Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace]], 4th edition, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1967, pp. 358–365.&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau continued on the technological progress:
{{quote|
It has also given total war that terrifying, world-embracing impetus which seems to be satisfied with nothing less than world dominion… The machine age begets its own triumphs, each forward step calling forth two or more on the road of technological progress. It also begets its own victories, military and political; for with the ability to conquer the world and keep it conquered, it creates the will to conquer it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Politics Among Nations]], pp. 369–370.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Earlier, impressed with the swift opening of World War II, Derwent Whittlesey wrote in 1942:
{{quote|
The swift march of conquest stunned or dazzled the onlookers… The grandiose concept of the world domination became possible as a practical objective only with the rise of science and its application to mechanical invention. By these means the earth’s scattered land units and territories became accessible and complementary to each other, and for the first time the [[world state]], so long a futile medieval ideal, became a goal that might conceivably be reached.&lt;ref&gt;Derwent Whittlesey, ''German Strategy of World Conquest'', (Essex: F. E. Robinson &amp; Co, 1942), p 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yet before the entrance of the United States into this War and with Isolationism still intact, US strategist [[Hanson W. Baldwin]] projected:
{{quote|
Tomorrow air bases may be the highroad to power and domination… Obviously it is only by air bases … that power exercised in the sovereign skies above a nation can be stretched far beyond its shores… Perhaps… future acquisitions of air bases … can carry the voice of America through the skies to the ends of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson W. Baldwin, ''United We Stand! Defense of the Western Hemisphere'', (New York &amp; London: Whittlesey House, 1941), p 189, 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the early 17th century, Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] proposed that world domination could be achieved through control of the [[ocean]]s, writing that "whosoever commands the sea commands the [[trade]]; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Walter Raleigh]], "A Discourse of the Invention of Ships, Anchors, Compass, &amp;c.", ''The Works of Sir Walter Ralegh, Kt.'' (1829, reprinted 1965), vol. 8, p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, [[Halford John Mackinder]] offered another influential theory for a route to world domination, writing:

:"Who rules [[Eastern Europe|East Europe]] commands the [[The Geographical Pivot of History#The World-Island and the Heartland|Heartland]]:&lt;br&gt;Who rules the Heartland commands the [[Afro-Eurasia|World-Island]]:&lt;br&gt;Who rules the World-Island commands [[Earth|the World]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]], ''Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction'' (1919), p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some proponents of ideologies ([[anarchism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Nazism]], and [[capitalism]]) actively pursue the goal of establishing a form of government consistent with their political beliefs, or assert that the world is moving "naturally" towards the adoption of a particular form of government (or self), authoritarian or anti-authoritarian. These proposals are not concerned with a particular nation achieving world domination, but with all nations conforming to a particular social or economic model. A goal of world domination can be to establish a [[world government]], a single common political authority for all of humanity. The period of the [[Cold War]], in particular, is considered to be a period of intense ideological polarization, given the existence of two rival blocs—the capitalist [[Western Bloc|West]] and the communist [[Eastern Bloc|East]]—that each expressed the hope of seeing the triumph of their ideology over that of the enemy. The ultimate end of such a triumph would be that one ideology or the other would become the sole governing ideology in the world.

In certain [[religion]]s, some adherents may also seek the [[Religious conversion|conversion]] (peaceful or [[Forced conversion|forced]]) of as many people as possible to their own religion, without restrictions of national or ethnic origin. This type of spiritual domination is usually seen as distinct from the temporal dominion, although there have been instances of efforts begun as [[holy war]]s devolving into the pursuit of wealth, resources, and territory. Some [[Christianity|Christian]] groups teach that a false religion, led by [[false prophet]]s who achieve world domination by inducing nearly universal worship of a [[False god|false deity]], is a prerequisite to [[end time]]s described in the [[Book of Revelation]]. As one author put it, "[i]f world domination is to be obtained, the masses of little people must be brought on board with religion".&lt;ref&gt;Buddy Selman, ''Because God Made a Promise to Abraham'' (2011), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, speakers have accused nations or ideological groups of seeking world domination, even where those entities have denied that this was their goal. For example, [[J. G. Ballard]] quoted [[Aldous Huxley]] as having said of the United States entering the [[First World War]], "I dread the inevitable acceleration of American world domination which will be the result of it all...Europe will no longer be Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. G. Ballard]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/13/biography.aldoushuxley?INTCMP=SRCH Prophet of Our Present]. Review of ''[[Aldous Huxley]]: An English Intellectual'' by Nicholas Murray. ''The Guardian'', 13 April 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Geert Wilders]] argued in 2012 that "[[Islam]] is an ideology aiming for world domination rather than a religion",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Wilders|first=Geert |authorlink=Geert Wilders|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/sep/14/geert-wilders-5-questions-with-decker/|title=DECKER: 5 Questions with Geert Wilders|interviewer=Brett M. Decker|work=The Washington Times|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 characterized the [[2008 Israel–Gaza conflict]] as a proxy action by Islam against the West, contending that "[t]he end of Israel would not mean the end of our problems with Islam, but only... the start of the final battle for world domination".&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert Wilders]] [http://europenews.dk/en/node/14505 Speech at the Four Seasons, New York (25 September 2008)].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth Art Month''' is a month of promoting art and [[art education]] in the United States.  It is observed in March, with thousands of American schools participating, often with the involvement of local [[art museums]] and [[civic organizations]].

==Background==
Youth Art Month was founded by the Crayon, Water Color &amp; Craft Institute, Inc., the predecessor of the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute, Inc.]] (ACMI), in cooperation with the [[National Art Education Association]], in 1961 and was initially called '''Children's Art Month'''.  Its goal was to "emphasize the value of participating in art for all children."  It was renamed Youth Art Month in 1969, to include secondary school students.  In 1984, ACMI created the [[Council for Art Education, Inc.]] (CFAE) to oversee the annual observation of Youth Art Month.  As of 2009, CFAE consisted of representatives of: ACMI, the [[National Art Education Association]], "The SHIP" (a group of [[manufacturers]] of [[art materials]]), and the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]].  The [[Craft &amp; Hobby Association]] is also involved in Youth Art Month.

==Activities==

===National events===

The main nationwide component of Youth Art Month is a [[competition]] called '''School Flags Across America . . . Flying High'''.  As part of the competition, each state Youth Art Month Chairperson selects a theme that is representative of that state and of the spirit of Youth Art Month, and students design flags around that theme.  The winning design from each state is then made into an actual flag, and the 50 student-designed flags are then displayed throughout Washington, D.C. following an [[opening ceremony]] held the first week of March to commemorate the start of Youth Art Month.  The winning students and their families are invited to attend this opening ceremony in Washington, D.C. and the flags are displayed throughout the city for March, and then displayed at the Youth Art Month booth at the annual [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] of the National Art Education Association.

===State and local events===
[[Governor (United States)|Governors]] and [[mayors]] throughout the United States issue proclamations declaring March as Youth Art Month, and many [[United States Senate|United States Senators]], [[Member of Congress]], and [[State legislature (United States)|state legislators]] take the opportunity to make public statements in favor of art education.

Observation of Youth Art Month is carried out by [[volunteering|volunteers]] around the country, including art educators, [[parents]], librarians, leaders of [[youth organizations]], [[businesspeople]], and students.

Activities depend on the efforts of local volunteers, and include:

* display of student art at art museums, [[libraries]], and other places throughout the community;
* talks, forums, and discussions on art;
* partnerships with local newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations to raise the profile of youth art and art education in the community;
* local art competitions, often with winning student art displayed somewhere prominent in the community (e.g. at local bus stops);
* cross-promotions to raise awareness of other local charities or to beautify the community;
* special events, such as [[sidewalk chalk]] displays, [[ice sculpture]] carving, and craft workshops.
