The Ashta-Nayika classification (''nayika-bheda'') first appears in ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' (24.210-11), a key [[Sanskrit]] treatise on Indian [[performing arts]], authored by [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] (dated between 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="sahitya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Luiz Martinez|first= José |title=Semiosis in Hindustani music|year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas Publishers|isbn=81-208-1801-6|pages=288–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is detailed in later works like the ''Dasarupaka'' (10th century), ''[[Sahityadarpana]]'' (14th century) and various other treatises on poetics as well as erotic ''[[Kamashastra]]'' texts like Kuttanimata (8th-9th century) based on courtesans, ''Panchasayaka'', ''Anangaranga'' and ''Smaradipika''. [[Keshavdas|Keshavadasa]]'s ''Rasikapriya'' (16th century) in [[Hindi]], also elaborates on the Ashta-nayika.&lt;ref name="sodhi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sodhi|first=Jiwan|title=A study of Bundi school of painting|year=1999|publisher=Abinav Publishers|isbn=81-7017-347-7|pages=52–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika have been illustrated in [[Indian painting]], literature, sculpture as well as [[Indian classical dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Projesh |title=Dance in thumri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsuhSiITjU8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=Ashta+Nayika|year=1986|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-212-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman |title=Woman in Indian sculpture|year=2006|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-474-0|pages=93–106|chapter=Shringara nayika}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable medieval paintings that depict the Ashta nayika are the [[Ragamala paintings]], as those from the [[Bundi]] school of painting.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

A famous example in Indian literature is [[Jayadeva]]'s ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' (12th century) as well as in the [[Vaishnava]] poet Banamali's compositions, [[Radha]] dons the roles of the various nayikas while with her nayaka is the god [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/14/stories/2007091450100200.htm|title=Learn the lingo|date=Sep 14, 2007|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika is a central theme in ''Pahari embroidery'' used to decorate the ''Chamba [[Rumal]]'', especially produced in [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The Ashta Nayika are usually portrayed in eight panels on the Rumal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naik|first=Shailaja D. |title=Traditional embroideries of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Ashta+Nayika%22|year=1996|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=81-7024-731-4|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian (Hindustani) classical music, the eternal love between [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] is represented through the consciousness of [[Radha]] as the leitmotif that dominates the lyrics. Especially the semi-classical genre of [[Thumri]] imbibes the myriad moods of [[Radha]] as Ashta Nayika consumed by passionate love for [[Krishna]].

==The classification==
The ''Natya Shastra'' describes the nayikas in the following order: Vasakasajja, Virahotkanthita, Svadhinabhartruka, Kalahantarita, Khandita, Vipralabdha, Proshitabhartruka and Abhisarika. The nayikas are further classified in two varieties of the ''[[shringara]] rasa'', the ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' related to love: Sambhoga (love in meeting) and Vipralambha (love in separation). Vasakasajja, Svadhinabhartruka and Abhisarika are associated with  Sambhoga; the others with Vipralambha.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

In the ''Shringara Prakasha'', Bhoja relates the various nayakas and nayikas with musical ''[[raga]]''s and ''ragini''s (a female raga). Somanatha's ''Ragavibodha'' (1609) and Damodara's ''Sangitadarpana'' (c. 1625) continue this trend.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vasakasajja===

Vasakasajja ("one dressed up for union")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Vasakasajjika is waiting for her lover returning from a long journey. She is depicted in her bed-chamber filled with lotus leaves and garlands.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is dressing herself for the union with her lover and "eager with expectation of love's pleasure".&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; Her beauty is compared by Kesavadasa to [[Rati]] - the Hindu love goddess, waiting for her husband, the love god [[Kamadeva]].&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; A Vasakasajja sculpture is found in the Lakshmana Temple in [[Khajuraho]] and the National Museum, Delhi.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' associates the raginis [[Bhupali]] and [[Todi]] with Vasakasajja.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Virahotkanthita===

Virahotkanthita ("One distressed by separation")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Utka (as described by Keshavadasa) is the distressed heroine pining for her lover, who, due to his preoccupation, fails to return home. She is depicted waiting for him, sitting or standing on a bed or out in the pavilion.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' identifies the raginis Mukhari, Pauravi and Turushkatodi with the Virahotkanthita, while the ''Sangitadarpana'' names Patamanjari in this category.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

Svadhinabhartruka ("one having her husband in subjection")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Svadhinapatika(as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman who is loved by her husband and controls him. He is subjugated by her intense love and pleasing qualities.He is devoted and faithful to her
&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In paintings, this nayika is depicted with a nayaka, who applies ''[[Alta (dye)|mahawar]]'' on her feet or a vermilion [[tilak]] (mark) on her forehead.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; In [[Jayadeva]]'s [[Gita Govinda]] as well as in the poem ''Kuru Yadunandana'', [[Radha]] is portrayed as a Svadhinabhartruka. In the latter, Radha commands her lover, the god [[Krishna]], to rearrange her makeup which is in disarray due to their fierce [[coitus]].&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

Many raginis like Malashri, Travanika, Ramakriti, Jaitashri and Purvi  are associated with Svadhinabhartruka.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Kalahantarita===

Kalahantarita ("one separated by quarrel")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Abhisandhita (as named by Keshavadasa)&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; is a heroine separated from her lover due to a quarrel or jealousy&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; or her own arrogance.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; Her lover is usually depicted leaving her apartment disheartened, while she too becomes heartsick and repentant without him.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In other portrayals, she is depicted refusing the advances of her lover or refusing a wine cup from him. In Gita Govinda, Radha is also portrayed as Kalahantarita in an instance.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Khandita===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Khandita Nayika.jpg|thumb|upright|Khandita rebuking her lover.]]

Khandita ("one enraged with her lover")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is an enraged heroine, whose lover had promised her to spend the night with her, but instead comes to her house the next morning after spending the night with another woman. She is depicted offended, rebuking her lover for his infidelity.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

In the ''Sangitadarpana'', the ragini Varati represents the Khandita Nayika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vipralabdha===

Vipralabdha ("one deceived by her lover"),&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; , is a deceived heroine,&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; who waited for her lover the whole night.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is depicted throwing away her jewellery as her lover did not keep his promise.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; This happens when a lover meets a Khandita and promises a tryst and breaks his promise.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Sangitadarpana'' associates Vipralabdha with the ragini Bhupali. However, the ''Ragavibodha'' presents the raginis Varati and Velavati as Vipralabdhas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Proshitabhartruka===
[[File:Proshita-patika Nayika.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Proshita-patika mourning.]]

Proshitabhartruka ("one with a sojourning husband")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Proshitapatika (as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman whose husband has gone away from her for some business and does not return on the appointed day. She is depicted seated mourning, surrounded by her maids, but refusing to be consoled.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' describes the raginis Dhanashri and Kamodi as Proshitabhartrukas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Abhisarika===

Abhisarika ("one who moves")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is a heroine, who sets aside her modesty and moves out of her home to secretly meet her lover.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; She is depicted at the door of her house and on her way to the tryst, defying all kinds of difficulties like the storm, snakes and dangers of the forest.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In art, Abhisarika is portrayed often in hurry towards her destination.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The raginis Bahuli and Saurashtri are described having the traits of the daring Abhisarika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

[[File:Tamamushi Shrine.JPG|thumb|[[Tamamushi Shrine]], [[Horyu-ji]], Nara prefecture, Japan. [[Asuka Period]], decorated with lacquer and oil painting on wood, gilt bronze plaques, and the iridescent wings of jewel beetle ([[Tamamushi]]).]] 
'''Beetlewing''', or '''beetlewing art''', is an ancient craft technique using [[iridescent]] [[beetle]] wings practiced traditionally in [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[China]] and [[Japan]].

==Tradition==
It was common in some of the ancient refined cultures of Asia to attach beetlewing pieces as an adornment to paintings, textiles and jewelry. Different species of [[metallic wood-boring beetle]] wings were used depending on the region, but traditionally the most valued were those from beetles belonging to genus ''[[Sternocera]]''. Their wings were valued for their beautiful and hardy metallic [[Variations of green#Emerald|emerald]] iridescence. The shiny appearance of beetlewings is long-lasting. They are surprisingly durable if subject to normal non-abusive use. 

In Thailand beetlewings of wood–boring beetles ''Sternocera spp.'' ({{lang-th|แมลงทับ}}), like ''[[Sternocera aequisignata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaeng.com/blog/?p=4262 Life cycle of the rounded jewel beetles, Sternocera spp. วงจรชีวิตของแมลงทับกลมใช้เวลานานถึง 2 ปี - Siam Insect Zoo-Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; were preferred to decorate clothing (shawls and Sabai cloth) and jewelry in former court circles. The beetles have a short life span of 3 to 4 weeks in their adult stage. To avoid killing the beetles, only those that die of natural causes are collected. 

In 19th-century India exquisite masterpieces of embroidered textiles were produced using beetlewing pieces. These cloth items have survived the passage of time without losing their splendor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meg-andrews.com/item-details/Beettlewing/6961 Antique Costumes &amp; Textiles - Beetlewing, Early 19th century]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, the beetle wings will retain their natural sparkle, even though the cloth surrounding them may have decayed.

The species of beetle traditionally used in decorative work in Japan is ''[[Chrysochroa fulgidissima]]'', known also as ''Tamamushi''.

==Survival==
In Thailand this ancient tradition has mostly died out. In [[Bangkok]], rare pieces of crafts and jewelry made with beetlewing are displayed at the [[Vimanmek Palace|Dusit Palace]] complex of [[King Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V), now a museum. 

Thanks to the encouragement and support of HRH [[Queen Sirikit]], efforts are being made to preserve this traditional art at the Chitralada Center by supporting artisans who have kept the skill alive. 

Modern beetlewing work is usually applied on simple items, like earrings and collage work. These are marketed mostly through tourist-oriented shops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thailand.prd.go.th/ebook/queen/content/content_chitralada.html Chitralada - SUPPORT Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526153436/http://thailand.prd.go.th/ebook/queen/content/content_chitralada.html |date=2011-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Etruscan - Bulla with Daedalus and Icarus - Walters 57371 - Side A.jpg|thumb|Etruscan bulla picturing [[Icarus]]]]

'''Bulla''', an [[amulet]] worn like a locket, was given to male [[children of Ancient Rome|children]] in [[Ancient Rome]] nine days after birth. Rather similar objects are rare finds from Late Bronze Age Ireland.

==Roman bullae==
Roman bullae were enigmatic objects of lead, sometimes covered in gold foil, if the family could afford it. A bulla was worn around the neck as a locket to protect against evil spirits and forces. Bullae were made of differing substances depending upon the wealth of the family.

===Roman boys===
Before the age of manhood, Roman boys wore a bulla, a neckchain and round pouch containing protective amulets (usually [[Fascinum|phallic symbols]]), and the bulla of an upper-class boy would be made of gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/clothing.html |title=Roman Clothing |at=Part I |publisher=Vroma.org |access-date=2012-11-07 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials included leather and cloth.

A freeborn Roman boy wore a bulla until he came of age as a [[Roman citizen]]. Before he put on his ''[[toga]] virilis'' ("toga of manhood") he placed his boyhood bulla in the care of his parental household deities ([[Lares]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, John R., ''The Houses of Roman Italy, 100 BC-AD 250. Ritual, Space and Decoration,'' illustrated, University Presses of California, Columbia and Princeton, 1992, pp. 9-10; citing [[Propertius]], 4.1.13 &amp; [[Persius]], ''The Satires'', 5.30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some modern sources interpret [[Macrobius]]'s single reference to an amulet worn by a triumphal general during his procession as evidence that the childhood bulla was also a standard item of [[Roman triumph|triumphal regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Beard, Mary]]: ''[[The Roman Triumph]]'', The Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]], Cambridge, Mass., and London, England, 2007, pp. 229-230, 375-376, note 29; citing see also Macrobius, 3. 6. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman girls===
{{main|Lunula (amulet)}}
A girl child did not wear a bulla per-se,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=J.L. |last1=Sebesta |first2=L. |last2=Bonfante |title=The World of Roman Costume |publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press |year=2001 |page=47 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but another kind of amulet, called a [[Lunula (amulet)|lunula]], until the eve of her [[marriage]], when it was removed along with her childhood [[toy]]s and other things. She would then stop wearing child's clothes and start wearing women's [[Roman Dress]].

==Bronze Age Ireland==
A small number of bullae have been found in Ireland; they are called “bullae” based on their resemblance to the Roman form.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Other than superficial resemblance, Irish and Roman bullae have no known connection.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish bullae so-far found were made of base metal&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Irish bullae are usually made of lead, but also tin. Bullae made of clay are rare.&lt;/ref&gt; – sometimes clay – covered with a folded over piece of gold foil. The Irish bullae date to the Late Bronze Age, between about 1150&amp;nbsp;BCE–750&amp;nbsp;BCE.

They were presumably worn suspended round the neck with a cord running through the hole below the flat top. The body of the bulla has roughly vertical sides before making a semi-circle or inverted pointed arch at the bottom. The gold is incised with geometrical decoration.

Whether they were purely for adornment or had an amuletic or other function is unclear.  Despite the small weight of gold used they would have been only available for elite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/bullae |title=Bullae |series=Bronze Age objects |publisher=Portable Antiquities Scheme |location=UK |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808090352/http://finds.org.uk/bronzeage/objects/bullae |archive-date=8 August 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=d0214472-a18a-4fc4-b0c4-018a181ce345 |title=Bulla |dead-url=yes |date=November 2016 |publisher=National Museum of Ireland |df= |access-date=2013-08-18 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130818160504/http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=d0214472-a18a-4fc4-b0c4-018a181ce345# |archive-date=2013-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wallace |editor1-first=Patrick F.|editor2-last=O'Floinn |editor2-first=Raghnall |title=Treasures of the National Museum of Ireland |series=Irish Antiquities |volume=3 |page=18 |year=2002 |publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan |location=Dublin, EI |ISBN=0-7171-2829-6 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Joan J. |year=1980 |title=Bronze Age Goldwork of the British Isles |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UDI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |via=Google Books |pages=65&amp;nbsp;ff |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

Harvard Art Museums. www.harvardartmuseums.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued professional development ===
The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt; AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/courses#.WSykcMm1tPt Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org.

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of specialty ==
Some conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

'''The Council for Art Education, Inc. (CFAE)''' is an organization created by the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute, Inc.]] (ACMI) in 1984 to promote March as [[Youth Art Month]], which was designed to promote [[art education]].  As of 2009, CFAE consisted of representatives of: ACMI, the [[National Art Education Association]], "The SHIP" (a group of [[manufacturers]] of [[art materials]]), and the [[General Federation of Women's Clubs]].  The organization sponsors an annual competition called "School Flag Across the U.S....Flying High", where [[students]] are encouraged to design their own [[flags]], and the winning flag is flown in [[Washington, D.C.]] throughout Youth Art Month.  CFAE is currently [[headquartered]] in [[Hanson, Massachusetts]].

'''Darío Antonio Suro García-Godoy''' (June 13, 1917, [[La Vega (city)|La Vega]] – January 18, 1997, [[Santo Domingo]]) was an [[art critic]], [[diplomat]] and painter from the [[Dominican Republic]]. He was the nephew of painter [[Enrique García-Godoy]], his first art teacher. Along with [[Yoryi Morel]] and [[Jaime Colson]], he is considered one of the founders of the modernist school of Dominican painting.

==Family==
Born to Jaime Vicente Suro Sánchez (born in 1890, in Utuado, Puerto Rico) and Isabel Emilia García-Godoy Ceara (born in 1883 to [[:es:Federico García Godoy|Federico García Godoy]] and Rosa Ceara Giménez).&lt;ref name=Genealogy&gt;{{cite web|last=Espinal Hernández|first=Edwin Rafael|title=Federico García Godoy: 90 años después|url=http://www.idg.org.do/capsulas/marzo2014/marzo201415.htm|work=Cápsulas Genealógicas en Areíto|publisher=Instituto Dominicano de Genealogía|accessdate=13 May 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424124402/http://www.idg.org.do/capsulas/marzo2014/marzo201415.htm|archivedate=April 24, 2014 |location=Santo Domingo,&amp;nbsp;D.&amp;nbsp;N.|language=Spanish|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, [[Rubén Suro|Rubén Antonio]] (1916-2006).&lt;ref name=Genealogy/&gt;

==Early career==
Early on, he became popular as an [[Impressionist]] [[landscape artist]], often painting horses and rainy scenes of the Cibao region of his country. Suro had his first solo exhibition in 1938 at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. Subsequently, the same exhibition was shown at the San Cristobal Ateneo and in 1939, he was included in group exhibitions in [[New York City]], at the Riverside Museum and the Dominican Republic Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].

In 1940, Suro participated in the Inter-American Exhibition of the Caribbean organized by the [[Organization of American States]]. In that same year, he participated in a group show at the Ateneo Dominicano in Santo Domingo. In 1942, he had a solo exhibition at the [[Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (Santo Domingo)|Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes]] in Santo Domingo.

==Mexico==
[[File:Dario Suro 01.jpg|right|thumb|''Lluvia en el mercado'' (English:  ''Rain in the Market''), 1942 ([[Museo de Arte Moderno (Santo Domingo)|Museo de Arte Moderno]], [[Santo Domingo]])]]
The following year, 1943, he married Maruxa Franco Fernandez of Santiago and shortly after, they departed for Mexico where he was named [[cultural attaché]] at the [[List of diplomatic missions of the Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic Embassy]] in that country. On the way, they stayed in [[Havana]] for several weeks, where his bride's cousin, Tomas Hernandez Franco, was the Dominican [[Consul General]] to that city. Here he met with the young art critic [[José Gómez-Sicre]], whom he had encountered previously in Santo Domingo. Later they would renew their friendship in [[Washington, D.C.]], where Gómez-Sicre was the founder and director of the [[Art Museum of the Americas]], which was established in 1976 by the O.A.S. Permanent Council. While in Havana, Suro also met and befriended important modern artists such as [[Fidelio Ponce]], [[Carlos Enríquez]] and [[Amelia Peláez]].

Finally arriving in Mexico after their fascinating Cuban "sejour", Suro had a very busy schedule. In addition to his duties as attaché, he enrolled at [[Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado "La Esmeralda"]], where he studied art for nearly four years with some of the most prestigious artists in contemporary Mexico, including [[Diego Rivera]], [[Agustín Lazo]], [[Jesús Guerrero Galván]] and [[Manuel Rodríguez Lozano]].

Suro soon befriended some of the most prominent people in Mexico City, which was a great cultural center at the time, including the [[philosopher]] [[Alfonso Reyes]], the [[art historian]] and critic Justino Fernández, painters [[María Izquierdo (artist)|María Izquierdo]] and [[Angelina Beloff]] (the first wife of Rivera), and writer and critic Agustín Velázquez Chávez. He also met [[José Clemente Orozco]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Lupe Marin]] and [[José Vasconcelos]], who would play a crucial role in Suro's career. In 1944, he received word that he had won the Second Prize (Silver Medal) at the Second National Fine Arts Biennial in Santo Domingo. Two years later he won First Prize (Gold Medal) at the Third National Fine Arts Biennial.

===Impact on work===
Suro's time in Mexico had a dramatic impact on his work. Moving away from a harmonious palette and depictions of pleasant, often melancholy, genre scenes that made him popular with his countrymen, he opted for something more bold and jarring. Influenced by the Mexican nationalistic spirit that embraced all things ethnic, Suro created a related Dominican vision heretofore unseen, a new kind of painting called "Negroide", which had its counterpart in Dominican literature of the time, namely in the poetry of his brother Rubén Suro ("Poemas De Una Sola Intencion"). Directly addressing multiracial issues (an obvious component of Dominican reality) through graphic images, was indeed a new approach in a nation where whitewashing was often the norm. Many Dominicans liked to think that their heritage derived exclusively from Spain, forgetting their important African legacy. Suro's take was confrontational and challenging, using imagery that made some of his countrymen uncomfortable.

In 1946, he was included in a group show at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City. The following year, he had a solo exhibition at the institution, an event that was widely publicized in the city, bringing him recognition from some of the most important art critics{{spaced ndash}} but perhaps leading to his downfall with his own government. His embassy job was suddenly terminated. Before he knew it, he was on a plane with his family going back home where he would be facing an uncertain future. Suro was told by unofficial sources that Dominican Republic [[dictator]] [[Rafael Trujillo]] was not happy with the attention his cultural attaché had received in Mexico.

==Dominican Republic==
Upon his return to Santo Domingo, Suro and his wife were warmly greeted by family and friends, while others, especially some who were close to Trujillo, kept a certain distance. The fall from grace was short lived.

Vasconcelos, his friend from Mexico, who happened to arrive in Santo Domingo on an official visit and raved to Trujillo about the recently repatriated diplomat and painter, calling him "brilliant", and strongly urging the Dominican leader to name Suro Director of Fine Arts of the nation. This happened in early 1947 and once again Suro was celebrated. That same year, he had a successful solo exhibition at the [[National Palace of Fine Arts]] in Santo Domingo, showing works that were shown in Mexico with a few recent Dominican additions. Overall, Dominicans were greatly impressed by a new dynamic vision of their nation forged in Mexico by a young Dominican.

===Director of Fine Arts===
As Director of Fine Arts, Suro was once again in the spotlight, receiving distinguished guests, including [[Alicia Markova]] and [[Anton Dolin]] and groups like the celebrated "Coros y Danzas" from Spain. He was responsible for overseeing new exhibitions at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and setting up cultural programs. He also gave lectures covering a wide range of themes, like the one on his friend José Clemente Orozco, "La Muerte de Orozco", which he gave at the Instituto Dominico Americano in Santo Domingo. In 1948, he participated in the 4th National Biennial of Fine Arts.

===Personal issues===
During this same period, the Suro family underwent dramatic, painful changes. His son, Jaime, died suddenly shortly before his second birthday. This event became an obsessive recurring [[leitmotif]] in several of his paintings. Depicting the dead child becomes a kind of [[catharsis]] in those canvases; the native [[Baquiní]] ritual of burying children becomes an important point of identity for the artist. In 1948, his son Federico was born and the following year his daughter Rosa.

==Spain==
In 1950, Suro's life changed once again when he was sent to Spain as cultural attaché of the Dominican Republic. Arriving with his family in [[Madrid]], Suro befriended some of the most outstanding Spanish artists of that time, including [[Antonio Saura]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Manolo Millares]], and [[Jose Caballero]] ("Pepe"). Caballero was a close friend of [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Pablo Neruda]], [[Luis Buñuel]] and others. Suro was also able to see the great art of Spain, including works by his personal favorites [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[El Greco]] and [[Goya]].

Living in Spain also facilitated extensive travel to other European cities, including Paris, London and Amsterdam. He especially loved Italy, and was particularly impressed by the works of [[Piero della Francesca]].

Combining diplomacy and art as he had in Mexico, Suro participated in group exhibitions in Madrid and Barcelona, as well as faraway places like San Francisco ([[California Palace of the Legion of Honor|Legion of Honor]]) and Pittsburgh ([[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]]). He was invited to participate in the [[Salón de los Once]] in 1951, along with ten other artists, a venue organized by the philosopher [[Eugeni d'Ors]]. The same year, he participated in the First Hispano-American Biennial, which was exhibited in Madrid and Barcelona. He represented the Dominican Republic in several important congresses (including the [[Congreso de la Cooperacion Intellectual Latino Americano—1952]]) while continuing his travels throughout the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and several other European nations.

In terms of his artistic development, Spain had a significant impact. This is where Suro painted his first abstract canvases, influenced by European trends.

==Dominican Republic==
As in Mexico, his busy professional life came to an abrupt end. His job was suddenly terminated, without any explanation. Upon arrival in Santo Domingo the same scenario was repeated that they experienced upon their return from Mexico. The Suros heard gossip about the termination of his job and a close friend, who happened to be related to Trujillo's wife, recommended that they leave the country. Leaving the country in that era was not simple. Both Dario and Maruxa were interrogated, but in a fairly short time they were on their way to New York City in 1953. Their children joined them the following year.

==New York City==
Suro's New York City experience would be decidedly different from his Mexico City and Madrid years. With limited English, the couple had a difficult time adjusting to the metropolis. His wife immediately found work as a seamstress in a factory. Suro, however had a harder time. Visiting several establishments that hired artists to do fairly routine work, he soon realized that there was little demand. He finally found a job on [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], in a factory where artists painted [[porcelain]], screens and other objects. They were given models to work from, with a limited freedom of artistic expression.

Nevertheless, Suro explored the New York City art scene. He started contacting dealers and gallery owners, including [[Rose Fried]], [[Betty Parsons]] and [[Leo Castelli]].

As an art critic, Suro wrote the first in-depth critical articles on both [[Piet Mondrian]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] in the Spanish language. He reintroduced the work of [[Joaquín Torres García]] to the artists within the [[Rose Fried Gallery]] circle, where he was asked to write the text of an accompanying monograph for Torres Garcia's 1960 breakthrough exhibition.

Among the artists befriended by Suro in New York City were [[Fritz Glarner]], [[Ronnie Elliott]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Adolf Fleischmann]], [[Minna Citron]], [[Bud Hopkins]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Charmion von Wiegand]], [[John Grillo]], [[Jean Xceron]], [[Judith Rothschild]], [[Lil Picard]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Raymond Hendler]], [[John Hultberg]] and [[Lynne Drexler]].

In spite of his busy schedule, working in the factory and painting at home, he wrote for many international publications, including the Paris-based ''[[Aujourd'hui]]'' and the Madrid-based ''[[Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos]]'', and he was a frequent contributor at ''[[El Caribe]]'' and other newspapers in the Dominican Republic.

Through his job, he met [[Herman Somberg]], one of his coworkers who was a quintessential New Yorker and a talented artist who happened to be a close friend of [[Franz Kline]]. After a certain reluctance, the latter finally agreed to meet Suro and the two became fast friends (later Suro reminisced about the encounter and ensuing friendship in an article written for ''Americas Magazine'' "Franz Kline{{spaced ndash}} Freedom and Space" in 1969). He frequented the [[Cedar Tavern]] in Manhattan, which he later called "one of the great universities of my life" and the place where he drank seriously along with his growing number of acquaintances. Another special friend was [[Philip Guston]], who was fluent in Spanish.

===Neo-Plasticist world===
Many of the friends that he met early on through Fried were part of the [[Neo-Plasticist]] world. [[Fritz Glarner]] had been a close friend of Mondrian, a kindred spirit and the man who photographically documented Mondrian's New York City studio. One of Suro's most intriguing friends was the German Dadaist poet, writer and drummer [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] who was also a psychiatrist who went by the name Charles R. Hulbeck. As in Mexico and Spain, Suro changed his style once again, expressing himself through geometric abstract images and eventually going on to works that were decidedly informal and expressionistic.

===Group shows===
He participated in group shows at the Rose Fried Gallery, including the International Collage Exhibition in 1956. [[Barbara Guest]], covering this show for ''Arts Magazine'', observed, "Suro has carried the Dada idea along, with a frank assemblage of numbers which would have delighted le grand maitre Picabia". Suro also participated in many group shows, including the  "International Avant Garde Perspectives" at the [[Newport Art Association]] in 1959.

He finally had a solo exhibition at the [[Poindexter Gallery]], in Manhattan, in 1962. The new paintings were both a reflection of his American experience, as well as his lifelong obsession with Spain{{spaced ndash}} several paintings were entitled "Tauromaquia", Suro's homage to Goya. Unfortunately, the exhibition coincided with a major newspaper strike and Suro did not receive a normal press coverage. [[John Gruen]], in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', among the few periodicals that covered the event, wrote: "A Dominican artist who has shown extensively in Europe but not previously here offers oils and collages in intensely muted colors flavored with textual elements reminiscent of the Spanish concern with the "earth". They are strong, bold and terse". Suro received a congratulatory letter from his old friend [[Vela Zanetti]], who visited the exhibition and was both impressed and surprised by the new paintings. The art magazines had overall positive comments as well.

==Washington==
In 1961, events in his homeland once again changed his life. Trujillo was assassinated. [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]], Suro's childhood friend, was elected [[President of the Dominican Republic]] in 1962 and named Suro the cultural attaché at the [[Embassy of the Dominican Republic in Washington, D.C.]], as well as the Organization of American States (OAS). Suro remained in these posts for most of the rest of his life. Washington did not offer the same artistic stimulus as New York City, but his new job was more comfortable and better-paying.

Suro continued painting and exhibiting worldwide into his old age. His painting went through new phases, constantly changing. In his last decade, he revisited old themes, often combining them and coming up with something new in the process. He also continued writing, frequently contributing to ''Americas Magazine'', several Dominican Republic publications, including ''Ahora'' and ''Listin Diario'', as well as international ones, including ''[[Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos]]'' and ''[[Acento Cultural]]''. He was promoted from cultural attaché to Counselor (1965) to [[Minister-counselor|Minister Counselor]] (1967) to [[Minister Plenipotentiary]], [[Deputy Chief of Mission]] (1970) and finally Adjunct Ambassador, Alternate Representative (1980).

In October 1996, he returned to the Dominican Republic with his wife. He was hoping to concentrate on his art, developing new ideas for paintings inspired by shadows; however, he died the following January. His funeral was attended by many friends, as well as Dominican dignitaries; three former Dominican presidents were present{{spaced ndash}} [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]], [[Donald Reid Cabral]] and [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]]{{spaced ndash}} who told the Suro family "Dario Suro was not only a great artist, he was a great Dominican".

==Recognition==
Suro was the first artist to receive "El Premio Nacional de Artes Plasicas" of the Dominican Republic in 1993, which was presented to him by President [[Joaquín Balaguer]]. The "Orden de Duarte, Sanchez y Mella" medal was presented posthumously to his widow by President [[Leonel Fernández]] in 1999.

A comprehensive retrospective, "Dario Suro 1917&amp;ndash;1997: Metamorfosis y Transmigracones", was organized at the Centro Cultural de Espana in Santo Domingo, curated by Ricardo Ramon Jarnes, Laura Gil and Marianne de Tolentino in 2001. The 4th Caribbean Biennial (2002), dedicated to Suro, was organized by Sara Herman, Director of the National Gallery of Modern Art of the Dominican Republic; Ricardo Ramon Jarnes and Laura Gil curated an accompanying retrospective exhibition. President [[Hipólito Mejía]] and Vice President Milagro Ortiz Bosch opened this biennial.

===Self-assessment===
In 1981, Suro assessed his approach to art in the following manner: "I have always been motivated by the existential condition of an object and not by the development of a style." More recently, art historian and critic Alejandro Anreus, who often wrote about Suro, offered a more complete summary of his multifaceted career as follows. "Stylistically, Suro transformed the social realism of the Mexican muralists into a neo-realist aesthetic charged with an existential view of tragedy. By the 1950s he had already painted in a kind of pre-Pop Art when he completed his numeric series, and in the 1960s his abstract expressionist phase was a highly original one where the stain, more than the gesture, was his proffered mark-making strategy, while his palette was evocative of 17th century Spanish painting. His erotic period (1970s) culminated in an obsessive calligraphic use of thin, transparent layers of paint, where lines constructed the female sexual forms as pulsating, fully empowered entities with a life of their own. His body of work before his death was a fierce expressionism, where both the human and landscape forms were torn and reconstructed."

'''False Folio''' is the term that [[Shakespeare]] scholars and [[bibliography|bibliographers]] have applied to [[William Jaggard]]'s printing of ten Shakespearean and [[Shakespeare Apocrypha|pseudo-Shakespearean]] plays together in 1619, the first attempt to collect Shakespeare's work in a single volume. There are only two complete extant copies. One is part of the collection of the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowery|first1=J. Franklin|title=The Bindings of Edward Gwynn in the Folger Library|date=2011|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is part of [http://library.tcu.edu/spcoll/ Special Collections] at [http://www.tcu.edu Texas Christian University] in Fort Worth, Texas.

The term "false folio" intentionally evokes the folio collections of Shakespeare's works that appeared later: the [[First Folio]] of 1623 and its three seventeenth-century successors. The description "[[Folio (printing)|folio]]" is not strictly accurate, since the ten plays were printed in a larger-than-usual [[quarto]] format, not in folio; but the key qualifier is ''false'' folio. The texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by [[Alfred W. Pollard]], [[Walter Wilson Greg|W. W. Greg]], and William J. Neidig. Pollard provides a detailed account in his ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos''.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Pollard, ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos: A Study in the Bibliography of Shakespeare's Plays 1594–1685,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1909; pp. 81–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the stationer and printer William Jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619, either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice.  Jaggard, however, did not have clear title to all of the plays involved [see: [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]]; [[Stationers' Register]]], and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos. The ten plays were:

*''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' – "printed for T. P. 1608" on the title page. False date. [[Thomas Pavier]] was the stationer who possessed the rights to ''Henry V'', and was an associate of Jaggard.
*''[[King Lear]]'' – "Printed for [[Nathaniel Butter]] 1608." False date and name. Butter had printed Q1 of ''Lear'' in 1608.
*''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' – "Printed by J. Roberts, 1600." False date and name. This was one play to which Jaggard did not have valid title; it belonged to stationer Laurence Hayes.
*''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' – "Printed for Arthur Johnson, 1619." False date and name. Johnson published Q1 of ''Merry Wives'' in 1602.
*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' – "Printed by James Roberts, 1600." False date and name.
*''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' – "Printed for T. P. 1619", date "corrected" to 1609 in second state.
*''[[Sir John Oldcastle]]'' – "printed for T. P. 1600". False date.
*''[[A Yorkshire Tragedy]]'' – "Printed for T. P. 1619."
*''The Whole Contention Between the Two Famous Houses, Lancaster and York'' – "Printed at London, for T. P." This was the major innovation of the collection: Jaggard joined together two previously separate texts, ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (the early version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]],'' published by [[Thomas Millington (publisher)|Thomas Millington]] in 1594 and 1600), and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (the early version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' published by Millington in 1595 and 1600). In 1602, Pavier had acquired the rights to both plays from Millington.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 161, 216–17, 249–50, 317–18, 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pericles'' was printed after ''The Whole Contention'', since their [[signature mark|signatures]] (the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence) run together; but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order. (The few existing collections vary.)

As Jaggard lacked rights to Hayes' ''Merchant of Venice'', he may also have lacked rights to Butter's ''Lear'' and Johnson's ''Merry Wives''. There is much about the False Folio affair that remains unclear, such as subjective questions of Jaggard's motivation. Jaggard had a previous odd connection with the Shakespeare canon: he had printed the questionable miscellany ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' as Shakespeare's in 1599 and 1612. Some Shakespeare scholars have wondered why the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] used Jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the First Folio, just a couple of years after the False Folio affair. (Work on the First Folio began almost certainly in 1621.) It may have been a case of necessity, since Jaggard had a large-capacity print shop. (He had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays.) Pavier's role in the matter is also debated; his initials occur on five of the nine volumes (six of the ten plays), and some contemporary commentators see Pavier's role as more significant than Jaggard's – referring to the books as the "Pavier quartos" instead of the "False Folio."&lt;ref&gt;Peter M. Blayney, "Compositor B and the Pavier Quartos," ''The Library,'' 5th series, Vol. 27 issue 3, pp. 179–206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William S. Kable, ''The Pavier Quartos and the First Folio of Shakespeare,'' Dubuque, IA, W. C. Brown Co., 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary "piracy,"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred W. Pollard, ''Shakespeare's Fight with the Pirates and the Problems of the Transmission of His Text,'' London, A. Moring, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the False Folio during the twentieth century. By the start of the twenty-first century, some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved, a view that no longer casts Jaggard and Pavier as the villains in a moral contest.&lt;ref&gt;Sonia Massai, ''Shakespeare and the Rise of the Editor,'' Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French Colonial''' is a style of architecture used by the [[French colonial empire|French during colonization]]. Many former French colonies, especially those in Southeast Asia, have previously been reluctant to promote their colonial architecture as an asset for tourism; however, in recent times, the new generation of local authorities has somewhat "embraced" the architecture and advertise it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eng.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/abouthcmcity/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?CategoryId=10&amp;ItemID=5440&amp;PublishedDate=2005-03-13T11:19:09Z/&lt;/ref&gt; French Colonial architecture has a long history, beginning in North America in 1604 and being most active in the Western Hemisphere (Caribbean, Guiana, Canada, Louisiana) until the 19th century, when the French turned their attention more to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mqup.ca/architecture-and-urbanism-in-the-french-atlantic-empire-products-9780773553149.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
[[French colonization of the Americas|French settlements in Canada]] date back to the mid-16th century and until the annexion of Quebec by the British Crown after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], [[New France|French Canada]] alongside with Louisiana, was immensely prosperous. Hence the abundant architectural legacy from that period particularly in [[Quebec City]] but also in [[Montreal]]. Most buildings constructed during the French colonial period utilized a heavy timber frame of logs installed vertically on a sill, ''[[poteaux-sur-sol]]'', or into the earth, ''[[Post in ground|poteaux-en-terre]]''.  An infill of lime mortar or clay mixed with small stones ([[pierrotage]]) or a mixture of mud, moss, and animal hair ([[bousillage]]) was used to pack between the logs.  Many times the infill would later be replaced with [[brick]].  This method of construction was used in the [[Illinois Country]] as well as Louisiana. General characteristics of a French Colonial dwelling included a raised [[basement]] which would support the floor of the home's primary living quarters.  Exterior stairs were another common element; the stairs would often climb up to a distinctive, full-length [[veranda]] or "gallery," on a home's [[façade]]. The roof over the veranda was normally part of the overall roof. French Colonial roofs were either a steep [[Hip roof|hipped roof]], with a [[dormer]] or dormers, or a side-gabled roof.  The veranda or gallery was often accessed via [[French doors]].  French Colonial homes in the [[Southern United States|American South]] commonly had [[stucco]]ed exterior walls.&lt;ref name=bigolin&gt;Bigolin, Steve.

==In the United States==
French Colonial was one of four domestic architectural styles that developed during the colonial period in what would become the [[United States]]. The other styles were [[Colonial Georgian]], [[Dutch Colonial]], and [[Spanish Colonial]].  French Colonial developed in the settlements of the [[Illinois Country]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]].  It is believed to have been primarily influenced by the building styles of [[French Canada]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Robert ''Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930'', page 180. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8173-1134-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had its beginnings in 1699 with the establishment of French Louisiana but continued to be built after [[Spain]] assumed control of the colonial territory in 1763. Styles of building that evolved during the French colonial period include the [[Creole cottage]], [[Buildings and architecture of New Orleans#Creole townhouse|Creole townhouse]], and [[Louisiana Creole people|French Creole]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/louisiana/architecture.htm |title=French Creole Architecture |accessdate=2008-08-02 |work=Louisiana Division of Historic Preservation |publisher=National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Southeast Asia==
There are some colonial buildings as France's legacy in the area, dating back to the 19th and 20th [[French Indochina]] colony. Most of them are located in [[Hanoi]], [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and [[Phnom Penh]]. Saigon (present-day Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi, as the capitals of Indochina, respectively, in 1887–1902 and 1902-1945, present the most exceptional and among the best-preserved French Colonial buildings in the region, including:

[[Image:Lamgods closed.jpg|thumb|340px|Closed view, back panels]]

The '''''Ghent Altarpiece''''' (or the '''''Adoration of the Mystic Lamb''''', {{lang-nl|'''Het Lam Gods'''}}) is a very large and complex 15th-century [[polyptych]] [[altarpiece]] in [[St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent]], Belgium. It is attributed to the brothers [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]] and [[Jan van Eyck]], who were [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Flemish]] painters. It is considered a masterpiece of European art and one of the world's treasures.

The panels are organised in two vertical [[Register (art)|registers]], each with double sets of foldable wings containing inner and outer panel paintings. The upper register of the inner panels  form the central [[Deësis]] of [[Jesus|Christ the King]], [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] and John the Baptist. They are immediately flanked in the next panels by angels playing music and, on the far outermost panels, the naked figures of [[Adam and Eve]]. The four lower-register panels are divided into two pairs; sculptural [[grisaille]] paintings of St John the Baptist and St [[John the Evangelist]], and on the two outer panels, [[donor portraits]] of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut. The central panel of the lower register shows a gathering of saints, sinners, clergy and soldiers attendant at an adoration of the [[Lamb of God]]. There are several groupings of figures, overseen by the dove of the [[Holy Spirit]].{{efn-ua|Eight of its twelve panel painting are doubled hinged shutters, allowing two distinct views depending on whether they are opened or closed; except for Sundays and festive holidays, the outer wings were closed off and covered with cloth. The outer panels contain two vertically stacked registers (rows).}} The altarpiece is one of the most renowned and important artworks in European history.

Art historians generally agree that the overall structure was designed by Hubert during or before the mid 1420s, and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan between 1430 and 1432. However while generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passage to either brother, no convincing separation has been established.&lt;ref name="Burroughs 1933, 184"&gt;Burroughs (1933), 184&lt;/ref&gt; The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant and [[Ghent]] mayor Jodocus Vijd and his wife Lysbette as part of a larger project for the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] chapel. The altarpiece's installation was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432. It was much later moved for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains. While indebted to the [[International Gothic]] as well as [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Roman art|Romanic]] traditions, the altarpiece represented a huge advancement in art, in which the idealisation of the [[medieval art|medieval]] tradition gave way to an exacting observation of nature&lt;ref name="Gombrich, E.H. pages 236"&gt;Gombrich, E.H., ''The Story of Art'', pages 236–9. Phaidon, 1995. {{ISBN|0-7148-3355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human representation. A now lost inscription on the frame stated that Hubert van Eyck ''maior quo nemo repertus'' (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck—calling himself ''arte secundus'' (second best in the art)—completed it in 1432.&lt;ref name="Burroughs, 184–193"&gt;Burroughs, 184–193&lt;/ref&gt; The original, very ornate carved outer frame and surround, presumably harmonizing with the painted [[tracery]], was destroyed during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; it may have included clockwork mechanisms for moving the shutters and even playing music.

The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant Jodocus Vijd, then Mayor of [[Ghent]],  and his wife Lysbette as part of a larger project for the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] chapel. The installation of the altarpiece was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432. It was much later moved for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains.

Art historians generally agree that the overall structure was designed by Hubert in the early to mid 1420s, and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan between 1430 and 1432. It is one of the most renowned and important paintings in art history, and generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passages to either brother, but no convincing separation of their contributions has been established.&lt;ref name="Burroughs 1933, 184"/&gt; A now lost inscription on the frame stated that Hubert van Eyck ''maior quo nemo repertus'' (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck—calling himself ''arte secundus'' (second best in the art)—completed it in 1432.&lt;ref name="Burroughs, 184–193"/&gt; The original, very ornate carved outer frame and surround, presumably harmonizing with the painted [[tracery]], was destroyed during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]; it may have included clockwork mechanisms for moving the shutters and even playing music.

While it is indebted to the [[International Gothic]] as well as [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Roman art|Romanic]] traditions, the altarpiece represents a huge advance in art, in which the idealisation of the [[medieval art|medieval]] tradition gives way to an exacting observation of nature&lt;ref name="Gombrich, E.H. pages 236"/&gt; and human representation.

Attribution to the van Eyck brothers is supported by the small amount of surviving documentary evidence attached to the commission, and from Jan's signature and dating on a reverse frame. Jan seems to minimize his contribution in favor of his brother, who died six years before the work's completion in 1432. A less explicit indicator is their seeming portraits as the third and fourth horseman in the [[The Just Judges|Just Judges panel]]. Ramsay Homa notes lettering in the central panel of the lower register that might be read as an early formation of what was to become van Eyck's well known signature, built around various formations of &lt;small&gt;"ALS IK KAN" (''As I Can''&lt;/small&gt;), a pun on his full name; and lettering is found on the headdress of one of the prophets standing at the back of the grouping. It is written in Hebrew script that roughly translates into French as ''Le chapeau&amp;nbsp;... orne de trois lettres herbraiques formant le mot Saboth'', or more likely as "Yod, Feh, Aleph", which when transliterated represents Jan's initials, JvE.&lt;ref&gt;Homa (1974), 327&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 19th century, art historians have debated which passages are attributable to the little-known and obscure Hubert and which are by Jan, famous across Europe by the early 1430s. In the 17th and 18th centuries, it was often assumed that Jan had found a number of random panels left behind after Hubert's death and assembled them into the current format. This view has been discounted since the early 19th century, on the basis of the obvious overall design of the work, although there are obvious stylistic differences between many passages.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 214&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally accepted that the majority were completed by Jan, from an overall design by Hubert, who probably oversaw the construction of most of the frames. A number of difficulties present themselves, not least that there is no surviving work confidently attributed to Hubert, and it is thus impossible to detect his style. Instead, art historians have resorted to comparing individual passages to known works by Jan, looking for stylistic differences that might indicate the work of another hand. Advances in [[Dendrochronology]] have for example established that parts of the wing panels were felled around 1421. Allowing a seasoning time of at least 10 years, we must assume a completion date well after Hubert's death in 1426, thus ruling out his hand from large portions of the wings.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and technique==
[[File:Anyell místic-central-CatedralUtrecht.jpg|thumb|left|320px|View of [[Utrecht Cathedral]] from the central inner panel]]
The polyptych differs in a number of aspects to the other paintings attributed to Jan van Eyck, not least in scale. It is the only of his works intended for public, rather than private, worship and display.&lt;ref name="hplay194"&gt;Harbison (Reaktion), 194&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck pays as much attention to the beauty of earthly things as to the religious themes. The clothes and jewels, the fountain, nature surrounding the scene, the churches and landscape in the background – are all painted with remarkable detail. The landscape is rich with vegetation, which is observed with an almost scientific accuracy, and much of it non-European.&lt;ref name="Pächt"&gt;Pächt&lt;/ref&gt;

Lighting is one of the major innovations of the polyptych. The panels contain complex light effects and subtle plays of shadow, the rendering of which was achieved through new techniques of handling both oil paint and transparent glazes. The figures are mostly cast with short, diagonal shadows which serve to, in the words of art historian Till-Holger Borchert, "not only heighten their spatial presence, but also tell us that the primary light source is located beyond the picture itself."&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Annunciation'' scene, shadows imply that they emanate from the daylight within the chapel in which they are housed.&lt;ref name="h81"&gt;Harbison (1995), 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Further innovations can be found in the detailing of surface textures, especially in the reflections and refractions. This is best seen in the fall of light on the armor in the ''Knights of Christ'' panel, and the ripple of the water in the [[Fountain of Life|Fountain of life]] in the ''Adoration of the Mystic Lamb''.&lt;ref name="b24"&gt;Borchert (2011), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Yet although the work contains many individual innovations, it did not emerge spontaneously, but is rather part of a long tradition of oil painting and altarpiece design of the southern Netherlands. A great number of these works were destroyed during the iconoclasm of the mid 16th century, a period in which the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' was twice nearly destroyed; on 19 August 1566, and again in 1576 when a special guard was put on the work to protect it from rioters.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of destruction in these waves was such that the Ghent historian Marcus Van Vaenewijk (1516–69) recorded that in the summer of 1566 the burning pyres on which the works were thrown could be seen from 10 miles away. Because of this, art historian [[Susie Nash]] points out that the Ghent work seems so unusual in part because it was one of the few major examples to survive wholly intact.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Several of the painting's wings were bought in 1816 by the English collector in Berlin, [[Edward Solly]].&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"&gt;Kurtz (2004), 24&lt;/ref&gt; They were bought in 1821 by the King of Prussia, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and continued to be kept in Germany.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt; During [[World War I]], other panels were taken from the cathedral by Germany. As part of mandated compensation in the [[Versailles Treaty]] after the end of the war, Germany returned the pilfered panels along with the original panels that had been legitimately bought by Solly, to help compensate for other German "acts of destruction" during the war.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt;
The Germans "bitterly resented the loss of the panels", and at the start of another conflict in 1940, a decision was made in Belgium to send the painting to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to keep it safe.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt; The painting was ''en route'' to the Vatican, in [[France]], when [[Italy]] declared war as an [[Axis powers|Axis power]] alongside Germany. The painting was stored in a museum in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] for the duration of the war, as French, Belgian and German military representatives signed an agreement which required the consent of all three before the masterpiece could be moved.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt; In 1942, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the painting to be seized and brought to Germany to be stored in a [[Bavaria]]n castle. After Allied air raids made the castle too dangerous for the painting, it was stored in a [[salt]] mine.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband2"&gt;{{cite book

The panels were threatened during outbreaks of [[iconoclasm]], and have suffered fire damage. During different wars, some panels were sold and others looted. A number were captured by the German occupying forces during [[World War I]], but were later returned to St. Bavo's Cathedral. In 1934 two panels, [[The Just Judges]] and Saint John the Baptist, were stolen. The "Saint John the Baptist" panel was returned soon after, but "The Just Judges" panel is still missing. [[Albert Camus]] in [[The Fall (Camus novel)|The Fall]] imagines it is kept by the protagonist, Clamence, in his Amsterdam apartment. In 1945, the altarpiece was returned from Germany after spending much of [[World War II]] hidden in a salt mine, which greatly damaged the paint and varnish. The Belgian art restorer [[Jef Vanderveken|Jef Van der Veken]] produced a copy of 'The Just Judges', as part of an overall restoration effort.

==Open view==
The altarpiece was opened on feast days, when the richness, colour and complexity of inner view was intended to contrast with the relative austerity of the outer panels. As viewed when open, the panels are organised along two registers (levels), and contain depictions of hundreds of figures.&lt;ref name="hplay194" /&gt; The upper level consists of seven monumental panels,&lt;!-- is each a separate panel, or are there 7 paintings on one panel and the four wing shutters? --&gt; each almost six feet high, and includes a large central image of Christ flanked by frames showing Mary (left) and John the Baptist (right), which contain over twenty inscriptions each referring to the figures in the central [[Deësis]] panels.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 836&lt;/ref&gt;

These panels are flanked by two pairs of images on the folding wings. The two panel closest to the Deësis show singers in heaven; the outermost pair show Adam and Eve, naked save for strategically placed fig leaves.&lt;ref name="p124"&gt;Pächt (1999), 124&lt;/ref&gt; The lower register has a panoramic landscape stretching continuously across five panels. While the individual panels of the upper tier clearly contain separate—albeit paired—pictorial spaces, the lower tier is presented as a unified ''[[Mise en scène]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 19&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 12 panels, eight have paintings on their reverse visible when the altarpiece is closed.

===Upper register===

====Deësis====
The three central upper panels show a [[Deesis|Deësis]] of monumental and enthroned figures, each with a halo. They are the Virgin Mary to the left, [[John the Baptist]] to the right, and a central figure who may be either God or Christ – a distinction much debated amongst art historians. Theories include that the panel shows [[Christ in Majesty]] dressed as in a priest's vestments,&lt;ref&gt;Lane (1984), 109&lt;/ref&gt; [[God the Father]], or the [[Holy Trinity]] amalgamated into a single person.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanens (1980), 106&lt;/ref&gt; The figure looks towards the viewer with his hand raised in blessing, in a panel filled with inscriptions and symbols. There are Greek inscriptions decorated with pearls on the hem of his robe or [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]], which, taken from [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], read &lt;small&gt;''REX REGUM ET DOMINUS DOMINANTIUM''&lt;/small&gt; ("King of Kings, and Lord of Lords").&lt;ref name="p124" /&gt;

The golden [[brocade]] on the throne features pelicans and [[vine]], probable references to the blood spilled during the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. Pelicans were at the time believed to spill their own blood to feed their young. The vines allude to [[sacramental wine]], the [[eucharist]]ic symbol of Christ's blood.&lt;ref&gt;Charney (2010), 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The crown is at his feet, and on either side the step is lined with two levels of text. The left hand upper line reads &lt;small&gt;''VITA SINE MORTE IN CAPITE''&lt;/small&gt; ("Life without death on his head"), that on the right &lt;small&gt;''IUVENTUS SINE SENECTUTE IN FRONTE''&lt;/small&gt; ("Youth without age on his forehead"). These are placed above—on the left and right respectively—the words &lt;small&gt;''GAUDIUM SINE MERORE A DEXTRIS''&lt;/small&gt; ("Joy without sorrow on his right side") and &lt;small&gt;''SECURITAS SINE TIMORE A SINISTRIS''&lt;/small&gt; ("Safety without fear on his left side").&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et all. (2004), 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="p129"&gt;Pächt (1994), 129-130&lt;/ref&gt;

To the left Mary reads from a [[girdle book]] draped with a green cloth. The book is an unusual [[emblem|attribute]] for Mary, and might be based the figure on [[Robert Campin]]'s ''Virgin Annunciate''.&lt;ref name="p129"/&gt; She wears a crown adorned with flowers and stars, and is dressed as a bride. The inscription on the arched throne above reads: "She is more beautiful than the sun and the army of the stars; compared to the light she is superior. She is truly the reflection of eternal light and a spotless mirror of God".&lt;!--can we get the actual inscription here--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dhanens (1980), 106-108&lt;/ref&gt; Like Mary, John the Baptist holds a holy book – likewise an unusual attribute, and one of 18 books in the set of panels.&lt;ref name= "Dhanens108ff"/&gt; He wears a green mantle over a [[cilice]] of camel-hair. He looks towards the Almighty in the center panel, with his hand also raised in blessing, uttering the words most typically associated with him, &lt;small&gt;''ECCE AGNUS DEI''&lt;/small&gt; ("Behold the Lamb of God").&lt;ref name="p124" /&gt;

It is often assumed that given the [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortening]] seen in the representation of God the Father, the artist was familiar with the either of the Italian painters [[Donatello]] or [[Masaccio]]. Susie Nash believes van Eyck was already leading toward this development, and it was something he was "perfectly capable of producing without such models", and believes the technique represents "a shared interest [rather than] a case of influence."&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

====Musical angels====

The two musical panels are commonly known by variants of the titles ''Singing Angels'' and ''Music-making Angels'', and are both 161&amp;nbsp;cm x 69.3&amp;nbsp;cm. Each features a choir; on the left angels gather behind a wooden carved music stand positioned on a swivel, to the right a group with stringed instruments gather around a pipe organ, played by a seated angel, shown full-length. The presence of the two groups on either side of the Deësis reflects a by then well-established motif in representations of the heavens opening; that of musical accompaniment provided by celestial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt (1999), 124, 151-152&lt;/ref&gt; As was common in the Low Countries in the 15th century, the angels are dressed in liturgical robes, a custom that migrated from Latin [[liturgical drama]] to the art of the period.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee (1972), 268-274&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Singing Angels (detail) - WGA07642.jpg|thumb|left|340px|Choir of Angels]]
The angels attend the [[King of Kings]], that is, to God the father in the central Deësis panel. Unusually, they lack most of the attributes usually associated with angels depicted in northern art of the time. They do not have wings, and their faces are unidealised, and show a number of different individual expressions. Music historian Stanley Boorman notes that their depiction contains many earthly qualities, writing that "the naturalism is so seductive that the viewer is tempted to consider the scenes as depictions of contemporary church music."&lt;ref name="b30"&gt;Boorman (1983), 30&lt;/ref&gt; Yet he concludes that the inscriptions "reinstalls them in the heavenly sphere".&lt;ref name="b31"&gt;Boorman (1983), 31&lt;/ref&gt; In both panels the angels stand on [[maiolica]] tiles decorated with the [[Holy Name of Jesus|IHS]] Christogram, representations of the lamb and other images.&lt;ref name="b24" /&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Angels Playing Music (detail) - WGA07646.jpg|thumb|200px|String and wind instruments]]
The left hand panel's frame is inscribed with the words &lt;small&gt;''MELOS DEO LAUS''&lt;/small&gt; ("Music in Praise of God"), the frame of to the right with &lt;small&gt;''LAUDATE EUM IN CORDIS ET ORGANO''&lt;/small&gt; ("Praise him with stringed instruments and organs").&lt;ref name="p124" /&gt; A number of art historians have defined the figures as angels based on their positioning and role within the overall context of the registers. They are sexless and possess [[cherub]] faces, which contrast with the realistic depictions of the other full-sized non-divine females in the work; Eve in the same register&lt;ref name="b24" /&gt; and Lysbette Borluut in the outer panels. The angels are dressed in elaborately brocaded ecclesiastical [[cope]]s or [[chasubles]], mostly painted in reds and greens. Their robes indicate that they are intended as representative of the [[Mass (liturgy)|celebration of mass]] before the altar in the lower central panel.

The left-hand group shows eight fair haired angels wearing crowns and gathered in front of a music stand&lt;!--reminder: stand has carvings--&gt; singing, although none of them looks towards the score on the stand. As in a number of the other panels, here van Eyck used the device of the open mouth to give a sense of life and motion to his figures. Borchert writes that the emphasis on the open mouths is "specifically motivated by the desire to characterize the angel's facial expressions according to the various ranges of polyphonic singing. To that end the position of the angel's tongues are carefully registered, as are that of their teeth."&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 31–2, see also Golaqki-Voutrira (1998), 65–74&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Elisabeth Dhanens notes how "One can easily see by their singing who is the soprano, who is the alto, who is the tenor and who is the bass".&lt;ref name = "Dhanens108ff"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 108&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghent Altarpiece B - Angels - detail.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Detail of the lead Angel]]
The figures are positioned in a wave-like order of body height, with the orientation of each of the eight faces in looking in different directions.&lt;!--obviously, but source?--&gt; A number of scholars have remarked on their physiognomy. Their cherub faces and long, open, curly hair are similar but also show a clear intention by the artist to establish individual traits. Four angels are shown frowning, three have narrowed eyelids which give the appearance of peering, a trait also seen in some of the apostles in the "Adoration of the Lamb". Pächt does't see Jan's hand in the rendering of their expressions, and speculates if they are remnants from Hubert's initial design.&lt;ref name="p152"&gt;Pächt (1999), 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In the right-hand panel, the only angel fully visible is the organist around whom the others gather. Although a larger group is suggested, only another four angel's faces can be seen in the closely cropped huddle. These other angels carry stringed instruments, including a small [[harp]] and a type of [[viol]].&lt;ref name = "Dhanens108ff"/&gt; Their instruments are shown in remarkable detail. The organ at which [[Saint Cecilia]] sits is detailed with such precision that in places its metal surfaces show reflections of light.&lt;ref name="b24" /&gt;

Modern musicologists have been able to recreate a working copy of the instrument. Until the [[Trecento]], when the idea of [[orchestration]] was introduced, music playing angels were typically winged, depicted holding stringed or wind instruments as they hovered "on the wing" around on the edges of images of saints and deities.&lt;ref name="p151"&gt;Pächt (1999), 151&lt;/ref&gt; In French [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the first two decades of the 15th century, winged angels often seemingly floated on the margins of the page, as illustrations to the accompanying text.&lt;ref name="p152"/&gt;

====Adam and Eve====

}}

The two outer panels show near life-sized nudes of [[Adam and Eve]] standing in [[niche (architecture)|niches]]. They are the earliest treatment in art of the [[nude (art)|human nude]] with Early Netherlandish naturalism,&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Duby|Duby, George]],''A History of Private Life, Vol 2 Revelations of the Medieval World'', 1988 (English translation), p. 582, Belknap Press, Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; and are almost exactly contemporary with the equally ground-breaking pair in [[Masaccio]]'s ''[[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]'' in [[Florence]] of about 1425. They face inwards towards the angels and the Deësis, separating them. They self-consciously attempt to cover their nakedness with a fig leaf as in the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] account, indicating that they are depicted as after the [[fall of man]]. Eve holds a fruit in her raised right hand; not the traditional apple but a small citrus, most probably a [[citron]]. [[Erwin Panofsky]] drew particular attention to this element, and described it as emblematic of the "disguised" symbolism he saw running through the work as a whole.&lt;ref name="sy511"&gt;Snyder (1976), 511&lt;/ref&gt; Both figures' eyes are downcast and they appear to have forlorn expressions. Their apparent sadness has led many art historians to wonder about van Eyck's intention in this portrayal. Some have questioned if they are ashamed of their committal of original sin, or dismayed at the world they now look upon.&lt;ref name="sy511" /&gt;

The realism with which Jan approached his figures is especially evident in these two panels. The depiction of Eve exemplifies the Late Gothic ideal for the female figure, as developed in International Gothic art around the start of the century, and pioneered in nude form by the [[Limbourg brothers]], especially their Adam and Eve in the ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]''. Comparing the Limbourg's Eve to a classical female nude, [[Kenneth Clark]] observed that "her [[pelvis]] is wider, her chest narrower, her waist higher; above all there is the prominence given to her stomach".&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1972), 310&lt;/ref&gt; Clark describes her as "a proof of how minutely 'realistic' a great artist may be in the rendering of details, and yet subordinate the whole to an ideal form. Hers is the supreme example of the bulb-like body. The weight-bearing leg is concealed, and the body is so contrived that on one side is the long curve of the stomach, on the other downward sweep of the thigh, uninterrupted by any articulation of bone or muscle."&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1972), 311&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eve Ghent van Eyck(A).jpg|thumb|left|240px|Eve holding a citrus fruit]]

The precision and detail with which their nakedness is recorded offended many over the years. During a visit to the cathedral in 1781, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] found them so disagreeable that he demanded they be removed.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen et al., 39&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's nakedness further offended 19th century sensibilities, when their presence in a church came to be considered unacceptable. The panels were replaced by reproductions in which the figures were dressed in skin cloth; these are still on display in the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]]. In comparison to contemporary depictions of Adam and Eve, this version is very spare and omits the usual motifs associated with the theme; there is no serpent, tree or any trace of the [[garden of Eden]] normally found in contemporary paintings.&lt;ref name="sy511" /&gt;

In contrast to the other panels in the register, Adam and Eve are positioned near the edge of each panel, and neither is entirely ''within'' the border of their setting. Adam's foot appears to protrude out of the niche and frame and into real space. More subtly, Eve's arm, shoulder and hip appear to extend beyond her architectural setting. These elements give the panel a three-dimensional aspect. The [[trompe-l'œil]] become more pronounced when the wings are turned slightly inwards,&lt;ref name="b28"&gt;Borchert (2008), 28&lt;/ref&gt; an especially interesting fact when it is considered that the polyptych was wider than the original chapel it was executed for and could never be opened fully.&lt;!--can't remember source--&gt;

Above Adam is a grisaille depiction of Abel making a sacrifice of the first lamb of his flock and Cain presenting part of his crops as a farmer to the Lord. Above Eve is a representation of the murder of [[Cain and Abel|Abel by his brother Cain]] with an ass's jawbone.&lt;ref name="Dhanens108ff" /&gt;

===Lower register===
A continuous panoramic landscape unifies the five panels of the lower register.&lt;ref name="b28" /&gt; The center panel shows the adoration of the [[Lamb of God]] (''Agnus Dei'') in a scene derived from the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref&gt;Charney (2010), 64&lt;/ref&gt; Large cords of people stream towards him in worship; four groupings are shown congregating at each corner of the central panel, another four arrive in the two pairs of outer panels – representing the Warriors of Christ and Just Judges on the left-hand side, and the holy hermits and pilgrims on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 83&lt;/ref&gt; Of the eight groupings only one consists of females. The groupings are segregated by their relationship to the [[Old Testament|old]] and [[New Testament|new]] testaments, with those from the older books positioned to the left of the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen et al. (2003), 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the pilgrims is [[Saint Christopher]], patron saint of travelers.&lt;!-- moved this without the cite --&gt; At the rear of the hermits on the inner right-hand panel is [[Mary Magdalene]], carrying [[unguents]].

====''Adoration of the Mystic Lamb''====
[[File:Retable de l'Agneau mystique (7).jpg|thumb|500px|left|The central ''Adoration of the Mystic Lamb'' panel. The groupings of figures are, from top left anti-clockwise: the male martyrs, the pagan writers and Jewish prophets, the male saints, and the female martyrs.]]

Measuring 134.3 x 237.5&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref name="p212"/&gt; the center panel has as its centerpiece an altar on which the Lamb of God is positioned, standing in a verdant meadow, while the foreground shows a fountain. Five distinct groups of figures surround altar and fountain. In the mid-ground two further groups figures are seen gathering; the dove of the Holy Spirit is above. The meadow is framed by trees and bushes; with the spires of Jerusalem visible in the background. Dhanens says the panel shows "a magnificent display of unequaled color, a rich panorama of late medieval art and the contemporary world-view."&lt;ref name= "D97"/&gt; The iconography, suggested by the groupings of the figures, appears to follow the [[liturgy]] of [[All Saints' Day]].&lt;ref name= "D103" /&gt;

The lamb stands on an altar, and is surrounded by 14 angels arranged in a circle,&lt;ref name="R47"/&gt; some holding symbols of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], and two swing [[censer]]s.&lt;ref name= "D97"/&gt; The lamb{{efn-ua|This portion of the panel was restored following damage suffered in an 1822 fire; however the restoration was not complete and some of the passages were abandoned mid-way. The most startling result of this is that a portion of an underdrawing of the lamb was left exposed, leading to it now appearing to have four ears. See Pächt (1999), 123}} has a wound on its breast from which blood gushes into a golden chalice, yet it shows no outward expression of pain, a reference to Christ's sacrifice. The angels have multicolored wings and hold instruments of [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's passion]], including the cross and the [[crown of thorns]]. The [[antependium]] on the upper portion of the front of the altar is inscribed with the words taken from John 1:29; &lt;small&gt;''ECCE AGNUS DEI QUI TOLLIT PECCATA MUNDI''&lt;/small&gt; ("Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world"). The [[lappet]]s bear the phrases &lt;small&gt;''IHESUS VIA''&lt;/small&gt; ("Jesus the Way") and &lt;small&gt;''VERITAS VITA''&lt;/small&gt; ("the Truth, the Life").&lt;ref name="R47"&gt;Ridderbos at al. (2004), 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghent Adoration detail 4.jpg|thumb|400px|A group of women gathering to worship Christ]]

A dove, representing the Holy Spirit, hovers low in the sky directly above the lamb, surrounded by concentric semicircles of white and yellow hues of varying luminosity, the outermost of which appear like [[nimbus cloud]]s.&lt;!--Reminder: more on this--&gt; Thin golden beams emanating from the dove resemble those surrounding the head of the lamb, as well as those of the three figures in the [[Deësis]] in the upper register. The rays seem to have been painted by van Eyck over the finished landscape, and serve to illuminate the scene in a celestial, supernatural light. This is especially true with the light falling on the saints positioned directly in front of the altar. The light does not give reflection or throw shadow,&lt;ref name="B23"&gt;Borchert (2011), 23&lt;/ref&gt; and has traditionally been read by art historians as representing the [[New Jerusalem]] of [[Book of Revelation|Revelations]] which in 21:23, had "no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God did Lighten it".&lt;ref name="B21"&gt;Borchert (2008), 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination contrasts with the natural and directional lighting of the four upper interior wings, and of each of the outer wings. It has been interpreted as a device to emphasize the presence of the divine and accentuate the paradise of the central landscape.&lt;ref name="B23" /&gt; The dove as the Holy Spirit, and the lamb as Jesus, are positioned on the same axis as that of God The Father in the panel directly above; a reference to the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2004), 53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--There is much more on this for an iconography section at some stage--&gt;

=====Fountain of life=====
[[File:Ghent Altarpiece D - Fountain.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The fountain of life.&lt;ref name= "D97"/&gt;]]
In the center foreground, the [[fountain of life]] consists of a large stream of water, ending with a jewel-laden bed. In the distance, a minutely detailed cityscape recalls [[New Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;Charney (2010), 23&lt;/ref&gt; The detail and close attention to landscape and nature is at a level previously unseen in Northern European art. The numerous recognisable species of plants are minutely depicted with high levels of botanical accuracy. Similarly, the clouds and rock formations in the distance contain degrees of verisimilitude that evince studied observation. The far landscape contains representations of actual churches, while the depiction of the mountains beyond contain the first known example in art of [[aerial perspective]].&lt;ref name="B29"&gt;Borchert (2008), 29&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the panel does not strive for exact realism; the sum of the forensically detailed natural elements, in combination with the apparition of the Holy Spirit and extended beams of light, serve to create a wholly individual and uniquely creative interpretation of a classic biblical scene.&lt;ref name="B23" /&gt;

The inscription on the fountain's rim reads &lt;small&gt;''HIC EST FONS AQUE VITE PROCENDENS DE SEDE DEI + AGNI''&lt;/small&gt; ("This is the fountain of the water of life, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb"), symbolizing the fountain of life is "watered by the blood of the Lamb".&lt;ref name="p124"/&gt; From its center rises a column with an angel above bronze dragons, from which streams of water fall into the fountain's basin. A vertical axis forms between the fountain and altar, where the flowing blood testimony to the spirit as cited in John, 5:97.&lt;ref name= "D97"/&gt; Similar the altar and its ring of angels, the fountain is surrounded by figures arranged in distinct groupings.&lt;ref name = "p126"&gt;Pächt (1999), 126&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Prophets, Apostles, church figures=====
The representation of figures gathering on each side of the fountain are drawn from biblical, pagan and contemporary ecclesiastical sources. Some are crowded around the fountain in what Pächt describes as two "processions of figures [that] have crowded to a halt". To the left are representatives of figures from Judaism and prophets who have foretold the coming of Christ; to the right representatives from the Church.&lt;ref name = "p126"/&gt; The figures directly to the left of the fountain represent witnesses from the Old Testament;&lt;ref name="R47" /&gt; dressed in pink robes, kneeling, reading aloud from open copies of the Bible, facing the mid-ground with backs turned to the viewer.&lt;ref name = "p138"&gt;Pächt (1999), 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ghent Altarpiece D - Popes - detail.jpg|thumb|220px|Three of the figures in the grouping to the right of the fountain can be identified as [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], [[Pope Gregory XII|Gregory VII]] and [[Antipope Alexander V]].&lt;ref name= "D100"/&gt;]]
A larger group of pagan philosophers and writers stand behind them. These men seem have traveled from all over the world, given the Oriental faces of some, and their different styles of headdress. The figure in white, holding a laurel wreath, is generally accepted to be [[Virgil]], who is said to have predicted the coming of the Saviour. [[Isaiah]] stands to his side holding a twig, a symbol of his own prophecy of Christ as recorded in Isaiah 11:1.&lt;ref name="R47" /&gt;

On the right, [[twelve apostles]] from the New Testament kneel before a group of male saints. They are dressed in red vestments symbolizing martyrs; the Popes and other clergy representing the church hierarchy.&lt;ref name= "D97"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 97&lt;/ref&gt; A number are recognizable, including [[Saint Stephen]] who carries the rocks with which he was stoned. Three popes in the foreground represent the [[Western Schism]]—a dispute that festered and lingered in Ghent—and are identifiable as [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]], [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] and [[Antipope Alexander V]]. Dhanens suggest the positioning of popes standing beside antipope shows "an atmosphere of reconciliation".&lt;ref name= "D100"/&gt;

=====Confessors and martyrs=====
The groups of figures in the mid-ground, to the left and right of the altar, are known as the male and female martyrs. Identifiable biblical figures carry palms.&lt;ref name = "p126"/&gt; They enter the pictorial space as though through a path in the foliage, males standing to the left, women to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Dhanens (1980), 100; 103&lt;/ref&gt; The female martyrs, sometimes known as the holy virgins, are gathered by an abundant meadow, a symbol of fertility. A number are identified by their [[emblem|attribute]]s: in front [[Agnes of Rome|St. Agnes]] carries a lamb, [[Saint Barbara|St. Barbara]] a tower, [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]] is finely dressed&lt;!--carrying nothing?--&gt;, and [[Dorothea of Caesarea|St. Dorothy]] carries flowers; further back [[Saint Ursula|St. Ursula]] carries an arrow.&lt;ref name="R47" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "D100"/&gt; The women wear flowered crowns.&lt;ref name= "D103"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 103&lt;/ref&gt; The men on the left include confessors, popes, cardinals, abbots and monks who are dressed in blue.&lt;ref name= "D100"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 100&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Just Judges and the Knights of Christ=====
The wing panels to the left of the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" show groups of approaching knights and judges. Their biblical source can be identified from inscriptions on the panel frames. The far left hand panels contain lettering reading &lt;small&gt;"[[Miles Christianus|CHRISTI MILITES]]"&lt;/small&gt; (''Warriors of Christ''), the inside left panel reads &lt;small&gt;"IUSTI IUDICES"&lt;/small&gt; (''Righteous (or ''Just'') Judges'').&lt;ref name="Pächt" /&gt; The presence of the Judges, none of whom were canonised saints, is an anomaly which art historians have long sought to explain. The most likely explanation is that they refer to Jodocus Vijd's position as a city [[alderman]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2004), 54&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The ''Just Judges'' may contain portraits of Jan and Hubert as the third and fourth Judges on horseback. The evidence based on the similarity of one of the figures to Jan's 1433 ''[[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|Portrait of a Man]]'', now in the [[National Gallery, London]], generally thought to be a self-portrait. The second, closer, figure is thought to be Hubert, because of facial similarity to Jan. Although the judge in the Ghent panel appears to be younger than the sitter in the London painting, they wear similar [[Chaperon (headgear)|chaperons]] with the [[cornette]] tightly bound around the [[bourrelet]].&lt;ref name="c216"&gt;Campbell (1998), 216&lt;/ref&gt; The judges in the Ghent panel became the basis for a number of later portraits of the brothers, including that of [[Dominicus Lampsonius]].&lt;ref name="b93&amp;5"&gt;Bourchert (2008), 93–95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck - The Ghent Altarpiece - Prophet Micheas - WGA07680.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Detail of the prophet [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] in the right [[lunette]]]]

The altarpiece measures 375 x 260&amp;nbsp;cm when the shutters are closed. The upper panels contain [[lunettes]] showing prophets and [[Sibyls]] looking down on the annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors on the far left and right panels flanked by saints.&lt;ref name="p212"&gt;Pächt (1999), 212&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; this is especially true of the faux stone [[grisaille]] statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth;&lt;ref name="b25" /&gt; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer feel as if the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.

[[File:Hubert van Eyck 009.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Detail showing the [[Erythraean Sibyl]]]]

The figures in the lunettes refer to prophecies of the coming of Christ. The far left lunette shows the prophet [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and the far right one shows [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]]. The two much taller inner shutters show the [[Erythraean Sibyl]] (on the left) and the [[Cumaean Sibyl]] on the right. Each panel includes a text inscribed on a floating ribbon or "[[Banderole (speech scroll)|banderole]]", while the identities of the figures are carved on the lower border of each panel. Zechariah's text, taken from Zechariah 9:9, reads &lt;small&gt;''EXAULT SATIS FILIA SYON JUBILA ECCE REX TUUS VENTI''&lt;/small&gt; ("Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion&amp;nbsp;... behold, your king comes"), while the Erythraean Sibyl's words are &lt;small&gt;''NIL MORTALE SONAS AFFLATA ES NUMINE CELSO''&lt;/small&gt; ("Sounding nothing mortal you are inspired by power from on high").&lt;ref name="aeneid"&gt;Virgil, Aeneid, 6:50 "nec mortale sonans, adflata est numine"&lt;/ref&gt; To the right the Cumaean Sibyl's reads &lt;small&gt;''REX ALTISSIMUS ADVENIET PER SECULA FUTURUS SCILICET IN CARNE''&lt;/small&gt; ("The Highest King shall come and shall be in the flesh through the ages").&lt;ref name="r43"&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2004), 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hubert van Eyck 028.jpg|thumb|140px|Detail showing the [[Cumaean Sibyl]]]]
Zechariah and Micah look down on the fulfillment of their prophecies contained in the banderoles floating behind them. The Erythraean Sibyl is shown observing, while the Cumaean Sibyl, wearing a green dress with thick fur sleeves, gazes down at Mary, her hand held in empathy over her own womb.&lt;ref name="j376"&gt;Jolly (1998), 376&lt;/ref&gt; Micah's lunettes are an early instance of an illusionistic motif, wherein the sense of the boundary between the painting, frame and viewer's space becomes blurred. In this example, the prophet knowingly places his hand outwards on the lower border of the frame.

In October 1428 Jan was part of a Burgundian embassy sent to secure the hand of Isabella,
eldest daughter of [[John I of Portugal]] (1385–1433). After a storm forced them to spend four
weeks in England, the Burgundians arrived in Lisbon in December. In January they met the King in
the castle of Aviz, and van Eyck painted the Infanta's portrait, probably in two versions to
accompany the two separate groups who left by sea and by land on 12 February to report the terms
to the Duke. The portraits are untraced, but one is preserved in a drawing (Germany, priv. col., see
Sterling, fig.), which indicates that Jan used the princess's Portuguese dress for the Erythrean sibyl
on the Ghent Altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Art Online – Jan van Eyck&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ???? replace this --&gt;

In the mid 20th century, art historian Volker Herzner noted the facial similarity between the Cumaean Sibyl and Philip's wife [[Isabella of Portugal]], especially as she is portrayed in van Eyck's lost [[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|1428–29 betrothal portrait]].{{efn-ua|The portrait is known today from a 17th-century pencil copy. Other art historians have suggested that the Virgin in van Eyck's Washington ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' bears Isabella's face. See Wolff, Hand (1987), 81}} Herzner speculated that the text in the [[banderole]] in the sibyl's panel has a double meaning, referring not only to the coming of Christ, but also to the 1432 birth of Philip's first son and heir to survive infancy. Others reject this idea, given the high rates of infant mortality at the time, and the connotations of bad luck usually associated with acclaiming a son before he is born.&lt;ref name="r58"&gt;Ridderbos at al. (2004), 58–9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annunciation===

Beneath the lunettes are the four panels of the upper register. The two outer panels of the middle register show the [[Annunciation to Mary]], with the [[Archangel Gabriel]] on the left and the Virgin Mary on the right. Both are dressed in white robes, and occupy what appear to be the opposite ends of the same room.&lt;ref name="B31" /&gt; Gabriel and Mary's panels are separated by two much narrower images showing unoccupied domestic interior scenes.&lt;ref name="h99"/&gt; The back wall in the left-hand image has a window opening onto a view of street and city square,&lt;ref name="B31" /&gt; while that in the right-hand image has a niche.&lt;ref name="b25" /&gt; Some art historians have attempted to associate the street with an actual location in Ghent, but it is generally accepted that it is not modeled on any specific place.&lt;ref name="h81" /&gt; The sparseness of these narrow panels seem anomalous in the overall context of the altarpiece; a number of art historians have suggested that they were compromises worked out by Jan as he struggled to accommodate his design within the original framework set out by Hubert.&lt;!--there is much more on this--&gt;&lt;ref name="j375" /&gt;

Mary and Gabriel are disproportionately large in relation to the scale of the rooms they occupy. Art historians agree that this follows the conventions of both the [[International Gothic]] and late [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] traditions of the [[icon]] by showing saints, especially Mary, in a much larger scale than their surroundings. In this instance their size is probably a device to convey the idea that they are heavenly apparitions who have come momentarily before the donors who are in the lower register. Van Eyck used this conceit most dramatically in his ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'', (c. 1438–40) which is likely a panel from a dismantled [[diptych]].&lt;ref name="h99"&gt;Harbison (2012), p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;

Gabriel has blond hair and multicoloured wings. His right hand is raised and in his left he holds lilies, traditionally found in paintings of the annunciation as symbols of Mary's virginity.&lt;ref name="j375"&gt;Jolly (1998), 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2004), 19 &amp; 77&lt;/ref&gt; His words to Mary are written alongside him in Latin: &lt;small&gt;''AVE GRACIA PLENA D(OMI)N(U)S TECU(M)''&lt;/small&gt; ("Hail who art full of grace, the Lord is with you"). The horizontal inscription extends out the panel and halfway across the neighbouring image. As in van Eyck's Washington ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' of c. 1434–6, the letters of Mary's reply are inscribed in reverse and upside-down; as if for God to read from heaven, or for the holy spirit, as represented by the dove, to read as he hovers directly above her. She answers &lt;small&gt;''ECCE ANCILLAM D(OMI)NI''&lt;/small&gt; ("Behold the handmaiden of the Lord").&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 82&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van eyck, annunciazione, dettaglio, 1434-36 circa.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Archangel Gabriel]] in a cope with a jewelled morse in [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Jan van Eyck's ''Annunciation'']], 1434–36]]

Art historian Penny Jolly suggests that in the mid to late 1420s Jan may have traveled to Italy at the behest of the Duke of Burgundy where, in Florence, he probably saw an iconic 14th century annunciation, and perhaps visited more contemporary annunciation scenes. The Florentine annunciations have a number of iconographic similarities to the Ghent panels, including Gabriel's multi-colored wings, the upside down writing, the treatment of light beams, and the separation between angel and virgin by a thin architectural feature. Some of these elements, particularly the spatial separation between the two figures, can be found in [[Lorenzo Monaco]]'s ''[[Bartolini Salimbeni Annunciation]]'' in [[Santa Trinita]], finished before his death in 1424, and one that Jan may have seen. In Monaco's painting the angel and Mary are separated by two small spaces, one external and one internal, similar to the city-scape and domestic [[lavabo]] panels in the Ghent annunciation.&lt;ref name="j375" /&gt;&lt;!-- fix page numbers --&gt;

The style of the furnishings of the room and the modernity of the town visible through the arched window set the panels in a contemporary 15th century setting. The interiors have been cited as one of the first representations of medieval "bourgeois domestic culture".&lt;ref name="b27"&gt;Borchert (2011), 27&lt;/ref&gt; Borchert sees this familiar setting as a device to allow 15th century viewers to connect with the panel and so reinforce the conceit that the two saints are apparitions occupying the same space and time as the donor or observer.&lt;ref name="b25"&gt;Borchert (2011), 25&lt;/ref&gt; Yet a number of features in the interior suggest that it is not a secular domestic space, most obviously the cool and austere surfaces, the domed windows and stone columns.&lt;ref name="b27" /&gt;

The four panels are most obviously connected by the floor tiling and [[vanishing point]].&lt;ref name="b25" /&gt; Shadows falling on the tiling at the lower right hand corner of each panel can only have been cast by the moulding on the frames, that is from an area outside of the pictorial space.&lt;ref name="p13"&gt;Pächt (1999), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saints and donors===
The figures in the four panels of the lower register are all positioned within uniform [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s. The outer panels show the [[donor portrait|donors]] Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut.&lt;ref name="p126" /&gt; The inner panels contain [[grisaille]] paintings of Saint John the Baptist and Saint [[John the Evangelist]]. The grisaille is used to give the illusion of sculpture and imply that these are cult representations of the two saints before which the donors kneel, gazing into the distance with their hands clasped together in veneration.&lt;ref name="p169"&gt;Pächt (1999), 169&lt;/ref&gt; As with the most of the other panels on the inner and outer views, they are lit from the right.&lt;ref name="h81" /&gt; Shadows thrown by the figures establish depth, and bring realism to both the faux statues and painted niches.&lt;ref name="borchert30"&gt;Borchert (2011), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Each saint stands on a stone [[plinth]] inscribed with his name. John the Baptist, the son of the priest [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] (not to be confused with the prophet of the same name shown on the upper register), holds a lamb in his left arm and is turned towards Joost Vijdt. His right hand is raised and his finger extended to point towards the lamb, a gesture that implies that he is reciting the [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]]. John the Evangelist holds a [[chalice]], a reference to the early medieval tradition that he had ability with cures; he could drink poison from a cup without ill effects.&lt;ref name ="J392"&gt;Jolly (1998), 392&lt;/ref&gt;

The donors are painted life size,&lt;ref name="p169"/&gt; and thus to a much larger scale than the saints; this is most noticeable in the relative sizes of their heads and hands. Their bright and warmly colored clothes contrast sharply with the grey of the lifeless saints. Van Eyck brings a high degree of realism to his portrayal of the Vijdts; his study of the ailing couple in old age is unflinching and far from flattering. Details that reveal their aging include Joost's watering eyes, wrinkled hands, warts, bald head and stubble streaked with gray. The folds of both figures' skin are meticulously detailed, as are their protruding veins and fingernails.&lt;ref name="b30" /&gt;{{efn-ua|The panels resemble passages from van Eyck's c 1436 ''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'', and the manner of depicting the aged in such a way is characteristic of a number of works produced by the workshop after his death. See Borchert (2011), 30}} They are generally thought to be among the final panels completed for the altarpiece, and are so dated to 1431 or the early months of 1432.&lt;ref&gt;Meiss (1952), 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Jodocus (known as Joos) Vijd was a wealthy merchant and came from a family that had been influential in Ghent for several generations. His father, Vijd Nikolaas (d. 1412), had been close to [[Louis II of Flanders]]. Jodocus was one of the most senior and politically powerful citizens of Ghent. He was titled ''Seigneur'' of [[Oudenaarde|Pamele]] and [[Ledeberg]], and in a difficult and rebellious political climate, became one of the [[Duke of Burgundy]] [[Philip the Good]]'s most trusted local councilmen. Around 1398 Jodocus married Lysbette Borluut, also from an established city family.&lt;ref name="B31"&gt;Borchert (2008), 31&lt;/ref&gt; The couple died childless and the endowment to the church and the commissioning of such an unprecedentedly monumental altarpiece were intended for a number of reasons, primarily to secure a legacy. But, according to Borchert, also to "secure his position in the hereafter" and, important to such an ambitious politician, demonstrate his social prestige, revealing, Borchert believes, a desire to "show off and&amp;nbsp;... outstrip by far all other endowments to St John's, if not each and every other church and monastery in Ghent."&lt;ref name="b32&amp;3"&gt;Borchert (2008), 32–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Ghent prospered through the early 15th century, and a number of local councilors sought to establish a sense of independence from Burgundian rule. Philip was in financial difficulty, and asked the city for revenue, a burden many city councilors felt unreasonable and could ill afford, financially or politically. The situation became tense, and because there was division within the council over the burden, this led to a mistrust that meant council membership was dangerous and precarious. During a power play in 1432 a number of councilors were murdered, seemingly for their loyalty to Philip. Tensions came to with head in a [[Revolt of Ghent (1449–53)|1433 revolt]], which ended with the [[Decapitation|beheading]] of the councilors who had acted as ringleaders.&lt;ref name="h37"&gt;Hagen et al., 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout Vijd stayed loyal to Philip. His position as warden at St. John the Baptist's church (now [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]]) reflects this; the church was favoured by the Burgundians for official ceremonies held in Ghent. On the day of the altarpiece's consecration, 6 May 1432, Philip's and [[Isabella of Portugal]]'s son was baptised there, indicating Vijd's status at the time.&lt;ref name="b32"&gt;Borchert (2008), 32&lt;/ref&gt;

As warden (''kerkmeester'') of St. John's, Vijd between 1410 and 1420 not only financed the construction of the principal chapel's [[Bay (architecture)|bay]], but endowed a new chapel off the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], which took his family name and was regularly to hold masses in his and his ancestors' memory. It was for this new chapel that he commissioned [[Hubert van Eyck]] to create an unusually large and complex polyptych altarpiece.&lt;ref name="B31" /&gt; He was recorded as donor on an inscription on the original, now lost, frame. The chapel was dedicated to St. John the Baptist,&lt;ref name="b17"&gt;Borchert (2008), 17&lt;/ref&gt; whose traditional [[emblem|attribute]] is the Lamb of God, a symbol of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/bartolome-esteban-murillo-the-infant-saint-john-with-the-lamb The Infant Saint John with the Lamb]".

==Condition==
The first significant restoration was carried out in 1550 by the painters [[Lancelot Blondeel]] and [[Jan van Scorel]], following the earlier and poorly executed cleaning by Jan van Scorel, that led to damage to the [[predella]].&lt;ref name = "P120ff"/&gt; The 1550 undertaking was performed with a care and reverence that a contemporary account writes of "such love that they kissed that skilful work in art in many places".&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 67&lt;/ref&gt; The predella was destroyed by fire in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt (1999), 132&lt;/ref&gt; Comprising a strip of small square panels&lt;ref&gt;Charney (2010), 15&lt;/ref&gt; and executed in water based paints, it showed hell or [[limbo]] with Christ arriving to redeem those about to be saved. During the [[Protestant Reformation]] the piece was moved out of the chapel to prevent damage in the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'', first to the attic and later to the town hall, where it remained for two decades.&lt;ref name="P120ff"&gt;Pächt (1999), 120&lt;/ref&gt; In 1662 the Ghent painter [[Antoon van den Heuvel]] was commissioned to clean the Ghent Altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Voll (1906), 245&lt;/ref&gt;

A program of restoration at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent]] began in October 2012, and is projected to last five years. The restoration is carried out by the [[Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage]] (KIK-IRPA) and the onsite project coordinator is Bart JC Devolder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ghent Altarpiece project|url=http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/panelpaintings/panel_paintings_ghent.html|publisher=[[Getty Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the panels being worked on are in the museum at any one time, with the others remaining on display in the cathedral.

The altarpiece has been moved several times over the centuries.&lt;ref name="P120ff"/&gt; Art historian [[Noah Charney]] describes the altarpiece as one of the more coveted and desired pieces of art, the victim of 13 crimes since its installation,&lt;ref&gt;Charney (2010), x&lt;/ref&gt; and seven thefts.&lt;ref&gt;Charney (2010), 1&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[French Revolution]] the altarpiece was among a number of art works plundered in today's Belgium and taken to Paris where they were exhibited at the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]. It was returned to Ghent in 1815 after the French defeat at the [[Battle of Waterloo]].&lt;ref name ="Deam3"&gt;Deam (1998), 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
The painting's wings (not including the Adam and Eve panels)&lt;ref name ="Deam3" /&gt; were pawned in 1815 by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ghent|Diocese of Ghent]] for the equivalent of £240. When the diocese failed to redeem them, they were sold by the dealer Nieuwenhuys in 1816 to the English collector [[Edward Solly]] for £4,000. The pieces spent some months in London, during which time the new owner unsuccessfully sought a buyer. They were later bought by the [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King of Prussia]] for £16,000, an enormous sum at the time, and for many decades they were exhibited in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger (1961), 130&lt;/ref&gt; The panels still in Ghent were damaged by fire in 1822, and the separately hinged Adam and Eve panels sent to a museum in Brussels.&lt;ref name="P120ff"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], other panels were taken from the cathedral by German forces. Under the terms of the [[Versailles Treaty|Treaty of Versailles]] and its subsequent [[World War I reparations|reparations]] transfers, in 1920 Germany returned all the panels,&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt; and, after a century of separation, they all were again in Ghent. In 1934, ''The Just Judges'' and ''Saint John the Baptist'' panels were stolen. The panel of ''Saint John the Baptist'' was returned by the thief as a goodwill gesture, but the ''Just Judges'' panel is still missing.&lt;ref name="P120ff"/&gt; The Germans "bitterly resented the loss of the panels" and, at the start of another invasion by Germany in 1940, a decision was made in Belgium to send the altarpiece to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to keep it safe.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt; The painting was in France, ''en route'' to the Vatican, when Italy declared war as an [[Axis powers|Axis power]] alongside Germany. The painting was stored in a museum in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], and French, Belgian and German military representatives signed an agreement which required the consent of all three before the masterpiece could be moved.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband"/&gt; In 1942, [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the painting to be seized from a museum in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] and brought to Germany to be stored in the [[Schloss Neuschwanstein]] castle in [[Bavaria]]. The seizure, led by senior museum administrator [[Ernst Buchner (curator)|Ernst Buchner]] and aided by officials in France, was ostensibly to protect the altarpiece from war. After Allied air raids made the castle too dangerous for the painting, it was stored in the [[Altaussee#Nazi repository for stolen art|Altaussee]] salt mines.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband2"/&gt; Belgian and French authorities protested against the seizing of the painting, and the head of the German army's Art Protection Unit was dismissed after he disagreed with the seizure.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband2"/&gt;

The altarpiece was recovered by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] group [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]] after the war and returned to Belgium in a ceremony presided over by Belgian royalty at the [[Royal Palace of Brussels]], where the 17 panels were displayed for the press. French officials were not invited as the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government had allowed the Germans to remove the painting.&lt;ref name="nazi contraband3"&gt;Kurtz (2006), 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Square Mile''' and also known as the '''Golden Square Mile''' (officially in {{lang-fr|'''Le Mille Carré'''}} and also known as '''Mille carré doré''') is the nostalgic name given to an urban [[neighbourhood]] developed principally between 1850 and 1930 at the foot of [[Mount Royal]], in the west-central section of downtown [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada. The name "Square Mile" has been used to refer to the area since the 1930s; prior to that, the neighborhood was known as 'New Town' or 'Uptown'.&lt;ref&gt;Discover Montréal: an architectural and historical guide - Joshua Wolfe, Cécile Grenier, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of 'Golden' was coined by Montreal journalist Charlie Lazarus, and the name has connections to contemporary real-estate developments, as the historical delimitations of the Golden Square Mile overlap with Montreal's contemporary central business district.

From the 1790s, the business leaders of [[Montreal]] looked beyond [[Old Montreal]] for spacious sites upon which to build their country homes. They developed the farmland of the slopes of [[Mount Royal]] north of [[Sherbrooke Street]], creating a neighborhood notorious for its grandeur and architectural audacity. At the Square Mile's peak (1850-1930), its residents included the owners and operators of the majority of Canadian rail, shipping, timber, mining, fur and banking industries. From about 1870 to 1900, 70% of all wealth in [[Canada]] was held by this small group of approximately fifty men.&lt;ref name="fodor"&gt;{{cite book|title=Compass American Guides: Montreal|publisher=[[Fodor's]]|isbn=978-1-4000-1315-9|pages=132–135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bpxmNNnjBQoC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Golden+Square+Mile&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qt_cTpaTEMTj0QGanrDFDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Golden%20Square%20Mile&amp;f=false|authors=Patricia Harris, David Lyon|accessdate=5 December 2011|chapter=Golden Square Mile|date=2 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, multiple factors led to the neighborhood's decline, including the [[Great Depression]], the dawn of the [[automobile]], the demand for more heat-efficient houses, and the younger generations of the families that had built these homes largely moved to [[Westmount]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/lists-and-rankings/canadas-richest-neighbourhoods-2013/ |title=Canada's Richest Neighbourhoods, 2013|website=canadianbusiness.com |publisher=Canadian Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/370804/income-by-postal-code/|title=Income by postal code: Mapping Canada’s richest and poorest neighbourhoods|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Quiet Revolution]], some of the businesses created in [[Montreal]], on whose fortunes the Square Mile had been built, moved to [[Toronto]].{{Citation needed|reason=Did such displacement of businesses take place?  The Quiet Revolution article doesn't mention it.  If true, this is significant and deserves a reference.|date=March 2015}} In this period, the Square Mile evolved to gradually become the central business district, and many of grand houses were demolished. The face of the Square Mile was altered, leading to the formation of [[Heritage Montreal]] to preserve architecture in the city.

By 1983, only 30% of the mansions in the northern half of the Square Mile had survived demolition; and only 5% survived south of Sherbrooke Street.&lt;ref&gt;Rémillard, François; &amp; Brian Merrett (1987). ''Mansions of the Golden Square Mile.'' Meridian Press. {{ISBN|2-920417-25-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the remaining mansions, such as the James Ross House, today known as Chancellor Day Hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Chancellor_Day_Hall.html|title=Chancellor Day Hall (formerly James Ross House)|last=Johnson|first=David|website=cac.mcgill.ca|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; are today owned by [[McGill University]]. Nevertheless, the mansions of the Golden Square Mile represent a prosperous period during which Montreal was the cultural and financial capital of Canada.

==Borders==
[[File:Résidence de Duncan McIntyre.gif|thumb|left|[[Duncan McIntyre (businessman)|McIntyre]]'s ''Cragruie'', built on 10 acres off McGregor Street c.1880, demolished 1930]]
[[File:Maison Herbert Molson 3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Herbert Molson]] House. Designed by architect [[Robert Findlay]] in 1912.]]
The neighbourhood had precise borders measuring roughly a [[square mile]], covering the area between [[René Lévesque Boulevard|Boulevard René-Lévesque]] at the southern end; [[Pine Avenue]] at the foot of [[Mount Royal]] at the northern end; [[University Street]] at the eastern end, and [[Guy Street]] at the western end. In effect, however, the 'Square Mile' was contained within a far smaller area, between [[Sherbrooke Street]] and Pine Avenue, and Guy and University, covering scarcely nine streets on the north-south axis. From east to west: [[McTavish Street]], [[Peel Street, Montreal|Peel Street]], [[Stanley Street, Montreal|Stanley Street]], [[Drummond Street, Montreal|Drummond Street]], [[Mountain Street]], Ontario Avenue (now Avenue du Musée), Redpath Street, Simpson Street, and [[Guy Street]]; and three streets on the east-west axis, from south to north: Sherbrooke St. West, McGregor Street (now [[Doctor Penfield Avenue]]) and Pine Avenue.

==Architecture==
The architects of the Square Mile included [[Robert Findlay]], [[Bruce Price]], [[Andrew Taylor (architect)|Sir Andrew Taylor]], [[William Tutin Thomas|William Thomas]], John Hopkins and the brothers Edward and [[William Sutherland Maxwell|William Maxwell]]. The architecture was an eclectic mix of the [[Neo-classical architecture|Neo-classical]], [[Neo-Gothic]], [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]], [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] and [[Art Nouveau]], though other styles also figured prominently, sometimes within the same home. By [[World War I]], simpler houses were built, such as [[Herbert Molson]]'s. [[Maison Cormier]] was one of only a few examples of [[Art deco]].

Scottish [[sandstone]] and local [[granite]] were commonly used materials, and most homes had substantial grounds, [[Atrium (architecture)|atria]] and large [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]]. A great many of the Square Milers were keen [[Horticulture|horticulturalists]] and aside from their [[garden]]s, they enjoyed keeping [[Greenhouse|hothouse]] [[flowers]] through the long winters. The streets of the Square Mile were lined with [[elm]], [[spruce]] and [[maple]] trees, but an outbreak of [[Dutch elm disease]] in the 1970s destroyed those that had once lined Sherbrooke Street.

==Montreal's mercantile community (1642-1930)==

As a hotel, it was the largest in the [[British colonies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/8766387 |title=Import from Canada|date=11 January 1850 |website=trove.nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; until burnt in the riots of 1849]]
[[File:Place d'armes, Montreal.jpg|thumb|The [[Bank of Montreal]] on Place d'armes, founded in 1817 by one French and seven British merchants. It served as the national bank of [[Canada]] up until 1934]]
In 1642, a fort named [[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville Marie]] was founded on the Island of Montreal by [[Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve]]. Ville Marie became a centre for the [[fur trade]] and French expansion into [[New France]] until 1760, when it was surrendered to the British army, following the French defeat of the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]]. British immigration expanded the city.

The British immigrants who came to [[Montreal]] after the Conquest tended to be from well-connected mercantile families and immigrated to Canada as a means to further their fortunes, unlike earlier British immigrants who came to [[North America]] to escape religious or political persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/nwc/history/09.htm|title=History - The canoe|website=digital.library.mcgill.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's golden era of fur trading began with the advent of the locally owned [[North West Company]]. In the 1760s, the men of the Beaver Club, a gentlemen's dining club, provided the financial backing and necessary management to take control of the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]]. The new merchants were associated with the [[North West Company]], the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the agents of the [[East India Company]], and eventually dominated the fur market in most of [[British North America]].

As many of the wealthy French Canadians moved from Canada to [[France]] following the Conquest, British and Scottish merchants were able to cheaply purchase vast tracts of land upon which to build factories, and take control of the banking and finance of the new [[Dominion]]. The growing fortune of the Montreal mercantile elite of this era was consolidated through marriage and company mergers. After the collapse of the fur trade in the 1850s, the mercantile elite turned its interest to railways and shipping.

By the mid-19th century, the Montreal mercantile elite, residing in the Square Mile, firmly held the reins of Canada's economy. The merchants successfully connected Canada by building a network of railroads and exploiting maritime routes and the port of Montreal, which l remained the principal [[port]] through which immigrants arrived, and also through which Canada's produce was shipped to and from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[British Empire|Empire]].

For decades, the wealth accumulated from the fur trade, finance, and other industries made of Montreal's mercantile elite a "kind of commercial aristocracy, living in lordly and hospitable style," as [[Washington Irving]] observed.&lt;ref&gt;''Astoria'' (London, 1836) by Washington Irving&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, [[John Jeremiah Bigsby|John Bigsby]] penned his impressions of the city:&lt;blockquote&gt;I found, but did not expect to find, at Montreal a pleasing transcript of the best form of [[London]] life&amp;nbsp;— even in the circle beneath the very first class of official families. But I may be pardoned; for I had seen in the capital of another great [[colony]] ([[Cape Town]]) considerable primitiveness of manners.. (In Montreal) at an evening party at Mr [[John Richardson (businessman)|Richardson]]'s the appointments and service were admirable; the dress, manners, and conversation of the guests, in excellent taste. Most of the persons there, though country-born, had been educated in [[England]] ([[United Kingdom|Britain]]), and everything savoured of [[Kensington]]. There was much good music.. Some of the show-shops rival those of London in their [[plate glass|plate-glass]] windows, and its inns are as remarkable for their palatial exterior as they are for their excellent accommodation within.. Montreal is a stirring and opulent town.. Few places have so advanced in all the luxuries and comforts of high civilisation as Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HFLMo4XFcHsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shoe+and+canoe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l6YXsiXW-8&amp;sig=mDRbE0E7RrmaWzsjnuibgj0Wsf8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ng5uULG3PIyV0QWw2YDoAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA ''The Shoe and Canoe; or Pictures of Travel in the Canadas''] (1850) by John Bigsby&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before the 1840s, the landed, political and wealthier merchant classes of [[Montreal]] lived on their [[seigneuries]] during the summers and came to the city only for [[Parliament of Canada|Parliament]] or to conduct business during the winter. In 1816, Francis Hall, then a young [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] with the [[14th King's Hussars]], observed that Montreal's [[gentry]] "live in a splendid style, and keep expensive tables".&lt;ref&gt;''Travels in North America, from Modern Writers, With Remarks and Observations; Exhibiting a Connected View of the Geography and Present State of That Quarter of the Globe'' - [[William Bingley]], 1821&lt;/ref&gt; They kept townhouses on St. James Street, [[Notre-Dame Street]] and overlooking the [[Champ de Mars, Montreal|Champ de Mars]]; enjoying among other entertainments the [[Germany|German]] [[Orchestra]] and [[Viennese Waltz|Viennese dances]] held at the Hayes House theatre on Dalhousie Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/EN/009004-119.01-e.php?id_nbr=4489 "Moses Hayes"], ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795, [[Isaac Weld]] commented that "the people of Montreal, in general, are remarkably hospitable and attentive to strangers; they are sociable also amongst themselves, and fond in the extreme of convivial amusements".&lt;ref&gt;Travels through the states of North America, and the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, during ... 1795, 1796, and 1797 - Isaac Weld (1800)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}}

But lively as it was, [[Old Montreal]] with its frequent fires and swelling population was becoming less desirable. The wealthy merchants in particular began to seek large plots of land on which to build homes worthy of their success while remaining close to their business interests; and, their eyes turned to the fertile [[farmland]] under [[Mount Royal]]. John Duncan observed in 1818 that, "a number of very splendid mansions have lately been erected on the slope of the mountain, which would be regarded as magnificent residences even by the wealthy merchants of the mother country".&lt;ref&gt;Duncan's Travels, 1818&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, [[John Jeremiah Bigsby|John Bigsby]] described the view from Château St. Antoine, then said to be 'the most magnificent building in the whole city and standing within 200 acres of parkland roughly at the end of Dorchester Street:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had the pleasure of dining with (William McGillivray) at his seat, on a high terrace under the mountain, looking southwards and laid out in pleasure-grounds in the English style. The view from the drawing room windows of this large and beautiful mansion is extremely fine, too rich and fair, I foolishly thought, to be out of my native England. Close beneath you are scattered elegant country retreats embowered in plantations, succeeded by a crowd of orchards of delicious apples, spreading far to the right and left, and hedging in the glittering churches, hotels, and house-roofs of Montreal...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HFLMo4XFcHsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=john+bigsby+shoe+canoe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l6YXvcOO1-&amp;sig=qsGynVz1aUMEZn9Vm4o5nLbQbTw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eZFxUI-XLs-QhQeykICIBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA|title=The Shoe and Canoe ; Or Pictures of Travel in the Canadas: With Facts and Opinions on Emigration, State Policy, and Other Points of Public Interest|first=John Jeremiah|last=Bigsby|date=3 March 2018|publisher=Chapman and Hall|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The early residents of the Square Mile enjoyed marked benefits from being the first to settle there: The houses were surrounded by acres of parkland, with long carriage drives, [[vineyard|vineries]], [[orchards]], [[fruit]] and [[vegetable gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;My Children's Children (Montreal, 1937), by Evelyn Carter Springett&lt;/ref&gt; The surveyor [[Joseph Bouchette]] noted that the produce from these gardens in the summer months was "excellent in quality, affording a profuse supply... in as much, or even greater perfection than in many southern climes".&lt;ref&gt;British Dominions in North America (London, 1831), by Joseph Bouchette&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, [[Sir Richard Phillips]] commented that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A number of handsome villas now make their appearance around the town, and there are numerous sites still unoccupied, which will probably be hereafter crowned with elegant seats. Few places in the world possess more capabilities of this kind than [[Quebec City|Quebec]] and Montreal; if the latter is less bold than the former in its scenery, it possesses much richness and delicate beauty, which need nothing but wealth and taste to display them to advantage; the former already exists in Montreal to a great extent, and there are also very respectable proofs of the existence and growth of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;New voyages and travels: consisting of originals, translations, and abridgments ; with index and historical preface - Sir Richard Phillips, 1822&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;List of principal structures built
* ''Beaver Hall''. Built in 1792, for [[Joseph Frobisher]], it stood between the McTavish and McGill properties on the site that is today commemorated as Beaver Square. It stood amidst 40 [[acre]]s made up of [[forest]] and [[apple tree]]s, roughly where the [[Sun Life Building]] is today. The house measured 80 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] across and his dining room comfortably sat forty guests. It burned down in a fire in 1847.
* ''Burnside Place''. Built in 1797, for [[James McGill]]. Unlike the [[mansion]]s built by McGill's contemporaries, Burnside was a comfortable [[farmhouse]] of two stories over a basement for the kitchen and servants, standing on 46 acres of land, and used by the McGills during the summer. In his will, McGill bequeathed the property and £10,000 to establish a university, which would become [[McGill University]]. Immediately after his death, the house was occupied by his stepson, François-Amable Trottier DesRivières, who fought to keep the house for himself rather than give it to the [[Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning]] as his stepfather had intended. The last person to occupy the house was [[John Bethune (principal)|John Bethune]]; it was replaced by the Arts Building in 1837.
* ''McTavish House.'' Built in 1800 for [[Simon McTavish]]. Constructed with [[ashlar|dressed]] [[limestone]] by French [[Stonemasonry|masons]]. The [[facade]] of the main house measured 145 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] across, with two semi-circular towers, capped by typically French conical roofs at each end.&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture and Town Planning in Colonial North America'' - James &amp; Georgiana Kornwolf, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its completion, it was described as "a large, handsome stone building.. at the foot of the mountain in a very conspicuous situation. Gardens and orchards have been laid out, and considerable improvements made, which add much to the beauty of the spot".&lt;ref&gt;''Travels through Canada and the United States of North America''- John Lambert, 1806-08&lt;/ref&gt; The house was left empty from 1805 and was supposedly haunted by McTavish. It was demolished in 1860/61, when the estate was broken up and sold off in plots. Some of the stone from the original house was used to construct ''Braehead'' in 1861.
* ''Chateau St. Antoine''. Built in 1803, for [[William McGillivray]]. A 'fine [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] structure of [[Ashlar|cut stone]]', the house was described in 1816 as the most magnificent building in the whole of the city. The house, which boasted 'an enchanting' [[ballroom]], stood on Cote St. Antoine near the end of Dorchester Street within 200 acres of parkland 'laid out in pleasure-grounds in the [[England|English]] style'. McGillivray was said to have lived like a lord, enjoying a magnificent view of the city and the river.&lt;ref&gt;''Montreal in Evolution: Historical Analysis of the Development of Montreal's Architecture and Urban Environment'' - Jean-Claude Marsan, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The house was afterwards occupied by several different owners: John McKenzie, [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]],  [[Charles Wilson (Canadian politician)|Charles Wilson]] and finally the [[George-Édouard Desbarats|Desbarats family]]. It has since been demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawdonhistoricalsociety.com/dorwin/mtlin1816.htm|title=Montreal in 1816|first=Glenn F.|last=Cartwright|website=rawdonhistoricalsociety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* McLeod House, Rue St. Antoine. A 'first class house' built circa 1810 for [[Archibald Norman McLeod]], since demolished.
* ''St. Antoine Hall'', St. Antoine Street; a forty-two room home built for [[John Torrance]], 1818;&lt;ref name="The Square Mile 1987"&gt;The Square Mile, Merchant Princes of Montreal (1987) by Donald MacKay&lt;/ref&gt; A 'handsome residence' built in the [[palladian]] style, on a 'grand and sprawling estate,' renowned for its acres of gardens, greenhouses, vineyards and orchards, surrounded by a high brick wall. Since demolished.
* ''Piedmont'', Pine Avenue; built before 1820, when [[Louis-Charles Foucher]] moved in with his family. It was purchased in the 1830s by [[John Frothingham]]; inherited in 1870 by [[John Henry Robinson Molson]]. The house stood among orchards and formal gardens and was approached by a long tree-lined drive on what are today the grounds of [[McGill University]]. Its 10 acres of grounds were purchased by Lords [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Strathcona]] and [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|Mount Stephen]] in 1890, on which they built the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]]. The house was demolished in 1939.&lt;ref name="The Square Mile 1987"/&gt;
* ''Lunn House,'' Sherbrooke Street; built in 1825 for [[William Lunn (educator)|William Lunn]], demolished 1920
* ''Manoir Souvenir'', between Dorchester Boulevard and the fashionable Rue Saint-Antoine; it stood within a park of 240 acres and was built in 1830 for [[Frédéric-Auguste Quesnel]]; afterwards inherited by his nephew, [[Charles-Joseph Coursol]]. It still stands today, though derelict and barely recognisable from its former grandeur.
* ''Terrace Bank'', [[Sherbrooke Street]]; built in 1837 for [[John Redpath]] who purchased the 235-acre estate for £10,000 from the Desrivières family in 1836. He subsequently subdivided the property at a profit of £25,000, with little infringement on their space, before building his home on a plot amidst gardens and orchards with a private road that ran up to the house from the corner of Mountain and Dorchester streets.&lt;ref name="erudit"&gt;[http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2003/v14/n1/010324ar.pdf Roderick Macleod, "The Road to Terrace Bank: Land Capitalization, Public Space, and the Redpath Family Home, 1837-1861"], ''Erudit'', 2003, Vol. 14, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The house was enlarged by the Redpaths in 1861 and since demolished. The land on which the house stood has been replaced by Redpath Crescent.&lt;ref name="erudit"/&gt;
* ''Kildonan Hall'', [[Sherbrooke Street]]; built in the 1840s for [[Joseph Mackay]]. In the photograph of the house its [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]] can just be made out on the left, and the [[coach house]] and [[stables]] are seen beyond the arch to the right of the house. It was demolished in 1930.
* ''Mount Prospect House'', Sherbrooke Street; built in 1842 for [[William Workman]], demolished 1952
* ''Athelstane Hall'', 'a fine house' on St. Alexander Street; built in 1844 for John Smith, and afterwards occupied by Rev. Gavin Lang. Since demolished.
* ''[[Notman House]],'' [[Sherbrooke Street]]; built 1843-45 for [[William Collis Meredith|Sir William Collis Meredith]], to the design of [[John Wells (architect)]]. Although it lies outside the Square Mile and is of more modest proportions than its counterparts, it is the only surviving residence of its era on Sherbrooke Street - that was once lined with many like it. It is also one of [[Quebec]]'s only few remaining [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] residences.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' - Shaking our Cultural Foundations - Notman House on Sherbrooke Street is a classified heritage building, but that doesn't seem to mean much - April 21, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It was purchased by Alexander [[Molson family|Molson]] circa 1865, who sold it in 1876 to [[William Notman]], for whom it is named today. In 1894, it was purchased by [[George Alexander Drummond|Sir George Drummond]] for use as the ''St. Margaret's Home for Incurables''. In 2012, it was purchased by the OSMO Foundation.
* ''Rosemount'', McGregor Street; built in 1848 for [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet]] on land that he purchased from [[George Simpson (administrator)|Sir George Simpson]]; purchased in 1871 by [[William Watson Ogilvie]] and altered by him in 1890; purchased in 1926 by Sir Percy Walters who demolished the house in 1943 to create 'Percy Walters Park'.

===1850 to 1869===
Following the strikes and the [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal]], the new [[decade]] was "like the arrival of a [[Montreal]] [[Spring (season)|spring]], prosperity and stability invigorated the city in the early 1850s".&lt;ref name="The Square Mile 1987"/&gt; [[Sir Hugh Allan]] was elected President of the Montreal [[Board of Trade]] in 1851 and work on railways and steamships was evident everywhere, bringing with it a surge of construction. There were now a dozen architects practising in the city and the newly rich competed with one another for the largest, most decorative homes.&lt;ref&gt;Diaries of John Frothingham (1788-1870)&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's lively reputation had not diminished, as [[Charles A. Goodrich|Charles Goodrich]] suggested with a hint of disapproval: "If you wish to enjoy good eating, dancing, music and gayety, you will find an abundance of all (at Montreal)".&lt;ref&gt;Travels and sketches in North and South America, by Charles Augustus Goodrich (1852)&lt;/ref&gt; While staying at [[Donegana's Hotel, Montreal|Donegana's Hotel]] in 1853, Clara Kelly wrote to her father, [[Fitzroy Kelly|Sir Fitzroy Kelly]], describing her impressions of the city and the Square Mile in its infancy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The scenery I find remarkably pretty, and, moreover, the city has an air of comfort, and to a certain extent of antiquity, rarely to be seen in the [[United States of America|States]].. The view from ([[Mount Royal]]'s) summit is most picturesque, - green undulating land dotted with country houses and cottages, with beautiful gardens and trees.. The scene of the terrible fire which occurred here three years ago was pointed out to us. It has fearfully devastated a great part of the town. It seems difficult to understand how such a fire could have lasted so long a time and have done so much mischief, as the houses were not built of wood, which I had always imagined to be the case.. (We visited) a most beautiful and wonderful garden, belonging to a Montreal merchant (probably [[John Torrance]] of St. Antoine Hall), whose name I forget but who has collected here everything which is rich and rare, in [[shrub]] or [[flower]].&lt;ref&gt;A Woman's Wanderings in the Western World: A Series of Letters Addressed to Sir Fitzroy Kelly, M.P., by his daughter Mrs. Clara Bromley, published 1861&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Completed in 1863, Sir Hugh Allan's new house, ''[[Ravenscrag, Montreal|Ravenscrag]]'', was to be the jewel of the Square Mile, as he intended. He purchased fourteen acres from the decaying [[Simon McTavish|McTavish]] estate and built a sumptuous home of 72 rooms that excelled "in size and cost any dwelling-house in [[Canada]]," surpassing [[Dundurn Castle]].&lt;ref name="Canadian Biography 1890"&gt;Dictionary of Canadian Biography (1881-1890), Volume XI&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, Montreal had come of age, which was recognised by three [[Royal tours of Canada|Royal visits]] from the future [[Edward VII]], [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]] and [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]], the most of any colony.

Following the [[Confederation of Canada]], the mercantile elite was led by the Allan brothers (Sir Hugh and [[Andrew Allan (shipowner)|Andrew]]), described by the ''Gazette'' as the "pioneers of our commercial greatness".&lt;ref name="Canadian Biography 1890"/&gt; In 1878, the [[Marquis of Lorne]] and [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] were posted to Canada as the new [[Vice-regal]] couple, while [[Montreal]] was attracting celebrities of the day such as [[Charles Dickens]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Mark Twain]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]]. At the same time in London, the likes of [[Emma Albani]] and [[Sir Gilbert Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Gilbert Parker]] were representative of Quebec's culture.&lt;ref&gt;Journeys: A History of Canada - R. Douglas Francis, Richard Jones, Donald B. Smith, R. D. Francis, Richard Jones, Donald B. Smith (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] was completed under the direction of [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|Lord Mount Stephen]], [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Lord Strathcona]] and [[Richard B. Angus|R.B. Angus]], after which it was continued by [[Thomas Shaughnessy, 1st Baron Shaughnessy|Lord Shaughnessy]] and [[William Cornelius Van Horne|Sir William Cornelius Van Horne]]. Celebrating their success, they spared no expense on their homes, with interiors decked in detailed [[mahogany]] and private art galleries housing works of the likes of [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Cézanne]], [[John Constable|Constable]] and [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] etc. Van Horne's collection of [[Japanese pottery and porcelain|Japanese pottery]] brought [[connoisseur]]s from [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]; and the [[Old Masters]] collection belonging to [[James Ross (Canadian businessman)|James Ross]] was frequently loaned out for public exhibition around the world.

[[Ashton Oxenden]] was [[Anglican Diocese of Montreal|Bishop of Montreal]] from 1869 to 1878. As an [[England|Englishman]], previously well travelled in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Spain]], he paid a high complement to "this flourishing and wealthy city" when he stated that, "upon the whole, I prefer Montreal, as a place of residence, to almost any town that I have ever seen." Oxenden particularly enjoyed the "picturesque city's cheerfulness (and the) kindness of its inhabitants":&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;My First Year in Canada - Ashton Oxenden, Bishop of Montreal, 1871&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an abundance of [[charitable institution]]s at Montreal (and) all well managed.. among the [[Roman Catholic]]s especially there are many institutions on an enormous scale.. I have hardly seen a [[beggar]] in the streets or in the [[countryside|country]]. There is a great absence of [[poverty]], except perhaps among the lowest [[French Canadian|French]] population.. Happily there is at present (1871) a kindly feeling between the Roman Catholics and [[Protestant]]s, each pursuing their own course without molesting the other. The general cost of living (is) much the same as in an ordinary [[England|English]] town.. Dinner parties are frequent in Montreal. There is perhaps a little too much expense devoted to them; and this prevents all but the wealthy from indulging in such hospitalities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Upper parts of the town are of more recent growth, and contain commodious and detached houses, belonging to the men of business and persons of fortune. The streets in this part of the town are as yet incomplete, showing at present certain gaps, which will ere long be filled up with handsome houses. They are all flanked by trees, chiefly [[maple]]s (which) greatly add to the beauty of the town. The Montreal builders are excellent. They not only run up their houses at an indescribable speed, but they build them well and substantially.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aside from the men at the very top, the CPR had also brought about another housing boom to the Square Mile: In 1885, [[Sir John Abbott]], the company's chief lawyer, built his new home on Sherbrooke Street and Peel, and in doing so set a trend among his boardroom colleagues, as Oxenden had correctly predicted, filling the gaps within the Square Mile.

;List of principal structures built
* [[Van Horne Mansion]]; built in 1869 for [[John Hamilton (Quebec politician)|John Hamilton]], President of the Merchant's Bank.

Income tax was introduced after the [[First World War]] and in 1926 the Meighens were forced to sell the property. It was purchased by three [[Anglo-Quebecer|anglophone]] businessmen, [[Noah Timmins]], J.H. Maher and J.S.

* Baumgarten House, McTavish Street; built in 1887 for [[Baron]] [[Alfred Baumgarten]]. The house resembled the ancestral home of his wife, Donners Park, in [[Altona, Hamburg]]. His widow sold it to [[McGill University|McGill]] in 1926 and it became the home of General [[Arthur Currie|Sir Arthur Currie]]. From 1935, it has been the McGill Faculty Club.
* ''Rotherwood'', Redpath Street; built in 1887 for George Hague. After his death it was left empty for several years. His heirs had found taxes too heavy and could not afford to maintain the house. Unable to sell it at a decent price, it was demolished in 1929.
* [[George Alexander Drummond|Sir George Drummond]]'s House, Sherbrooke Street, on the corner of Mansfield Street; built by [[Andrew Taylor (architect)|Sir Andrew Taylor]] in 1888. It was  demolished by the City of Montreal in 1930 and the site was used as a car wash.

===1890 to 1914===
From the 1890s into the [[Edwardian era]] the city enjoyed a gilded age. [[Stephen Leacock]] recalled, "the rich in Montreal enjoyed a prestige in that era that not even the rich deserve".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;The Reconquest Of Montreal: Language Policy and Social Change in a Bilingual City - Marc Levine, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The men of the CPR retired in the 1890s, having created "the world's greatest transportation system,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVEEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=cpr+worlds+greatest+transportation+system&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xCiuT8GYKJGb1ASugar|title=LIFE|first=Time|last=Inc|date=5 April 1937|publisher=Time Inc|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; selling a package of cheap land (their land holdings were equal in size to the [[Province of Alberta]]) with a cheap ticket from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] through to the [[Canadian West]]. Together they had built a nation, seeing over a million immigrants settle in the west, and by exploiting the mineral resources included in their land grants, they and their [[shareholders]] would see their net earnings grow year on year to $46 million in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance of Grandeur: The Anglo-Protestant elite of Montreal, 1900-1950; Margaret W. Westley (1990), page 192&lt;/ref&gt; Unprecedented amounts of capital now flowed in from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to build [[Western Canada]], and [[Montreal]], where every major company had its headquarters, was once again at the centre of this latest web of prosperity - "those who thought that the government of Canada was in [[Ottawa]] were mistaken, it was ''here''".&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian Home: From Cave to Electronic Cocoon - Marc Denhez, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In perhaps no section of the [[British colonies|Colonies]] have [[England|Englishmen]] and [[Scotland|Scotsmen]] made more of their opportunities than in Montreal. There is an air of prosperity about all their surroundings which at once impresses the visitor. Taken all in all, there is perhaps no wealthier city area in the world than that comprised between Beaver Hall Hill and the foot of [[Mount Royal]], and between the parallel lines of Dorchester and Sherbrooke Streets in the West End.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The wealth inherited and managed by the next generation of Square Milers continued to grow, but while many were successful as businessmen they were less entrepreneurial. They financed and worked closely with newcomers such as [[Edward Wentworth Beatty|Sir Edward Beatty]], [[Herbert Samuel Holt|Sir Herbert Samuel Holt]] and the last of the great Square Mile tycoons, [[John Wilson McConnell|J.W. McConnell]].&lt;ref name="The Square Mile 1987" /&gt; These men had easily integrated themselves into Square Mile society, but there was a new and hungrier generation of anglophones coming to Montreal, epitomised by [[Henry Worth Thornton|Sir Henry Thornton]], who were not as readily accepted by the older generation, which jealously guarded over the dominance of their cornerstones, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] and the [[Bank of Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance of Grandeur: The Anglo-Protestant elite of Montreal, 1900-1950; Margaret W. Westley (1990), page 201&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this new group included [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Max Aitken]] and [[Izaak Walton Killam|Isaac Killam]], who were 'pilled' (barred) from entry into the Mount Royal Club.&lt;ref&gt;Profits and Politics: Beaverbrook and the Gilded Age of Canadian Finance - Gregory Marchildon, 1996. Page 152&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, finding that the St. James' Club had become "too overcrowded," the Square Mile's leading businessmen, led by the likes of [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Strathcona]] and [[Richard B. Angus|Angus]], established the Mount Royal Club that overnight became Montreal's most prestigious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/documents/Chapterone.pdf|title=The Founding of the Mount Royal Club in 1899 and its Position within Montreal’s Cultural and Social Milieu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]] found it to be "one of the best clubs I know in the [[New World]], with the indefinable atmosphere about it of a good [[London]] club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/frederick-edwin-smith-earl-of-birkenhead/my-american-visit-ala/page-11-my-american-visit-ala.shtml|title=Read the eBook My American visit by Frederick Edwin Smith Birkenhead online for free (page 11 of 16)|first=Denis Larionov &amp; Alexander|last=Zhulin|website=www.ebooksread.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As much as the next generation spent their money on parties, new houses, grand refurbishments and summer homes, they also continued to pour money back into [[education]], [[health]], and [[culture]]; albeit for the most part to the benefit of Montreal's anglophone community. Giving an estimated $100 million to charity in his lifetime, [[John Wilson McConnell|McConnell]] followed in the magnanimous steps of some of Montreal's best remembered philanthropists, such as Lord Strathcona, to whom [[King Edward VII]] referred to as "Uncle Donald" in recognition of his generosity towards charitable causes across the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Strathcona: A Biography of Donald Alexander Smith (2002), by Donna McDonald&lt;/ref&gt;

A strong British influence predominated in the Golden Square Mile during this era. This was recognised in London by increasingly frequent [[Royal tours of Canada|Royal visits]]. "The [[Union Jack]] flew from Ravenscrag (since inherited by Sir Montague Allan)"&lt;ref&gt;All Our Yesterdays (1983), by Edgar Allan Collard&lt;/ref&gt; where the [[Montreal Hunt]] now met, and [[George Alexander Drummond|Lady Drummond]] was heard to reflect the sentiments of the Square Mile by stating, "the [[British Empire|Empire]] is my country. Canada is my home".&lt;ref name="The Square Mile 1987" /&gt; The best households were not always necessarily run by Canadians, but by governesses, butlers, cooks, nursemaids and maids sourced from Britain, who were used to working in large houses.

;List of principal structures built
* Hector Mackenzie House, on the corner of Mountain and Sherbrooke Streets. Built 1891, designed by John Hopkins. Used as the Air Force Club during [[World War II]], it was afterwards acquired by [[Standard Life (Canada)|Standard Life]] and demolished in 1960 to make way for its new office tower.

The house was designed by the [[William Sutherland Maxwell|Maxwell brothers]] and the gardens were laid out by [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted &amp; Eliot]]. The house was enlarged again in 1906. Lady Meredith gave it to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] to be used a nurses residence in 1941. [[McGill University]] purchased the building in 1975, and renamed it ''Lady Meredith House''. It was designated a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1990. 
* Clouston House, Peel Street. Built 1894, by the Maxwell brothers for [[Edward Clouston|Sir Edward Clouston, 1st Bt.]]. The imposing [[Château]] style mansion had a round corner tower capped by a conical roof and connected by way of a [[loggia]] to a polygonal oriel. The house was finished in rough masonry of [[Buff (colour)|buff]] and red [[sandstone]]. Sculptor Henry Beaumont designed the decorative stone carvings on the exterior. Construction of the building cost $44,715. The house was demolished in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/maxwells/details.php?recordCount=304&amp;Page=3&amp;id=55&amp;pn=&amp;cn=&amp;pr=&amp;ct=&amp;str=&amp;mj=&amp;mn=&amp;sta=|title=Canadian Architecture Collection - McGill University, Montreal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
[[File:Residence H-Vincent-Meredith 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vincent Meredith|Sir Vincent and Lady Meredith]] converted their home, ''[[Lady Meredith House|Ardvana]]'' (above), into a rehabilitation centre for Canadian soldiers returning from [[Western Front (World War I)|the Front]]]]
The men associated with the Beaver Club, the predecessors of the Square Milers, had almost all served in the Canadian Militia and on the outbreak of the First World War the next generation did not hesitate to take up arms. At his own expense, [[Andrew Gault|Hamilton Gault]] raised [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], the last privately raised regiment in the British Empire. He was injured three times leading his regiment into battle, and even after losing a leg he still returned to the Front.&lt;ref&gt;Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (1972), by Jeffrey Williams&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Lord Strathcona's Horse]], raised by that [[Canadian peers and baronets|Canadian peer]] for the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], was once again returned to action. The British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] claimed to his biographer that had the war continued into 1919, he would have sought to replace [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Douglas Haig]] with the Square Mile's [[Arthur Currie|General Sir Arthur Currie]].&lt;ref name = flanders&gt;{{cite book| last = Dancocks| first = Daniel G.| title = Welcome to Flanders Fields| publisher = McLelland and Stewart | year = 1988| location = Toronto| page = 245| isbn = 0-7710-2545-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ladies of the Square Mile raised money for the troops and some like [[Vincent Meredith|Lady Meredith]], the [[Andrew Gault|Gault]]s and the [[Alfred Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]s opened their houses to injured soldiers returning from [[Europe]]. The personal services in [[England]] of the [[Canadian Red Cross]] were under the charge of [[George Alexander Drummond|Lady Julia Drummond]] who saw that each Canadian soldier returned to an English hospital received a visit offering sympathy and supplying any basic needs. When [[Martha Allan]] trained as a [[nurse]] and bought an ambulance which she drove in [[France]], her mother was inspired to set up a hospital in [[England]] for Canadian soldiers.

Economically, [[Montreal]] would emerge from the war nearly unscathed, due in a large part to the steady hand of the president of the Bank of Montreal, [[Vincent Meredith|Sir Vincent Meredith]]. In 1919, fifty families were said to have controlled a third of Canada's invested wealth,&lt;ref name="The Square Mile 1987"/&gt; and the great majority of them were based in [[Montreal]].

===The End of an Era===
[[File:St. James Street, Montreal.jpg|thumb|The [[Molson Bank]] on St. James Street, [[Montreal]], in 1872]]
[[File:St. James Street, Montreal, c.1895.jpg|thumb|upright|St. James Street, the financial centre of [[Montreal]] at its peak in 1895]]
[[File:Sun-Life-Building-June-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Built in 1931, the [[Sun Life Building]] on Dorchester Square was in its time the largest edifice in the [[British Empire]]]]
The Square Mile had reached its peak in the [[Edwardian era]], both in spirit and substance. What followed was a steady decline as aggressive American-style corporations took control of the family businesses whose origins laid with the [[Scots-Quebecer]]s and the Beaver Club. 'New money' swept into Montreal from the United States, [[Western Canada]] and, such as the [[Bronfman family]], from different ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Remembrance of Grandeur: The Anglo-Protestant elite of Montreal, 1900-1950; Margaret W. Westley (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to the [[Canadiens]] of the [[Ancien Régime]] a [[century]] before, the Square Milers with their old-fashioned British ideals and business principles did not adapt to the changes in society and held themselves aloof. Newcomers, who neither knew nor cared about the [[wikt:Old guard|old guard]] and their traditions were more often than not barred from entry into Square Mile society (such as membership to Montreal's most prestigious men's club, the Mount Royal), but this only served to further alieniate the declining [[enclave]].

Changing attitudes, [[First World War|the war]], the introduction of [[income tax]] and the invasion of commerce in the streets below [[Sherbrooke Street|Sherbrooke]] all played their part in the decline. The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] affected a great number of Square Milers, though not as badly as it did their American counterparts. Art collections were sold and some tried to sell their houses, but there were no takers. The [[J.K.L. Ross]] House was sold for $50,000 in 1930, only a few years after it had been valued at $1 million. Those who had relied on investments moved to smaller, more heat-efficient houses in Westmount or took apartments at the [[Ritz-Carlton Montreal]], whereas others like [[Herbert Samuel Holt|Sir Herbert Samuel Holt]], who never dealt on margin, emerged untouched.

The [[Great Depression in Canada]] during the 1930s fueled the [[Quebec nationalist]] movement and set the course for the Quiet Revolution. The social divide between anglophones employers and French Canadian workers in Quebec had existed for a long time, but the economic turmoil of the Great Depression led to calls for change from the status quo. For the next four decades the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government, with the support of the [[Catholic Church]], dominated Quebec politics, undermining anglophone domination.

In 1977, the newly elected Parti Québécois (PQ) government passed the [[Charter of the French Language]] (known as Bill 101), making the use of [[French language]] mandatory for medium and large-scale companies when communicating with French-speaking staff. This law, the election of the PQ, and the threat of Quebec independence caused instability in the province's business environment, and accelerated the move of some companies' headquarters from Montreal to other Canadian cities, including Calgary and Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/23/archives/montreals-malaise-aggravated-by-separatism-vote-a-longstanding.html|title=Montreal's Malaise Aggravated by Separatism Vote|last=Giniger|first=Henry|date=1979-07-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies remained in Montreal, including the [[Montreal Exchange]] [[North America]]'s oldest [[brewery]], [[Molson]]s, but others moved their headquarters elsewhere, such as the [[Bank of Montreal]], [[Sun Life Building|Sun Life Financial]], the [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Trust]] and [[The Guarantee Company of North America]]. Toronto had surpassed Montreal as the financial capital of Canada in 1934, and the move of these companies out of Montreal marked the end of an era.

==Demolition==

It was demolished in 2014.]]
By the end of [[World War II]], the homes within the Square Mile were for the most part left empty or only partially occupied. Montreal's central business district had shifted northwest toward Sherbrooke Street, in the area of the Square Mile. From 1945 to 1965, many of the great mansions were acquired by commercial and civic institutions and demolished or repurposed beyond all recognition.

The majority of the mansions were demolished and replaced with high-rise office or residential developments, but some two dozen other homes were also transformed into university or commercial offices. Ravenscrag was left by Sir Montague and Lady Allan to the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] in 1942. The sumptuous residence was converted into the [[Allan Memorial Institute]], and [[McGill University]] used its fourteen acres of grounds to erect subsidiary buildings.

Some demolitions were controversial. The [[Van Horne Mansion]], the centre of Square Mile society since the 1930s was demolished by promoter [[David Azrieli]] in 1973, igniting a vigorous public debate regarding conservation of historical buildings, and the reasons for which a building should be preserved. The demolition of the Van Horne mansion led to the establishment of [[Heritage Montreal]] to protect historic buildings at the provincial level. The architectural character of the neighbourhood stabilized, but the original Square Mile as it had been had already changed beyond recoginition.

==Prospect of further demolition==
Modern architecture has emphasis the integration of older buildings with new developments. An example is [[Maison Alcan]], formerly the home of [[Lord Atholstan]], which became the headquarters of [[Alcan]] in the early 1980s. Another example is [[Lady Meredith House]], home to [[McGill University|McGill]]'s Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law, which was broken into and set on fire in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/campus/buildings/Lady_Meredith_House.html|title=Lady Meredith House "Ardvarna"|first=David|last=Johnson|website=cac.mcgill.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGill subsequently renovated and retrofitted the old house to its original elegance, hiring Julia Gersovitz, a McGill graduate and professor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterfurnace.com/pdfs/casestudies/wf924.pdf Last Century's Structure Retrofitted for the Next - Waterfurnace International Inc.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823225414/http://www.waterfurnace.com/pdfs/casestudies/wf924.pdf |date=2015-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, threats to the built heritage of the Square Mile remain.

===Royal Victoria Hospital===
The buildings formerly occupied by the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal|Royal Victoria Hospital]] and the remaining property on which they stand have been empty since 2015, when the hospital itself moved into the new 'McGill Superhospital' in the Glen Yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.montrealgazette.com/2012/01/26/montreals-superhospital-construction-checkup/|title=Montreal's superhospital construction check up|date=26 January 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Vic, a veritable Montreal landmark, has been expanded several times since it was built in 1893, and the changes have never before been cause for concern. In 1891, the public-spirited Lords [[Lord Mount Stephen|Mount Stephen]] and [[Lord Strathcona|Strathcona]] purchased the land and gave the necessary funds to the [[City of Montreal]] for which to build the hospital. However, they attached a caveat to their donation, stating that the land and its buildings must only ever be used for education and healing.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv-fVyiHaxo|title=Elspeth Angus and the Royal Victoria hospital|first=|last=Montreal Gazette|date=16 December 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010, Elspeth Angus (born in 1929), a descendant of [[Richard B. Angus|R.B. Angus]] and an heir as the grand-niece of [[Lord Mount Stephen]], has been fighting to maintain not just the wishes but the conditions set down by the founders to the city, and find use for the land and its buildings as a [[Research institute|research facility]].&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; [[Heritage Montreal]] are also supporting her in her efforts. In 2014, McGill University released a proposal for the integration of the site into the McGill campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=McGill University outlines plan for Royal Victoria Hospital|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/mcgill-university-outlines-plan-for-royal-victoria-hospital-1.2621626|accessdate=29 August 2015|publisher=CBC News|date=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francis Redpath Mansion===

Built in 1886, it was designed by the noted architect [[Andrew Taylor (architect)|Sir Andrew Taylor]] and was one of the last of his residential projects still standing in the city. In 1986, the Sochaczevski family, the new owners of Francis Redpath's house, began demolition in order to replace it with yet another a vista-changing [[condominium]] block. A portion of the house was destroyed before a [[injunction|court injunction]] was taken out and its destruction was temporarily halted.&lt;ref name="heritagemontreal.org"/&gt;

In 2001, Mayor [[Pierre Bourque (politician)|Pierre Bourque]] granted immediate demolition of the house. In 2002, following intervention by [[Heritage Montreal]], [[Projet Montréal]] and local citizens, the ''Commission d’arbitrage de la Ville de Montréal'' refused the demolition permit granted by the Bourque administration, on the grounds of the solidity of the house and reminding the owner of his obligation to keep it in good condition—the Sochaczevski family had signed an agreement with the [[Montreal City Council]] to maintain the house when they bought it in 1986, but did nothing to maintain, protect or stabilize it.&lt;ref name="heritagemontreal.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thelinknewspaper.ca"&gt;[http://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/910/ (Four Stories) Above the Law Forthcoming Redpath Development Violates Montreal's Zoning Bylaw, published in ''The Link'', Concordia University's Independent Newspaper, 31 January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mayoral candidate, [[Gérald Tremblay]] portrayed himself as a defender of the Redpath house and heritage buildings, but as soon as he gained office—strongly backed by [[The Suburban]] newspaper, owned by the Sochaczevski family—he considered a plan to allow demolition to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projetmontreal.org/communiques/projet-montral-s-oppose-la-dmolition-de-la-maison-redpath_fr/?lang=en|title=Projet Montreal Opposes Redpath Mansion Demolition - January 13, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew his support after the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] stepped in to object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/West-end-Times/16.21westendtimes/2011020401/7.html#6|title=West End Times, February 6, 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Mayor [[Denis Coderre]] approved the final demolition permit, to be carried out in February 2014. It was demolished on March 19, 2014, just two weeks after Quebec Culture and Communications Minister [[Maka Kotto]] intervened to order a halt to the mansion's demolition, in accordance with the Cultural Heritage Act, the Court intervened—at the owner’s request—to shorten the period granted in the minister’s order. Heritage Montreal expressed regret that the discussions were limited to the owner and the minister, not the community nor municipal authorities. After these talks with the owner, Kotto concluded that Redpath House “does not present a national heritage interest,” and gave the go ahead for it to be torn down to make for way for the promoter's development.

==Plot summary==
An easy going young man named Jack, a bit of a directionless 'lost-soul' and previous hedonistic 'wild-child' alcoholic (and unfortunate believer that most he's attempted in life he's failed at miserably) is attempting to, on this his seventh straight year of sobriety, to straighten out his life once and for all by taking his relationship in a more serious direction with a proposal of marriage. He's [[cohabitation|living with]] his partner Camilla, an assertive aspiring young doctor who is pretty much the driving force (not to mention, main financial supporter) of their otherwise contented life together. And even though he live in a house bought and paid for by Camilla's wealthy father, still Jack struggles to afford an engagement ring to go with the very proposal he's just sprung on his tearfully accepting now fiancee. Camilla, not only jumps straight into reception planning, but having previously suffered a problematic miscarriage, pregnancy preoccupation and planning has shot to the top of her priorities list. Jack, though terrified at the idea of becoming a father, is nevertheless even more fearful of loosing the only thing truly stable and loving in his life, so silently acquiesces to fiancee's wishes. But... little does he know just how much his life is about to change, when he answers the door to someone he doesn't immediately recognise but who certainly seems to know him...  

The incessant ringer at the door, who's just showed up and about to implode his life with a mere but loaded sentence, is Anna ([[Anna Friel]]). Soon Jack is reminded that Anna is someone he drunkenly hooked-up with at some concert 8 years previously - a [[one-night stand]] as it happens - and informs him that they have a seven-year-old son called Phoenix. At first Jack is rude and dismissive, clutching at denials and misremembered snippets of having worn a condom. But Anna's insistence on a paternity test soon sets him on the right path to accept and meet his son. Jack begins to spend time with Phoenix but is reluctant to tell Camilla about everything that has been going on, unsure how to juggle both sides of his life at once. Meanwhile, Camilla's meticulous ovulation tracking soon means that Jack is about to be father for a second time. However, fearful of losing out, Jack mishandles the situation by not be ing honest with either party. Camilla, however, soon finds out the truth when Phoenix needs to be rushed to the hospital she's working at after a nasty fall from a jungle-gym at the playground during one of their weekly visits. Consequently, feeling lied to and betrayed, Camilla kicks Jack out the house, cancels their wedding plans and wants nothing to do with him. Jack is rather devastated and attempts to explain and set things right, but ultimately understands that the right choice is actually making his son his priority and two just give the situation some time.  

Later it is revealed that Anna has a [[terminal illness]] ([[ovarian cancer]]) and that Anna's awareness of doomed fate is what prompted her to seek out Jack in the first place. In order that Phoenix not be left alone in the world after such a traumatic event as losing his mother. She asks Jack to promise to care for Phoenix as he'll be needing his father more than ever once she's gone - which Jack immediately agrees and promises to do. In the end Anna dies and Phoenix goes to live with Jack, who eventually makes things right with Camilla too. The film ends just before Camilla is due to give birth to their baby. But it's implied that the four will go on to heal and grow into one happy family together, finally having all they wished for (even more so!) at the beginning of the film.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Having You 2013 at Finite Films|url=http://www.finitefilmsandtv.com/having-you-film/|publisher=finitefilmsandtv.com|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4406">{{redirect|Hit Parade}}
A '''hit parade''' is a ranked list of the most popular recordings at a given point in time, usually determined by sales and/or [[airplay]]. The term originated in the 1930s; [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]] published its first music hit parade on January 4, 1936.  It has also been used by broadcast programs which featured hit (sheet music and record) tunes&lt;ref name="jdun"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunning|first=John |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-time Radio |publisher=Oxford University Press US |date=1998 |edition=revised |page=739 |isbn=0-19-507678-8 |accessdate=19 September 2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&amp;pg=PA738#v=twopage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Your Hit Parade]]'', which aired on [[radio]] and [[television]] in the [[United States]] from 1935 through the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dunning, 1998, p.738&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==
Hit tunes were originally published as sheet music, so many artists were encouraged to introduce or promote a tune in different styles, formats or areas of popularity. Through the late 1940s, the term ''hit parade'' referred to a list of compositions, not a list of records. In those times, when a tune became a hit, it was typically recorded by several different artists. Each [[record company]] often promoted its own product through the airtime it purchased on commercial radio stations. Most non-commercial stations, like the [[BBC]], were required by national regulations to promote local talent, and were also limited in the amount of ''[[needle time]]'' given to recorded popular music.

In later years, a re-recording of a tune originally introduced or popularised by a certain artist was called a ''[[cover version]]''. In the United States, regardless of copyright, covers were an automatic option &amp;ndash; since the [[Copyright Act of 1909]] &amp;ndash; enabled by [[Compulsory license|compulsory mechanical licenses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115|title=U.S. Copyright Office - Copyright Law: Chapter 1|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat031104.html|title=U.S. Copyright Office: Section 115 Compulsory License|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covers were often rejected by fans of the particular artists because it produced [[unfair competition]] to their favourite version.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Covering a tune was, therefore, not offering an alternative rendition, but of producing a copy as a direct alternative to compete for airtime, sales and placement on the hit parade charts.

==Rock and roll period==
As [[rock and roll]] became popular, it was more difficult for generic singers to cover the tunes. It has been said that ''Your Hit Parade'' was nearly cancelled after many weeks of unsuccessful attempts by the [[big band|big-band]] singer [[Snooky Lanson]] to perform [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]" in 1956. The program finally ended in 1959.

The term is still used, as in the title of the popular magazine ''[[Hit Parader]]'' and the [[Canada|Canadian]] record label Hit Parade Records. The British indie band [[The Hit Parade (group)|The Hit Parade]] took its name from the US TV show.

The title ''Hit Parade'' also became familiar during the late 1960s and early 1970s through a popular automated music format produced by the [[Drake-Chenault|Drake-Chenault Co.]] and featured on hundreds of radio stations. Originally called ''Hit Parade '68'', then ''Hit Parade '69'' and ''Hit Parade '70'', it was then entitled simply ''Hit Parade''.

==Europe==
The term ''hit parade'' was commonly used in the [[United Kingdom]] around the 1950s and 1960s to refer to the current chart, but rapidly fell out of favour and came to be seen as archaic and old-fashioned, today the term hit parade is usually used by people when referring to the success of [[oldies]] and [[schlager]] hits from around those times. It is also still commonly used to refer to current charts in the 21st century as a loan word in several countries and languages of mainland Europe.

'''''Imaginary Conversations''''' is a publication consisting of five volumes of imaginary conversations, mainly between historical people of classical Greece and Rome, composed by the English author [[Walter Savage Landor]]. Landor's fame rests on this prose. The work is of great interest as a specimen of the poetic prose full of rich imagery &amp; ornate diction as seen in De Quincey.

==Background==
The Imaginary Conversations were begun when Landor, aged 46, was living with his family in [[Florence]] during 1821 where he had rooms in the Medici Palace and later rented the Villa Castigilione. The idea of the compositions began during his childhood as he wrote later: ''"When I was younger..[a]mong the chief pleasures of my life, and among the commonest of my occupations was the bringing before me such heroes and heroines of antiquity, such poets and sages, such of the prosperous and unfortunate as most interested me … Engaging them in conversations best suited to their characters..."''.&lt;ref&gt;H Van Thal ''Landor:a biographical anthology'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The unenthusiastic reception of Landor's play “Count Julian” demonstrated that Landor, while adept at dialogue, lacked the dramatic capability necessary to convert it to stage performance, and he destroyed another tragedy “Ferranti and Giulio” in frustration at his publishers. 

At Florence, Landor was corresponding with [[Robert Southey]], who had planned to write a book of "Colloquies", and they considered collaborating on a project. Landor had finished fifteen dialogues by 9 March 1822, and sent them to [[Longman]]'s company.  Longman would not publish, so by the influence of his friend Julius Hare, he managed to get an agreement with the company of Taylor &amp; Hessey to publish them. Some disputes with the publishers followed in which both Southey and [[William Wordsworth]] became involved, not without some embarrassment to Southey as one of the "Conversations" was between Southey and Porson on the merits of Wordsworth's poetry. During 1824, two volumes were published with eighteen conversations in each. The third volume of Imaginary Conversations was published by Henry Colburn during 1828 but Julius Hare was frustrated by Colburn’s delays, and the fourth and fifth volumes were finally published by James Duncan during 1829. Over the succeeding years Landor published occasional Imaginary Conversations as individual publications and collated a number of them during 1853.

==[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s Appraisal==
{{cquote|The very finest flower of his dialogues is probably to be found in the single volume  ''Imaginary Conversations of Greeks and Romans''; his command of passion and pathos may be tested by its success in the distilled and concentrated tragedy of ''Tiberius and Vipsania'', where for once he shows a quality more proper to romantic than classical imagination: the subtle and sublime and terrible power to enter the dark vestibule of distraction, to throw the whole force of his fancy, the whole fire of his spirit, into the shadowing passion (as Shakespeare calls it) of gradually imminent insanity. Yet, if this and all other studies from ancient history or legend could be subtracted from the volume of his work, enough would be left whereon to rest the foundation of a fame which time could not sensibly impair.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica 1882&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interliterary mentions==
''Imaginary Conversations'' was a favorite book of the character ''Tibby'' in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel, ''[[Howards End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. ''Howards End''. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 11, {{ISBN|978-0-679-40668-6}} (US)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mentioned in the book and film &lt;i&gt;84 Charing Cross Road&lt;/i&gt; by Helene Hanff.

The '''Indian Naval Ensign''' (also known as the '''Indian White Ensign''') is a naval ensign used by ships of the [[Indian Navy]].

The blue ensign of the [[Star of India (flag)|Star of India]] was used from 1879–1928 as the [[naval ensign]] of Her Majesty's Indian Marine (1879-1892) and then the Royal Indian Marine (1892-1928). It then became the [[naval jack]] and was used from 1928–1947 by the Royal Indian Marine (1928-1934) and then the Royal Indian Navy (1934-1950). The [[white ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]] was used from 1928–1950 as the naval ensign of the Royal Indian Marine and then the Royal Indian Navy. The [[Flag of India]] has been used since 1947 as the naval jack of the Indian Navy.

From 26 January 1950, when India became a republic, until 2001, the Indian Navy used a modified version of the British Naval Ensign, with the Union Flag replaced with the Indian Tricolor in the canton.&lt;ref name="insignia"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Designs of Crests and Badges in the Services|url=http://pib.nic.in/archive/docs/DVD_38/ACC%20NO%20807-BR/HOM-1950-01-06_484.pdf|website=Press Information Bureau of India - Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, this flag was replaced with a white ensign bearing the Indian Navy crest, as the previous ensign was thought to reflect India's colonial past. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2004/apr/23navy.htm|title=Indian Navy to change its ensign|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However complaints arose that the new ensign was indistinguishable as the blue of the naval crest easily merged with the sky and the ocean. Hence in 2004, the ensign was changed back to the [[St. George's cross]] design, with the addition of the emblem of India in the intersection of the cross. 

In 2014, the ensign as well as the naval crest was further modified to correct the omission of the national motto in [[Devanagari]] script: '''सत्यमेव जयते''' ([[Satyameva Jayate]]) which means 'Truth Alone Triumphs' in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2716049/Indian-Navy-launch-Satyameva-Jayate-credo-new-logo.html|title=Indian Navy to launch Satyameva Jayate credo with a new logo|accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Children's Book Day''' ('''ICBD''') is a yearly event sponsored by the [[International Board on Books for Young People]] (IBBY), an international non-profit organization. Founded in 1967, the day is observed on or around [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s birthday, April 2. Activities include writing competitions, announcements of book awards and events with authors of [[children's literature]].

Each year a different National Section of IBBY has the opportunity to be the international sponsor of ICBD. It decides upon a theme and invites a prominent author from the host country to write a message to the children of the world and a well-known illustrator to design a poster. These materials are used in different ways to promote books and reading. Many IBBY Sections promote ICBD through the media and organize activities in schools and public libraries. Often ICBD is linked to celebrations around children's books and other special events that may include encounters with authors and illustrators, writing competitions or announcements of book awards.

{{Culture of Bengal}}
'''Kalighat painting''' or '''Kalighat Pat''' originated in the 19th century [[Bengal]], in the vicinity of [[Kalighat Kali Temple]], [[Kalighat]], [[Kolkata]], [[India]], and from being items of souvenir taken by the visitors to the Kali temple, the paintings over a period of time developed as a distinct school of [[Indian painting]].  From the depiction of Hindu gods, [[Hindu goddess|god]], and other [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] characters, the Kalighat paintings developed to reflect a variety of themes.

==History==
[[File:The demon ravana fighting with the ape hanuman, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ravana]] and [[Hanuman]], Kalighat school of painting, c1880]]
[[File:Kalighat Ganesha in the lap of Parvati.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Ganesha in the lap of Parvati]]
[[File:The goddess durga on her lion kills the demon mahishasura, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Durga]] and [[Mahishasura]], c.1880]]
In the nineteenth century, the only school of painting that was flourishing in Bengal was the traditional art of scroll paintings that was popular in the rural areas. These paintings were done on cloth or patas. They depicted conventional images of gods and goddesses and scenes from epics like Tulsidas’ Rama charita manas. The artists were villagers who travelled from place to place with their scroll paintings and sang the scenes from the epics depicted in the paintings during village gatherings and various festivals. These artists, called patuas or ‘painters on cloth’.

[[File:Kalighat Temple, 1887.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Kalighat]], Kolkata- shown with the [[Kalighat Temple]] and the river, [[Adi Ganga]]]]
Meanwhile, the British, having established themselves in the country politically started to evince interest in art, literature, and music. They set up institutions that imparted a European style of academic training to Indian artists. The Calcutta School of Art was one such school and attracted traditional artists–the patuas—to the city.
Initially these artists were concentrated around the temple at Kalighat where there was a demand for religious art. Gradually, they started to learn from the newer techniques and discovered that these could help them increase their earnings. They started creating new forms of art and the Kalighat painting was born.

===Oriental and Occidental Kalighat===
The Kalighat School was an agreeable and unique blend of two different styles of painting—the Oriental and the Occidental—and steadily gained popularity. Among the deities that the Kalighat artists painted, the goddess Kali was a favorite. Images of Durga, Lakshmi, and Annapurna were also popular, especially during the Durga Puja festival. The artists also portrayed themes like Sita-Rama, Radha-Krishna and the exploits of Hanuman. 
Another theme depicted, dear to the Bengali ethos, was that of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his disciples. But the Kalighat artists did not restrict themselves to religious themes. Their paintings depicting different professions and costumes were also popular with the tourists. Even contemporary events like crime were the subject of many paintings. The artists also chose to portray secular themes and personalities and in the process played a role in the Independence movement. They painted historic  characters like Rani Lakshmibai, and Duldul the famous horse of Imam Hussain of Karbala.

==Capturing Daily Life==

An important achievement of the Kalighat artistes was that they made simple paintings and drawings, which could easily be reproduced by lithography. Such prints were then hand coloured. This trend continued up to the early part of the twentieth century and these paintings ended up in museums and private collections. The charm of the Kalighat paintings lies in the fact that they captured the essence of daily life and they influence modern artistes like the late [[Jamini Roy]] even to this day.

An annotated '''list of popular/famous dancers'''.

{{compact ToC|num=yes}}

== A ==

*[[Fifi Abdou]] (born {{Birth date|1953|04|26|df=yes}}), Egyptian [[belly dancer]] and actress. She rose to fame in the 1970s, and was one of the most famous and successful Egyptian dance stars throughout the 1980s and 1990s until her retirement in the 2000s. She has been the subject of several controversies during her long career.
*[[Paula Abdul]] (born {{Birth date|1962|06|16|df=yes}}), American recording artist, dancer, choreographer, and actress. Before achieving widespread fame as a recording artist in the early 1990s, Abdul, a former high school [[cheerleader]], was a heavily sought-after choreographer who has designed dance routines for several well-known performers, including singer [[Janet Jackson]]. In her music videos, Abdul has exhibited skills in a variety of dance styles, including [[hip-hop dance|hip-hop]], [[tap dance|tap]], and [[Freestyle dance|freestyle]]. Abdul's major television breakthrough came in 2002, when she became a judge on the popular reality television talent competition ''[[American Idol]]'', a role in which she remained for seven years. In 2011 Abdul was one of the judges on the American version of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]'', another reality television singing competition.
*[[Fred Astaire]] ({{Birth date|1899|05|10|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1987|06|22|df=yes}}), American film and Broadway stage dancer, choreographer, singer, musician and actor. He was an innovator in dance. He made 31 musical films and was honored with the fifth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the [[American Film Institute]].

==B==
*[[George Balanchine]] ({{Birth date|1904|01|22|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1983|04|30|df=yes}}), Georgian ballet choreographer. He is one of the 20th century's foremost choreographers, and one of the founders of American ballet. His work formed a bridge between classical and modern ballet. Apollo is Balanchine's oldest surviving ballet and his first great public ballet which Balanchine was to become renowned for. It premiered on June 12, 1928 by Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhart in Paris. Balanchine looked upon Apollo as the turning point of his life, "in its sustained oneness of tone and feeling". The story centers around Apollo, the god of the sun, who is visited by three muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance; Polyhymnia, muse of hymns; and Calliope, muse of poetry. Balanchine created ballet sequences for Ravel's opera ''L'enfant et les sortilèges'' to Colette's libretto with what Ravel described as "Russian dancers", presumably from the Ballets Russes for the 1925 Monte Carlo premiere, although this is not listed as a Ballets Russes production.
*[[Sara Baras]] (born 1971), female [[Flamenco]] Dancer, born in the port of Cadiz. She is internationally famous and regularly tours the world. She has won a number of awards including the Madroño Flamenco of Montellano (Seville) in 1993,and in 1999 and 2001, she received a prize for the Best Female Spanish Dance Performer.
*[[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] (born {{Birth date|1948|01|28|df=yes}}), Soviet-born Russian American dancer, choreographer, and actor, often cited alongside [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]] as one of the greatest ballet dancers of the 20th century. After a promising start in the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, he defected to Canada in 1974 and went on to become a principal dancer and artistic director with the American Ballet Theatre and the New York City Ballet in New York City. He has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting modern dance, premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own. His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema and television has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary dancer.
*[[Bez (dancer)|Bez]] (born {{Birth date|1964|04|18|df=yes}}), renowned as the dancer for the [[Happy Mondays]].
*[[Vytautas Beliajus]] ({{Birth date|1908|02|26|df=yes}} – September 1994), considered the father of [[international folk dancing]] in the United States. He specialized in [[Music of Lithuania|Lithuanian dance]], but performed and taught many other types of dance as well. He published multiple books on the subjects of dance and ethnicity, and also started the folklore magazine Viltis. Beliajus was born in Lithuania and emigrated to the U.S. when he was 14 years old. He had two younger brothers, Leonas and Julius, and a sister, Gyte Jekentes.
*[[Carlo Blasis]] ({{Birth date|1797|11|04|df=yes}} – {{Death date|1878|01|15|df=yes}}), Italian dancer, choreographer and dance theoretician. He is well known for his very rigorous dance classes, sometimes lasting four hours long. He was the first who published an analysis on the ballet techniques in 1820, in a work named ''Traité élémentaire, théorique, et pratique de l'art de la danse'' (''Elementary Treaty on the Art of the Dance, theory and practice''). He is most known for the pose "Attitude" derived from the famous statue Mercury by Giovanni da Bologna. He taught [[Enrico Cecchetti]], who expanded his technique.
*[[Chrystelle Trump Bond]], American dancer, choreographer, and dance historian
*[[James Brown]] or James Joseph Brown, Jr. ({{Birth date|1933|05|03|df=yes}} – {{Death date|2006|12|25|df=yes}}), commonly referred to as "The Godfather of Soul", "Mr. Dynamite", the "King of Funk", "Soul Brother #1" and "The Hardest Working Man in Show Business", was an American entertainer (singer and dancer). He is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th-century popular music and was renowned for his vocals and feverish dancing. As a prolific singer, songwriter and bandleader, Brown was a pivotal force in the music industry. He left his mark on numerous artists. Brown's music also left its mark on the rhythms of African popular music, such as afrobeat, jùjú and mbalax, and provided a template for go-go music. Brown began his professional music career in 1953 and rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s on the strength of his thrilling live performances and string of smash hits. During the early 1980s, Brown's music helped to shape the rhythms of early hip-hop music, with numerous groups looping or sampling his funk grooves and turning them into what became hip hop classics and the foundations of the music and dance genre. Brown danced vigorously as he sang, working popular dance steps such as the [[Mashed Potato]] into his routine along with dramatic leaps, splits and slides. In addition, his horn players and backup singers ([[The Famous Flames]]) typically performed choreographed dance routines, and later incarnations of the [[Revue]] included backup dancers. Male performers in the Revue were required to wear tuxedos and cummerbunds long after more casual concert wear became the norm among the younger musical acts. Brown's own extravagant outfits and his elaborate processed hairdo completed the visual impression.
*[[Jean Butler]] (born {{Birth date|1971|03|14|df=yes}}), Irish [[step dancer]].She began training in Irish dance at the age of four with the widely respected teacher Donny Golden. She also participated in tap and ballet classes, but step dance became her focus. Her talent was clear from a young age, and she competed in regional, national and international championships. She and her sister, Cara Butler, both went on to win numerous national titles and regional titles, and placing well in international competitions. Jean has performed with Green Fields of America and Cherish the Ladies. She debuted with The Chieftains at Carnegie Hall at the age of seventeen, and toured with them on three continents.

[[Merce Cunningham]] Dance Company was formed at Black Mountain College in the summer of 1953. Since that time Cunningham has choreographed nearly 200 works for his company. In 1973 he choreographed Un jour ou deux for the Ballet of the Paris Opéra, with music by Cage and set design by Jasper Johns. The Ballet of the Paris Opéra also performed a revival of his ''Points in Space'' in 1990. His work has also been presented by New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Boston Ballet, White Oak Dance Project, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, Zurich Ballet, and Rambert Dance Company (London), among others. Cunningham's interest in contemporary technology has led him to work with the computer program Dance Forms, which he has used in making all his dances since ''Trackers'' (1991).Another of Cunningham's innovations was the development of what might be called "non-representative" dance which simply emphasizes movement: in Cunningham's choreography, dancers do not necessarily represent any historical figure, emotional situation, or idea.

*[[Lloyd Shaw (educator)|Lloyd Shaw]] (1890 – 1958), also known as Dr. Lloyd "Pappy" Shaw, was an educator, and is generally credited with bringing about the broad revival of square dancing in America. He was superintendent/principal/teacher/coach for Cheyenne Mountain Schools, Colorado Springs, Colorado from 1916–1951, and taught [[folk dancing]] .Shaw traveled the country, and compiled instructions for traditional square dances from different callers all over the country. He documented them, and tried them out on the students he taught. He formed the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers, a high-school exhibition team, which toured the United States in the 1930s and 1940s, appearing in more than 50 major cities .As the popularity of square dancing grew, square dance callers began extracting individual calls from these dances, and attempts at standardised lists were developed. These lists were later adopted by callers, and organizations such as Callerlab and later the American Callers Association formed to manage and promote a universal list and the type of dance leadership that Shaw envisioned.
*[[Jimmy Slyde]] (born 1927), who is known as the King of Slides, is a world-renowned [[tap dancer]], especially famous for his innovative tap style mixed with [[jazz]]. Slyde's profile in the United States revived noticeably in the 1980s. He danced in the films ''The Cotton Club'', ''Tap'' and ''Round Midnight'', as well as a number of television specials. He collaborated with Steve Condos on a program of jazz tap improvisation at the Smithsonian Institution and performed across the United States and in South America. In 1989, Slyde received a Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut in the musical Black and Blue. In recent years, Slyde has received a number of significant honors, including the NEA National Heritage Fellowship Award (1999), the Charles "Honi" Coles Award (2001), a Guggenheim Fellowship for Choreography (2003), and an honorary Doctorate of Performing Arts from Oklahoma City University. Slyde is still performing and teaching today throughout the United States. He continues to stress the importance of mastering the basics and using sliding cascades of taps close to the floor.
*"Shorty" [[George Snowden]] was an African American dancer in Harlem during the 1920s and 1930s. He is popularly credited with coining the name "[[Lindy Hop]]" for a popular partner swing dance of the day. He is also often credited with inventing the dance, though this is unsubstantiated and unlikely. Snowden was a popular dancer at the [[Savoy Ballroom]] in Harlem, New York, in the United States and appears in the film After Seben (1929), in which he performs the breakaway, a variation on the Charleston, which later developed into the Lindy Hop. He can also be seen in the film'' Ask Uncle Sol'' (1937), dancing with his most famous partner Big Bea.
*[[Britney Spears]] (born December 2, 1981), American singer and dancer. Apart from being famous for her hit singles "[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]" and "[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!...I Did It Again]]", she is also internationally renowned for her unique outfits and her entertaining and freestyle dancing. Her debut single, "...Baby One More Time", features Spears dancing in a formal yet somewhat revealing catholic school girl uniform, which brought both success and extreme controversy to her iconic career. Britney Spears is often compared to fellow singers and dancers [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Christina Aguilera]].
*[[John W. Bubbles|John William Sublett]] (February 19, 1902 – May 18, 1986), known by his stage name [[John W. Bubbles]], was an American vaudeville performer, singer and entertainer .Sublett is known as the father of "rhythm tap", a form of tap dance. As opposed to the tap dancing of Bill Robinson (Bojangles) who emphasized clean phrases and toe taps, Sublett brought in percussive heel stomps and played with the traditional eight-bar phrase, slowing it down to allow for more rhythmic freedom. He thus merged the art of tap dancing with the new improvisitory style of jazz, reinventing the tap artform.
*[[Sylvia Sykes]], [[swing dance]] instructor, judge and choreographer. In particular she is considered by most to be the leading authority on the dance Balboa. She also represented the U.S. in the World Boogie Woogie Championships in Grenoble, France with her original partner Jonathan Bixby. She is best known for reviving Balboa, which is rapidly gaining popularity around the world, and is a regular guest at the balboa dance camps.

==T==
*[[Marie Taglioni]] (April 23, 1804 – April 24, 1884), famous Italian ballerina of the [[Romantic ballet]] era, a central figure in the history of European dance. Marie Taglioni was born in Stockholm, Sweden, to the Italian cheoreographer Filippo Taglioni and the Swedish dancer Sophie Karsten (daughter of the Swedish opera singer Christoffer Christian Karsten and the Polish actor Sophie Stebnowska). [[Marie Taglioni]] rose to fame as a dancer when her father (and teacher) created the ballet La Sylphide (1832) for her. Marie retired from performing in 1847. Later she taught social dance to children and society ladies; she also took a limited number of ballet pupils. Her only choreographic work was Le Papillon (1860) for her student Emma Livry, who is remembered for dying in 1863 when her costume was set alight by a gas lamp (limelight) used for stage lighting. Marie lived much longer, dying in Marseilles in 1884.
*[[Layla Taj]], belly dancer whose dances communicate aspects of Egyptian traditions and culture.
*[[Twyla Tharp]] (born July 1, 1941), leading American dancer and choreographer. She has won Emmy and Tony awards, and currently works as a choreographer in New York City .Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre in 1988, where Tharp created more than a dozen works. Since that time Tharp has choreographed dances for many companies including The Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, The Boston Ballet, The Joffrey Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance and The [[Martha Graham]] Dance Company.
*[[Danny Tidwell]] (born August 1, 1984 in Norfolk, Virginia), American contemporary and ballet dancer and choreographer, best known for being the runner-up on Fox's third season of ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (U.S. TV series)|So You Think You Can Dance]]'' in 2007. Tidwell began dancing as a child, at first focusing on [[jazz]] before changing to ballet while attending Kirov Academy of Ballet at the age of fifteen. He has worked in elite companies, including the American Ballet Theater. He has also performed the works of renowned choreographers, including Debbie Allen, William Forsythe and Mia Michaels. He is [[Travis Wall]]'s brother, also a runner-up, of the second season of ''So You Think You Can Dance''.
*[[Eddie Torres]] (born on July 3, 1950), one of the most famous [[Salsa (dance)|salsa dance]] instructors in the world. He has trained thousands of dancers, including some of the most well known contemporary dancers. Through his dance school, he has taught thousands of people how to dance salsa in his own distinctive style. He also has a children's dance program that teaches approximately three hundred students a year.
*[[Antony Tudor]] (4 April 1908 – 19 April 1987), born William Cook, highly influential 20th-century English ballet choreographer, teacher and dancer. Antony Tudor is generally accepted to be one of the great originals of modern dance forms. Along with [[George Balanchine]], he is seen as a principal transformer of ballet into a [[modern art]], but of a genius that uses, rather than proceeds from, ballet forms. His work is usually considered as modern "psychological" expression, but—like their creator–of austerity, elegance and nobility.

== U ==
*[[Uday Shankar]] (December 8, 1900 – September 26, 1977) (Bengali: উদয় শংকর), the pioneer of modern dance in India, and a world renowned Indian dancer and choreographer, was most known for adapting Western theatrical techniques to traditional Indian classical dance, imbued with elements of Indian classical, folk, and tribal dance, thus laying the roots of modern Indian dance, which he later popularized in India, Europe, and the United States in 1920s and 1930s.
*[[Galina Ulanova]] ({{OldStyleDateDY|8 January|1910|26 December 1909}} {{spaced ndash}} 21 March 1998), Russian ballet dancer. She is frequently cited as being one of the greatest [[ballerina]]s of the 20th century. From 1944 to 1960 she was the [[prima ballerina assoluta]] of the [[Bolshoi Theater]].

==V==
*[[Agrippina Yakovlevna Vaganova]] (July 6, 1879 – November 5, 1951), outstanding Russian ballet teacher who developed the [[Vaganova method]] - the technique which derived from the teaching methods of the old Imperial Ballet School (today the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet) under the Premier Maître de Ballet Marius Petipa throughout the mid-to-late 19th century, though mostly throughout the 1880s and 1890s. It was Vaganova who perfected and cultivated this form of teaching the art of classical ballet into a workable syllabus. Her Fundamentals of the Classical Dance (1934) remains a standard textbook for the instruction of ballet technique.

==W==
*[[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]] (July 21, 1673 – September 24, 1760), dancer and choreographer and is commonly known as the father of English [[pantomime]]. Weaver was born in Shrewsbury. His father, a dance teacher, suggested he go to London and become a ballet master. Weaver soon became a specialist in comic roles and created the first pantomime ballet, the burlesque Tavern Bilkers (1702). His more serious work'', The Loves of Mars and Venus'' dealt with themes from classical literature and required a significant amount of gestures due to the story not being expressed in any spoken form. Because Weaver attempted to use plot and emotion in replacement of more sophisticated technical and speech methods, he is considered a major influence on subsequent choreographers, including [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] and [[Gasparo Angiolini]].
*[[Charles Edward Weidman]], Jr. (1901 in Lincoln, Nebraska – 1975), modern dancer, choreographer and teacher. He studied and performed with Denishawn before leaving to form the [[Humphrey-Weidman]] school and company with [[Doris Humphrey]] and Pauline Lawrence. Like his partner Humphrey, Weidman worked from principles of fall and recovery and also experimented with a form of linking unrelated movements that he called "kinetic pantomime." During the 1930s, Weidman taught at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont and presented choreography including his popular ''Candide'' (1937) through the Federal Dance Theatre of the WPA.
*[[Mary Wigman]] (1886 – 1973), German dancer, choreographer, and instructor of dance. Credited for innovation of expressionist dance, and pioneer of [[modern dance]] in Germany. Mary Wigman's choreographies often employed non-Western instrumentation: fifes, bells, gongs, and drums from India, Thailand, Africa, and China. However, the primary musical accompaniment for her most well known dances was percussion, which contrasted greatly with her use of silence. Mary would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal motifs, as well as ecstatic spinning.

'''Music Law''' refers to legal aspects of the music industry, and certain legal aspects in other sectors of the entertainment industry. The music industry includes [[record label]]s, music publishers, merchandisers, the live events sector and of course performers and artists.

The terms "music law" and "entertainment law", along with "business affairs", are used by the music and entertainment industry and should not be thought of as academic definitions. Indeed, music law covers a range of traditional legal subjects including [[intellectual property]] law ([[copyright]] law, [[trademark]]s, image publicity rights, design rights), [[competition law]], [[bankruptcy law]], [[contract law]], [[defamation]] and, for the live events industry, [[immigration law]], [[health and safety law]], and licensing.

==Definitions==
*A "compilation" refers to work formed from already existing materials in a way that forms its own original work, including collective works.
*"Copies" are physical objects that hold, fix, or embody a work such as a music tape, film, CD, statue, play, or printed sheet music.
*"Sound recordings" can refer to any audio recording including the sound accompanying motion pictures.
*"Copyright owner" is the entity that legally owns rights to a work.&lt;ref name="copyright.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/|title=Copyright Law of the United States - U.S. Copyright Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Performance" The copyright holder has the exclusive right to perform the work in public, or to license others to perform it. The right applies to “literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works.".&lt;ref&gt;17 U.S.C. § 106(4)&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a CD in public, or showing a film in public is "performing" the work.

==Copyright==

{{main| copyright}}

==Publishing==

Publishing is the primary source of income for musicians writing their own music.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Money collected from the 'publishing' rights is ultimately destined for songwriters - the composers of works, whether or not they are the recording artist or performer. Often, [[songwriter]]s will work for a musical ensemble to help them with musical aspects of the composition, but here again, the writer of the song is the owner of it and will own the copyrights in the song and thus will be entitled to the publishing revenues.  Copyrights in compositions are not the same as [[sound recording]]s.  A recording artist can record a song and sell it to another band or company. As a result, that particular company will own the recording, but not the song. The original writer will always maintain the copyright for that particular song. The publishing money is connected to the copyright, so the owner will be the only one making money off of the song itself. All successful songwriters will join a collection society (such as ASCAP and BMI in the USA, SOCAN in Canada, JASRAC in Japan, GEMA in Germany and PRS for Music in the UK, etc.) and many will enter into agreements with music publishing companies who will exploit their works on the songwriters behalf for a share of ownership, although many of these deals involve the transfer (assignment) of copyright from the songwriter to the music publisher.

Both the recorded music sector and music publishing sector have their foundations in [[intellectual property]] law and all of the major recording labels and major music publishers and many independent record labels and publishers have dedicated "business and legal affairs" departments with in-house lawyers whose role is not only to secure intellectual property rights from recording artists, performers and songwriters but also to exploit those rights and protect those rights on a global basis. There are a number of specialist independent law firms around the world who advise on music and entertainment law whose clients include recording artists, performers, producers, songwriters, labels, music publishers, stage and set designers, choreographers, graphic artists, games designers, merchandisers, broadcasters, artist managers, distributors, collection societies and the live events sector (which further includes festivals, venues, promoters, booking agents and production service providers such as lighting and staging companies).

==Performance Licensing==
{{main|Music licensing}}

==Business==

The US Government views artists that give concerts and sell merchandise as a business. Bands that tour internationally will also face a plethora of legislation around the world including health and safety laws, immigration laws and tax legislation. Also, many relationships are governed by often complex contractual agreements.

In the US it is important for musicians to get legal business licenses. These can be obtained at a city hall or local government center. The business license will require the tracking of sales, wages, and gigs. A tax ID is also necessary for all businesses. Musicians that fail to comply with the tax ID process and do not report their profits and losses to the government can face serious consequences with the IRS.

'''The Naked Maja''' ({{lang-es|La maja desnuda}}) is a [[Philately|philatelic]] name for three [[postage stamp]]s of [[Spain]] of 1930 depicting the ''[[La maja desnuda]]'' painting (1800) by [[Francisco de Goya]] (1746–1828).&lt;ref name="quinta4"/&gt; They are part of a set marking the anniversary of the death of this Spanish artist, and are considered the world's first postage stamp with [[Nude (art)|nudes]].&lt;ref name="scandal"&gt;[http://www.philatelic-postal-club.org/docs/newsletter_apr_2014.pdf "The Nude Maja, Philatelic Scandal"] in ''Newsletter of the International Postal Philatelic Club'', No. 2, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The complete set includes 32 stamps. 14 of them with denominations between 1 ''[[céntimo]]'' and 5 ''[[Spanish peseta|peseta]]s'' (Scott #386–396 and 400–402), have similar design in different colors—a portrait of Francisco de Goya in his mature years (1826) by [[Vicente López y Portaña]].

The set also included 13 [[airmail stamps]] with [[etching]]s of Goya's ''[[Los caprichos]]'' and ''[[Los disparates]]'' cycles (Scott # C18-30),&lt;ref name="neyhart"&gt;Neyhart, C. [http://www.nwpl.org/documents/may2010.full.pdf "The lesser known Spanish Goya's"] in ''Northwest Philatelic Library Research'', Vol. 6, Issue 12, May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two other express mail stamps: ordinary (Scott # E7), and air mail (Scott # CE1) stamps overprinted "urgente" ("urgent").

The remaining three highest denominations – dark purple (1 peseta), gray-green (4 pesetas) and red-brown (10 pesetas) (Scott # 397-399) – engraved by [[:es:José Luis López Sánchez-Toda|José Luis López Sánchez-Toda]] reproduce one of the most famous and controversial artist's paintings: ''[[La maja desnuda]]''.

The size of the stamps is 47 × 34&amp;nbsp;mm &lt;!--The Goya portrait ones are 25 × 34 mm--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filateliatalavera.com/product.aspx?p=24057&amp;t=0&amp;c=12 Filatelia Talavera] 1930. 15 de junio.

== Issue ==
[[File:Espana1930goya2cts.jpg|thumb|upright|{{small|Portrait of Francisco de Goya, 1826 (Scott#387)}}]]
The issue was dedicated to the closure of the [[Ibero-American Exposition of 1929|Ibero-American Exhibition]] in Seville (May 9, 1929 – June 21, 1930) and at the same time to the 100th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Goya.

The stated purpose of its distribution was to recoup construction costs of the Quinta de Goya (literally "Goya's country house"),&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt; exhibition hall entirely devoted to the works of the Spaniard, where some of his paintings and etchings were placed.&lt;ref name="quinta"&gt;{{cite journal|title=La quinta de Goya (Pabellon Citroen)|first1=José María|last1=Cabeza Méndez|journal=Aparejadores: boletín del Colegio Oficial de Aparejadores y Arquitectos Técnicos de Sevilla|issn=1695-8934|number=40|year=1992|pages=13–16|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="quinta2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1988/08/28/030.html|location=Sevilla|title=La Quinta de Goya en la Exposición Iberoamericana|page=30|work=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|last1=Ayza|first1=Román|date=28 August 1988|access-date=1 April 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set had a nominal value deliberately inflated in comparison to conventional postal rates (it was sold for the equivalent of US$5 at the time). The stamps went on sale on June 15, 1930 and were cancelled by four different types of postmarks. They were valid for the payment of postal services only for three days, until June 17,&lt;ref name="manta"&gt;Manta, V. "[http://www.artonstamps.org/goya.htm The Clothed and The Naked Maja by Goya]". Artonstamps.org, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; so they are rare cancelled, and most cancellations are forgeries of a later time, some of them contain an error ("CUINTA GOYA" instead of "QUINTA GOYA").

Information about the circulation sold during the three days vary. According to a New York newspaper, ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'' for August 1, 1930, 29,000 stamps of the first issue featuring the nude Maja, of all three denominations, were sold in total.&lt;ref name="brooklyn"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/58061739/ "Maybe"]. ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', August 1, 1930. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to today's versions, 9,800 10-peseta Majas and 231,000 Majas of the other two denominations (1 peseta and 4 pesetas) were issued.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt;

== Background ==
Having lost the charm of its "[[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]]", economic prosperity, global leadership, and [[Spanish American wars of independence|most of its colonial possessions]], Spain in the 18th-19th centuries was experiencing chronic decline. The political and cultural dominance of its northern neighbor, [[France]], especially telling on the Spanish elite, could not but cause aversion and strive for [[Peninsular War|national liberation]] in the society, and intensified search of national identity as a way out of the crisis.

[[Majo|''Majos'' and their girlfriend ''majas'']] were representatives of fringe urban [[lumpenproletariat]] originating from Spanish provinces,&lt;ref name="Thompson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Thompson|title=Performing Spanishness: History, Cultural Identity and Censorship in the Theatre of José María Rodríguez Méndez|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XdOo_KolKWQC&amp;pg=PA149|year=2007|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-134-5|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played a catalytic role in the public debate and turned their lower status into a way to express their freedom and rejection of afrancesado ('Frenchified', high society and traditional society of that time in general). Both maja men and women wore daggers at their belts, dressed provocatively and foppishly, deliberately behaved themselves arrogantly, were notable for freedom of manners, and sometimes lived on banditry and looting.&lt;ref name="Esdaile2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles J. Esdaile|others=Santiago Jordán (trans.)|title=La quiebra del liberalismo, 1808-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-PENp55tJoC&amp;pg=PA22|year=2001|publisher=Grupo Planeta (GBS)|isbn=978-84-8432-182-8|page=22|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strong nationalist overtones turned the image of ''maja'', in fact a prostitute, into a cult of passionate and free Spanish woman.&lt;ref name="ParrondoCremades1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juan Carrete Parrondo|author2=Fernándo Checa Cremades|title=El Grabado en España: . Siglos XV al XVIII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4KgLAQAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1988|publisher=Espasa-Calpe|language=Spanish|isbn=978-84-239-5273-1|page=720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobility reinterpreted items of clothing from slums as an organic part of the Spanish national costume. Embodiment of this trend, ''majismo'', became a favorite subject for Francisco Goya; and his painting ''La Maja Desnuda'' was in this sense a culmination. The artist, however, painted his work for a very small elite audience and hardly imagined that his ''Maja'' in less than a century and a half would be available to the general public in hundred thousands of copies.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;Clark, W. [http://www.cilam.ucr.edu/diagonal/issues/2005/majismo.html "Spain, the Eternal Maja': Goya, Majismo, and the Reinvention of Spanish National Identity in Granados's Goyescas"] in ''University of California, Journal of the Center for Iberian and Latin American Music'', 25 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s–1930s, Spain was once again at a crossroads caused by its painful defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, the deepening economic crisis, and [[Nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain|waves of separatism]] and widespread intellectual discussion about the "[[The two Spains|national identity of Spain]]." This pursuit resulted in a deep national division and, later, in a [[Spanish Civil War|bloody civil war]]. The intellectuals of [[Generation of '98]] needed strong and [[Épater la bourgeoisie|shocking]] symbols, means for daring embodiment of the national idea – and ''majismo'' came in handy.&lt;ref name="Esdaile2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="clark" /&gt; ''La maja desnuda'' postage stamps manifested it with a quite obvious underlying message for the Spanish society.

[[File:Espana1930majavestidaessay.jpg|upright=2.0|thumb|center|[[Essay (philately)|An essay]] of unissued postage stamps ''La maja vestida'']]

In his book, ''El arte de grabar el sello'', published in 1969, engraver of the series, José Sánchez-Toda, reproduced an alternative [[Essay (philately)|stamp essay]] prepared by him for issuance and depicting ''La maja vestida'', just in case if ''Correos'' refused to approve the bolder option. Approval of ''La maja vestida'' would have preserved all symbolism of the issue, though such choice would have been less scandalous. The Spanish governmental mail service, however, went all in.&lt;ref name="toda"&gt;Sanchez-Toda, J. ''El arte de grabar el sello''. Barcelona: Emeuve, 1969, pp. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that postage stamps are officially a 'business card' of the issuing country, one of its official media symbols, and therefore sexual motives in their design are traditionally rare&lt;ref name="cochrane"&gt;Cochrane, K. [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2014/apr/15/homoerotic-artist-tom-of-finland-official-stamp-approval "Homoerotic artist Tom of Finland gets the official stamp of approval]." ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (and this is especially true for the first half of the 20th century), depicting naked flesh (both female and male) on postage stamps of that time was, strictly speaking, no news.

Images of [[Ancient Greek sculpture|ancient statues]] or their imitations were quite common elements of design of both [[postage stamp]]s and various [[Revenue stamp|fiscal stamps]], vouchers, [[cheque]]s, [[banknote]]s, and [[Security (finance)|securities]], i. e. any government and corporate securities that needed [[security printing]] against [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] using aesthetically acceptable complication of the design. In addition, the stamps of African [[Colonialism|colonies]] often featured [[Negro|African women]] with naked [[breast]]. It was the ''La Maja Desnuda'', however, that became the world's first case of open image of the body of a worldly woman (not a [[Greek mythology|goddess]]) with [[pubic hair]],&lt;ref name="pukas"&gt;Pukas, A. [http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/275973/Duchess-of-Alba-The-Royal-Cougar "Duchess of Alba: The Royal Cougar"].

== Response ==

Appearance in 1930 of the ''Maja Desnuda'' series caused a scandal in [[Roman Catholicism in Spain|conservative catholic Spain]].  The purists made loud public protests,&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt; denouncing the threat to public [[morality]]. According to them, in particular, such stamps would corrupt innocent children who collected stamps.&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Child|title=Miniature Messages: The Semiotics and Politics of Latin American Postage Stamps|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0DMl-sYT8kC&amp;pg=PR60|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-8927-4|page=60|quote=''Loud protests were heard complaining that the 'naked' stamp [of Goya’s ''The Naked Maja''] would corrupt innocent children who collected stamps.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, stamp dealers were displaying the shocking series in their shop windows.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;Conrad, H.

Republicans actively used these [[Philatelic fakes and forgeries#Government and propaganda forgeries|stamps for political propaganda]] against corruption of [[Decadent movement|decadent]] aristocracy and its monarchist supporters, which accelerated the change of the [[Social order|social system]]:&lt;ref name="mackay"&gt;[[James A.

Meanwhile, the stamp scandal went beyond the Spain itself.  The [[Universal Postal Union]] started receiving protests (and some of them at the national level, which could result in a post war), but these protests, however, were not satisfied.&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt; ''Time'', one of the leading US magazines of the time, wrote about a wave of indignation worldwide risen due to the issuance of these stamps. The edition explained:&lt;ref name="neyhart"/&gt;

In 1952, [[Ostende]] police (Belgium) confiscated ''La maja desnuda'' stamps from the shop window of a local [[stamp dealer]] as "immoral.".&lt;ref name="toledo"&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19521123&amp;id=w_lOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pAAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5604,4009268&amp;hl=ru "Display Of Stamps Termed 'Immoral'"].

P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, postal authorities in various cities of the United States treated the shocking stamps differently: thus, in [[Boston]] in July 1930 they were mutilated in passing through the mails, while at the same time in [[Washington, DC]], according to the press, “they had nothing to do with the stamp designs of other countries.”&lt;ref name="dailyeagle"&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/57395932/ "Stamp nudes create furur among collectors; fear ban"] in ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', 25 July 1930, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1930, however, the [[U.S. Mail]] has officially banned all mail franked with the ''Majas'' from entering the country. Such mail was barred and apparently returned to senders.&lt;ref name="cochrane" /&gt; However, according to philatelic experts, not a single returned mail is known.&lt;ref name="quesada"&gt;''Eugenio de Quesada'' [http://www.rahf.es/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/La%20leyenda%20de%20la%20maja%20desnuda.pdf La leyenda de "La Maja Desnuda" (Emisión Quinta de Goya, 1930)] in ''Estudios de Afinet'', No. 4, November 2009, pp. 29—41. {{ISBN|978-84-613-5735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US authorities made their claims specific in 1958-1959, when a film by [[Henry Koster]] ''[[The Naked Maja]]'' came out co-produced by the USA, Italy and France. For advertising purposes, United Artists Corp. tried then to mail out 2,268 postcards announcing the film and carrying a reproduction of the Goya's painting ''La Maja Desnuda'', but the distribution was halted by the Post Office Department, which held that it violated Sections 1461 and 1463 of Title 18 of the [[United States Code]], forbidding the mailing of "lewd, [[Lascivious behavior|lascivious]] or indecent" matter.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/opinion/25iht-oldapril25.html '1959 Goya Work Creates Polemic"] in ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film company's protest stating that the postcards reproduced a painting being publicly displayed in the Prado Museum in Madrid, was, however, rejected. At hearings, the court found that the presence of the ''La Maja Desnuda'' painting in the museum was not a crime, but distribution of such images is "sexy-pandering to a lewd and lascivious interest on the part of the average man."&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; This legal rule is no longer in force in the United States (since 1996).&lt;ref name="timesnewsweekly"&gt;[http://www.timesnewsweekly.com/news/2011-05-05/Editorial "Editorial"] in ''Times Newsweekly'', May 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the scandalous series of 1930 Spanish stamps was immortalized in a novel, ''Hit List'' by [[Lawrence Block]], where the central character Keller described in detail his teenager collector's feelings in relation to its purchase.&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;Block, L. "Hit List", William Morrow, 2000, p. 304. {{ISBN|978-0-06-019833-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In philatelic literature ''La maja desnuda'' of 1930 is considered to be "[t]he best-known sexually related stamp in history, probably."&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt;

== Subsequent issues ==
In 1958, the Spanish ''La maja desnuda'' stamps were reproduced in the US on one stamp of the 10-stamp set with the most famous paintings of Goya issued for the Day of the Stamp. Another issue, an imperforated block of four stamps with four facsimiles of the 1930 4 pesetas Spanish stamp, albeit in different colors, was issued in the US in 1996.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt; Both issues, however, were only a private initiative of local philatelic clubs.&lt;ref name="chicago" /&gt;

In addition, Waterlow &amp; Sons reprinted for several times in London all values of the scandalous set from the original printing plates, unloading onto the market circulations ten times exceeding the original circulation, between 1932 and 1969. These [[new print]]s cannot be distinguished from the original stamps, but even so they are still of interest to philatelists.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt;

All stamps of the set exist in an imperforated form, and as [[line pair]]s and [[Se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] stamps without [[Postage stamp separation|perforations]] between the elements, but with external perforation. Some exist in the changed colors (mostly red and blue) as limited edition.&lt;ref name="stampnews" /&gt; It is known that only three imperforates were issued at a price approximately six times higher than normal perforated version in 1930.&lt;ref name="manta" /&gt;

As a result, in 2011 the ''Stamp News'' magazine evaluated three unused La maja desnuda stamps only at $20–30.&lt;ref name="stampnews" /&gt; At the end of 2015, the whole set could be found on the philatelic market for about $50. A complete kit including 'Urgente' overprints (Scott # 386-402, C18-30, CE1, E7) and specimens of all stamps ('muestra' overprints vertically on the left), is altogether valued on specialized philatelic online auctions at $350–400.&lt;ref name="kelleher"&gt;[http://stampauctionnetwork.com/V/v66979.cfm Lot #3961]. — Daniel F. Kelleher Auctions LLC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past decades, the ''La Maja Desnuda'' painting by Goya has been repeatedly reproduced by other nations on their postage stamps, including countries with significant religious domination in society: [[Paraguay]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Albania]], etc.&lt;ref name="scandal" /&gt;

Yet, as several theorists and curators have noted, such forms of interaction, social exchange, participation, and transformation do not distinguish new media art but rather serve as a common ground that has parallels in other strands of contemporary art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hybridge.wordpress.com/2011/02/15/writings-media/|title=Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?|work=Contemporary Art and New Media: Toward a Hybrid Discourse?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such insights emphasize the forms of cultural practice that arise concurrently with emerging technological platforms, and question the focus on technological media, per se.

New Media concerns are often derived from the [[telecommunications]], [[mass media]] and [[Digital electronics|digital electronic]] modes of delivering the artworks involve, with practices ranging from [[conceptual art|conceptual]] to [[Internet Art|virtual art]], [[performance]] to [[Installation art|installation]].

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}
The origins of new media art can be traced to the moving photographic inventions of the late 19th century such as the [[zoetrope]] (1834), the [[praxinoscope]] (1877) and [[Eadweard Muybridge|Eadweard Muybridge's]] [[zoopraxiscope]] (1879). From the 1920s through the 1950s, various forms of kinetic and light art, from [[Thomas Wilfred]]'s 'Lumia' (1919) and 'Clavilux' light organs to [[Jean Tinguely]]'s self-destructing sculpture 'Homage to New York' (1960) can be seen as progenitors of new media art.

In 1958 [[Wolf Vostell]] becomes the first artist who incorporates a [[television]] set into one of his works. The ''Black Room Cycle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/deutscher-ausblick/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: German View from the Black Room Cycle|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Installation art|installation]] is part of the collection of the [[Berlinische Galerie]].

During the 1960s the development of then new technologies of video produced the new media art experiments of [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Wolf Vostell]] with the [[Installation art|installation]] ''6 TV Dé-coll/age'' in 1963 at the [[Smolin Gallery]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/television-decollage/|title=Media Art Net - Vostell, Wolf: Television Décollage|work=medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. Michael Noll]], and [[multimedia]] [[performance]]s of [[E.A.T.]], [[Fluxus]] and [[Happening]]. 
In 1983, [[Roy Ascott]] introduced the concept of "distributed authorship" in his worldwide telematic project La Plissure du Texte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timeline.1904.cc/tiki-index.php?page=La+Plissure+du+Texte|title=La Plissure du Texte|work=1904.cc|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402201801/http://timeline.1904.cc/tiki-index.php?page=La+Plissure+du+Texte|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Frank Popper]]'s "Electra" at the [[Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]. The development of computer graphics at the end of the 1980s and real time technologies then in the 1990s combined with the spreading of the Web and the Internet favored the emergence of new and various forms of interactive art by [[Ken Feingold]],  [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]], [[David Rokeby]], [[Ken Rinaldo]], [[Perry Hoberman]], [[Tamas Waliczky]]; [[telematic art]] by [[Roy Ascott]], [[Paul Sermon]], [[Michael Bielický]]; Internet art by [[Vuk Ćosić]], [[Jodi (art collective)|Jodi]]; virtual and immersive art by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[Monika Fleischmann]], [[Wolfgang Strauss]] and large scale urban installation by [[Rafael Lozano-Hemmer]]. In Geneva, the [[Centre pour l'Image Contemporaine]] or CIC coproduced with [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] from Paris and the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne the first internet video archive of new media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia-art.org/index_en.htm|title=Nouveaux Media - New Media - Neue Medien|website=www.newmedia-art.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Simultaneously advances in biotechnology have also allowed artists like [[Eduardo Kac]] to begin exploring DNA and genetics as a new art medium.

Influences on new media art have been the theories developed around interaction, [[hypertext]], databases, and [[computer network|networks]]. Important thinkers in this regard have been [[Vannevar Bush]] and [[Theodor Nelson]], whereas comparable ideas can be found in the literary works of [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Italo Calvino]], and [[Julio Cortázar]].

==Themes==
In the book ''New Media Art'', [[Mark Tribe]] and Reena Jana named several themes that contemporary new media art addresses, including [[computer art]], [[collaboration]], [[Personal identity|identity]], [[appropriation (art)|appropriation]], [[Open source|open sourcing]], [[telepresence]], surveillance, corporate parody, as well as intervention and [[hacktivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maurizio Bolognini]] suggested that new media artists have one common denominator, which is a self-referential relationship with the new technologies, the result of finding oneself inside an epoch-making transformation determined by technological development. Nevertheless, new media art does not appear as a set of homogeneous practices, but as a complex field converging around three main elements: 1) the art system, 2) scientific and industrial research, and 3) political-cultural media activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Catricalà|first1=Valentino|title=Media Art. Toward a new Definition of Arts in the Age of Technology|date=2015|publisher=Gli Ori|isbn=978- 88-7336-564-8|url=https://www.academia.edu/11185472/Media_Art._Towards_a_New_Definition_of_Arts_in_the_Age_of_Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant differences between scientist-artists, activist-artists and technological artists closer to the art system, who not only have different training and technocultures, but have different artistic production.&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm "From interactivity to democracy. Towards a post-digital generative art"], ''Artmedia X Proceedings''. Paris, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This should be taken into account in examining the several themes addressed by new media art.

Non-linearity can be seen as an important topic to new media art by artists developing interactive, generative, collaborative, immersive artworks like [[Jeffrey Shaw]] or [[Maurice Benayoun]] who explored the term as an approach to looking at varying forms of digital projects where the content relays on the user's experience. This is a key concept since people acquired the notion that they were conditioned to view everything in a linear and clear-cut fashion.  Now, art is stepping out of that form and allowing for people to build their own experiences with the piece. Non-linearity describes a project that escape from the conventional linear narrative coming from novels, theater plays and movies. Non-linear art usually requires audience participation or at least, the fact that the "visitor" is taken into consideration by the representation, altering the displayed content. The participatory aspect of new media art, which for some artists has become integral, emerged from [[Allan Kaprow]]'s ''Happenings'' and became with Internet, a significant component of contemporary art. 

The inter-connectivity and interactivity of the [[internet]], as well as the fight between corporate interests, governmental interests, and public interests that gave birth to the web today, fascinate and inspire a lot of current new media art.

Many new media art projects also work with themes like politics and social consciousness, allowing for [[social activism]] through the interactive nature of the media. New media art includes "explorations of code and user interface; interrogations of archives, databases, and networks; production via automated scraping, filtering, cloning, and recombinatory techniques; applications of user-generated content (UGC) layers; crowdsourcing ideas on social- media platforms; narrowcasting digital selves on "free" websites that claim copyright; and provocative performances that implicate audiences as participants".&lt;ref&gt;Dale Hudson and Patricia R. Zimmermann. (2015). ''[http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/thinking-through-digital-media-dale-hudson/?K=9781137433626 Thinking Through Digital Media Transnational Environments and Locative Places]''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. P. 1. {{ISBN|978-1137433626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key themes in new media art is to create visual views of databases. Pioneers in this area include [[Lisa Strausfeld]], [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Bulajic|first1=Viktorija Vesna| title=Database aesthetics: art in the age of information overflow|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2007|url=|isbn=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Alberto Frigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moulon |first=Dominique |date=2013 |title=Contemporary new media art  |url= |location= |publisher=Nouvelles éditions Scala |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Database aesthetics holds at least two attractions to new media artists: formally, as a new variation on non-linear narratives; and politically as a means to subvert what is fast becoming a form of control and authority.

The emergence of 3D printing has introduced a new bridge to new media art, joining the virtual and the physical worlds.  The rise of this technology has allowed artists to blend the computational base of new media art with the traditional physical form of sculpture.  A pioneer in this field was artist [[Jonty Hurwitz]] who created the first known anamorphosis sculpture using this technique.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Longevity ==
As the technologies used to deliver works of new media art such as [[photographic film|film]], [[cassette tape|tapes]], [[web browser]]s, [[software]] and [[operating system]]s become obsolete, New Media art faces serious issues around the challenge to [[Art conservation and restoration|preserve artwork]] beyond the time of its contemporary production. Currently, research projects into [[New media art preservation]] are underway to improve the preservation and documentation of the fragile media arts heritage (see [[Docam|DOCAM - Documentation and Conservation of the Media Arts Heritage]]).

Methods of preservation exist, including the translation of a work from an obsolete medium into a related new medium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ercim.org/publication/ws-proceedings/DELOS6/rosetta.pdf|format=PDF|title=Digital Rosetta Stone|website=ercim.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the digital archiving of media (see the [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome ArtBase]], which holds over 2000 works, and the [[Internet Archive]]), and the use of [[emulators]] to preserve work dependent on obsolete software or operating system environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |title=Preserving the Rhizome ArtBase (report) |first=Richard |last=Rinehart |website=rhizome.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116094312/http://rhizome.org/artbase/report.htm |archivedate=2005-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/design/the-mission-to-save-vanishing-internet-art.html|title=The Mission to Save Vanishing Internet Art|last=Rose|first=Frank|date=2016-10-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Around the mid-90s, the issue of storing works in digital form became a concern. Digital art such as moving images, multimedia, interactive programs, and computer-generated art has different properties than physical artwork such as oil paintings and sculptures. Unlike analog technologies, a digital file can be recopied onto a new medium without any deterioration of content. One of the problems with preserving digital art is that the formats continuously change over time. Former examples of transitions include that from 8-inch floppy disks to 5.25-inch floppies, 3-inch diskettes to CD-ROMs, and DVDs to flash drives. On the horizon is the obsolescence of flash drives and portable hard drives, as data is increasingly held in online [[cloud storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://besser.tsoa.nyu.edu/howard/Papers/elect-art-longevity.html|title=Longevity of Electronic Art|website=besser.tsoa.nyu.edu|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums and galleries thrive off of being able to accommodate the presentation and preservation of physical artwork. New media art challenges the original methods of the art world when it comes to documentation, its approach to collection and preservation. Technology continues to advance, and the nature and structure of art organizations and institutions will remain in jeopardy. The traditional roles of curators and artist are continually changing, and a shift to new collaborative models of production and presentation is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/225871513|title=New media in the white cube and beyond : curatorial models for digital art|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|others=Paul, Christiane.|isbn=9780520255975|location=Berkeley|oclc=225871513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
In New Media programs, students are able to get acquainted with the newest forms of creation and communication. New Media students learn to identify what is or isn't "new" about certain technologies.&lt;ref name="illinois.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art.illinois.edu/content/undergraduate/programs/new-media/|title=The School of Art and Design - University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|work=illinois.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science and the market will always present new tools and platforms for artists and designers. Students learn how to sort through new emerging technological platforms and place them in a larger context of sensation, communication, production, and consumption.

When obtaining a bachelor's degree in New Media, students will primarily work through practice of building experiences that utilize new and old technologies and narrative. Through the construction of projects in various media, they acquire technical skills, practice vocabularies of critique and analysis, and gain familiarity with historical and contemporary precedents.&lt;ref name="illinois.edu" /&gt; 

In the United States, many Bachelor's and Master's level programs exist with concentrations on Media Art, New Media, Media Design, Digital Media and Interactive Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~j21099/nmschools.html|title=New Media Programs in the United States — Dr. Edgar Huang|website=www.iupui.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
[[Random House]] purchased the rights to the essay collection in October 2012 after a bidding war generated by Dunham's 66-page book proposal. Bidding was reported to have risen past $3.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bosman|first1=Julie|title=Lena Dunham Signs Book Deal for More Than $3.5 Million|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/lena-dunham-sings-book-deal-for-more-than-3-5-million/|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Not That Kind of Girl'' was published September 30, 2014.

==Reception==
''Not That Kind of Girl'' received mixed reviews but was a commercial success, reaching #2 on ''[[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]'' on October 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=COMBINED PRINT &amp; E-BOOK NONFICTION|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2014-10-19/combined-print-and-e-book-nonfiction/list.html|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sloane Crosley]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' said the book was often hilarious but not ground-breaking in content. Crosley cautioned that attempts to view Dunham as a bellwether of modern feminism would unfairly overshadow the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crosley|first1=Sloane|authorlink1=Sloane Crosley|title=A Voice of a Generation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/books/review/lena-dunham-memoir-not-that-kind-of-girl-review.html|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hadley Freeman]], in a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', described Dunham as being a smart and talented writer, and the book as being brutally honest, but also narcissistic and thin in experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Freeman|first1=Hadley|authorlink1=Hadley Freeman|title=Not That Kind of Girl review – Lena Dunham exposes all, again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/30/not-that-kind-of-girl-lena-dunham-review-memoir|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The New Republic]]'', [[James Wolcott]] found the book filled with "chatty punch lines, airy anecdotage, and sour kiss-offs" and, ultimately, "callow, grating, and glibly nattering."&lt;ref&gt;https://newrepublic.com/article/120027/not-kind-girl-review-lena-dunhams-callow-grating-memoir&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Stevens of ''[[PopMatters]]'' wrote, "But the book, as a whole, is a lovely, touching, surprisingly sentimental portrait of a woman who, despite repeatedly baring her body and soul to audiences, remains a bit of an enigma: a young woman who sets the agenda, defies classification and seems utterly at home in her own skin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Lena Dunham's 'Not That Kind of Girl' Packed With Witty Anecdotes, Honesty|first=Heidi|last=Stevens|date=October 1, 2014|url=http://www.popmatters.com/wire/186390-lena-dunhams-not-that-kind-of-girl-packed-with-witty-anecdotes-hones/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the book a "B+" and that it was "guided mostly by a Woody-Allen-with-a-uterus kind of whimsy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Leah|title=Not That Kind of Girl (2014)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20856612,00.html|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==

=== Sexual abuse ===
In November 2014, Dunham and the book became a subject of controversy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonald|first1=Soraya Nadia|title=Lena Dunham responds to sites accusing her of sexually abusing her sister|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/11/03/lena-dunham-responds-to-sites-accusing-her-of-sexually-abusing-her-sister/|accessdate=November 8, 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a profile of Dunham by [[Kevin D. Williamson]] published in ''[[National Review]]''. In her book, Dunham describes examining her sister [[Grace Dunham|Grace]]'s genitals when they were children out of curiosity, bribing her with candy for kisses and casually masturbating while lying in bed next to her. Williamson characterizes this as sexual abuse,&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williamson|first1=Kevin D.|authorlink1=Kevin D. Williamson|title=Pathetic Privilege|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/391348/pathetic-privilege-kevin-d-williamson|accessdate=November 12, 2014|issue=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lena, Grace, and child psychologists, sexual abuse experts, and researchers in human sexuality reject the notion.&lt;ref name=MWM&gt;{{cite news|last=Moyer|first=Kevin D.|title=Sexual Abuse Allegations|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/11/04/lena_dunham_sibling_sexual_abuse_allegations_ridiculous_and_dangerous.html|accessdate=February 10, 2014|issue=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Oldenburg|first1=Ann|title=Lena Dunham: Sexual abuse or sexual exploration?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2014/11/06/lena-dunam-sexual-abuse-sister-grace-exploration-lawsuit/18524915|accessdate=February 13, 2015|work=USA Today|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Caffaro|first1=John|title=Sibling sexual assault is epidemic. No wonder Lena Dunham caused an uproar.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/11/06/sibling-sexual-assault-is-epidemic-no-wonder-lena-dunham-caused-an-uproar/|accessdate=April 16, 2015|work=The Washington Post|date=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview about the controversy in  ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine's XX Factor blog, developmental psychologist [[Ritch Savin-Williams]] says that the cited passages do not indicate abuse and that "Children have been doing this stuff forever and ever and ever and ever, and they will do it forever and ever and ever."&lt;ref name=MWM/&gt; Child sexual abuse expert [[David Finkelhor]] said that a judgement requires more than a single incident, and psychologist [[Sharon Lamb]] opined that the incidents described in the book were "within the norms of childhood sexual behavior" and that "It wouldn’t be sex offender wrong, it would be inappropriate..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark-Flory|first1=Tracy|title=Child therapists: Stop freaking out about Lena Dunham|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/11/04/child_therapists_stop_freaking_out_about_lena_dunham|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=Salon|issue=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunham later apologized for some of the wording in the book, specifically the joking use of the term 'sexual predator', which she described as insensitive.&lt;ref name="TLAT"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Lena Dunham apologizes for her 'comic use' of 'sexual predator'|first=Christine|last=D'Zurilla|date=November 4, 2014|url=http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-81876655/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothman|first1=Michael|title=Lena Dunham Apologizes for 'Sexual Predator' Section in Her Book|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/lena-dunham-apologizes-sexual-predator-section-book/story?id=26685074|accessdate=November 7, 2014|work=Good Morning America|publisher=ABC News|date=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues ===
In December 2014, [[Breitbart News]] investigated Dunham's claim that Dunham was at a party, "alone, drunk and high on Xanax and cocaine" and was sexually assaulted by a leading member of the [[Oberlin College]] Republicans, whom she called "Barry". Breitbart found a politically conservative alumnus of Oberlin with the forename Barry, later known as "Barry One", who had attended the school at the same time as Dunham but denied he was the man described by her. Breitbart later raised further doubts that the incident between "Barry One" and Dunham had even occurred. Oberlin College publicly distanced themselves from the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Post]]|title=Could 'Barry' sue Lena Dunham over her memoirs?|first=Eugene|last=Volokh|date=December 4, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/12/04/could-barry-sue-lena-dunham-over-her-memoirs|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alumnus ("Barry One") subsequently set up a legal fund online to pursue legal action against Dunham and her publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The Washington Times]]|title=Lena Dunham: 'Barry One' starts legal fund to fight actress' rape claim|first=Jessica|last=Chasmar|date=December 7, 2014|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/lena-dunham-barry-one-starts-legal-fund-to-fight-a|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Barry One"'s counsel stated that 'Despite multiple requests ... Dunham has not issued any sort of statement clearing Barry's name and clarifying the confusion that is happening.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/lena-dunham-barry-one-starts-legal-fund-to-fight-a/ "Barry One" starts legal fund to fight Lena Dunham claims"], ''The Washington Times''. Retrieved February 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, 2014, [[Random House]] issued a statement claiming Dunham had related that "Barry" was a [[pseudonym]] and had no connection to the Oberlin alumnus with the same first name. The pseudonym was to be removed from all further editions of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NPR|title=Book News: Random House Promises Changes To Lena Dunham Book|first=Colin|last=Dwyer|date=December 9, 2014|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/12/09/369600711/book-news-random-house-promises-changes-to-lena-dunham-book|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Nōtan'''|濃淡}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[design]] concept involving the play and placement of light and dark elements as they are placed next to the other in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of [[art]] and [[image]]ry.

==Uses==
This use of light and dark translates shape and form into flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface. Nōtan is traditionally presented in [[paint]], [[ink]], or cut [[paper]], but it is relevant to a host of modern-day image-making techniques, such as [[lithography]] in [[printmaking]], and [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]] in [[animation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17999">'''Open-source architecture''' (OSArc) is an emerging paradigm that advocates new procedures in imagination and formation of virtual and real spaces within a universal [[infrastructure]]. Drawing from references as diverse as [[open-source]] culture, [[modular design]], [[avant-garde]] [[architectural theory]], [[science fiction]], language theory, and [[neuro-surgery]], it adopts an inclusive approach as per [[spatial design]] towards a collaborative use of design and design tools by professionals and ordinary citizen users. The umbrella term ''citizen-centered design'' harnesses the notion of ''open-source architecture'', which in itself involves the non-building architecture of computer networks, and goes beyond it to the movement that encompass the building design professions, as a whole.

==History==
Citizen-centered design was spearheaded in 1999 by academic research in leading universities, such as the University of Texas (SUPA)&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.uta.edu/coursedescriptions/supa/&lt;/ref&gt; and professional practice organizations, such as the Earthnomad Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthnomad.com&lt;/ref&gt; and ARK Tectonics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthnomad.net&lt;/ref&gt; to position the citizen-centered design movement at the intersection of design and public policy. In the decades that followed, the movement grew to encompass various efforts around the globe, from organizations and collaborations to community design centers sponsored by academic institutions. The principles of the citizen-centered design movement and by extension, open-source architecture, were built on the body of knowledge accumulated since the 1960s on citizen participation research and practices.

Around the turn of the century,  citizen engagement research and practices were reformulated through the lens of more effective approaches and paradigms in the social and applied sciences, through the seminal work of Dr. Schaban-Maurer (2013), architect, urban planner and author of the deliberative design and phronetic engagement resource "Rise of the Citizen Practitioner"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Citizen-Practitioner-Basil-Schaban-Maurer/dp/3639704525/ref=sr_1_cc_1/183-1761655-4953811?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392858636&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=rise+of+the+citizen+practitioner&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Schaban-Maurer laid out the principles and precepts of his 'Life-Experience Narrative Exchange' methodology in the Mindful Policy Engagement field, which he founded in 2013, with the ground-breaking work 'The Roles of the Citizen Practitioner in Citizen Engagement for Architecture, Urban Design and Urban Planning Policy: A Phronesis-Based Approach"&lt;ref&gt;http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=117053&amp;local_base=GEN01-MCG02&lt;/ref&gt; The work provides rigorous theoretical basis for a body of best case studies and best practices of citizen-centered architecture, urban design and urban planning, as well as, urban and public policy. According to Dr. Schaban-Maurer, the (LENE) methodology leads to meaningful and effective design practices by integrating their processes with the principles of Phronetic Engagement and Mindful Policy into a new field of inquiry; 'Mindful Policy Engagement.' (Schaban-Maurer, 2013: 11)&lt;ref&gt;http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=117053&amp;local_base=GEN01-MCG02&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, open-source architecture practitioners and academics have increased the reach and influence of the citizen-centered design movement to other fields through inter-disciplinary collaborations, publications, conferences, and international exhibitions. In the last decade, open-source architecture, the mindful policy engagement field and the citizen-centered design movement have spawned smaller, derivative subsets of various names, most prominent of which is 'social impact design', 'public interest design' and the 'open architecture network' whose adherents combine design practice with social service. These early efforts, decades ago, are being propelled forward by new sensibilities through the continued commitment of architects, urban designers, planners, policy-makers and other stakeholders to engage and harness the knowledge of ordinary citizens in the design, development and implementation of urban policies, for projects that impact the very communities where we all live and work.

[[Cooking]] is often hailed as an early form of open source; [[vernacular architecture]] – producing recipes for everyday buildings – is another form of early lo-fi open-source culture, openly sharing and optimising technologies for building.

==Funding==

New economic models, exemplified by incremental [[microdonation]]s and [[Crowd funding|crowd-funding]] strategies like [[Sponsume]] and [[Kickstarter]], offer new modes of project initiation and development, destabilising the traditionally feudal hierarchy of client/architect/occupant. Financing of private projects increasingly moves to the public domain, offering mass rather than singular ownership, whereas funding of public projects can be derived from more flexible, responsive frameworks than simple levies or taxation. Open-source architecture should have particular appeal for builders entirely outside the mainstream economy, such as squatters, refugees and the military.

==Engagement==

Open-source architecture relies upon amateurs as much as experienced professionals, the "genius of the mass" as much as that of the individual,&lt;ref&gt;http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=117053&amp;local_base=GEN01-MCG02&lt;/ref&gt; eroding the binary distinction between author and audience. Like social software, it recognises the core role of multiple users at every stage of the project – whether as clients or communities, designers or occupants; at its best, it harnesses powerful &lt;!--?[[network effect]]--&gt;network effects to scale systems effectively. It is typically democratic, enshrining principles of open access and participation, though political variations range from stealth authoritarianism to communitarian consensualism.

Traditional developments require engagement programmes in which the 'community' is 'consulted' with respect to incoming developments, often with blunt tools such as focus groups, which often result in lack of representation and input, or at worst can result in [[NIMBYism]]. With crowd-funded models, forms of engagement are built into the process, enabling a kind of emergent urbanism, in which use of space is optimised on terms set by its users. This reclamation of people's power can be seen as a soft, spatial version of [[Hacktivism]]. Open-source architecture is likely to suffer some of the organizational drawbacks of [[open-source software]], such as forking of projects, abandoned projects, the emergence of cliques and incompatibility with the installed base of buildings. Organized campaigns of [[fear, uncertainty and doubt]] are probable.

==Standards==

An important aspect of open-source architecture is the emergence of [[open standard]]s of collaboration. The establishment of common, open, modular standards (such as the grid proposed by the [[OpenStructures]] project&lt;ref&gt;http://openstructures.net/&lt;/ref&gt; addresses the problem of hardware compatibility and the interface between components, allowing collaborative efforts across networks in which everyone designs for everyone. The establishment of universal standards also encourages the growth of networks of non-monetary exchange (knowledge, parts, components, ideas) and remote collaboration.

==Design==

Mass customisation replaces standardisation as algorithms enable the generation of related but differentiated species of design objects. [[Parametric design]] tools like [[Grasshopper]], [[GenerativeComponents]], [[Revit]] and [[Digital Project]] enable new user groups to interact with, navigate and modify the virtual designs, and to test and experience arrays of options at unprecedented low cost – recognizing laypeople as design decision making agents rather than just consumers. Open-source codes and scripts enable design communities to share and compare information and to collectively optimise production through modular components, accelerating the historical accumulation of shared knowledge. [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]] (Building Information Modelling) and related collaboration tools and practices enable cross-disciplinary co-location of design information and integration of a range of platforms and timescales. [[Rapid prototyping]] and other [[3D printing]] technologies enable instant production of physical artefacts, both representational and functional, even at an architectural scale, to an ever-wider audience.

There are severe criticisms of the use of currently popular design software, however, because of the impossibility of future residents and users to access them. P2P Urbanism promotes low-tech design solutions that collect traditionally-derived design knowledge and makes it available on an open-source web platform. This focus instead promotes traditional local materials and building techniques in [[vernacular architecture]] and is entirely distinct from that of the virtual design groups focusing upon the extremely expensive parametric design. The proponents of P2P Urbanism also philosophically oppose what they see as "fashionable" design approaches because of a link to unsustainable products, strong commercial interests, and total control by only a few participants—which is the opposite of opening up design to the whole population. In their view the point of open-source design should be to facilitate users designing and building their own dwellings, not to continue promoting a design elite that includes current [[starchitect]]s.

==Construction==

The burgeoning [[open-source hardware]] movement enables sharing of and collaboration on the hardware involved in designing kinetic or smart environments that tightly integrate software, hardware, and mechanisms. Through these various tools, informed by sensor data, design becomes an ongoing, evolutionary process, as opposed to the one-off, disjointed fire-and-forget method of traditional design. This is an acknowledgement of the fact that design has always been an unending process, as well as a collaboration between users and designers. Operating systems for the design, construction and occupancy phases become possible, created as open platforms stimulating a rich ecosystem of 'apps'. Various practices jostle to become the [[Linux]] of architectural software, engaging in 'platform plays' at different scales rather than delivery of plans and sections. Embedded sensing and computing increasingly mesh all materials within the larger "[[Internet of things]]", evolving ever closer towards [[Bruce Sterling]]'s vision of a world of [[Spimes]]. Materials communicate their position and state during fabrication and construction, aiding positioning, fixing and verification, and continue to communicate with distributed databases for the extent of their lifetime.

==Occupancy==

Today’s OSArc enables inhabitants to control and shape their personal environment – “to Inhabit is to Design”, as [[N. John Habraken|John Habraken]] put it. This aspect is enhanced by today’s fully sentient networked spaces, constantly communicating their various properties, states and attributes – often through decentralised and devolved systems. Crucial system feedback is supplied by a wide range of users and occupants, often either by miniature electronic devices or mobile phones – [[crowdsourcing]] (like crowd-funding) large volumes of small data feeds to provide accurate and expansive real-time information. Personalisation replaces standardisation as spaces 'intelligently' recognise and respond to individual occupants. Representations of spaces become as vital after construction as they are before; [[Real-time data|real-time monitoring]], feedback and [[ambient displays|ambient display]] become integral elements to the ongoing life of spaces and objects. Maintenance and operations become extended inseparable phases of the construction process; a building is never "complete" in open-source architecture's world of growth and change.

If tomorrow’s buildings and cities will be like "computers to live in"&lt;!--(apologies to [[Le Corbusier]])--&gt; (see also: [[smart city]]) open-source architecture provides an open, collaborative framework for writing their operating software in real world conditions reflecting the principles of the citizen-centered architecture movement, as well as, the mindful policy engagement field, namely, unique designs for unique contexts, reflecting individual users' values through value rational planning and engagement-based praxis.

'''Opera management''' is the management of the processes by which [[opera]] is delivered to audiences. A multifaceted task, it involves managing an opera company, primarily the singers and musicians who perform the operas, but in many cases also managing the [[opera house]] in which the company performs. 

Opera is a complex art form involving high fixed costs and requiring complex management. In addition to the singers and musicians who form the core of the company its production requires scenery and costumes and sometimes dancers and non-singing actors. Fixed costs in today's opera organizations—keeping many of the singers and musicians on year-round contracts, and if managing their own theatre, the cost of workers needed to create and maintain the sets and costumes as well as the cost of maintaining and running the building—combined with the costs of individual productions, make opera the most expensive of the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Towse, Ruth (2011).  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eyXQbYAXCBQC&amp;pg=PA313&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MW7ZT8myMIrE0QX62-n8Aw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "Opera and Ballet"], p. 313 in Ruth Towse (ed.) ''A Handbook of Cultural Economics''. Edward Elgar Publishing. {{ISBN|1848448872}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in the 19th century when opera was largely run by individual [[impresario]]s rather than large organisations, opera management as a profession was characterised as "a devouror of the fortunes of the victims it has tempted by its seductions".&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader'' (6 August 1864). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?pg=PA175&amp;dq=opera+management&amp;ei=GULbT8PqK82r8AO-zK3JCw&amp;id=ToBNAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=opera%20management&amp;f=false "The Opera Season at Covent Garden"], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Gye]], who turned the [[Royal Italian Opera]] in Covent Garden into one of London's premiere opera houses in the 19th century and who shaped the careers of many famous singers, described opera management as a "dreadful business".&lt;ref&gt;Dideriksen, Gabriella and Ringel, Matthew (1995). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/746717 "Frederick Gye and 'The Dreadful Business of Opera Management'"], ''19th-Century Music'', Vol. 19, No. 1 (Summer, 1995), pp. 3-30. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venice and the development of opera as a business==
The [[origins of opera|earliest operas]] were privately performed and financed by the noble families who commissioned them, often to mark great court occasions. One such example was [[Marco da Gagliano]]'s ''[[La Flora]]'',  performed in 1628 at the Medici Palace in Florence to celebrate the marriage of [[Margherita de' Medici]] and  [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma]]. [[Archduchess Maria Maddalena of Austria|Grand Duchess Maria Maddalena]], the wife of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II de' Medici]] and the mother of the bride, took an active role in the planning of the production. She secured the services of the musicians and singers, attended the rehearsals, and according to musicologist Kelley Harness, may well have contributed to the development of the plot as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harness, Kelley Ann (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfj1sn6m_XoC&amp;q=%22La+Flora%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22La%20Flora%22&amp;f=false ''Echoes of Women's Voices: Music, Art, and Female Patronage in Early Modern Florence''], p. 175. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226316599}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Publicly performed operas first appeared in [[Venice]] during the [[Carnival|Carnival season]] of 1637. This was facilitated by the large number of public theatres already present in the city which originally served for the production of plays. They were built by noble families such as the [[Grimani]], [[Nicolò Tron|Tron]],  and [[Vendramin]]. The rebuilt [[Teatro San Cassiano]], sponsored by the Tron family, was the first in the world specifically devoted to opera. Performances of ''L'Andromeda'' in 1637 by librettist [[Benedetto Ferrari]] and composer [[Francesco Manelli]] marked the theatre's first commercially produced opera.&lt;ref&gt;Ringer, Mark (2006). ''Opera's First Master: The Musical Dramas of Claudio Monteverdi'', pp. 130-131. Amadeus Press. {{ISBN|1574671103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of cases the [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Venetian owners  profited from their theatres by renting them out to others who produced and managed the opera performances. The key figure in the actual production of the operas was the impresario, who assembled the singers, musicians and creative team and made the business and artistic decisions. Sometimes the impresarios were hired by the theatre renters and their backers. On other occasions the impresario was also one of the investors and the renter of the theatre. The ''cassier'' (cashier) was in charge the financial side of the production, including handling the payments and receipts. While the ''cassier'' was sometimes a separate member of the management team, in many instances the impresario also acted as the ''cassier''.&lt;ref&gt;Glixon, Beth Lise and Glixon, Jonathan Emmanuel (2006).

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195154169}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous impresarios of the day was [[Marco Faustini]] who managed several Venetian opera houses in the course of his career.

[[File:Student from UNY reading short story by Evi Idawati 2015-06-08 06.jpg|thumb|A student of [[Yogyakarta State University]] performing a dramatic reading of a short story]]
'''Oral Interpretation''' is a dramatic art, also commonly called "interpretive reading" and "dramatic reading", though these terms are more conservative and restrictive.  In certain applications, oral interpretation is also a theatre art – as in reader's theatre, in which a work of literature is performed with manuscripts in hand or, more traditionally, using stools and music stands; and especially chamber theatre, which dispenses with manuscripts and uses what may be described as essentialist costuming and stage lighting, and suggestive scenery.

The term is succinctly defined by [[Paul Campbel]]l (''The Speaking and Speakers of Literature''; Dickinson, 1967) as the "oralization of literature"; or more eloquently, if less intelligibly, by Charlotte Lee and Timothy Gura (''Oral Interpretation''; Houghton-Mifflin, 1997) as "the art of communicating to an audience a work of literary art in its intellectual, emotional, and aesthetic entirety".  Historically essential to Charlotte Lee's definition of oral interpretation is the fact the performer is "reading from a manuscript".  This perspective, once the majority view, has long since become the minority opinion on the question; so that whether one is or is not reading from a manuscript, the art retains the same name.

Voice and movement technique is ''opsis'' ("spectacle") while oral interpretation is, conceptually, ''melopoiia'' ("music technique").

Because oral interpretation is an essential dramatic element in all performance art (even dance, in which the oral element is most typically a silent element), all actors, singers, storytellers, etc., are ''interpreters'' – but not all interpreters are necessarily actors, or singers, or storytellers, and so on.  When, for example, the writer [[David Sedaris]] reads one of his stories on stage, or when [[Leonard Cohen]] performs one of his lyric poems, they are both engaged in the art of oral interpretation.

In the United States, there is a historic and purely academic argument as to whether oral interpretation and drama/theatre performance are different names for the same thing or whether they are completely different art forms.  This argument is almost exclusively found at colleges and universities whose theatre programs evolved in departments historically or currently called "English and Speech", "Speech and Dramatic Arts" or "Communication and Theatre Arts".  The argument is rarely heard in theatre programs that did not evolve out of English and/or Speech Communication departments, such as those associated with schools/colleges of music.

In high schools across the United States, Oral Interpretation is a very highly valued competition event, particularly in the mid-western states, such as Nebraska, Iowa, and South Dakota.  Students select a work of literature, make a cutting of the literature to fit a time limit of 10 minutes, and perform it in several rounds at tournaments across their state. The piece must be from a published, worthwhile piece of literature, with the exception of Readers Theatre. The categories of said event are as follows:
* Serious Prose—Interpretation of a work of prose literature with a serious basis. Single-person event.
* Humorous Interp—Interpretation of any published work of comedic literature. Single-person event
* Dramatic Interp—Interpretation of a dramatic play with a serious nature. Single-person event.
* Poetry—Interpretation of a published work of poetry. Single-person event.
* Non-Original Oratory—Interpretation of an oratorical speech that has been previously delivered. Single-person event.
* Duo Interpretation—Interpretation of a piece of literature where two Interpers are involved. The pair may not look at nor touch each other, and must deliver the piece in the direction of the audience. This category has the most stringent rules.
* Readers Theatre—A theatrical interpretation performance where 3-6 people participate. They may perform an original piece, or they may take a cutting from a work of literature. This category has the least amount of rules.

'''Rag painting''' or '''ragging''' is a form of [[faux painting]] using paint thinned out with [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] and old rags to create a lively texture on walls and other surfaces.  [[Image:sch ewf 5.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of the ragging design with a stencil]]

Ragging can be done as a negative or positive technique.  The former involves rolling glaze over the entire surface, and removing it with clean rags to reveal the underlying paint color in a pleasing textural pattern.  The latter is accomplished by applying glaze directly to the wall with a rag, and creates a similar pattern.  Ragging is a very adaptable finish that can be used in a variety of areas, creating the illusion of an old world texture, but on a flat surface that can be easily painted over.

Ragging can be done in a variety of patterns, including rag rolling, in which the rags are twisted together and then rolled over a wet glazed surface creating the illusion of fabrics such a velvet or silk.  Ragging is also often used as a pattern underneath stenciling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21614">In [[linguistics]], '''sound symbolism''', '''phonesthesia''' or '''phonosemantics''' is the idea that vocal sounds or [[phoneme]]s carry meaning in and of themselves.

==Origin==
In the 18th century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] propagated a theory that words containing certain sounds should bear certain meanings; for instance, the front vowel sounds E, I, YU should be used when depicting tender subjects and those with back vowel sounds O, U, Y when describing things that may cause fear ("like anger, envy, pain, and sorrow").&lt;ref&gt;[http://feb-web.ru/feb/lomonos/texts/lo0/lo7/lo7-0892.htm М. В. Ломоносов. Краткое руководство к красноречию. Книга первая, в которой содержится риторика, показующая общие правила обоего красноречия, то есть оратории и поэзии, сочиненная в пользу любящих словесные науки (1748)] // Ломоносов М. В. Полное собрание сочинений / АН СССР. — М.; Л., 1950—1983.
Т. 7: Труды по филологии 1739—1758 гг. — М.; Л.: Изд-во АН СССР, 1952. — С. 242 (§ 172).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) who is considered to be the founder of modern 'scientific' linguistics. Central to what de Saussure says about words are two related statements: First, he says that "the [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]] is arbitrary". He considers the words that we use to indicate things and concepts could be any words &amp;mdash; they are essentially just a consensus agreed upon by the speakers of a language and have no discernible pattern or relationship to the thing. Second, he says that, because words are arbitrary, they have meaning only in relation to other words. A dog is a dog because it is not a cat or a mouse or a horse, etc. These ideas have permeated the study of words since the 19th century.

==Types==

[[Margaret Magnus]] is the author of a comprehensive book designed to explain phonosemantics to the lay reader: ''Gods in the Word''. This work describes three types of sound symbolism using a model first proposed by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (see below):

===Onomatopoeia===
{{see also|Onomatopoeia}}
This is the least significant type of symbolism. It is simply imitative of sounds or suggests something that makes a sound. Some examples are "crash", "bang", and "whoosh".

===Clustering===

Words that share a sound sometimes have something in common. If we take, for example, words that have no prefix or suffix and group them according to meaning, some of them will fall into a number of categories. So we find that there is a group of words beginning with /b/ that are about barriers, bulges and bursting, and some other group of /b/ words that are about being banged, beaten, battered, bruised, blistered and bashed. This proportion is, according to Magnus, above the average for other letters.

Another hypothesis states that if a word begins with a particular phoneme, then there is likely to be a number of other words starting with that phoneme that refer to the same thing. An example given by Magnus is if the basic word for 'house' in a given language starts with a /h/, then by clustering, disproportionately many words containing /h/ can be expected to concern housing: hut, home, hovel, habitat...

Sound symbolic words cannot be broken down into smaller units of meaning. Sound clusters are not treated as [[morpheme]]s. Words beginning with /gl/ (glitter, gleam, glow, glisten, etc.) pertain to light reflection but [gl] on its own has no meaning nor does every other word with /gl/ refer to light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907495600|title=Introducing morphology|last=Lieber|first=Rochelle|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016|isbn=9781107480155|edition= Second |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=48|oclc=907495600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clustering is language dependent, although closely related languages will have similar clustering relationships.

===Iconism===
Iconism, according to Magnus, becomes apparent when comparing words which have the same sort of referent. One way is to look at a group of words that all refer to the same thing and that differ only in their sound, such as 'stamp', 'stomp', 'tamp', 'tromp', 'tramp', and 'step'. An /m/ before the /p/ in some words makes the action more forceful; compare 'stamp' with 'step' or 'tamp' with 'tap'. According to Magnus, the /r/ sets the word in motion, especially after a /t/ so a 'tamp' is in one place, but a 'tramp' goes for a walk. The /p/ in all those words would be what emphasizes the individual steps.

Magnus suggests that this kind of iconism is universal across languages.

===Phenomimes and psychomimes===

Some languages possess a category of words midway between onomatopoeia and usual words. Whereas [[onomatopoeia]] refers to the use of words to imitate actual sounds, there are languages known for having a special class of words that "imitate" soundless states or events, called ''phenomimes'' (when they describe external phenomena) and ''psychomimes'' (when they describe psychological states). On a scale that orders all words according to the correlation between their meaning and their sound, with the sound-imitating words like ''meow'' and ''whack'' at one end, and with the conventional words like ''water'' and ''blue'' at the other end, the phenomimes and the psychomimes would be somewhere in the middle. In the case of the Japanese language, for example, such words are learned in early childhood and are considerably more effective than usual words in conveying feelings and states of mind or in describing states, motions, and transformations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.aall.ufl.edu/SJS/Baba.pdf Junko Baba, "Pragmatic Function of Japanese Mimesis in Emotive Discourse"] The author shows that psychomimes "create more vivid and intensified expressions to fuel the liveliness of the personal conversation" and "are effectively used to dramatize the emotive state of the protagonist".&lt;/ref&gt; They are not found, however, only in children's vocabulary, but widely used in daily conversation among adults and even in more formal writing. Like Japanese, the Korean language also has a relatively high proportion of phenomimes and psychomimes.

==History of phonosemantics==

Several ancient traditions exist which talk about an archetypal relationship between sounds and ideas. Some of these are discussed below, but there are others as well. If we include a link between ''letters'' and ideas then the list includes the [[Viking]] ''[[Runes]]'', the [[Hebrew]] ''[[Kabbalah]]'', the [[Arab]] ''[[Abjad]]'', etc.. References of this kind are very common in [[The Upanishads]], The [[Nag Hammadi Library]], the [[Celt]]ic ''[[Book of Taliesin]]'', as well as [[early Christian]] works, the [[Shinto]] [[Kototama]], and [[Shingon]] [[Buddhism]].

===Old Chinese===

Sinologist Axel Schuessler asserts that in [[Old Chinese]], "Occasionally, certain meanings are associated with certain sounds."&lt;ref name="Schuessler"&gt;Schuessler (2007), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning initials, he suggests that words with meanings such as "dark, black, covered" etc. tend begin with &lt;tt&gt;*m-&lt;/tt&gt;, while those indicating "soft, subtle, flexible" begin with &lt;tt&gt;*n-&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt; Taking a broader perspective, he also notes that "Roots and stems meaning 'round, turn, return' have an initial &lt;tt&gt;*w-&lt;/tt&gt; not only in Chinese, but generally in the languages of the area."&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt;

As for finals in Old Chinese, Schuessler points out, "Words that signify movement with an abrupt endpoint often end in &lt;tt&gt;*-k&lt;/tt&gt;," and "Words with the meaning 'shutting, closing' [...] tend to end in final &lt;tt&gt;*-p&lt;/tt&gt;."&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt; He also notes an overlap between the significations of initial &lt;tt&gt;*m-&lt;/tt&gt; and final &lt;tt&gt;*-m&lt;/tt&gt;: "Words that imply 'keeping in a closed mouth' tend to end in a final &lt;tt&gt;*-m&lt;/tt&gt;".&lt;ref name="Schuessler"/&gt;

===Plato and the Cratylus Dialogue===

In ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', [[Plato]] has [[Socrates]] commenting on the origins and correctness of various names and words. When [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]] asks if he can provide another hypothesis on how signs come into being (his own is simply 'convention'), Socrates initially suggests that they fit their referents in virtue of the sounds they are made of:

{{quote|Now the letter [[rho]], as I was saying, appeared to the imposer of names an excellent instrument for the expression of motion; and he frequently uses the letter for this purpose: for example, in the actual words rein and roe he represents motion by rho; also in the words tromos (trembling), trachus (rugged); and again, in words such as krouein (strike), thrauein (crush), ereikein (bruise), thruptein (break), kermatixein (crumble), rumbein (whirl): of all these sorts of movements he generally finds an expression in the letter R, because, as I imagine, he had observed that the tongue was most agitated and least at rest in the pronunciation of this letter, which he therefore used in order to express motion|Cratylus.&lt;ref&gt;(note this is an open source translation available at [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/cratylus.html Internet Classics Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, faced by an overwhelming number of counterexamples given by Hermogenes, Socrates has to admit that "my first notions of original names are truly wild and ridiculous".

===Upanishads===

The [[Upanishads]] contain a lot of material about sound symbolism, for instance:

{{quote|The mute consonants represent the earth, the sibilants the sky, the vowels heaven. The mute consonants represent fire, the sibilants air, the vowels the sun… The mute consonants represent the eye, the sibilants the ear, the vowels the mind.|[[Aitareya Aranyaka]] III.2.6.2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe01/sbe01237.htm] [[The Upanishads]], translated by [[Max Müller]], 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Shingon Buddhism===

[[Kūkai]], the founder of [[Shingon]], wrote his ''Sound, word, reality'' in the 9th century which relates all sounds to the voice of the [[trikaya|Dharmakaya]] [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

===Early Western phonosemantics===

The idea of phonosemantics was sporadically discussed during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]]. In 1690, [[John Locke|Locke]] wrote against the idea in an essay called "[[An Essay on Human Understanding]]". His argument was that if there were any connection between sounds and ideas, then we would all be speaking the same language, but this is an over-generalisation. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s book ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding]]'' published in 1765 contains a point by point critique of Locke's essay. Leibniz picks up on the generalization used by Locke and adopts a less rigid approach: clearly there is no perfect correspondence between words and things, but neither is the relationship completely arbitrary, although he seems vague about what that relationship might be.&lt;ref&gt;adapted from a literature review by Magnus - see website below&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern phonosemantics===
In 1836 [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] published ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwicklung des Menschengeschlechts.'' It is here that he establishes the three kinds of relationship between sounds and ideas as discussed above under '''Types of Sound Symbolism'''. Below is a sample of researchers in the field of phonosemantics.

[[Otto Jespersen]] suggests that: "Sound symbolism, we may say, makes some words more fit to survive."  [[Dwight Bolinger]] of [[Harvard University]] was the primary proponent of phonosemantics through the late 1940s and the 1950s. In 1949, he published ''The Sign is Not Arbitrary''. He concluded that [[morpheme]]s cannot be defined as the minimal meaning-bearing units, in part because [[Meaning (linguistic)|linguistic meaning]] is so ill-defined, and in part because there are obvious situations in which smaller units are meaning-bearing.

[[Ivan Fónagy]] (1963) correlates phonemes with [[metaphors]]. For example, nasal and velarized vowels are quite generally considered ‘dark’, front vowels as ‘fine’ and ‘high’. Unvoiced stops have been considered ‘thin’ by European linguists, whereas the fricatives were labelled ‘raw’ and ‘hairy’ by the Greeks.

[[Hans Marchand]] provided the first extensive list of English [[phonestheme]]s. He wrote, for example, that "/l/ at the end of a word symbolizes prolongation, continuation" or "nasals at the end of a word express continuous vibrating sounds."

[[Gérard Genette]] published the only full length history of phonosemantics, ''Mimologics'' (1976). In 450 pages, Genette details the evolution of the linguistic iconism among linguists and poets, in syntax, morphology and phonology.&lt;ref&gt;The above review of modern phonosemantics is partially adapted from a literature review by Magnus - see website below.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguist [[Keith McCune]] demonstrated in his doctoral thesis that virtually every word in the [[Indonesian language]] has an iconic (phonosemantic) component. His two-volume doctoral thesis "The Internal Structure of Indonesian Roots" was completed at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1983 and published  in [[Jakarta]] in 1985.

==Relationship with neuroscience==

[[Image:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|250px|Booba and Kiki shapes|This image is an illustration of the [[Bouba/kiki effect]]. Canary Islands natives called the shape on the left "kiki" and the one on the right "bouba".]]

In the 2003 [[BBC]] [[Reith Lectures]], [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]] outlined his research into the links between [[brain structure]] and function. In the fourth lecture of the series he describes the phenomena of [[synesthesia]] in which people experience, for example, sounds in terms of colors, or sounds in terms of tastes. In one type of synesthesia, people see numbers, letters of the alphabet, or even musical notes as having a distinct color. Ramachandran proposes a model for how language might have evolved.{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} The theory may explain how humans create [[metaphor]]s and how sounds can be metaphors for &lt;!--visual/mental--&gt; images – why for example sounds can be described as "bright" or "dull". In explaining how language might have evolved from cross activation of adjacent areas in the brain, Ramachandran notes four crucial factors, not all related to language, but which combined might have resulted in [[Origin of language|the emergence of language]]. Two of these four processes are of particular interest here.

''[[Synesthetic cross modal abstraction]]'': i.e. we recognize properties that sounds and images have in common and abstract them to store them independently. The sounds and shapes of the objects have characteristics in common that can be abstracted; for example, a "sharp", "cutting" quality of a word, and the shape it describes. Ramachandran calls this the '[[Bouba/kiki effect]]', based on the results of an experiment with two abstract shapes, one blob-like and the other spiky, that asked people to relate the nonsense words ''bouba'' and ''kiki'' to them. The effect is real and observable, repeatable across linguistic groups, and evident even in the description of the experiment (with the ''bouba'' shape usually described using similar-sounding words like ''bulbous'' or ''blobby'' while the ''kiki'' shape is ''prickly'' or ''spiky'').

''Built in preexisting cross activation''. Ramachandran points out that areas of the brain which appear to be involved in the mix-ups in synesthesia are adjacent to each other physically, and that cross-wiring, or cross activation, could explain synesthesia and our ability to make metaphors. He notes that the areas that control the muscles around the mouth are also adjacent to the visual centers, and suggests that certain words appear to make our mouth imitate the thing we are describing. Examples of this might be words like "teeny weeny", "diminutive" to describe small things; "large" or "enormous" to describe big things.

More recently, research on [[ideasthesia]] indicated that Kiki and Bouba have an entire semantic-like network of associated cross-modal experiences.

==Relationship with poetry==

The sound of words is important in the field of [[poetry]], and [[rhetoric]] more generally.  Tools such as [[euphony]], [[alliteration]], and [[rhyme]] all depend on the speaker or writer confidently choosing the best-sounding word.

[[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]]'s book ''Euphonics: A Poet's Dictionary of Enchantments'' collects lists of words of similar meaning and similar sounds. For example, the entry for "gl-" contains words for shiny things: glisten, gleam, glint, glare, glam, glimmer, glaze, glass, glitz, gloss, [[glory (optical phenomenon)|glory]], glow, and glitter.  Likewise, in German, nouns starting with "kno-" and "knö-" are mostly small and round: ''Knoblauch'' "garlic", ''Knöchel'' "ankle", ''Knödel'' "dumpling", ''Knolle'' "tuber", ''Knopf'' "button", ''Knorren'' "knot (in a tree)", ''Knospe'' "bud (of a plant)", ''Knoten'' "knot (in string or rope)".

==Use in commerce==
Phonesthesia is used in commerce for the names of products and even companies themselves. According to linguist [[Steven Pinker]], one particularly "egregious example" was when cigarette maker [[Philip Morris International|Philip Morris]] rebranded to [[Altria]]. The name "Altria" is claimed to come from the Latin word for "high"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-2337818_ITM | work=Finance Wire | title=Altria Director Discusses Rebranding Company, CNNfn | date=November 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Pinker sees the change as an attempt to "switch its image from bad people who sell addictive [[carcinogen]]s to a place or state marked by [[altruism]] and other lofty values".&lt;ref name="Pinker"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Stuff of Thought | publisher=Penguin Books | year=2007 | accessdate=21 August 2013 | author=Pinker, Steven | pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand names of many pharmaceuticals are common examples.

'''Sports photography''' refers to the genre of [[photography]] that covers all types of [[sport]]s.

In the majority of cases, professional sports photography is a branch of ''[[photojournalism]],'' while amateur sports photography, such as photos of children playing [[association football]], is a branch of ''[[vernacular photography]].''

The main application of professional sports photography is for editorial purposes; dedicated sports photographers usually work for newspapers, major wire agencies or dedicated sports magazines.  However, sports photography is also used for advertising purposes both to build a brand and as well as to promote a sport in a way that cannot be accomplished by editorial means.

Equipment typically used for sports photography includes a [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera]] with high [[Burst mode (photography)|continuous shooting]] speeds and interchangeable lenses ranging from 14mm to 400mm or longer in [[focal length]], depending on the type of sport. The proper lenses are very important as they allow the photographer to reach closer or farther as quickly as possible to keep up with the game play. Essential accessories include a [[monopod]] or [[Tripod (photography)|tripod]] for stability and extra batteries. Longer focal length lenses are typically used to photograph action in sports such as football, while wide angle lenses can be used for sideline and close-up athlete photos.

===Camera bodies===
The preferred camera bodies for modern sports photography have fast autofocus and high burst rates, typically 8 [[frames per second]] or faster. The current flagship sports cameras produced by Canon and Nikon are the [[Canon EOS-1D X Mark II]] and the [[Nikon D5]]; these are popular in professional sports photography.

===Lenses===
Different sports favor different lenses,&lt;ref name="tdpoutdoor" /&gt; but sports photography usually requires [[Lens speed|fast]] (wide aperture) [[telephoto]] lenses, with fast [[autofocus]] performance. Fast autofocus is needed to focus on movement, telephoto to get close to the action, and wide aperture for several reasons:
* The background is dramatically put out of focus due to a shallow [[depth of field]], resulting in better subject isolation.
* The lenses can focus more quickly due to the increase in light entering the lens – important with fast-moving action.
* Faster shutter speeds can be used to freeze the action.
Extremely wide apertures (such as f/1.2 or f/1.4) are more rarely used, because at these apertures the [[depth of field]] is very shallow, which makes focusing more difficult and slows down autofocus.&lt;ref name="tdpindoor" /&gt; The main distinction is between outdoor sports and indoor sports – in outdoor sports the distances are greater and the light brighter,&lt;ref name="tdpoutdoor"&gt;[http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Canon-Lenses/Canon-Outdoor-Sports-Lens.aspx Canon Outdoor Sports Lens Recommendations], The Digital Picture&lt;/ref&gt; while in indoor sports the distances are lesser and the light dimmer.&lt;ref name="tdpindoor"&gt;[http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Canon-Lenses/Canon-Indoor-Sports-Lens.aspx Canon Indoor Sports Lens Recommendations], The Digital Picture&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, outdoor sports tend to have longer focal length [[long focus lens]]es with slower apertures, while indoor sports tend to have shorter lenses with faster apertures.

Both zoom and prime lenses are used; zoom lenses (generally in the 70–200, 75–300, 100–400 or 200-400 range) allow a greater range of framing; primes are faster, cheaper, lighter, and optically superior, but are more restricted in framing. As an example the Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 400mm f/2.8G ED VR AF lens and the Canon EF 300mm f/2.8L IS II USM lens are both fixed telephoto lenses which cannot zoom.

[[Aperture]]s of f/2.8 or faster are most often used, though f/4 is also found, particularly on brighter days. Particularly visible are the Canon super telephoto lenses, whose distinctive white casing (to dissipate the sun's heat) is recognizable at many sporting events. Of these, the [[Canon EF 400mm lens|Canon 400mm f/2.8]] is particularly recommended for field sports such as [[football]].&lt;ref name="tdpoutdoor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-digital-picture.com/Reviews/Canon-EF-400mm-f-2.8-L-IS-USM-Lens-Review.aspx Canon EF 400mm f/2.8 L IS USM Lens Review], The Digital Picture&lt;/ref&gt;

This varies with sport and preference; for example [[golf]] photographers may prefer to use a 500mm f/4 as opposed to a 400mm f/2.8 as it is a lighter lens to be carried around all day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ephotographyclasses.com Photography Classes] Retrieved 21 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indoor sports photography, as mentioned earlier, can present its own challenges with less distance between the action and photographer and extreme lighting.  For example, competition cheerleading allows for photographers to be up close to the action while looking upwards directly into harsh stage lighting against a black background.  A different approach to such a situation is to use the prime lens named a "nifty fifty".  The shutter speed is extremely fast while still setting the aperture to bring in enough light.  In this scenario a budget telephoto lens would produce both dark and blurry images.  Using a prime 50mm lens is a budget friendly option for many other indoor events such as school plays, concerts, dance recitals, etc.

===Remote cameras===
Sports photographers may use remote cameras triggered by wireless shutter devices (i.e. [[PocketWizard|Pocket Wizards]]) to photograph from places they could not otherwise stay, for example in an elevated position such as above a basketball basket, or to be in two places at once, i.e. at the start and the finish - such as at horse racing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Technique==
Location is often important for sports photography. At big events, professional photographers often shoot from VIP spots with the best views, usually as close to the action as possible. Most sports require the photographer to frame their images with speed and adjust camera settings spontaneously to prevent blurring or incorrect exposure. Some sports photography is also done from a distance to give the game a unique effect.

[[File:DTM Mercedes W204 DiResta09 amk.jpg|thumb|[[Panning (camera)|Panning]]]]
Shutter speed is critical to catching motion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://iconiccamera.com/sports-photography-tips-for-beginners/ |title= Sports Photography Tips For Beginners |access-date=26 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, thus sports photography is often done in [[shutter priority]] mode or manual. A frequent goal is to capture an instant with minimal blur, in which case a minimal shutter speed is desired, but in other cases a slower shutter speed is used so that blur shows to capture the motion, not simply the instant. A particular technique is [[Panning (camera)|panning]], where the camera uses an intermediate shutter speed and pans with the subject, yielding a relatively sharp subject and a background blurred in the direction of motion, yielding a sense of speed – compare [[speed line]]s.

ISO speed is often high (to allow faster shutter speeds) and may be left in auto.

Photos are often taken in burst mode to capture the best moment, sometimes in combination with JPEG rather than RAW shooting (JPEG files being smaller, these allow longer bursts).

===Strip photography===
{{further|Strip photography}}
While the vast majority of sports photography focuses on capturing a moment, possibly with some blur, the technique of [[strip photography]] is sometimes used to instead show motion over time. This is most prominent in a [[photo finish]], but can also be used for other purposes, often yielding unusually distorted images.

==Notable photographers==
A number of notable photographers are known for their sports work; they have often worked for the magazines ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' or ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''

{{short description|c.1655-1665 oil on oak panel painting by Jan Steen}}
[[File:Het_dronken_paar_Rijksmuseum_SK-C-232.jpeg|thumb|350px]]
'''''The Drunken Couple''''' is a c.1655-1665 oil on oak panel painting by [[Jan Steen]], now in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. [[Adriaan van der Hoop]] left it and the rest of his collection to the city of Amsterdam in 1854. It was initially assigned to the [[Museum Van der Hoop]] before being moved to its present home on 30 June 1885.

'''''The Golf Players''''' (1658) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on panel painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]], it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of [[Polesden Lacey]].

This painting by Hooch was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote; "305. The Game of Golf. In an entrance-hall paved with red tiles a little girl carrying a golf-club stands with her hand on the latch of an open door. She looks at a boy who is playing golf in the courtyard. In the distance is a village. Panel, 25 inches by 18 inches. Formerly in the collection of Count von Fries, Vienna. 
Sales:

* Pierard of Valenciennes, in Paris, March 21, 1860, No. 29.

This painting seems to have been a successful design for De Hooch as there are several variations on the subject of this little girl in the doorway:

'''''The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children, And The Family''''' is a book of social criticism written by [[Marie Winn]] and published in 1977 by [[Viking Penguin]] with the {{ISBN|0140076980}}. In it, Winn brought the communications medium of [[television]] under withering fire, accusing it of wielding an addictive influence on the very young.

Wrote Winn: &lt;blockquote&gt; "The very nature of the television experience apart from the contents of the programs is rarely considered. Perhaps the ever-changing array of sights and sounds coming out of the machine--the wild variety of images meeting the eye and the barrage of human and inhuman sounds reaching the ear--fosters the illusion of a varied experience for the viewer. It is easy to overlook a deceptively simple fact: one is always ''watching television'' when one is watching television rather than having any other experience."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 25th-anniversary revision was published in 2002, which included new material that was subtitled "Television, Computers, And Family Life". Winn was even more hostile to the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] than she had been to television itself twenty-five years before.

''''' The Verdict of the People''''' is an 1854 painting by [[George Caleb Bingham]], currently owned by the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]].

The last painting of Bingham's Election Series, ''The Verdict of the People'' tells the end of the story represented in the series. Within this painting, Bingham hid several political motives and ideas similar to the rest of the Election Series.  Historians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/opinion/donald-trump-verdict-of-the-people-821138|title=Donald Trump Meets The Verdict of the People - artnet News|date=18 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; say the painting depicts public reaction to a likely proslavery candidate's election victory.

Completed in 1854, the work covered issues of slavery, temperance, and a representative government, subjects that had gone from a local to a national level. During the early 1850s, the temperance movement grew and more states were abolishing alcohol. A book by Herman Humphrey, titled ''Parallel between Intemperance and Slavery'', associated the cause of anti-slavery to that of temperance. Bingham showed his view on intemperance and slavery by painting a banner that said, "Freedom for Virtue[,] Restriction for Vice." The banner referred to temperance by saying that the vice and alcohol would need to be restricted for the people to be free. The banner then references Bingham's ideas of slavery by using the connection of the temperance movement and the anti-slavery movement to show that Bingham thought negatively about slavery and shared that view with intemperance.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

When [[Donald Trump]] was [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inaugurated]] as the 45th president of the United States on Jan. 20, 2017, ''The Verdict of the People'' was the chosen painting, hanging on a partition wall behind the ceremonial head table in the Capitol's Statuary Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/donald-trump-will-eat-his-inaugural-lunch-in-front-of-an-image-of-slavery/2017/01/13/961a31e0-d76e-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html|title=The controversy behind the painting that will hang at Trump’s inaugural luncheon|publisher=[[Washington Post]]| accessdate =January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art''''' is a 2015 American [[documentary film]] directed by [[James Crump]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/land-art-smithson-holt-heizer-troublemakers-movie/ Su Wu, ''A New Documentary Sheds Light on the 'Troublemakers' of Land Art, T Magazine, ''May 4, 2015'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/virginia-dwan Christopher Bollen, ''LandArt'', ''Interview Magazine'', August 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://artforum.com/words/id=54731 Laura Hoffmann, ''James Crump Discusses'' Troublemakers The Story of Land Art, ''Artforum''], September 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/land-art-gets-its-close-up-in-new-film-1443403854 Andy Battaglia, ''Land Art Gets Its Close-Up In New Film'', ''Wall Street Journal''] September 27, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ''Troublemakers'' chronicles the history of [[land art]] in the 1960s and 1970s, when a group of radical New York artists began producing earthworks on a monumental scale in the desert spaces of the American southwest.

==Reception==
Eric Gibson of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing, "A film that takes its place among the great art documentaries of the past half-century... filled with great moments, large and small... deftly captures the madcap ambition, grandeur and even sublimity of the works these artists created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/troublemakers-the-story-of-land-art-review-1444081218|title='Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art' Review|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glenn Kenny of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in a NYT Critics' Pick called it a "thrilling documentary," writing "The film’s generous views of spectacular works like Smithson’s monumental ([[Spiral Jetty]]) (the work projects into the Great Salt Lake in Utah) and Mr. Heizer’s ([[Double Negative (artwork)|Double Negative]]) in Nevada (a huge trench bisected by a canyon) are best seen on the largest screen available." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/movies/review-troublemakers-the-story-of-land-art-a-documentary.html Glenn Kenny, Review: ''Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art'', a Documentary, ''The New York Times,'' January 8, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; John DeFore of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called the film "a colorful and sometimes gorgeous primer on this influential moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/troublemakers-story-land-art-film-832275|title='Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art': Film Review|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan Hoffman, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'' of London proclaimed "Forget ''Dawn of Justice'' – this is the best superhero team-up we’ll see at the cinema this year."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/08/troublemakers-the-story-of-land-art-robert-smithson-walter-de-maria-michael-heizer Jordan Hoffman, ''Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art Review - a story of art superheroes, The Guardian, ''January 8, 2016'']&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', Patricia Zohn declared ''Troublemakers'' "does something that is rare for art documentaries: It is very beautiful and dynamic itself in examining work that is challenging.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2119">A '''visual narrative''' (also '''visual storytelling''')&lt;ref&gt;Tony C. Caputo, ''Visual Storytelling: The Art and Technique'', Watson-Guptill Publications, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; is a story told primarily through the use of visual media. The story may be told using still [[photography]], [[illustration]], or [[video]], and can be enhanced with [[graphics]], music, voice and other audio.

==Overview&lt;!--'Visual narratology' redirects here--&gt;==
The term "visual narrative" has been used to describe several genres of visual storytelling, from news and information ([[photojournalism]], the [[photo essay]], the [[documentary film]]) to entertainment (art, movies, television, [[comic book]]s, the [[graphic novel]]). In short, any kind of a story, told visually, is a visual narrative.

The visual narrative has also been of interest to the academic community as scholars, thinkers and educators have sought to understand the impact and power of image and narrative in individuals and societies. The corresponding discipline is called '''visual [[narratology]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.imageandnarrative.be Image &lt;nowiki&gt;[&amp;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Narrative]'' – "a peer-reviewed [[e-journal]] on visual narratology in the broadest sense of the term".&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing characteristics of the visual narrative include:
*a persuasive story with a point of view
*high quality images, still or moving
*subject matter with pressing social, environmental, or spiritual value
*an appeal (explicit or implicit) for transformation in attitudes and behaviors

[[Image:20130609 in Zagreb 14.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Well of Life'' in front of [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb]]]]

The '''''Well of Life''''' (sometimes also '''''At the Well of Life''''' or the '''''Fountain of Life'''''; {{lang-hr|Zdenac života}}) is a [[sculpture]] by the Croatian sculptor and architect [[Ivan Meštrović]] installed in front of the [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] on [[Republic of Croatia Square]] in [[Zagreb]], Croatia. It depicts people in various phases of life that crouch and twist their bodies around a well which symbolizes life, youth, and the source of eternal beauty.

==Description==
The sculpture is circular with relief of ten naked figures, a child, love couple and the old man, life-size, that crouch and twist their bodies around a well which contains water. Strong facial expressions of the figures show the joy of life which alternated rhythmically makes the life cycle. The figures are watching their reflections in the water, while their bodies appear to have been frozen in motion. The figures are arranged so that they show to viewer the purpose of the well, i.e., desire for life and joy, which can be seen best in young characters who are hugging and kissing as opposed to the old man who is at the end of his life and looks with grief into the well, a symbol of life. The sculpture depicts man's natural cycle, from birth to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zdenac života – Meštrovićevo remek-djelo|url=http://www.give-me-art.com/zdenac-zivota-mestrovicevo-remek-djelo/|website=Give-me-art.com|accessdate=16 October 2016|language=hr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture is smooth and rounded with no sharp edges or regular geometric forms. It is made of bronze, whose dark color is in great contrast to the whiteness of the rock on which it is placed. The transitions between light and shadow are mild. The sculpture is both [[wikt:convex|convex]] and [[wikt:concave|concave]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

[[Auguste Rodin]]'s influence on Meštrović can be seen in this sculpture. As art historian professor Ljiljana Čerina says, "With its shimmering surface treatment of the body, Meštrović brings Rodin's [[impressionism]] into the [[Vienna Secession]] which proves that he is rodinist among [[secession (art)|secessionists]], while later in [[Paris]] he proves that he is secessionist among rodinists."&lt;ref name="slobodnadalmacija1"&gt;{{cite web|title='Zdenac života' u HNK Split|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/scena/kultura/clanak/id/200337/zdenac-zivota-u-hnk-split|website=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|accessdate=16 October 2016|language=hr|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
Sculpture was made in 1905, and was exhibited in 1909 in the author's gallery in [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] street no. 12. In year 1912, sculpture  was bought by [[Izidor Kršnjavi]] and installed on the [[Republic of Croatia Square]]. It was placed in the cavity surrounded by walls so that naked bodies on it would not cause astonishment and critical comments of, at the time, conservative people of Zagreb. In correspondence with [[Ante Trumbić]], Meštrović clearly expressed his wish that ''Well of Life'' should be placed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]].&lt;ref name="slobodnadalmacija1"/&gt;

'''Zsuzsi Roboz''' (15 August 1929 – 9 July 2012) was a London-based [[Hungary|Hungarian]] painter &lt;ref name="guardianObit"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jul/19/zsuzi-roboz|title=Zsuzsi Roboz dies|author=Edward Lucie-Smith|date=19 July 2012|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; known for her [[Portrait|portraiture paintings]] and [[painting|paintings]] of the arts, her work hangs at multiple prominent galleries including the [[Tate|Tate Britain]] and [[National Portrait Gallery, London|The National Portrait Gallery]].&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.messums.com/artists/view/19Zsuzsi_Roboz|title=Zsuzsi Roboz|website=www.messums.com|access-date=2018-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Zsuzsi Roboz was born in [[Budapest]]. Her father, Imre Roboz, was the manager of the [[Comedy Theatre of Budapest]] ([[Comedy Theatre of Budapest|Vígszínház theatre]]), which specialised in [[operettas]]. Her mother, Edith Roboz, was a society hostess.&lt;ref name="guardianObit" /&gt;

As an only child, Roboz was largely raised by governesses seeing relatively little of her parents, but enjoyed spending time with them whenever their busy lives would permit. The Sunday morning walks with her parents were a happy memory for Roboz as it was one of the only times she could really talk to her parents, especially her father.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Roboz: A Painter's Paradox|last=Taylor|first=John Russell|publisher=The Studio of Fine Art Publications|year=2005|isbn=1-903438-85-3|location=Buckinghamshire|pages=13-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Roboz felt a change in Hungary as right-wing ideas became more prominent, especially with [[Nazi Germany]] invading Hungary's former sister state [[Austria]] in 1938. Eventually the liberal arts fell out of favour and Roboz's father, Imre, was deprived of his job which resulted in him handing it over to a friend, writer Harsanyi Zsolt. It was soon necessary for Imre to go into hiding, shortly followed by Roboz and her mother being moved to a separate accommodation. They heard very little of Imre and was eventually declared dead, although his body was never found.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[The Times]], after the [[Hungary in World War II|occupation of Hungary]] Imre was eventually forced to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] where he had been reported dead.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Zsuzsi Roboz |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/zsuzsi-roboz-009s790dflp |accessdate=17 November 2018 |publisher=The Times |date=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, different articles state different causes of Imre’s death, no one is certain of how he actually passed. Zsuzsi and her mother were hidden by a neighbour and eventually crossed the [[Danube]] where they were rescued by the Americans.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

After the war, the pair moved to [[France]] as her mother had remarried a Frenchman, but Zsuzsi found life in France difficult and left for secretarial school in [[London]] at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;  After arriving in London in 1947&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi" /&gt;, she worked for an old friend of her fathers, [[Alexander Korda]], an active and well-known figure in Cinema, as a typist and occasional dinner guest with celebrities such as [[John Garfield]].&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

It was during this time that Roboz was attending art classes at the [[Royal Academy Schools]] under the supervision of Peter Greenham&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi" /&gt;,  and would later catch the eye of [[Pietro Annigoni]].&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;  She would later leave to study in Italy as Annigoni’s pupil and upon returning to London after the year was up, she was considered a “brilliant draughtsman.”&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

== Career ==
After a brief period in [[France]], she was sent to secretarial school in [[London]] but would pursue a career in painting. Some of her paintings are exhibited at the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]] and the [[Tate Gallery]]. She was best known for her portraits of dancers, musicians and writers.&lt;ref&gt;Profile, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 23 August 2008; retrieved September 26, 2008, No 5504, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

While she may be known for her portraits and could have built a grand clientele based on her work, Roboz had other interests and passions as well. Roboz regarded “herself as a painter who sometimes painted portraits, rather than a specialist in the genre.”&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt; These other interests included series on music and the ballet.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt; Yet it was for her talent as a portrait painter that she commissioned to do a series of portraits for the 10th anniversary [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] where her second husband, Alfred T. (Teddy) Smith was employed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;  

After her second independent show, she caught the attention of Jacques O’Hana, an art dealer from Mayfair who took her on as a recurring artist.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt; 

Although she had become relatively well known in the art world, she still wanted to further her artistic skills and travelled thoroughly, from places like the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian Coast]] to [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;
By the mid-nineties, she developed a symbolist style which can be seen her in series ''Spirit of Nature''.&lt;ref name="timesZsuzsi" /&gt;

Her symbolist style can also be seen in her final series, ''Face to Face'' (2011), a portraiture series of British and Irish writers that went beyond realism. The series was dedicated to not only show casing these writers but capturing their creative aura to celebrate their works that made them who they are.&lt;ref name="guardianObit" /&gt;
Among her other stylistic choices, Messum’s describes her work as ranging from “sensual drawings to oils which hint at the surreal absurdity of life’s experiences.”&lt;ref name="messumsZsuszi" /&gt;
