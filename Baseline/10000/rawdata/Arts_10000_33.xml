'''''!Women Art Revolution''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]] and distributed by [[Zeitgeist Films]]. It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists, curators, critics, and historians.

==Synopsis==
''!Women Art Revolution'' is a documentary film, created by [[Lynn Hershman Leeson]], to examine the under-recognized world of [[feminist art]]. Through interviews, documentary footage, and artworks, the film tracks the trajectory of feminist art. It begins at the start of the 1960s with antiwar and civil rights protests, it follows developments in feminist art through the 1970s.

Lynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists, curators, critics, and historians for over 4 decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in a variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as a result.The movie begins with a scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Hershman asks people to name 3 women artists, very few can name more than [[Frida Kahlo|Frida Khalo]]. Hershman calls the film the, "remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told." She says the events of the day led her to feel an, "urgency to capture that moment" and shoot whenever, wherever with a borrowed camera.

The film gets its name from the [[Women Artists in Revolution]] (WAR), which formed in the 1960's as a coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at a fundamental level, Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie, with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was, sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time.

The film overlays historical events with feminist art events, which were somewhat spurred on by these political events such as the [[Vietnam War]], [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]], [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], [[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation]], and [[Free Speech Movement]]. She labels the [[Miss America 1968|1968 Miss America Pageant]] as the moment when art and politics fused, culminating in a weeklong protest of art events.

The film mentions that [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimalism]] was the popular art style of the time. Meant to be devoid of politics, this movement didn't match up with what was happening socially and politically. The feminist art movement worked to recognize contemporary political movements and social issues, creating a platform for awareness of these events.

==Release==
The film debuted at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] (TIFF) 2010 as part of the Real to Reel category.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knegt|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''!Women Art Revolution'' played at New York's [[IFC Center]] beginning June 1, 2011, before opening around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yerman|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voynar|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Archive==
In the film, Hershman states that the filming process, "has accumulated (roughly) 12,428 minutes of footage," and ''!W.A.R.'' shows only 83 minutes, leaving 12,343 minutes of footage out.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A digital archive was created to contain the two decades of Hershmann Leeson's interviews that went into creating this film and is available through the [[Stanford University Libraries]] collection, ''!W.A.R. Voices of a Movement''.&lt;ref name =a8/&gt; According to the collection website, Hershmann Leeson desired this repository to "be shared with as wide an audience as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[Barry Keith Grant]] praises the film in his Film International piece, "Leeson's film is a like a patchwork quilt of disparate footage, but in the end it all comes together to become an important feminist work. The film could well serve as required viewing for art and film students today."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Ellen Druda says, "This powerful film will ignite even the tiniest spark of feminism in any woman's heart. Not only art lovers will come away with a deeper understanding of the movement and an appreciation for those who stood up and paved the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Druda|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Knight for the Windy City Times has a more critical view of the film, explaining, "Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown, demanding parity with their male counterparts. However, by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists didn't want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts, the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own - just like those 'womyn only' coffeehouses that existed 'back in the day.' So, while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries - and annoyingly overlooks the artists feminist forebears (like O'Keeffe, Nevelson and Kahlo, for example) - !Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elisabeth Subrin states that "Fusing history with memoir, Lynn Hershman Leeson enlists multiple visual strategies to produce an elegantly layered visual and sonic web of politics and powerful emotion. "&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Subrin|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Birds of a Feather''''' is a 1958 album by [[Carmen McRae]]. The album was arranged by [[Ralph Burns]], and features the saxophonist [[Ben Webster]]. All the songs on the album reference [[bird]]s in some way.&lt;ref name="Allmusic"&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=birds-of-a-feather-mw0000215707|label=Birds of a Feather}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{Album ratings

John Bush reviewed the album for [[Allmusic]] and wrote that "Fortunately, there are plenty of good songs on the subject, and it's not so narrow that all the focus hinges on birds themselves." Bush praised [[Ben Webster]]'s solo on "Bob White (Watcha Gonna Swing Tonight?)".&lt;ref name="Allmusic"/&gt;
Webster's biographer, Frank Buchmann-Moller, wrote that his performances on the album alternate between "routine and inspired", and likened his work on "Flamingo" to the "beating wings of a landing bird".&lt;ref name="Buchmann-Moller2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Buchmann-Moller|title=Someone to Watch Over Me: The Life and Music of Ben Webster|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JEQmZPptNy0C&amp;pg=PA174|date=5 February 2010|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-02598-8|pages=174–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Part of the collection at the Phuthadikabo Museum, Botswana.jpg|thumb|Part of the collection at the Phuthadikabo Museum, Botswana]]
The visual '''art of Botswana''' has varied among different ethnic group and throughout history. Historically it has fallen into two main categories: that of the [[!Kung]] peoples (also known as the [[San people]] or the [[Bushmen]] tribes) and that of the [[Nguni people|Nguni]]-derived peoples such as the [[Batswana]].

== !Kung Art ==
The first is of greater antiquity in origin, and includes decoration of many of the devices and equipment the [[ǃKung people|!Kung]] needed for desert existence. Items such as [[ostrich]] shells, clay water filters, animal skins, arrows, bows and pots often received added decoration by way of incised or relief decoration, imprinted pottery decoration, beading and carving. These tribes also carved art objects that had no other function, most often of animals.

A more ancient art is that of [[San rock art]], for which the !Kung are justifiably famous: right across the South-East African region their ancestors left dynamic paintings on rock faces and cave walls, executed in unknown and highly resilient pigments that have lasted millennia. Depictions of animals, hunts, ceremonies and dances are common. The [[Tsodilo]] Hills in Botswana were recognised as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2001, containing some 4,500 rock paintings in total; not all the art covered by this designation is by San people or their ancestors.  Most paintings may be from the last 1000 or 2000 years, although much older dates are sometimes claimed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanrockart.org/rock-art-gallery/botswana/ "Rock Art of Botswana"], Trust for African Rock Art&lt;/ref&gt;  It is difficult to date most paintings; often [[radiocarbon dating]] methods can be used for materials on the floor of a shelter, but these may not relate to the dates of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Willett, 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nguni Art ==
The Nguni peoples' art is more similar to Nguni-derived peoples' art in the rest of South-Eastern Africa. Sophisticated [[carvings]] of stone and wood (usually of animals or people), sculptures and pottery; 'township' art made of disca instruments, carved walking sticks, knobkerries and many other art forms. One art that is particularly developed in Botswana is the preparation and marketing of hides and furs that have been stitched together, often combined in decorative panels using the different fur types and colours from different animals. These can have a definite use as well, being derived originally from the '[[kaross]]' or desert blanket suited to the very cold conditions of the Kalahari at night and in winter. Woollen and crocheted blankets in local patterns are also popular. [[Basket weaving]] is also carried out to a high level of skill and variation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswana.co.za/Cultural_Issues-travel/botswana-country-guide-art-for-all.html Culture and Traditions of Botswana | Arts and Crafts], botswana.co.za&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a great deal of overlap between the two groups' artwork: for example the wire, ironwork and beads used in !Kung items would have been obtained by trade from Nguni peoples, who themselves would have obtained some of their raw art material such as skins and animal horns from the !Kung.

These days the art industry thrives in the production of items for tourist consumption. The Okavango swamp, some parts of the Kalahari desert tourist trail and various game reserves all support active local art industries. The major towns also have tourist galleries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botswana.co.za/Cultural_Issues-travel/botswana-country-guide-art-for-all.html Culture and Traditions of Botswana | Arts and Crafts], botswana.co.za&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists, including white Botswana residents, paint two dimensional pictures of wildlife for the same market, which also includes various items such as T-shirts, hunting knives, shoes and hats. Leather-work is also popular, as are items made from legally cullerded or utilitarian urban objects such as bottle tops and wire; drums, beading, rattles, musical instruments such as the [[mbira]] and stringed animals such as elephant hair bracelets.

During [[Apartheid]], South African artists in exile gathered in Botswana under the name Medu Art Ensemble to produce political artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Medu Art Ensemble, Gaborone, Botswana.

==Critical response==
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
The work addresses Lichtenstein's motif of monocularity by pitting the pilot's binocular vision against the technologically advanced monocular computing reflector [[gun sight]].&lt;ref name=ID&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yHv5QTPxOccC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22Okay+Hot-Shot%22+Lichtenstein&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g3vGUZeMGJCe9QSywYE4&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Okay%20Hot-Shot%22%20Lichtenstein&amp;f=false|title=Image Duplicator: Roy Lichtenstein and the Emergence of Pop Art|accessdate=June 23, 2013|isbn=0300087624|page=99|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|author=Lobel, Michael|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'''s critic Sophie Gilbert regards ''Bratatat!''

'''''Burebista''''' (1980) is a Romanian historical epic film about the life of the ancient [[Dacia]]n king [[Burebista]], depicting his battle to unify his nation and to resist Roman incursions. 

The film was made to commemorate the supposed 2,050th anniversary of the founding of the "unified and centralized" country that was to become Romania. The government of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] claimed an uninterrupted existence of the state from Burebista to Ceaușescu himself.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, L., ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p. 78; 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:TheSphinx.jpg|thumb|left|The head-shaped rock (known as the [[Sphinx (Romania)|Bucegi Sphinx]]) with which the film begins and ends]]
The film begins with a shot of [[Sphinx (Romania)|a rocky outcrop]], shaped like a human head, apparently gazing out over the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. A voice-over explains that the expansion of Roman power is beginning to threaten the borders of the kingdom of Dacia under its "enigmatic" ruler Burebista.

The high priest [[Deceneus]] convinces the Dacian lords to swear allegiance to Burebista as king of a unified Dacia. He promises to keep Dacia free from the increasing power of Rome. A rigorous regime of military training is introduced by the king. Some refugees from Rome arrive, including Calopor, a former gladiator who had served with Spartacus. Burebista welcomes them, asking Calopor to tell him about Spartacus' exploits.  Burebista also learns about the ambition of the young Julius Caesar, and his rivalry with Pompey. 

Messengers from [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] and from Greece arrive to ask Burebista's help in resisting the advance of Roman forces.  Burebista agrees to help. Calopor is sent to assess the situation in Greece. While there he meets his former girlfriend Lydia, who has been forced to marry the arrogant Roman aristocrat [[Gaius Antonius Hybrida]]. Hybrida demands games in his honour. Calopor takes part as a gladiator, planning to kill Hybrida. When Calopor throws a trident at him, Hybrida pulls Lydia in front of his body, and the trident kills her. Horrified, Calopor leaps up and stabs Hybrida to death, giving the signal for a general uprising. With the Romans in confusion, Burebista launches his cavalry against their retreating forces, defeating them.

Burebista celebrates his victory with a festival in Dacia. He learns from a messenger that Mithridates has killed himself to avoid being captured by Pompey, but is given a letter in which the dead king encourages him to continue to resist Rome. Another letter also arrives, from Pompey. Pompey is now asking Burebista's help to curb Caesar. He ponders trouble to come.

The [[Boii]], a Celtic tribe, raids Dacia, capturing and enslaving villagers with the help of a Dacian traitor. Burebista discovers that the raid succeeded because guards were drunk. He orders the destruction of grapevines. He attempts to negotiate with the Celts, telling them that Dacians and Celts need to cooperate to preserve independence from Rome. The Celts, influenced by their fanatical Druid Breza, refuse to negotiate. Forced to fight, Burebista is worried that the war will weaken both sides, giving Caesar an opportunity to invade. The Celts, meanwhile, threaten to kill all their Dacian captives. Deceneus tells Burebista that there will soon be a solar eclipse. Burebista decides to use this to frighten the Celts with the power of the Dacian gods. He tells them that the gods will darken the sun. The eclipse terrifies the Celts, who agree to surrender the captives. Breza flees, pursued by Calopor. When Calopor follows him into a building, Breza stabs him in the back. As he dies, Calopor reveals that he is Burebista's illegitimate son. Breza is captured and executed by being thrown into an altar pyre of the goddess [[Epona]]. 

With Celtic tribes now acknowledging his rule, Burebista has created a strong kingdom. In Gaul, Caesar announces that he has conquered the country and absorbed it into the Roman empire. After he has defeated Pompey, he will proceed to absorb Dacia too. As, some time later,  Burebista ponders Caesar's vow, he is told that the threat is over — Caesar has been assassinated. Deceneus speaks of the transience of life. Burebista says that all kings must die, but the unity of the nation he has created should be immortal. He gazes over the mountains, and his head fades into a merge with the rock with which the film began.

==Significance==
[[File:Stamp burebista.jpg|thumb|1980 Stamp, labeled "2050 years from the creation of the first Dacian state, centralized and independent under the rule of Burebista"]]
The film was made to coincide with celebrations of the founding of a unified state, presented as the model for modern Romania. According to [[Lucian Boia]], Burebista was constantly compared to Ceaușescu, {{quote|even a professional historian like Ion Horaţiu Crişan did not hesitate to write words of homage addressed to the Dacian king in the manner of those addressed to the communist dictator. Thus Burebista was “animated by the burning desire to raise up his folk. To them he dedicated his entire activity, in internal and external affairs, his entire life."&lt;ref&gt;Lucian Boia, ''History and Myth in Romanian Consciousness'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2001, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Doru Pop argues that Ceaușescu's "national-communist ideology" needed the support of claims that he "descended from a long line of Romanian (!) historical figures, beginning with Burebista, the illusory ruler of the Dacian empire."&lt;ref&gt;Pop, Doru, ''Romanian New Wave Cinema: An Introduction'', McFarland, 3 Mar 2014, p.118.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|Burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', c. 1900]]
A '''burlesque''' is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/24999 "Burlesque",] ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word derives from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burlesco}}'', which, in turn, is derived from the Italian ''{{wiktita|burla}}'' – a joke, ridicule or mockery.&lt;ref&gt;In theatrical use, a burla was "a comic interlude or practical joke introduced, usually extempore, into a performance by the servant masks of the [[commedia dell'arte]] … developed at will into a small independent 'turn', the characters returning at its conclusion to the main theme of the plot". See Hartnoll, Phyllis and Peter Found. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t79.e492 "Burla",] ''The Concise Oxford Companion to the Theatre'',  Oxford University Press, 1996. Oxford Reference Online, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myheritage.com/research/record-90100-43624043/the-new-york-clipper-vol-62-september#fullscreen "Burlesque News – The Growth of Burlesque"], ''[[New York Clipper]]'', Vol. 62, No. 31, September 12, 1914, p. 18 (accessed February 28, 2017, ''via'' [[MyHeritage]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Burlesque overlaps in meaning with [[caricature]], [[parody]] and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with [[extravaganza]], as presented during the [[Victorian burlesque|Victorian era]].&lt;ref&gt;[[H. W. Fowler|Fowler, H. W.]], rev. [[Ernest Gowers|Sir Ernest Gowers]] (1965). ''Modern English Usage''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 68 and 96&lt;/ref&gt;  "Burlesque" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. It has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrasting examples of literary burlesque are [[Alexander Pope]]'s  ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' and [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''.  An example of musical burlesque is  [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].  Examples of [[Victorian burlesque|theatrical burlesques]] include [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' and the [[A. C. Torr]] – [[Meyer Lutz]] shows, including ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]''.

A later use of the term, [[American burlesque|particularly in the United States]], refers to performances in a [[variety show]] format.  These were popular from the 1860s to the 1940s, often in [[cabaret]]s and clubs, as well as theatres, and featured bawdy comedy and female [[striptease]].  Some Hollywood films attempted to recreate the spirit of these performances from the 1930s to the 1960s, or included burlesque-style scenes within dramatic films, such as 1972's ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and 1979's ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]'', among others.

==Literary origins and development==
[[File:Arabella-Fermor-crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arabella Fermor, target of ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'']]
The word first appears in a title in [[Francesco Berni]]'s ''Opere burlesche'' of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as ''poesie bernesca'' in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic.&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;Fredric Woodbridge Wilson: "Burlesque", ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy (Accessed December 04, 2008), [http://www.grovemusic.com (subscription access)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Pyramus and Thisbe scene in ''[[Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's ''[[The Knight of the Burning Pestle]]'' were early examples of such imitation.&lt;ref name=stanton&gt;Stanton, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet [[Miguel de Cervantes]] ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are ''[[Exemplary Novels]]'' and the ''Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes'' published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQTtSRP?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570534/burlesque.html Burlesque], ''MSN Encarta'', accessed 18 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics.&lt;ref name=Baldick/&gt;

Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with "[[pastiche]]", "[[parody]]", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the "[[mock-heroic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt;

17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: '''High burlesque''' refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary [[Parody#English term|parody]] and the [[mock-heroic]]. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is [[Alexander Pope]]'s "sly, knowing and courtly" ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, pp. 290–91&lt;/ref&gt; '''Low burlesque''' applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is [[Samuel Butler (1612-1680)|Samuel Butler]]'s poem ''[[Hudibras]]'', which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric [[doggerel]] verse, using a colloquial idiom.  Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hudibras'' was so popular that it became the subject of parody itself.  See Sanders, p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in [[revue]]s and [[Sketch comedy|sketches]].&lt;ref name=stanton/&gt;  [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1974 play ''[[Travesties]]'' is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, p. 50; and Hunter, Jim (1982) ''Tom Stoppard's Plays''. London: Faber and Faber, {{ISBN|0-571-11903-4}}, pp. 23–33, 141–146 and 237–242&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
{{see also|Parody music}}

===Classical music===
Beginning in the early 18th century, the term burlesque was used throughout Europe to describe musical works in which serious and comic elements were juxtaposed or combined to achieve a grotesque effect.&lt;ref name=kennedy&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; As derived from literature and theatre, "burlesque" was used, and is still used, in music to indicate a bright or high-spirited mood, sometimes in contrast to seriousness.&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;

In this sense of farce and exaggeration rather than parody, it appears frequently on the German-language stage between the middle of the 19th century and the 1920s. Burlesque operettas were written by [[Johann Strauss II]] (''Die lustigen Weiber von Wien'', 1868),&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Strauss, Johann" in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Michael Ziehrer|Ziehrer]] (''Mahomed's Paradies'',1866; ''Das Orakel zu Delfi'', 1872; ''Cleopatra, oder Durch drei Jahrtausende'', 1875; ''In fünfzig Jahren'', 1911)&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Andrew (1992), "Ziehrer, C. M." in ''The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', ed. Stanley Sadie (London) {{ISBN|0-333-73432-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bruno Granichstaedten]] (''Casimirs Himmelfahrt'', 1911). French references to burlesque are less common than German, though [[André Grétry|Grétry]] composed for a "drame burlesque" (''Matroco'', 1777).&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, David and M. Elizabeth C. Bartlet, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43361 "Grétry, André-Ernest-Modeste: Works,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 24 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] called his 1916 one-act chamber opera-ballet ''[[Renard (Stravinsky)|Renard]]'' (''The Fox'') a ''"Histoire burlesque chantée et jouée"'' (''burlesque tale sung and played'') and his 1911 ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'' a "burlesque in four scenes". A later example is the 1927 burlesque operetta by [[Ernst Krenek]] entitled ''[[Schwergewicht]]'' (''Heavyweight'') (1927).

Some orchestral and chamber works have also been designated as burlesques, of which two early examples are the Ouverture-Suite ''Burlesque de Quixotte'', TWV 55, by [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] and the Sinfonia Burlesca by [[Leopold Mozart]] (1760). Another often-performed piece is [[Richard Strauss]]'s 1890 [[Burleske|Burleske for piano and orchestra]].&lt;ref name=kennedy/&gt;  Other examples include the following:
*1901: Six Burlesques, Op. 58 for piano four hands by [[Max Reger]]
*1904: Scherzo Burlesque, Op. 2 for piano and orchestra by [[Béla Bartók]]
*1911: Three Burlesques, Op. 8c for piano by Bartók
*1920: Burlesque for Piano, by [[Arnold Bax]]
*1931: Ronde burlesque, Op. 78 for orchestra by [[Florent Schmitt]]

*1956: Burlesque for Piano and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 13g by [[Bertold Hummel]]
*1982: Burlesque for Wind Quintet, Op. 76b by Hummel

Burlesque can be used to describe particular movements of instrumental musical compositions, often involving dance rhythms. Examples are the Burlesca, in [[Partitas, BWV 825-830|Partita No. 3 for keyboard (BWV 827)]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]], the "Rondo-Burleske" third movement of [[Symphony No. 9 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 9]] by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], and the "Burlesque" fourth movement of [[Violin Concerto No. 1 (Shostakovich)|Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 1]].&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, Andrew, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/mmzf "Dmitri Shostakovich Violin Concertos 1 &amp; 2 Review"], BBC Music, accessed 24 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jazz===
The use of burlesque has not been confined to classical music. Well known [[ragtime]] travesties include ''The Russian Rag'', by [[George L. Cobb]], which is based on [[Rachmaninoff]]'s [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]], and [[Harry L. Alford|Harry Alford]]'s  ''Lucy's Sextette'' based on the [[sextet]], 'Chi mi frena in tal momento?', from ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' by [[Donizetti]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Max (2006): ''Rachmaninoff: Life, Works, Recordings'' p 229&lt;/ref&gt;

==Victorian theatrical burlesque==
[[File:Florence St. John.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
{{main|Victorian burlesque}}
Victorian burlesque, sometimes known as "travesty" or "[[extravaganza]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; was popular in London theatres between the 1830s and the 1890s.  It took the form of [[parody music|musical theatre parody]] in which a well-known opera, play or ballet was adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, often risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work.  The comedy often stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the modern activities portrayed by the actors.  [[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Other authors of burlesques included [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;

Victorian burlesque related to and in part derived from traditional English [[pantomime]] "with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al.

This English style of burlesque was successfully introduced to New York in the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D.

[[File:Faustupto.jpg|thumb|150px|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]''|left]]
Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera.&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wells&gt;Wells, Stanley.

Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told, "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=wells/&gt; A staple of burlesque was the display of attractive women in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]], dressed in tights to show off their legs, but the plays themselves were seldom more than modestly risqué.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

[[File:Ruy-blas-programme-crop.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Souvenir programme|Programme]]: ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'']]
Burlesque became the speciality of certain London theatres, including the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and [[Royal Strand Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.  Until the 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize.  The house stars included [[Nellie Farren]], [[John D'Auban]], [[Edward O'Connor Terry|Edward Terry]] and [[Fred Leslie]].&lt;ref name=times70&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  From about 1880, Victorian burlesques grew longer, until they were a whole evening's entertainment rather than part of a double- or triple-bill.&lt;ref name=times70/&gt;  In the early 1890s, these burlesques went out of fashion in London, and the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new more wholesome but less literary genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt.

==American burlesque==
[[File:Bon-Ton Burlesquers2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Advertisement for a burlesque troupe, 1898]]
{{main|American burlesque}}
American burlesque shows were originally an offshoot of Victorian burlesque. The English genre had been successfully staged in New York from the 1840s, and it was popularised by a visiting British burlesque troupe, [[Lydia Thompson]] and the "British Blondes", beginning in 1868.&lt;ref name=Friends&gt;Hoffos, Signe and Moulder, Bob.

They consisted of three parts: first, songs and ribald comic sketches by low comedians; second, assorted [[Olio (musical number)|olios]] and male acts, such as acrobats, magicians and solo singers; and third, chorus numbers and sometimes a burlesque in the English style on politics or a current play. The entertainment was usually concluded by an exotic dancer or a wrestling or boxing match.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-9018177 "Burlesque show",] ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Online Library Edition, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While burlesque went out of fashion in England towards the end of the 19th century, to be replaced by [[Edwardian musical comedy]], the American style of burlesque flourished, but with increasing focus on female nudity. Exotic "cooch" dances were brought in, ostensibly Syrian in origin.  The entertainments were given in clubs and cabarets, as well as music halls and theatres. By the early 20th century, there were two national circuits of burlesque shows competing with the [[vaudeville]] circuit, as well as resident companies in New York, such as [[Minsky's Burlesque|Minsky's]] at the Winter Garden.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

The transition from burlesque on the old lines to striptease was gradual. At first, [[soubrette]]s showed off their figures while singing and dancing; some were less active but compensated by appearing in elaborate stage costumes.&lt;ref name=humez&gt;Humez, Nick.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5460">The '''Center for Hmong Arts and Talent''' ('''CHAT''') is an arts advocacy group based in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]'s [[Frogtown, Saint Paul|Frogtown neighborhood]]. Since its inception in 1998, CHAT has transformed into a social justice arts organization that engages with local and national [[Hmong people|Hmong]] communities. In addition to providing diverse arts-based programs, CHAT uses innovative strategies to address social issues affecting [[Hmong American]]s.

==History==
In the late 1980s, playwright Jaime Meyer worked with Hmong youth to produce ''Hmong Tapestry: Voices from the Cloth''. In 1990, Meyer and director Nkauj'lis Lyfoung formed '''Pom Siab Hmoob Theatre''' (PSHT). It was the first Hmong theater company in the world.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Fres Thao|title=Center for Hmong Arts &amp; Talent (CHAT)|url=http://www.mnopedia.org/place/center-hmong-arts-talent-chat|publisher=[[MNopedia]]|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 1997, PSHT wrote and produced eight successful plays in St. Paul. Of these, five were community-based and three were professionally staged.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 1998, PSHT members decided to expand the group's focus beyond theater arts in order to serve more Hmong artists. They changed its name to the Center for Hmong Arts &amp; Talent (CHAT). Their new work crossed multiple art genres, making CHAT the first and only multidisciplinary Hmong arts organization in the U.S. The CHAT acronym was inspired by the popularity of the internet [[chat room]]s of the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In the early 2000s, CHAT debuted and refined several of its central initiatives. In the summer of 2001, it organized the first-ever Hmong Arts &amp; Music Festival at St. Paul's Western Sculpture Park. In the fall, CHAT's youth program extended its reach by taking arts instruction into St. Paul's federal housing projects. The program was called Art Saves Us—in part because several core CHAT artists were raised in the projects, and art literally saved their lives.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2002, CHAT's Voice Your Mind [[open mic]] event, eventually rebranded Innovative Community Elevation (ICE) Open Mic, was created. The program took place at venues such as Hmong ABC, Jasmine Teashop, and [[Metro State University]]. It aimed to provide a supportive environment for artistic development and live performance.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

CHAT's involvement in technology and multimedia led to production efforts in music and film. It produced multiple videos and music compilations in the mid-2000s, including ''Hmongtopia: All About ABC's'' (2006) and ''The H Project'' (2005), a recording that raised awareness of the Hmong genocide in Laos.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2006, as a result of Hmong artists' increasing interest in the fashion industry, CHAT created the Fresh Traditions Fashion Show and program. This one-of-a-kind fashion event offered its all-Hmong roster of designers complete creative control. It also, however, presented them with a challenge: creating an outfit that incorporated fabrics and colors used in traditional Hmong clothing.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

Other CHAT programs and events launched during this period included CHAT Radio, which aired on [[KFAI]] between 2006 and 2010. The show provided information on the latest community arts news and showcased Hmong artists. Dawning&lt;&gt;''Dab Neeg'' Theatre (DDNT) was a theatre program that ran from 2007 until 2009. In 2007 alone, DDNT produced the collectively created ''Hmong-land''; staged [[May Lee Yang]]'s ''Sia(b)''; and toured ''Stir-Fried Pop Culture'' to schools and colleges.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In the fall of 2008 an influx of youth using the CHAT space as a creative hub prompted the creation of a new youth initiative. The Youth Leadership Group (YLG) targeted ages 15–19. The intense, year-long program used art as a vehicle to foster leadership skills and heighten students' expectations for success after high school. Youth met weekly to discuss critical issues affecting the Hmong community, plan arts campaigns, and present them to the public.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2014, the Hmong Arts &amp; Music Festival began taking place during the July 4 weekend within Lao Family Community of Minnesota's Hmong Freedom Celebration and Sports Festival. In that year, the event drew over fifteen thousand attendees.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

In 2015, many of CHAT's programs continue to enrich the St. Paul arts scene, as well as the Hmong and immigrant/refugee communities. The Youth Leadership Group has produced five original theater pieces since its creation. As of 2015, it organizes CHAT's quarterly Friday Night Lights open mic. Art Saves Us continues to provide free transportation and arts instruction to nearly two hundred youth annually. And Fresh Traditions is still the only U.S. fashion show to feature Hmong designers exclusively.&lt;ref name="MNopedia"/&gt;

One of the four [[Panhellenic Games]] were the [[Pythian Games]] in [[Delphi]]. Held every four years, they included competitions in athletics, theatre, music, poetry, and painting to praise the god [[Apollo]], the symbol of the [[Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485272/Pythian-Games Pythian Games], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 394 A.D., [[Theodosius I]], the emperor of the [[Byzantine Empire]] banned all Panhellenic Games as being pagan events.

Since 1912 till 1948, on the initiative of [[Pierre de Coubertin]], [[art competitions at the Summer Olympics]] were held in various countries. Medals were awarded for works related solely to [[sport]].&lt;ref&gt;''Richard Stanton.'' The forgotten Olympic art competitions — The story of the Olympic art competitions of the 20th century. Trafford Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|1-55212-606-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also an attempt to revive Pythian Games at the archeological site of Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet [[Angelos Sikelianos]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salamina-online.com/aggelos_sikelianos.htm Aggelos Sikelianos]&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Eva Palmer. In 1927, the first Delphic Festival was held in Greece, but the revival was then abandoned.

Nowadays there are so-called Delphi Festivals, which are the closest to their Panhellenic counterparts. They include religious rituals and activities like poetry competition, religious offerings, sports and of course feasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greeka.com/sterea/delphi/delphi-festivals.htm Information about the Festivals of Delphi Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:DF-1927 copy.jpg|150px|thumb|Poster of the Delphic Festival, 1927]]

In the second half of the 20th century, there was another attempt to restore Delphic Games. Since the 1990s, representatives from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, [[Germany]], Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States came together and organized First International Delphic Games, which took place in 2000 in Moscow, Russia (before that the concept was tested out in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], where First Junior Delphic Games took place.)

==Current revivials==
Currently, there are two organizations conducting Delphic Games.

The '''[[International Delphic Council]]''' (IDC) with headquarters in Berlin was founded in 1994 at the [[Schönhausen Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.392280880813927.79902.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the IDC| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995 the IDC actively supports the creation of the National Delphic organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.386038754771473.78926.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the NDC Nigeria| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.384951174880231.78728.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=Foundation of the "Delphic Movement in Russia"| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997 the IDC has organized the International Youth Delphic Games in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], Germany, Philippines, South Africa, as well as, since 2000, the International Delphic Games for adult participants in Russia, Malaysia, South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;''Lee Kyung-min''.[http://www.koreaittimes.com/story/4908/top-artists-gather-3rd-jeju-delphic-games  Top Artists to Gather at 3rd Jeju Delphic Games] September 7th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |date= |url=http://delphic.org/english/03games/chronology.htm |title=Delphic Games |publisher=// delphic.org |accessdate=2014-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102191231/http://delphic.org/english/03games/chronology.htm |archivedate=2014-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IDC held Delphic Games and Junior Delphic Games in the four-year cycle, two years offset from one another, such as the Olympic Games, held at different locations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=http://www.kulturserver.de/-/organisationen/detail/52021| title=International Delphic Council| publisher=// kulturserver.de| accessdate=2014-07-03|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=http://www.virtualmarket.itb-berlin.de/?Action=showCompany&amp;id=57634| title=International Delphic Council: ITB Berlin Virtual Market Place| publisher=// virtualmarket.itb-berlin.de| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Delphic  Games and Congresses receive greetings, patronage and support from various international organizations and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=392267214148627&amp;set=a.392265017482180.79897.369642239744458&amp;type=1&amp;theater| title=The letter with the greeting message from the Council of Europe| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| date=| url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.387774587931223.79201.369642239744458&amp;type=1| title=2nd Delphic World Congress| publisher=// facebook.com| accessdate=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer organization, '''[[International Delphic Committee]]''' (IDC) with headquarters in Moscow, was registered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idcworld.ru/news.list?year=2006&amp;lang=en Opening of the website of the International Delphic Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes International Delphic Games, Youth Delphic Games of Russia and Youth Delphic Games of [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]].

These Junior Delphic Games are dedicated to significant domestic events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=355094 The Ninth Junior Delphic Games Russia dedicated to the anniversary of the victory] // Вести.ру - 23 апреля 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youth.minstm.gov.ru/102/104.shtml/xPages/entry.2963.html Welcoming words of the Minister V.L.

[[Image:Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes 003.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pierre-Cécile Puvis de Chavannes: ''The Dream'', 1883]]
'''Dream art''' is any form of [[art]] directly based on material from [[dream]]s, or which employs dream-like imagery.

==History==
References to dreams ''in'' art are as old as literature itself: the story of [[Gilgamesh]], the [[Bible]], and the [[Iliad]] all describe dreams of major characters and the meanings thereof. However, dreams ''as'' art, without a "real" frame story, appear to be a later development—though there is no way to know whether many premodern works were dream-based.

In European literature, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement emphasized the value of emotion and irrational inspiration. "Visions", whether from dreams or intoxication, served as raw material and were taken to represent the artist's highest creative potential.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Expressionism]] introduced dream imagery into visual art. Expressionism was also a literary movement, and included the later work of the playwright [[August Strindberg]], who coined the term "dream play" for a style of narrative that did not distinguish between fantasy and reality.

At the same time, discussion of dreams reached a new level of public awareness in the Western world due to the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], who introduced the notion of the [[subconscious]] mind as a field of scientific inquiry. Freud greatly influenced the 20th-century [[Surrealist]]s, who combined the visionary impulses of Romantics and Expressionists with a focus on the unconscious as a creative tool, and an assumption that apparently irrational content could contain significant meaning, perhaps more so than rational content.

The invention of film and [[animation]] brought new possibilities for vivid depiction of nonrealistic events, but films consisting ''entirely'' of dream imagery have remained an avant-garde rarity. [[Comic book]]s and [[comic strip]]s have explored dreams somewhat more often, starting with [[Winsor McCay]]'s popular newspaper strips; the trend toward confessional works in [[alternative comics]] of the 1980s saw a proliferation of artists drawing their own dreams.

In the collection, [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0982869509 The Committee of Sleep], Harvard psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] identifies modern dream-inspired art such as paintings including Jasper Johns's ''Flag'', much of the work of Jim Dine and Salvador Dalí, novels ranging from "Sophie's Choice" to works by Anne Rice and Stephen King and films including Robert Altman's ''Three Women'', John Sayles ''Brother from Another Planet'' and Ingmar Bergman's ''Wild Strawberries''. That book also describes how Paul McCartney's ''Yesterday'' was heard by him in a dream and Most of Billy Joel's and Ladysmith Black Mambazo's music has originated in dreams.

Dream material continues to be used by a wide range of contemporary artists for various purposes. This practice is considered by some to be of psychological value for the artist—independent of the artistic value of the results—as part of the discipline of "dream work".

The international [[Association for the Study of Dreams]][http://www.asdreams.org] holds an annual juried show of visual dream art.

The '''Entertainment Merchants Association''' ('''EMA''') is the [[not-for-profit]] international trade association dedicated to advancing the interests of the $32 billion [[home video|home entertainment]] [[entertainment industry|industry]].

The Mission of EMA is to promote, to protect, and to provide a forum for, the common business interests of those engaged in the sale, rental, and licensed reproduction of entertainment software, such as motion pictures, video games, and sound recordings.

==History==
The Entertainment Merchants Association was established in 2006 through the merger of the [[Interactive Entertainment Merchants Association]] (IEMA) and the Video Software Dealers Association (VSDA). VSDA was organized in 1981 to help video retail stores fight against federal legislation that would have changed the [[first-sale doctrine]]. VSDA was initiated under the auspices of NARM (National Association of Recording Merchandisers), and was headed by Association staff President Risa Solomon.

==Composition==
EMA represents more than 1,000 companies throughout the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and other nations. Its members operate more than 20,000 [[retail outlets]] in the U.S. that sell and/or rent [[DVDs]] and computer and console [[video games]]. Membership comprises the full spectrum of retailers (from single-store specialists to multi-line mass merchants), distributors, the home video divisions of major and independent [[motion picture studio]]s, video game publishers, and other related businesses that constitute and support the home entertainment industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6104">During the beginning of the German invasions during [[World War II]], [[Jacques Jaujard]], the  director of the French [[Réunion des Musées Nationaux|Musées Nationaux]], foreshadowed the fall of France and decided to organize the evacuation of the [[Louvre]] art collection in province.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web

== Evacuation of the art collection ==
[[File:Nike descending staircase 3sept1939.jpg|thumb|right|The Winged Victory of Samothrace was carefully lowered down a ramp]]
[[File:La Grande Gallerie désertée.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Grande Gallerie in September 1939]]
On 25 August 1939, the Louvre was closed for 3 days, officially for repairs. However, many of the Louvre art collection was hauled on trucks (203 vehicles transporting 1862 wooden cases) and sent to [[Château de Chambord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some of the art pieces were too big to be fit in a truck. For example [[The Raft of the Medusa]] had to be covered with a blanket. When the truck initially arrived at Versailles on his route to Chambord, the canvas touched an electric cable and created a short-circuit which switched off the electricity in the whole town. After that, the routes were carefully planned to avoid this type of problems, and attendants which poles were responsible to deal with electric or phone cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Knopf]], pp. 54–55. {{ISBN|978-0-679-40069-1}}; OCLC 246524635&lt;/ref&gt;

The last art piece to leave the museum was the [[Winged Victory of Samothrace]], which was moved on September 3, 1939, the day the French ultimatum to Germany expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Throughout the war, the arts pieces were clandestinely moved from chateau to chateau to avoid being taken back by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; For example, the ''Mona Lisa'' was moved from Chambord to several castles and abbeys, to finish at the end of the war at the [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Along with other artworks from French national museums, it was sent for storage, first to Chambord Castle in the Loire Valley. On 5 June 1940, it was transferred to Chauvigny on a cushioned stretcher in the back of an ambulance, which had been sealed to keep the humidity constant (the official who accompanied the painting arrived nearly asphyxiated from the lack of circulation in the sealed vehicle). In September, it moved again, to the Ingres Museum in Montauban, before a final move to Montal in 1942''

[[File:Yongamsa Gwaebul.jpg|thumb|Seoul Tangible Cultural Heritage #363, the Bongwonsa Amita Gwaebul, on display during a festival at Yongamsa Temple in Seoul.]]
'''Gwaebul''' (괘불), meaning "Large Buddhist Banner Painting," are extremely large-scale Buddhist scroll paintings found throughout Korea. They are fairly rare, and only 53 were studied between 1986 and 2001. The paintings are typically brought out only rarely for special festivals or holidays such as [[Buddha's Birthday]] or [[Gwaebul Festival]]s when they are unrolled and hung from tall poles in the temple courtyard. When not in use, ''gwaebul'' are stored un a box behind the altar in a temple hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrich.go.kr/english/page.do?menuIdx=1038|title=RESEARCH ON TRADITIONAL PAINTINGS|last=|first=|date=|website=National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Status as Cultural Assets ==
Of the known ''gwaebul,'' seven have been designated as [[National Treasure (South Korea)|National Treasures]], 47 as [[Treasures of South Korea|Treasures]], and eight as Registered Cultural Heritage objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cha.go.kr/cha/idx/SubIndex.do?mn=EN|title=Cultural Heritage Administration|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aesthetics]], the '''human figure''' or '''human form''' in art, sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the [[beauty]] of the [[human]] body in its depiction or presentation. The study involves an appreciation of the [[Human body shape|body shape]], including [[Human positions|body postures]] - sitting, standing or even sleeping, and movements - [[Human gait|walking]], running, [[dancing]] etc. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]  refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aesthetics-online.org/ideas/leddy.html Section 17, Immanuel Kant]&lt;/ref&gt; The human figure conforms very well to the law that states that [[form follows function]], which is believed to be a result of [[evolution]] over thousands of generations.

== Study ==
The human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts. Very few art forms are not related to human figure such as [[music]], though it figures in [[lyrics]]. A study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects:
* [[Sculpture]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/HumanForm.html Human figure in various art forms]&lt;/ref&gt; is similar to figure drawing.
* [[Figure drawing]] involves the depiction of the body in different postures or in motion or at work.
* [[Literature]] involves the description of the human figure to imply its [[sexual attraction]], physical ability and mentality.
* [[Dance]] is an [[art form]] that involves [[Motion (physics)|movement]] of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of [[Emotional expression|expression]], [[social]] [[Interpersonal relationship|interaction]] or presented in a [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[performance]] setting.
* [[Body language]] involves [[human position|body posture]], [[gesture]]s, [[facial expression]]s, and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]].
* [[Fashion]] and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]].
* [[Ergonomics]] in passenger vehicles and seatings, this deals with [[unisex]] approach to human figure.
* [[Gait analysis]]
* [[3D animation]]

== Body proportions ==
{{Main|Body proportions}}
''Body proportions'' are the study of relation of [[human anatomy|human body]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://realcolorwheel.com/human.htm Human Proportions]&lt;/ref&gt; or in general, animal body, parts to each other and the whole, essential for depiction of the overall figure.

== Sculpture and figure drawing ==
[[File:Carracci, Annibale - Studio di nudo.jpg|thumb|Nude study, by [[Annibale Carracci]]]]
{{See also|Sculpture|figure drawing}}
A [[figure drawing]] is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures. It is a study or stylized depiction of the human form, with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. It is a composed image of the subject in a still position. A life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]].

'''''Jungle Drums''''' (1943) is the fifteenth of seventeen [[animation|animated]] [[Technicolor]] [[short film]]s based upon the [[DC Comics]] character of [[Superman]]. Produced by [[Famous Studios]], the cartoon was originally released to theaters by [[Paramount Pictures]] on March 26, 1943.

== Plot ==
Deep in the African jungle, a tribe of [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] warriors are having a celebration. Their leader is a tall man in a white cloak. Secretly, he's a [[Nazi]] commander, and the tribe's sacred temple is actually an underground Nazi outpost. The Nazis eagerly await the arrival of an American convoy with information about an Allied attack. When a military plane flies overhead, the Nazis shoot it down. The commander sends the warriors to search for survivors.

At the wreck site, the mortally wounded Lieutenant hands his secret documents to the crew's only survivor, Lois Lane. He tells her to destroy the documents. Then he dies. Lois is caught by the natives and tied up, but frees herself, runs into the jungle and avoids capture long enough to hide the documents under a rock. She is then captured and brought back to the temple for interrogation where she is tied to a chair. When she refuses to talk, the commander orders the warriors to burn her at the stake.

Meanwhile, Clark Kent and another pilot are flying out to meet with Lois' convoy. They spot the wrecked plane not far from the aboriginal village. Clark parachutes down to investigate. Once on the ground, he changes into Superman. He flies to the village. Lois is already being burned at the stake with the commander watching her. Just then, one of the warriors approaches the commander and gives him a set of papers. It's the documents Lois hid in the woods. Overjoyed with success, the commander has his men radio headquarters and send the Nazi [[U-boats]] to attack the Allied fleet.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jungledrums2.png|thumb|left|Adolf Hitler hangs his head in frustration.]] --&gt;
Superman arrives and saves Lois from burning to death. When the warriors see a man who can walk through fire, they run in terror. The Nazi soldiers futilely fight back against Superman. Meanwhile, Lois takes a spare white cloak and sneaks in to use the radio. The commander catches her but before he can do anything to stop her, Superman comes to her rescue. She sends a message to the American headquarters, warning them about the Nazi subs.

Out at sea, the Nazi subs prepare to decimate the Allied fleet. Before they can attack, they are bombed by a squadron of Allied [[Martin B-26 Marauder|B-26]] bombers sent in response to Lois' warnings. The subs are destroyed, and the Allied fleet is saved.

Meanwhile in [[Berlin]] during a [[Thunderstorm|thunderstorm]], [[Adolf Hitler]] listens to a newsflash about the defeat of his U-boat force. Angrily, he flips a switch on the radio and hangs his head in frustration as the tune ''[[Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition]]'' is heard.

[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.35|''La Calavera Catrina'']]
[[File:Calavera_garbancera.png|thumb|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] ''La Calavera Garbancera'' in 1913]]
'''''La Calavera Catrina ''''' ('Dapper Skeleton', 'Elegant Skull') or '''''Catrina''''' '''''La Calavera Garbancera''''' is a 1910&amp;ndash;1913 [[zinc]] [[etching]] by the Mexican printmaker, cartoon illustrator and [[lithographer]] [[José Guadalupe Posada]].&lt;ref name="artoftheprint"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/posada_jose_guadalupe_calaveracatrina.htm|title=Jose Guadalupe Posada, Calavera Catrina (Dapper Skeleton)|publisher=ArtofthePrint.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is offered as a satirical portrait of those Mexican natives who, Posada felt, were aspiring to adopt European aristocratic traditions in the pre-revolution era. ''La Catrina'' has become an icon of the Mexican Día de Muertos, or [[Day of the Dead]].

The zinc etching depicts a female skeleton dressed only in a hat, her ''chapeau en attende'' is related to European styles of the early 20th century. The original leaflet describes a person who was ashamed of their indigenous origins and dressed imitating the French style while wearing lots of makeup to make their skin look whiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mexican-folk-art-guide.com/catrina.html|title=La Catrina|work=Copal, Mexican Folk Art at its best Online.|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description also uses the word ''garbancera'', a nickname given to people of indigenous ancestry who imitated European style and denied their own cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="rockypoint360"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rockypoint360.com/la-catrina-the-woman-of-mexico|title=La Catrina – The woman of Mexico|date=2012-10-30|work=Rocky Point 360|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorklatinculture.com/catrina/|title=Catrina La Calavera Garbancera is the icon of Día de los Muertos|date=2018-09-25|work=New York Latin Culture Magazine|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural importance ==
"La Catrina has become the referential image of Death in Mexico, it is common to see her embodied as part of the celebrations of Day of the Dead throughout the country; she has become a motive for the creation of handcrafts made from clay or other materials, her representations may vary, as well as the hat." – J.G. Posada&lt;ref name="rockypoint360" /&gt;

While the original work by Posada introduced the character, the popularity of La Calavera as well as her name is derived from a work by artist [[Diego Rivera]] in his 1947 completed mural ''[[Sueño de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central]]'' ''(Dream of a Sunday afternoon along Central Alameda)''.

Rivera's mural was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the "Museo Mural Diego Rivera" adjacent to the Alameda in the historic center of [[Mexico City]]. It measures 15 meters long and it stood at the end of Alameda Park. The mural survived the 1985 earthquake, which destroyed the hotel, and was later moved across the street to the [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]], built after the earthquake for the purpose of housing and displaying Rivera's restored mural.&lt;ref name="sfgate" &gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/mexico/mexicomix/article/La-Catrina-Mexico-s-grande-dame-of-death-2318009.php Mexico's grande dame of death]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic subtext ==

=== Image ===
[[File:Chapala181.JPG|thumb|upright|Figures by Michoacan artisan Emilio Barocio Yacobo at the 2015 ''Feria de los Maestros del Arte'' in [[Chapala, Jalisco]]]]
Rivera's mural depicts a culmination of 400 years of Mexico's major figures, which include himself, Posada, and his wife [[Frida Kahlo]]. Rivera took inspiration from the original etching and gave Calavera a body as well as more of an identity in her elegant outfit as she is poised between himself and Posada. The intent seemed to be to show the tradition of welcoming and comfort the Mexicans have with death and especially the identity of a [[Santa Muerte|Lady of the Dead]], harking back to the heritage of the Aztec goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]].  As explained by [[curator]] David de la Torre from the [[LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes]], a [[Mexican-American]] museum and cultural center in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], US, Catrina has come to symbolize not only [[Día de Muertos]] and the Mexican willingness to laugh at death itself, but originally Catrina was an elegant or well-dressed woman, so it refers to rich people,&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt; de la Torre said. "Death brings this neutralizing force; everyone is equal in the end. Sometimes people have to be reminded of that."

=== Culture ===
The culture of La Calavera has ties to political satire and is also a well-kept tradition as the original was inspired by the polarizing reign of dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]]. Díaz is lauded for modernizing and bringing financial stability to Mexico, but he also led his government in repression, corruption, and excess, and had an apparent obsession with European materialism and culture. Christine Delsol writes: "Concentration of fantastic wealth in the hands of the privileged few brewed discontent in the hearts of the suffering many, leading to the 1910 rebellion that toppled Diaz in 1911 and became the Mexican Revolution."&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

=== Social Classes ===
She also symbolizes the contrasts between the upper and lower classes, for times were cruel. The social classes were extremely segmented and the highest class was the most fortunate, enjoying many privileges; in contrast, the lower classes were nearly invisible. To explain and rescue the folklore of honoring the memory of those who have passed away, while showing this off to high society, José Guadalupe Posada made caricatures of Death, one of these drawings being the famous Calavera with an elegant hat, though only representing the head and bust with a sophisticated and skeletal essence.&lt;ref name="rockypoint360" /&gt;

== Links to Mesoamerica ==

=== Aztecs ===
The calavera's ties to the past heritage of the Aztecs can be seen in various ways. The indigenous culture of skulls and the death-goddess [[Mictecacihuatl]] is common in [[pre-Columbian art]]. Lady of the Dead, Mictecacihuatl, was keeper of the bones in the underworld, and she presided over the ancient month-long Aztec festivals honoring the dead. Since the [[pre-Columbian era]], Mexican culture has maintained a certain reverence towards death,&lt;ref name="peña"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Araujo Peña |first=Sandra Alejandro |author2=Barbosa Ramírez Marisela |author3=Galván Falcón Susana |author4=García Ortiz Aurea |author5=Uribe Ordaz Carlos |title=El culto a la Santa Muerte: un estudio descriptivo |trans-title=The cult of Santa Muerte:A descriptive study |journal=Revista Psichologia |publisher=Universidad de Londres |location=Mexico City |url=http://www.udlondres.com/revista_psicologia/articulos/stamuerte.htm |language=Spanish |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen in the widespread commemoration of the [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref name="MRamirez"&gt;{{cite news |title='Saint Death' comes to Chicago |first=Margaret |last=Ramirez |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/death-chicago-08,0,2114588.story |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago |accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Christian beliefs superimposed on the ancient rituals, those celebrations have evolved into today's Day of the Dead.&lt;ref name="sfgate" /&gt;

=== Spain ===
As for the Spanish heritage (the death-orientation of the [[monastic orders]], [[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]], and ''[[memento mori]]'' traditions), it blended with the average Mexican's stoic, but far from humorless, view of death.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It should be noted that some find La Catrina to have closer ties to the Dance of Death than to the possible origins of the calavera in the art of ancient Mesoamerica. La Calavera differs markedly from the rigid sobriety of skulls carved by the Aztec or images of decomposing corpses depicted by the ancient Maya. In prints and various other art forms associated with the Day of the Dead—everything from papier-mâché to papel picado (perforated paper) to sugar and chocolate—images of the calavera are unmistakably humorous. The skeletons, often dressed in finery, move playfully and smile widely. In some ways, these animated figures are much closer visually to the European Dance of Death motif in which limber skeletons lead, lure, or drag unwitting mortals to their ends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/124/index.html Global art]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexico ===
Though these interpretations seem to ignore the full relationship that the Mexicans have with death, as well as the macabre humor that ties to the cycle of life, death and ceremony that the Aztecs had, it should be understood that few countries pay homage to death the way Mexico does; offerings, songs, respect and humor are all common Mexican expressions towards death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebra.aollatino.com/2010/11/01/what-does-death-mean-for-mexicans/ What does death mean for Mexicans]&lt;/ref&gt; The European ties are there both for comic effect as well as depicting the symbolic shell that Europe cloaked Mesoamerica in, but the native bones still lie within.

== Folk art ==

=== Purist ===
La Calavera Catrina today can be found in her more traditional form both in drawn works as well as sculptures made out of Oaxacan wood carvings, papier-mâché sculptures, majolica pottery, and [[Barro negro pottery|Barro negro black clay pottery]]. She is also coupled with male skeletons.

== Costume ==
Dressing as a "Catrina" is a popular costume in [[Day of the Dead]] celebrations in Mexico. Catrinas typically feature "[[Calavera#Face painting|sugar skull]]" make-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.allure.com/story/dia-de-los-muertos-makeup-tradition|title=5 Things to Know Before Doing Dia de Los Muertos Makeup|last=Devash|first=Meirav|work=Allure|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* Works such as the screen print ''Sun Maid'' (''Raisins'') by [[Ester Hernandez|Ester Hernández]] in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] show the influence of Posada's earlier vision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://americanart.si.edu/education/corazon/galeria_06.cfm Sun Mad, Ester Hernández, [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The same might be said of the cover for [[Los Lobos]]' album ''[[La pistola y el corazón]]'', which depicts a pistol toting Catrina in a couple's embrace.

* A character based on La Calavera appears as a protagonist in the 2014 computer-animated film ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Life]]'', where she is named "[[Santa Muerte|La Muerte]]" and is the queen of the deceased who are remembered by the living. She is referred to in the Latin American Spanish dub as "La Catrina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2262227/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv |title=The Book of Life (2014 film), Trivia |publisher=[[IMDb.com]] |quote=In the Spanish dubbing of the movie, La Muerte is called "La Catrina", this is obviously "Posada's Catrina" a popular iconic skeletal lady that has become associated with the festivities of the Día de Muertos.

* Two educational video series, ''La Calavera'' and ''La Calavera: El úlitmo secreto'', were filmed in Mexico by [[Pearson Education]], and include various program components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDBSOLUTIONID=6724&amp;PMDBSITEID=2781&amp;PMDBCATEGORYID=811&amp;PMDBSUBSOLUTIONID=&amp;PMDBSUBJECTAREAID=&amp;PMDBSUBCATEGORYID=23498&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142&amp;elementType=programComponents La Catrina, Program Components, Pearson Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Both videos integrate language proficiency with culture, and follow the journey of Jamie González as she searches for the secrets of her mysterious great-grandmother.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PS1lMm&amp;PMDbSiteId=2781&amp;PMDbSolutionId=6724&amp;PMDbSubSolutionId=&amp;PMDbCategoryId=811&amp;PMDbSubCategoryId=23498&amp;PMDbSubjectAreaId=&amp;PMDbProgramId=6142 La Catrina, Overview, Pearson Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', during the first and second days of November, a Day of the Dead Celebration is held among the largest Capital Cities of the game. Each city has a Calavera, represented as a dancing female undead NPC dressed in a mariachi outfit. If the player dances with her, his or her player character will also take the appearance of an undead character with a similar outfit.

* In the ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'', creatures called Calaveras painlessly welcome into the afterlife those who cannot accept death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863052391|title=Pathfinder roleplaying game : Bestiary 4|last=Stephen.|first=Radney-MacFarland,|last2=K.|first2=Reynolds, Sean|last3=Dennis.|first3=Baker,|last4=Alexandur.|first4=Alexandrov,|last5=Jason.|first5=Bulmahn,|last6=Gary.|first6=Gygax,|last7=1947-2009.|first7=Arneson, Dave,|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Paizo Pub|isbn=9781601255754|oclc=863052391}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar in appearance to La Catrina, wearing a festive dress and carrying a bouquet of flowers.

* The video game ''[[Need for Speed: Payback]]'' features a crew leader by the name of "La Catrina" as the leader of her crew "Graveyard shift" and one of the first bosses you encounter. Her motto says "When you ride a Hundred Miles an hour, Every decision is Life and Death".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ea.com/games/need-for-speed/need-for-speed-payback/street-leagues/graveyard-shift?cid=37302&amp;ts=1507434703836&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years on from the original event Ladyfest is still going strong as a global phenomenon.
The 2010 London Ladyfest was promoted as a "tenth anniversary" event, "celebrating a decade of DIY feminist arts and activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ladyfestten.com/|title=HugeDomains.com - LadyfestTen.com is for sale (Ladyfest Ten)|website=ladyfestten.com|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clashmusic.com/news/ladyfest-ten-launches Ladyfest Ten Launches] article from ClashMusic website&lt;/ref&gt;

Ladyfests in the world propose different kinds of activities, such as concerts, wokshops, conferences, debates, about very diverse topics. Workshops range from screenprinting, carpentry, stop-motion, plumbing-lessons to crocheting.

Ladyfest has inspired spin off events such as LaD.I.Y.fest in Berlin, Grrl Fest in Melbourne, and Grrl Fair in Santa Ana, CA.
LaD.I.Y fest in Berlin aimed to emphasise the do-it-yourself, participatory aspect of the festival.
And Grrl Fest in Melbourne started in 2013 in a warehouse in Melbourne. Harbouring the same ethos as a Lady Fest including music, art, zines and stalls. Grrl Fest is now an annual event with a wide network and sponsors: [http://www.grrlfest.com www.grrlfest.com] Grrl Fair in Santa Ana started in 2001 and ran through 2013. Organizers were inspired by fests like Ladyfest and Homo-a-gogo and wanted to bring DIY feminist punk ethos to their community.

'''''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Luncheon on the Grass'') – originally titled '''''Le Bain''''' (''The Bath'') – is a large [[oil on canvas]] painting by [[Édouard Manet]] created in 1862 and 1863. It depicts a [[female nude]] and a scantily dressed female bather on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. Rejected by the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 [[Salon des Refusés]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114147v Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refusés par le Jury de 1863 et exposés, par décision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elysées, le 15 mai 1863, Édouard Manet, ''Le Bain'', no. 363], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt; where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle|year=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-226-06328-7|pages=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece is now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Orsay"&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire_id/le-dejeuner-sur-lherbe-7123.html?no_cache=1&amp;cHash=48427e6bdb Musée d'Orsay, Le déjeuner sur l'herbe (Luncheon on the Grass)]&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller, earlier version can be seen at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art#The Courtauld Gallery|Courtauld Gallery]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artandarchitecture.org.uk/images/gallery/2454912b.html The Courtauld Gallery version]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and context==
The painting features a nude woman casually lunching with two fully dressed men. Her body is starkly lit and she stares directly at the viewer. The two men, dressed as young [[dandy|dandies]], seem to be engaged in conversation, ignoring the woman. In front of them, the woman's clothes, a basket of fruit, and a round loaf of bread are displayed, as in a [[still life]]. In the background, a lightly clad woman bathes in a stream. Too large in comparison with the figures in the foreground, she seems to float above them. The roughly painted background lacks depth, giving the viewer the impression that the scene is not taking place outdoors, but in a studio. This impression is reinforced by the use of broad "studio" light, which casts almost no shadows. The man on the right wears a flat hat with a tassel, a kind normally worn indoors.

Despite the mundane subject, Manet deliberately chose a large canvas size, measuring 81.9 x 104.1&amp;nbsp;in (208 by 264.5 cm), normally reserved for historical, religious, and mythological subjects.&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tucker|first1=Paul Hayes|title=Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=5–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the painting breaks with the academic traditions of the time. He did not try to hide the brush strokes; the painting even looks unfinished in some parts of the scene. The nude is also starkly different from the smooth, flawless figures of [[Alexandre Cabanel|Cabanel]] or [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].

A nude woman casually lunching with fully dressed men was an affront to audiences' sense of propriety, though [[Émile Zola]], a contemporary of Manet's, argued that this was not uncommon in paintings found in the [[Louvre]]. Zola also felt that such a reaction came from viewing art differently than "analytic" painters like Manet, who use a painting's subject as a pretext to paint.

There is much still not known about the painting, such as when Manet actually began painting it, exactly how he got the idea, and how and what sort of preparation works he did.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt; Though Manet had claimed this piece was once valued at 25,000 Francs in 1871, it actually remained in his possession until 1878 when [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], opera-singer and collector, bought it for just 2,600 Francs.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;

==Figures in the painting==
The figures of this painting are a testament to how deeply connected Manet was to ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe''. Some assume that the landscape of the painting is meant to be [[L'Île-Saint-Denis|l’île Saint-Ouen]], which was just up [[the Seine]] from his family property in [[Gennevilliers]]. Manet often used real models and people he knew as reference during his creation process.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Carol|title="To Paint, To Point, To Pose" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=93–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female nude is thought to be [[Victorine Meurent]], the woman who became his favorite and frequently portrayed model, who later was the subject of [[Olympia (Manet)|''Olympia'']]. The male figure on the right was based on a combination of his two brothers, Eugène and Gustave Manet. The other man is based on his brother-in-law, Dutch sculptor {{ill|Ferdinand Leenhoff|fr}}. Nancy Locke referred to this scene as Manet’s family portrait.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;

==Interactions of the figures==
What many critics find shocking about this painting is the interaction, or lack thereof, between the three main subjects in the foreground and the woman bathing in the background. There are many contrasting qualities to the painting that juxtapose and distance the female nude from the other two male subjects. For example, the feminine versus the masculine, the naked versus the clothed, and the white color palette versus the dark color palette creates a clear social difference between the men and the woman.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt; Additionally, some viewers are intrigued by the questions raised by the gaze of the nude woman. It is indeterminable whether she is challenging or accepting the viewer, looking past the viewer, engaging the viewer, or even looking at the viewer at all. This encounter identifies the gaze as a figure of the painting itself, as well as the figure object of the woman’s gaze.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;

==Inspirations==
As with the later ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863) and other works, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s engraving ''The Judgment of Paris'' (c. 1515) after a drawing by [[Raphael]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;Ross King. ''The Judgement of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism''. New York: Waller &amp; Company, 2006 {{ISBN|0-8027-1466-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raphael was an artist revered by the conservative members of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] and his paintings were part of the teaching programme at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], where copies of fifty-two images from his most celebrated frescoes were permanently on display. ''Le Bain'' (an early title for ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'') was therefore, in many ways, a defiant painting. Manet was cheekily reworking Raphael, turning a mythological scene from one of the most celebrated engravings of the [[Renaissance]] into a tableau of somewhat vulgar Parisian holidaymakers.&lt;ref&gt;Ross King, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Scholars also cite two works as important precedents for Manet's painting ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'': ''The Pastoral Concert'' by [[Giorgione]] or possibly [[Titian]] (in the [[Louvre]]) and Giorgione's [[The Tempest (painting)|''The Tempest'']], both of which are famous [[Renaissance]] paintings.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt; ''The Tempest'', which also features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting, offers an important precedent for Manet's painting ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe.''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rewald]],''The History of Impressionism'', [[The Museum of Modern Art]], 4th revised edition 1973, (1st 1946, 2nd 1955, 3rd 1961), p. 85. {{ISBN|0-87070-369-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pastoral Concert'' even more closely resembles ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe,'' as it features two dressed men seated in a rural setting, with two undressed women. ''Pastoral Concert'' is in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] and is likely, therefore, to have been studied by Manet.

According to Proust, he and Manet had been lounging by the Seine as they spotted a woman bathing in the river. This prompted Manet to say, "I copied Giorgione’s women, the women with musicians. It’s black that painting. The ground has come through. I want to redo it and do it with a transparent atmosphere with people like those we see over there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laessøe|first1=Rolf|title=Édouard Manet's "Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe" as a Veiled Allegory of Painting|journal=Artibus et Historiae|date=2005|volume=26|issue=51|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be a connection between ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'' and the work of [[Jean Antoine Watteau]].&lt;ref name="Fried"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fried|first1=Michael|title=Manet's Modernism or, The Face of Painting in the 1860s|date=1996|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manet’s original title, ''Le Bain'', initially drew the main attention to the woman near the water. This bathing figure alone is quite similar to the figure in Watteau’s ''Le Villageoise'', as both women crouch or lean over near water, simultaneously holding up their skirts. It’s possible that Manet adapted this pose, which is more clearly seen in a sketch of his years before his creation of ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe''.&lt;ref name="Fried" /&gt;

==Critique and controversy==
There were many mixed reviews and responses to ''Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe'' when it was first displayed&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k108159t Fernand Desnoyers, ''La peinture en 1863 : Salon des refusés'', A. Dutil (Paris) 1863], Bibliothèque nationale de France (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; and it continues to yield a variety of responses.  The initial response was characterized by its blunt rejection from the Paris Salon and subsequent display in the [[Salon des Refusés]]. Though many critiques were rooted in confusion about the piece, they were not always completely negative.&lt;ref name="McCauley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCauley|first1=Anne|title="Sex and the Salon" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Odilon Redon]], for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.
* [[Le Capitaine Pompilius]], a contributor for ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'', thought the characteristically "male" colors of the piece brought the countryside into the salon, but thought the painting was underdeveloped.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary|Castagnary]], appreciator of realist works, identified it as a nice sketch but said it lacked sincerity and lost the definition of the anatomy of the subjects. He also described Manet’s painting technique as "flabby".&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Arthur Stevens, contributor for ''[[Le Figaro]]'', praised Manet as a talented colorist but felt that he neglected form and modeling in this piece.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger|Thoré]], Paul, and Louvet loved the energy of the colors but found the brush strokes to be uneven.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution present at that time in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], a large park on the western outskirts of Paris. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Gartner, ''Art and Architecture: Musée d'Orsay'', 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-7607-2889-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Bois de Boulogne is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.

=== Critiques of the subject matter ===
* Louis Étienne characterized the painting as a puzzle, while describing the nude female as "a Bréda of some sort, as nude as possible, lolling boldly between two swells dressed to the teeth. These two persons look like high school students on holiday, committing a great sin to prove their manhood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1141487 Louis Étienne, ''Le jury et les exposants: salon des refusés'', Paris, 1863, p. 30.], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Arthur Stevens could not understand what the painting was saying.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Didier de Montchaux found the subject to be "fairly scabrous".&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* Thoré described the nude as an ugly and risqué subject matter, while describing the male on the right as one "who doesn’t even think of taking off his horrible padded hat outdoors…It’s the contrast between such an antipathetic animal to the character of a pastoral scene, and this undraped bather, that is shocking."&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;
* [[Philip Gilbert Hamerton|Philip Hamerton]], an English painter and contributor at the ''Fine Arts Quarterly'', had an affinity for the characteristic photographic detail of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] paintings. Though he did recognize the inspiration from Giorgione, he found Manet’s modern realism to be offensive in this situation. His disapproval of Manet and similar artists was related to the idea of indecency behind "vulgar men" painting nude women.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

=== General response ===
Though the peculiarity of the combination of one female nude with three clothed figures sparked mixed responses, the lack of interaction of the figures in addition to the lack of engagement by the nude woman provoked laughter instead of offense. Laughter as a response represses the sexual tension and makes the scene rather unthreatening to the viewer in the end.&lt;ref name="McCauley" /&gt;

==Commentary of Émile Zola==
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape. We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty. There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air. This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas. My God! What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men! That has never been seen. And this belief is a gross error, for in the [[Louvre]] there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude. But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized. The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience.  Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists. Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh. That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves. It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867,  et lps 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.cahiers-naturalistes.com/Salons/01-01-67.html&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dzola%2Bon%2Bmanet%26start%3D10%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Dpu9%26sa%3DN%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26channel%3Dsb%26biw%3D1799%26bih%3D840 Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867, link to English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Zola presents a fictionalised version of the painting and the controversy surrounding it in his novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (''The Masterpiece'').

== Inspired works==
[[File:Monet dejeunersurlherbe.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Monet)|Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'', 1865–1866, [[Musée d'Orsay]], [[Paris, France|Paris]].]]
[[File:James Tissot - La Partie carrée.jpg|thumb|left|[[James Tissot]], ''La Partie Carrée'', 1870]]
* In ''L'Oeuvre'', Émile Zola's novel about a painter, a work by his main character, Claude Lantier, exhibited in a fictional salon des refusés, resembles Manet's painting.
* [[Claude Monet]]'s own version of ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe (Monet)|Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' from 1865–1866, was inspired by Manet's masterpiece.
* French painter [[James Tissot]], painted ''La Partie Carrée'', in 1870; arguably a tamer version without the nudity of ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe''.
* [[Paul Cézanne]] painted the same theme in his ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (1876–1877), [[Musée de l'Orangerie]], Paris. It is not certain, however, that Cézanne was responsible for the title of the work, but it does incorporate many of the same elements of subject in the piece. For example, Cézanne’s clothed female subject poses similarly to the model of Manet in which her chin rests in her hand. The male figure, meant to resemble the painter himself, mimics the hand gesture of the man furthest right in Manet’s piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Locke|first1=Nancy|title="Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe as a Family Romance" Manet's Le Déjeuner Sur L'Herbe|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of Cézanne's painting also bears resemblance to ''[[:File:Nicolas Poussin - Bacchanal - the Andrians - WGA18269.jpg|Bacchanal]]'' (between 1627 and 1628), by [[Nicolas Poussin]], whose works in the Louvre were periodically copied by Cézanne. It is possible that Cézanne's ''Déjeuner'' represents nothing more than the joyful memories of outings in the countryside around Aix-en-Provence, known especially from the testimony of a childhood friend of the painter, Émile Zola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/pages/page_id19113_u1l2.htm Paul Cézanne, ''Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' (1876–1877), Musée de l'Orangerie, Paris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029032121/http://www.musee-orangerie.fr/pages/page_id19113_u1l2.htm |date=2014-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Manet’s painting inspired [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] as he completed the largest concentration of art prompted by a single work during the 20th century, consisting of 27 paintings, 140 drawings, 3 linogravures and cardboard marquettes for sculpture carried out between 1949 and 1962.&lt;ref&gt;''Picasso: Challenging the past'' [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] exhibition book, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso also adopted some of Manet’s techniques involving exploitation of the nude in the foreground as evident in his work ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', 1907.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;
* [[Paul Gauguin]] may have been inspired by this piece in creating his 1896 work ''Where do we come from? Who are we? Where are we going?'', as there is a similarity of Manet’s depiction of the nude woman and Gauguin’s Tahitian woman.&lt;ref name="Hayes" /&gt;
* [[Max Ernst]] painted a parody version of this piece named ''Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbre'' in 1944. He inverts the painting, replaces the nude woman with a fish, and adds an 'r' to the title for comedic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/2002.55?collection_search_query=fish&amp;op=search&amp;form_build_id=form-LSCVdx4K6pNGdu3UeD8aED5T32uXqJtj4kV67Am_FPk&amp;form_id=clevelandart_collection_search_form&amp;f%5B0%5D=object_on_view:1&amp;c=1|title=Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbre {{!}} Cleveland Museum of Art|website=www.clevelandart.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The painting inspired the 1959 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052765/ film] of the same name by [[Jean Renoir]].
* It was copied in the cover photo of the [[Bow Wow Wow]] [[LP record|LP]] ''[[See Jungle! See Jungle! Go Join Your Gang Yeah, City All Over! Go Ape Crazy!]]'', and the [[extended play|EP]] ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (Bow Wow Wow EP)|The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Controversy arose because the naked girl (lead singer [[Annabella Lwin]]) was only 14 at the time.  
* [[Alain Jacquet]] copied in 1964 the composition of Manet in his ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe''[http://collection.centrepompidou.fr/#/artworks?layout=mosaic&amp;page=0&amp;filters=authors:JACQUET+Alain%E2%86%B9JACQUET+Alain :], a serie of 95 serigraphies portraying the art critic [[Pierre Restany]] and the painter [[Mario Schifano]], one of which was left in the lobby of the [[hotel Chelsea]] in [[New York City]] for payment of his room.

The '''Liechtenstein Museum''' in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] contains much of the art collections of its owners, the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]], rulers of the principality of [[Liechtenstein]]. They include important European works of art, forming one of the world's leading private art collections. Its highlight used to be [[Leonardo]]'s portrait of ''[[Ginevra de' Benci]]''. 

The museum, which was open to the public until the [[Anschluss]] of 1938, had various locations, including the '''Liechtenstein Garden Palace''' in the IX District [[Alsergrund]], Vienna, and the '''[[Stadtpalais Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein City Palace]]''' in [[Bankgasse]], Vienna. It was reopened on 29 March 2004 and, after battling with low visitor numbers, was closed for regular visiting by the public in November 2011. According to the official website, "the highlights of the princely collections can be viewed exclusively as part of an event package or a pre-booked guided tour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaisliechtenstein.com/en/guided-tours.html|title=Guided Tours - Palais Liechtenstein|publisher=palaisliechtenstein.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objects from the collections have been sent on touring exhibitions to museums in other countries, especially the United States.  In particular displays are regularly mounted at the [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]] in [[Vaduz]], which is otherwise a gallery for a modern collection donated to the state of [[Liechtenstein]] by the ruling family.  Other works from the collection fill the palaces and residences of the Princely Family in Liechtenstein and Austria.

A catalogue of the artists (with short biographies) featured in the Gallery at the time of Prince [[Joseph Wenzel I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Joseph Wenzel]] was compiled by Vicenzo Fanti in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nK4DAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Pittore&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hvy7UNA2hbfLAfXfgEg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Pittore&amp;f=false|Compendio delle vite de Pittori, Scultori, e d'altri Artefici le di cui famose opere formano la prescrita celebre galleria di sua altezza Giuseppe Wenceslao Principe Regnate della Casa di Lichtenstein'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liechtenstein Garden Palace ==
[[File:Canaletto (I) 060.jpg|thumb|Liechtenstein Garden Palace painted in 1759 by [[Bernardo Bellotto|Canaletto]]]]
The ''Gartenpalais'' was built by Prince [[Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Johann Adam Andreas von Liechtenstein]], who commissioned its design and construction from [[Domenico Egidio Rossi]]; the shell was finished in 1700.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the construction is in Günter Passavant, ''Studien über Domenico Egidio Rossi und seine bauküstlerische Tätigheit innerhalb des süddeutschen und österreichischen Barok''(Karlsruhe: Braun) 1967:109-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Painted decor in the ''Palais'' was contributed by [[Marcantonio Franceschini]], [[Antonio Bellucci]], [[Andrea Pozzo]] and [[Johann Michael Rottmayr]]. Sculpture came from [[Giovanni Giuliani]] and his studio, and stucco from the stuccator [[Santino Bussi]].

==Premise==
Set in [[Detroit, Michigan]] the series stars [[Martin Lawrence]] in the role of Martin Payne, a [[disc jockey]] with a girlfriend named Gina Waters ([[Tisha Campbell-Martin]]). Martin works for the fictional radio station WZUP and later for local [[Public-access television]] station Channel 51. A common theme of the series is Martin's selfish and free-spirited nature. Episodes often center on Martin's inappropriate behaviors and incessant smart mouth towards his friends, neighbors, and whoever else finds themselves in his presence. When all is said and done, however, Martin loves his family and friends—it just takes dire situations for him to show it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/03/news/review-television-a-macho-image-for-a-sensitive-soul.html|title=A Macho Image for a Sensitive Soul|website=The New York Times|date=November 3, 1992|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the series progressed, plotlines saw Martin eventually move on to become the host of the talk show ''Word on the Street'', which aired on the small Detroit public-access television station Channel 51. He retained this position until the series' final episode, in which he and Gina prepared to move to [[Los Angeles]], from where his show would be syndicated nationally. The move coincided fortuitously with Gina's promotion by her boss Mr. Whitaker to head up his company's new Los Angeles headquarters, after having shut down the Detroit office. Gina's best friend Pam, whom Whitaker let go two episodes earlier due to this consolidation and downsizing, went on to pursue a career in the music industry as an artists &amp; repertoire ([[A&amp;R]]), executive at Keep It Real Records. (This plotline is the subject of a backdoor pilot episode that was included in the ''Martin'' series for a planned sitcom on Fox starring Tichina Arnold to be called ''Goin' for Mine'' (Episode 129, "Goin' for Mine"). This sitcom never materialized, however.) And at series' end, Cole{{who|date=November 2016}} proposed to his even more dimwitted, but attractive and devoted girlfriend Shanise (portrayed by Maura McDade), and they made plans to move into their own place. The only actor to appear in every episode as the same character is [[Thomas Mikal Ford]] as Tommy.

In early episodes, Lawrence began with a [[monologue]] of him speaking directly to the camera and audience from the darkened radio studio.

In 1997, Tisha Campbell filed a lawsuit against her co-star Martin Lawrence and the show's producers for [[sexual harassment]] and [[Verbal abuse|verbal]] and [[Physical abuse|physical assaults]], and she did not appear in most of the season five episodes. The explanation in most of the episodes Campbell did not appear in was that Gina was "out on business", though in the two-part episode "Going Overboard" it was stated that Gina had arrived too late to board the boat for the trip alongside everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/15/arts/tv-notes.html|title=TV Notes|website=The New York Times|date=January 15, 1997|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; HBO Studios eventually settled the case with Campbell so that the show's last season could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/martin-campbell-reconcile-1117342288/|title='Martin,' Campbell reconcile|date=March 21, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell did return to the Martin set to film the two-part series finale of the show under the condition that she would not share any scenes with or interact in any way with Martin Lawrence.  In the episode, Martin and Gina kept entering and exiting the sets at different times and the storyline was adjusted so that the characters were both part of it but never crossed paths.

== Characters ==

=== Main characters ===
* '''Martin Payne''' ([[Martin Lawrence]]) Martin, the [[title role|title character]], is a caring family man deep down, but on the outside a very macho, selfish smart alec. Martin carries himself in a typical [[urban culture|urban]] youth manner, with modern expressions and mannerisms. His girlfriend turned wife, Gina Waters, has sometimes tried to change him (much to his anger, seeing as he likes the way he acts), but this rarely worked. Martin is not much of a physical fighter despite trying to come off as such. He has a particularly antagonistic relationship with Gina's best friend Pam.
* '''Regina "Gina" Waters-Payne''' ([[Tisha Campbell-Martin|Tisha Campbell]]) (Seasons 1–4 (&lt;small&gt;main&lt;/small&gt;); 5 &lt;small&gt;recurring&lt;/small&gt;), Martin's professional, fun-loving, eternally romantic and forgiving girlfriend and later wife. She often acts as a peacemaker, admonishing others when they trade barbs and insults and breaking up fights. Gina works for a public-relations firm. She complements Martin's street savvy by serving as a voice of reason. She is Pam's best friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-07/entertainment/ca-16050_1_fox-series|title='Martin's' Wife Leaves Fox Series|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/martin-campbell-reconcile-1117342288/|title='Martin,' Campbell reconcile|date=March 21, 1997|work=Variety|accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thomas "Tommy" Strawn''' ([[Thomas Mikal Ford]]), one of Martin's best friends. Level-headed, intelligent, and charming, Tommy serves as another voice of reason, especially during Martin's schemes. He would often portray himself as a ladies' man and would flirt with Pam and other women on the show. He had a romantic relationship with Pam during the third and fourth seasons. His mysterious employment status was a running gag on the show. Of all the male characters, he is the only one to have attended college. He is the only character to appear physically in every episode.
* '''Cole Brown''' ([[Carl Anthony Payne II]]), Martin's other best friend. Dimwitted but well-meaning and known for his eclectic taste in headgear, Cole proudly cleans jets at the airport for a living, drives an [[AMC Pacer]], and lives with his mother Maddie until early Season Five. For a time in Season 3, Cole appeared to be attracted strictly to plus-sized women and dated a security guard named Big Shirley (who is fully seen in only one episode; another episode only showed "her" below the neck to portray her as being much taller and bigger than Cole). In the final season, after Cole meets Shanise and moves into his own apartment in a rough neighborhood, he dates Shanise, who appears to be even more dimwitted than he is. During the series finale, he becomes engaged to Shanise.
* '''Pamela "Pam" James''' ([[Tichina Arnold]]), Gina's sassy and ill-tempered co-worker, best friend and Tommy's girlfriend. Before eventually dating Tommy, Pam was always looking for a good man. Pam worked at the PR firm where she was employed as Gina's assistant. Pam has a very adversarial relationship with Martin. When he insults her, she responds typically via belittling that brings attention to Martin's short stature. Pam has a beautiful singing voice that she displays throughout the show.

=== Supporting characters ===
* '''Bruh-Man (Brother Man)''' ([[Reginald Ballard]]) &lt;small&gt;(1993–1997)&lt;/small&gt;: Martin's neighbor, who debuts in season two. He lives on the fifth "flo" (yet he always puts 4 fingers up when relating this fact), directly upstairs from Martin. Whenever Martin asks what he is doing, Bruh-Man replies, "Nuttin'…just chillin'." He often climbs down the "f-a-a-a-ah 'scape" (fire escape), to enter Martin's apartment, taking food, borrowing assorted items, and generally lounging around as if he lives there. At first, this greatly annoyed Martin but he eventually got used to it. In fact, fire escapes seem to be his only means of movement throughout buildings—he is seldom seen entering or exiting the apartment through the front door. When he attended Martin and Gina's engagement party at Gina's apartment, he went as far as climbing the building since there was no fire escape. Bruh-Man always wears badly fitting clothing a size or two too small (frequently, items he's "borrowed" from Martin), and has a characteristic gait consisting of a slow and lazy, rather limping, plodding walk, with his head cocked to one side. Martin, as Bruh-Man was heading toward the window to make his exit, once referred to it as his "slow bop". Bruh-Man speaks in a deep voice and with a long drawl, like that of [[Shaquille O'Neal]]. Despite being a popular character, Bruh-Man was quietly phased out of the series after season three. His last appearances were in the fourth season, and he explains his absence by stating that he only comes around when Martin and Gina are away out of respect for their marriage. This is proven true as he is absent throughout the fifth and final season of the series, however he is mentioned once albeit briefly. In episode 13, "Ain't That About a Ditch", when Gina's mother locks Martin out of his apartment, he pauses to think, then whispers "Bruh-Man" to himself as he walks off to climb in through the fire escape, then Martin shows up in his apartment.
* '''Hustle Man''' ([[Tracy Morgan]]) &lt;small&gt;(1994–1996)&lt;/small&gt;: The neighborhood purveyor of questionable products and services "at a discount rate! I don't do dat for erra'body! I'm just tryna help ''YOU'' out!" He always greets Martin with his trademark "What's happenin', chief?" In one episode, one of Hustle Man's more outrageous items for sale was an 'appetizing' array of roasted pigeons impaled on a tree branch (as if barbecued on it), which he attempted to sell to Martin and his friends while they were snowed in and starving. In another episode he served as Martin's cut-rate "wedding planner", armed with a shopping cart brimming with plastic flowers, chitlin loaf, and a 40-ounce bottle of malt liquor—Martin's retaliation for Gina's choice of a more elegant and ridiculously overpriced wedding planner.
* '''Stan Winters''' ([[Garrett Morris]]) &lt;small&gt;(1992–1994; 1995; 1997; guest role)&lt;/small&gt;, Martin and Shawn's boss, the owner and founder of radio station WZUP. He perpetually used too much cologne and wore woefully outdated clothing from the 1970s. Martin knew Stan to be cheap and quite untrustworthy, and just when Martin didn't think Stan could sink any lower with his schemes, Stan was always able to surprise him. Furthermore, Garrett Morris' real-life shooting resulted in his unexpected absence in the episode and a major change in the storyline, regarding Martin's career. Therefore, Stan was absent in the episode "The Hoedown in Motown" when he gets into trouble with the IRS due to a debt of $20,000 in unpaid taxes, precipitating his sale of the radio station, but returned in the season 2 finale "Martin's on the Move" where Stan recovers from the hospital and reunites with Martin for one last goodbye until he left town and subsequent flight to parts unknown. He returned for one episode in Season 3 to form a partnership with Martin, and together they opened a restaurant—Marty Mart's Meatloaf and Waffles. Needless to say, their joint venture was a failure. After this episode, Stan was never seen or mentioned again, however he returns as a guest appearance in the two-part series finale episode [[California, Here We Come]] where Martin reunited with him as he and the gang gave Martin a farewell roast at Nipsey's.
* '''Shawn McDermott''' ([[Jon Gries|Jonathan Gries]]) &lt;small&gt;(1992–1994; 1997; guest role)&lt;/small&gt;, the white, scatterbrained radio station engineer at WZUP. Martin always finds himself having rather strange conversations with him. Shawn often does things that upset their boss Stan, and once even tried to secure a record deal from [[Snoop Dogg]] when he was at an engagement party for Martin &amp; Gina. Shawn was later fired, along with Martin, when Stan sold the radio station. It is revealed in a later episode that Shawn was retained by the new station as an engineer. Shawn's final appearance on the show was in the Season 2 season finale episode where he says farewell to Martin. That particular episode showed a more serious side of Shawn as he gives Martin some advice on life that actually made sense. After this episode, Shawn is never seen or mentioned again, with the exception of the Season 4 clip show "The Best of Martin" in which he appears via archive footage, however he returns for one final guest appearance in the two-part series finale [[California, Here We Come]] where Martin reunites with him and the gang as he prepared Martin for a final roast at Nipsey's.
* '''Ms. Geri''' (Jeri Gray): She was a tough, trigger-happy senior who, regardless of her age and diminutive size, has no qualms about "whoopin' ass". Most of her assaults are committed on Martin in everyday situations, such as standing in line at the DMV or at the unemployment office. On one occasion, her opponent was Dragonfly Jones (Lawrence), whom she soundly defeated as well, taking his money for good measure.
* '''Shanise McGullicuddy''' (Maura McDade) &lt;small&gt;(1996–1997)&lt;/small&gt; is Cole's girlfriend (and later fiancée), during the fifth and final season. Shanise is a very friendly woman. She always has a positive attitude. However, she is even more dimwitted than Cole. She and Cole briefly break up in one episode but this occurs because when she told Cole she needed more space, he assumed she meant she wanted to break up but she actually wanted a bigger apartment. She is also thoughtful and willing to help others. In the episode ''Over the Hoochie's Nest'', she assists Martin, Tommy and Cole in rescuing Pam from an insane asylum. In the [[California, Here We Come|series finale]], Cole wanted to ask Shanise to marry him. He had a hard time asking her due to him losing the ring. Shanise was even taken to get X-rayed in order for Cole to find the ring after he stuck it in cupcake. Finally, they become engaged when she is tricked into reading a letter that says "Will you marry me?" and Cole says yes to her. At the end of the episode, she is last seen helping the Paynes move out of their apartment as well as saying farewell to them. The character started minor but developed a grounded position in the group after [[Tisha Campbell]] briefly left the show.
* '''Nipsey''' (Sean Lampkin): The rotund, good-natured bartender who owns Nipsey's Lounge, the group's favorite hangout.
* '''Varnell Hill''' (Tommy Davidson): The more successful talk show host and frenemy of Martin's that is constantly showing off and throwing his flashy lifestyle in Martin's face. Varnell is known to be a ladies man and gets worldwide recognition to Martin's dismay. He appears on the radio show that Martin hosts at WZUP.

=== Recurring characters ===
* '''Nadine Waters''' ([[Judyann Elder]]): Gina's doting and somewhat over-protective mother, who comes on as sophisticated, sweet and mild-mannered on the surface, but has shown a dark side on occasion—such as once getting immediately turned on by a brief scene from a porn video, and generally becoming quite flustered whenever conversation or situations turned to sexual subjects.
* '''Dr. Cliff Waters''' ([[J.A. Preston]]): Gina's overbearing and overprotective father who works as a chiropractor. Instantly disliked Martin because he didn't feel he was good enough for his daughter. During the wedding rehearsal dinner, he threatens to start "capping" people, instantly inciting a major fight with members of the Payne family.
* '''Lil' Dawg''' (Adrian Tibbs): A tall, lanky barber at Jim's Barber Shop whose unorthodox personal style is the subject of much ribbing in the workplace—he keeps his head nearly shaved, but grows a long mane of hair in back, and wears Coke-bottle-thick glasses. He is often seen at Nipsey's trolling for women (successfully!), and despite his looks and demeanor always seems to come out on top whenever he and Martin have a disagreement.
* '''Buckwhite''' (Ray Massara): A very easygoing, tall white boy with a huge dark-coloured Afro, Buckwhite has been seen hanging out at Jim's Barber Shop, at Martin's apartment for various sporting events on TV, and at Nipsey's Lounge. He speaks Ebonics in an unaffected "normal" white manner. (Massara is actually a property master and special-effects assistant in the film and television industry; at the time of his appearances on ''Martin'', he was that production's property master.)
* '''Bro Fo' Real (Brother For Real)''' ([[Charlie Murphy]]): A faithful audience member of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program, and quite possibly Martin's number one fan. Bro Fo' Real attends every of Martin's taping for his show and encouraged Martin to be himself during one of the show's taping ([[List of Martin episodes#Season 3: 1994–1995|Season 3, Episode 14]]).
* '''Angry Man''' (David Jean Thomas): A fellow audience member of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program, and often can be found in other locations such as the DMV. He is prone to stand up and shout "''Man.... SIT-CHO ASS DOWN!!''" when a guest (or anyone else, for that matter) says something he disagrees with.
* '''Mr. and Mrs. Booker''' ([[Jeris Lee Poindexter]] and [[Ellia English]]): A married couple and audience members of Martin's "Word on the Street" television program. The Bookers are constantly arguing. Mr. Booker appears to be somewhat goofy and dimwitted, while Mrs. Booker is loud and aggressive. Their most prominent appearance is in the Season 4 episode "Kicked to the Curb", where they assist Martin and Gina in getting their apartment back, by scaring off the new tenants after Mrs. Booker pretends to be a scorned wife looking to fight the woman who was "creeping with her husband".
* '''Maddie Brown''' (Laura Hayes): Cole's gossiping, no-nonsense mother who still supports him. She's known for talking about other people and spreading their business around. For example, Martin being broke and having Gina support him.
* '''Evelyn Porter''' ([[LaWanda Page]]): A senior resident who lives in Martin's apartment building who is also friends with Mama Payne and Cole's mother, Maddie.
* '''The Reverend Leon Lonnie Love''' ([[David Alan Grier]]): A local fire-and-brimstone preacher whose brand of religion doesn't seem to frown upon avarice, lying, cheating, stealing, and philandering—even with his own cousin Pam.
* '''Marian''' (Roxanne Reese): A seemingly well-heeled, middle-aged neighborhood alcoholic who often appears at parties, nightclubs, and gatherings, such as the audience on Martin's show ''Word on the Street'' and The Ladies League of Detroit. However, in one episode, she reveals that she is not drunk, that she is instead on medication.
* '''Kenji''' (Kenneth Whack): Dragonfly's student. 
* '''Laquita''' ([[Simbi Khali]]): The nail stylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon and Sheneneh's even-more vocal best friend.
* '''Keylolo''' ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]): A hairstylist at Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon. She is also Sheneneh's sidekick.
* '''Bonquisha''' ([[Kim Coles]]): Another one of Sheneneh's friends who always has bad breath. Bonquisha routinely claims that Keylolo is the one that has bad breath stating that was "eatin chitlins".
* '''Sonny''' ([[Reno Wilson]]): Martin's shoplifting cousin who dresses and acts like [[Eddie Murphy]].
* '''Luis''' ([[Luis Antonio Ramos]]): The superintendent of the apartment building where Martin lives. In one episode, he marries Pam to avoid deportation.
* '''Titus''' ([[Bentley Kyle Evans]]): A handsome well-dressed guy who is Gina's hairdresser, and seems to be attracted to Martin—affectionately calling him "Almond". (Evans was the executive producer of ''Martin''; he made several cameo and voice-only appearances throughout the series, including one of the callers on WZUP, a guest at one of Gina's parties, and the only guy who appeared at an all-male fashion show that Pam and Tommy sponsored.)
* '''Myra''' (BeBe Drake-Massey): Stan's girlfriend; they once double-dated with Martin and Gina (while Martin was on the outs with Cole, Pam and Tommy). She was a customer of Sheneneh's hair salon, and went bald after Gina treated her hair. While working for the unemployment office, she got several jobs for Martin – then nearly gave up on him since he kept quitting each job he received.
* '''Gloria Rodriguez''' (Angelina Estrada): Station director and Martin's supervisor at television station Channel 51.
* '''Bernice''' (Kymberly Newberry): A producer at Channel 51 who is always at odds with Martin. (Kymberly Newberry also briefly played an entirely different part of a shoe-saleswoman in episode 8 of season 2 "You've Got a Friend".)

=== Other roles played by Lawrence ===
One of the trademark running gags of ''Martin'', especially early in its run, was Lawrence playing multiple characters, utilizing various costumes and prosthetic appliances. This was often done as a plot device or comic relief. Season four was the last season to feature Lawrence as multiple characters on a regular basis. This technique was rarely used in Season 5, which was the final season of the series. The only characters that appeared in Season 5 were Sheneneh, Roscoe and Elroy. Mama Payne does not appear but her voice is heard in the holiday episode "Scrooge". Most of the other characters were last seen in Season 4 and the episodes they last appeared in seemingly wrote them out of the series.
* '''Sheneneh Jenkins''': Played by Martin, she is an exaggerated parody of a stereotypical "ghetto girl": she always has on flashy clothes/fashion accessories and [[Artificial hair integrations|hair weaves]]; nature has endowed her with a disproportionately oversized [[steatopygia|ghetto booty]]; and she speaks in [[African American Vernacular English]]. Sheneneh is the owner/operator of ''Sheneneh's Sho' Nuff Hair Salon''. Mama Payne and Sheneneh were the only two characters Lawrence played as women on the show, and both characters hated Gina. Full of quirks, Sheneneh is tall and thick in build and often describes herself as a "''la-a-a-dy''{{-"}}. Some of her other locutions are "''Oh mah goodnehhh!''{{-"}} and "''Aw-iight?''{{-"}} at every other word, and "Oh, no you didn't." Sheneneh's portrayed as being a very feisty, belligerent, touchy antagonistic, confrontational and disparaging diva, known for her ghetto fabulous scoldings. She lives in the apartment across the hallway from Martin's and factors into many of the plots by picking fights with Gina and especially Pam out in the hallway. Sheneneh has several girlfriends who occasionally appeared in the program, those being Keylolo ([[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]]), Bonquisha ([[Kim Coles]]), and Laquita ([[Simbi Khali]]). Of all the secondary characters played by Lawrence, Sheneneh is the only one to make an appearance in the final episode, though only her voice was heard. The [[nae nae]] dance, created in 2013, was inspired by the way Sheneneh danced in ''Martin'', and was named after the character.
* '''Edna (Mama) Payne''': Martin's extremely frenetic, and easily excited mother, who is extremely over-protective of Martin, and who dislikes Gina immensely. Comically, Lawrence's mustache was never covered with stage make-up while in this role. Mama's mustache was occasionally the subject of a sharp retort by Gina when she and Martin argued. She has a brother named Junior (portrayed by [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]). Mama does not appear in the fifth and final season, but her voice is heard in the Christmas episode "Scrooge". She has the same catchphrase as her son Martin, ''"Damn! Damn! Daaaaamn!"''
* '''Ol' Otis''': A very abrasive, strict, stuttering and potbellied old man, who is always seen in uniform while on his job as a security guard. His catchphrase is repeatedly referring to males as "bwah" [boy] and females as "guh" [girl]. Otis is usually seen melodramatically and hyperactively attempting to keep order whether there's trouble or not. Because of his immense gut, advanced age, and oafish appearance, Otis is often taken for a weak old man who just ''acts'' tough. Because of this, he's often challenged to physical fights following his abrasive behavior. Otis is always more than willing to oblige others in engaging in combat. Surprisingly through his buffoonish-styled wrestling, unexpected strength from Otis always catches his "antagonists" off guard, invariably making him the victor in the end. Otis's pet peeve is misconduct in the "younger generations". When all is said and done, he physically defeats all his much younger challengers with ease. In his final episode on the show, he moves to an undisclosed island. Otis does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Jerome''': A loudmouthed, aging, somehow well-funded, once-flashy but now-faded Detroit pimp. He runs an illicit casino, sports a family-heirloom gold tooth ("gold toof-es") in his mouth, was once voted Detroit's "Player of the Year", and has his sights set on Pam, as when he occasionally calls her "Junk in the Trunk". He often speaks in rhyming sentences. Usually Jerome appears on the scene with his signature spiel, "Oooh, oooh, oo-oo-ooh, I say Jerome's in the house, I say Jerome's in the ah-um-ah-um...watch yo' mouth!" Jerome's final appearance on the show is in the episode "Uptown Friday Night" (which parodies ''[[Uptown Saturday Night]]''), in which his final line is "And that's the eeeend!" Jerome does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Roscoe''': An antagonistic child with a perpetually runny nose and a very smart mouth, who can be considered Gina's arch-enemy (similar to Martin and Pam's rivalry). Lawrence played the role by standing on his knees, with shoes attached to his kneecaps. Roscoe only appears once during the first, fifth and final season.
* '''Dragonfly Jones''': A martial arts "expert" who is beaten up in nearly every appearance. He always seems to owe money to a real martial artist named Kenji, who is actually a student of Dragonfly. Kenji who would often beat up Dragonfly whenever he refuses to pay him some small sum he is owed. Dragonfly does not appear in the fifth and final season.
* '''Bob''': A white man who works in an unknown capacity at the marketing firm where Gina is employed, Bob is best described as a stereotypical surfer-dude-cum-redneck. He speaks in a Southern Californian accent mixed with a Southern twang, and often uses words like "dude" and "man", even in professional settings. Lawrence achieved a white appearance with stage make-up and a prosthetic nose appliance to make him appear Caucasian, as well as wearing a long, blond [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] wig to complete the look. Bob only appears in 2 episodes, once in the first season and again in the second season.
* '''Elroy Preston''': The fictional "Godfather of Black Surf Music" who is now completely forgotten and washed up. Preston works as an auto mechanic, and is best known for randomly breaking into song while performing his mechanical duties. He often distracts himself and irritates others when reminiscing on things that involve his trademark song, which consists only of Preston singing "Don't you know no good!" over and over. He makes one appearance in the fifth and final season.
* '''King Beef''': Cole's favorite 1970s [[blaxploitation]] movie actor, who is actually Lawrence in a huge bodysuit. Whenever trouble arises, he feels the overwhelming need to dance. It does not matter if he is on the run from Godzilla—he always finds time for dancing, and always with his scantily clad female co-stars flanking him. He is only seen during the first season.

== Possible revival ==
In January 2018, rumors have circulated that the popular series was possibly slated for a reboot due to a post that Martin Lawrence's fiance teased on Instagram, which made viral headlines to a popular blog [[The Shade Room]]. She posted a picture of the Martin TV show [[Intertitle|title card]] logo with the caption: ''"Got word from my fiance that my favorite TV show may be coming back"'' ending the comment with the peeking wide eyes emoji and Martin replied to the post with the same emoji, which can insinuate a common nod towards each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeZE8mFFmZ7/|title=Instagram post by The Shade Room • Jan 26, 2018 at 12:02am UTC|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HipHollywood'', another internet entertainment media blog, questioned Tisha Campbell-Martin on the rumor during an interview, in which she gave a ecstatic response that she can't speak upon it stating ''"It has been an honor to be Gina all these years and its surprising that people still love those characters so much. So, i can't tell you guys anything, but it is very excitng"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=HipHollywood|title=Exclusive: Tisha Campbell-Martin Confirms 'Martin' Reboot!|date=2018-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwilqeYaftw|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding insult to injury, a few days later during an [[E! News]] Daily Pop interview, she was caught off guard by the host who asked her about it, and instead of answering it, she jokingly denied it and brushed it off by changing the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=E!

News|date=2018-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlrw66eh-BY|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her responses caused an immediate interest from all media outlets to believing that she confirmed a possible reboot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dish Nation|title='MARTIN' REBOOT MAY BE IN THE WORKS|date=2018-02-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqoTjVPp91E|accessdate=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early February, [[TMZ on TV|TMZ]] caught up with Tichina Arnold, Tisha Campbell-Martin and Martin Lawrence altogether leaving Morton's Steakhouse in Burbank, California, all smiles and anticipating the same question. Martin replied by saying ''"Never Say Never"'', Tichina added by stating ''"In life there's always new beginnings, and there's always change...so we'll see what's happening".'' Tisha ended it bluntly and jokingly by blurting out  ''"We can't tell y'all shit, how 'bout that"'', The interview continues to go more in depth about questioning the shows popularity from the past and how a reboot can be made up to date with current events and hold its' popularity if it's greenlighted. Tichina and Tisha's responses kind of hinted and gave it away that it may happen, but realizes the questions already pushed them to reveal their answer, in which Tisha ends it with the same blunt quote she stated earlier in the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/02/01/martin-cast-reunites-steaks-talks-reboot-never-say-never/|title='Martin' Cast Reunites, Plays it Coy About TV Reboot|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interview is also the first time Tisha and Martin is seen publicly together since their past cast debacle, which was part of the reason for the show's cancellation in 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">A '''metabibliography''' (or '''biblio-bibliography''') is a [[bibliography]] of bibliographies.

Bibliographies serve the finding of relevant documents. Metabibliographies serve the finding of the relevant bibliographies in which the relevant documents may be found. One might quote Patrick Wilson:

"For if knowledge is power, power over knowledge is power to increase one's power; and if the stock of writings is thought of mainly as it represents a stock of knowledge, it is natural to propose treating it as a "resource" to be subjected to rational control, managemenet and utilization." (Wilson, 1968, p. 145).

Metabibliographies are valuable for building reference collections, but usually of less interest to the average user, who rely on bibliographies selected by others.

'''Miller Richardson''' (1917 &amp;ndash; May 25, 2012) was an American visual artist, stage and costume designer, scenographer and modern dance choreographer best known for his collaborations with [[Flower Hujer]] in the Flower Hujer Dance Theater company.

==Life and career==

William Miller Richardson, known professionally as Miller Richardson, was born  in El Paso, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.silive.com/obituaries/index.ssf/2012/08/william_miller_richardson_95.html | Obituary&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied architecture at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. At 19 he was awarded a scholarship to study art at the [[Art Students League]] under [[William Charles McNulty]]. He also studied at the [[Museum of Design Atlanta]] during 1938.

In 1953 he met choreographer and dancer [[Flower Hujer]], who is described in his obituary as his "longtime companion".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luckyrabbitestatesales.com/apps/blog/show/26940257-the-antique-estate-sale-of-the-decade-&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 they bought a neo-Gothic house together in New Brighton, Pendleton Place, which he restored. According to the New York Times: "His garden is exquisite, with shaped fir trees that give it an Italian air."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/21/realestate/streetscapes-pendleton-place-3-houses-that-recall-19th-century-staten-island.html&lt;/ref&gt; They lived there the rest of their lives. He collaborated with Hujer as artistic director of the Flower Hujer Dance Theatre, where he worked on choreography, costume and lighting design and sometimes performed. Richardson and Hujer were known for their exotic costumes and creative choreography. In 1984 he did a demonstration of costume design at [[Lincoln Center]].&lt;ref&gt;Dance, New York Magazine, October 29, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Their dances, based on religious and nature themes and praised for their dignity and simplicity, were presented in [[Trinity Wall Street]], [[St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church (Manhattan)|St. Bartholomew's]],&lt;ref&gt;Dance, New York Magazine, December 5, 1988, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; [[Church of the Intercession (Manhattan)]], Choreospace and other venues. Their best known piece was "[[Le Jongleur de Notre Dame|The Juggler of Our Lady]]", based on a medieval legend turned into a story by [[Anatole France]]. It was broadcast on television in 1965, performed in Kennebunk, Maine, in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;https://newspaperarchive.com/us/maine/biddeford/biddeford-journal/1967/08-14/page-2| Interfaith Service Ends Arts Festival, Biddeford Journal: Monday, August 14, 1967 - Page 2&lt;/ref&gt; and had revivals in 1981, 1988 and 1990.

Richardson worked as a multi-media artist. In addition to working in the theater, painting settings, backdrops and decor, he also executed commissions like portraits, murals, and decorative projects. He did not retire until he was nearly 90.

==Plot==
The ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'' is searching a [[binary star|binary star system]] in an effort to find the ''USS Brattain'', a [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] science vessel which went missing a month previous. The crew locates the ship but the ''Brattain'' is derelict, and all the crew are dead save one: the ship's [[Betazoid]] science adviser, Andrus Hagan, who is discovered hiding in a room just off the bridge. Hagan has somehow survived, but he has been shaken by the experience and is in a profound [[Catatonia|catatonic state]]. Counselor [[Deanna Troi]] tries to use her telepathy to contact Hagan. Meanwhile, [[Geordi La Forge]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] set to work repairing the ''Brattain'' but discover that although everything is in working order, the ship still fails to move. Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] determines that all of the ''Brattain''{{'}}s crew died at each other's hands. That night onward, Troi has trouble sleeping, encountering the same dream in which she levitates and drifts in the direction of a mysterious voice repeating, "Eyes in the dark, one moon circles". Troi starts to believe Hagan was influenced by the same dream.

Four days later, with the investigation stalled, [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] decides that the time has come to move on, but the crew find the ship also stalled like the ''Brattain''. Data discovers that both ships are trapped in a spatial phenomenon known as a "Tyken's Rift", and they can only escape through the force of a tremendous explosion. However, as they work at determining how to create this explosion, the crew starts becoming irritable and experiences hallucinations. Dr. Crusher realizes that everyone, but Troi, has failed to achieve [[R.E.M. sleep]] since entering the rift, leading to their current state. As violence begins to erupt around the ship, Picard assigns Data, who does not sleep or dream and is therefore unaffected, as acting Captain.

Data eventually attempts to use a pulse from the [[Navigational deflector|deflector]] aimed at the center of the rift to create the explosion, but this fails to produce any effect. As Data looks for other solutions with Troi, Troi gets an idea that her dreams of "eyes in the dark, one moon circling" is a description of a [[hydrogen atom]]. Data and Troi work out that there must be another ship from a psychic race trapped on the other side of the rift who is aware of their presence but looking for hydrogen to create an explosion. Troi goes to sleep to contact the other species through the dream, while Data vents hydrogen into the rift. An explosion soon occurs, and both the ''Enterprise'' and the alien ship are freed. As the crew recovers, Data returns the ship to Picard, but not before ordering everyone to get some sleep.

==Production==
The episode was intended as a vehicle for [[Marina Sirtis]], however she disliked it due to her fear of heights and the requirement that she be strapped into a flying harness.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWBfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT202&amp;dq=%22star+trek%22+%22night+terrors%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1xpjCgcHTAhVI8mMKHawoCI0Q6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22star%20trek%22%20%22night%20terrors%22&amp;f=false|title=Star Trek FAQ 2.0 (Unofficial and Unauthorized): Everything Left to Know About the Next Generation, the Movies, and Beyond|last=Clark|first=Mark|date=2013-06-01|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480355002|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTifVpk6cekC&amp;pg=PT198&amp;lpg=PT198&amp;dq=marina+sirtis+harness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VY11MI2XGC&amp;sig=PkuKEEbXi84deF_V4ANGtrG4aDY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj09-_018zTAhVQyWMKHQgGC2UQ6AEIVTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=marina%20sirtis%20harness&amp;f=false|title=The Next Generation Companion: Star Trek The Next Generation|last=Nemecek|first=Larry|date=2012-09-25|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781471106798|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tor /&gt;

The model used for the USS ''Brattain'' is the same as was used for the USS ''Reliant'' in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. The ship is occasionally referred to as the USS ''Brittain'' due to a spelling error on the exterior of the model.&lt;ref name=encyc /&gt;

==Reception==
[[TechRepublic]] placed the episode in its list of "The five worst Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes ever".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/geekend/the-five-worst-star-trek-the-next-generation-episodes-ever/|title=The five worst Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes EVER! - TechRepublic|website=TechRepublic|language=en|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zack Handlen of [[The A.V. Club]] noted that the episode "...lacked that mild twist at the end to make it memorable" but also that "This kind of episode is really the meat-and-potatoes of this sort of show, so it's impressive to realize that TNG has gotten to the point where delivering the expected is no longer entirely satisfactory".&lt;ref name=avclub /&gt; According to James Hunt of [[Den of Geek]] "It’s not completely incompetent, but it’s hard to imagine anyone loving this episode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/star-trek-the-next-generation/37180/revisiting-star-trek-tng-night-terrors|title=Revisiting Star Trek TNG: Night Terrors|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en|first=James|last=Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Place Royale (Koningsplein), Brussels, Belgium (ca. 1890-1900).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Place Royale, late 19th century]]

The square itself is built on the former site of the Baliënplein, which was the main market square adjacent to the former [[Coudenberg|palace of Coudenberg]]. The palace burned down, however, during a fire that took much of the original royal complex on the night of February 3, 1731. Construction of the new buildings around the square took from 1773 to 1780, using the design of French architect [[Gilles-Barnabé Guimard|Barnabé Guimard]], who received that commission in 1769. The square is almost an exact replica of the Place Royale in [[Reims]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, B: ''Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture'', p. 821. Architectural Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Belgian Revolution]] in 1830, a [[barricade]] was erected across the eastern exit of the square next to the current BELvue Museum, facing the [[Brussels Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'attaque du Parc de Bruxelles par les Volontaires en 1830|url=http://www.b1830.be/voluntary/doc.html|publisher=B1830.be|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two cannon were also positioned on it.

In 1831, the coronation of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], Belgium's first king, was held in the place. The funerals of [[Leopold III of Belgium|King Leopold III]] and [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders|Prince Charles]], prince-regent between 1944 and 50, were also held in the square.

In 2014, the heritage organization [[Beliris]] announced plans to restore the buildings and atmosphere on the square. Final plans will be provided in 2016 and work may begin in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laporte|first1=Christian|title=Une place encore plus… royale|url=http://www.lalibre.be/regions/bruxelles/une-place-encore-plus-royale-5472590d35707d02ac19d6ba|accessdate=24 November 2014|publisher=[[La Libre Belgique]]|date=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal building on the square is the [[Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg]], consecrated in 1787, and designed by Barré and [[Gilles-Barnabé Guimard|Guimard]]. On the western side of the square is the main building of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], next to the [[Magritte Museum]] while on the south-east side is the [[BELvue Museum]]. At the center of Place Royale is a statue of [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], the leader of the [[First Crusade|first crusade]] in 1096, riding on horseback. It was sculpted by [[Eugène Simonis]] in 1848 to replace the statue of [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine]] that had been melted down for the metal during the [[French Revolution]]. Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat enters the square from the south, rue de la Régence/Regentschapstraat from the southwest, and [[Mont des Arts]] from the northwest.

== Accessibility ==
This square is located near the [[Brussels Metro|metro]] stations [[Brussels Central Station|Gare Centrale/Centraal Station]], [[Parc metro station (Brussels)|Parc/Park]] and [[Trône/Troon metro station|Trône/Troon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21819">'''The psychology of film''' is a sub-field of the [[psychology of art]] that studies the characteristics of [[film]] and its production in relation to [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[narrative]] understanding, and [[emotion]]. A growing number of psychological scientists and brain scientists have begun conducting empirical studies that describe the cognitive and biological underpinnings of motion pictures or what has been called "psychocinematics".&lt;ref name=Shimamura&gt;{{cite book|last=Shimamura|first=Arthur P. (Editor)|title=Psychocinematics: Exploring Cognition at the Movies|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early theoretical approaches included works by psychologists [[Hugo Münsterberg]]&lt;ref name="Münsterberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Münsterberg|first=Hugo|title=The Photoplay. A psychological study|year=1916|publisher= Appleton.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rudolf Arnheim]].&lt;ref name=Arnheim&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnheim|first=Rudolf|title=Film as Art: 50th Anniversary Printing|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive film theorists [[David Bordwell]] and [[Noël Carroll]] fostered its philosophical underpinnings.

==Sensory Features==
Film is rather unusual as it involves an integration of visual and auditory stimuli. In [[Fictional film|narrative films]], plots are guided by camera placement and movement, dialogue, sound effects, and editing. Some aspects of film are driven by bottom-up or sensory guided factors (such as light, motion or sound), whereas other aspects depend more on top-down or conceptually driven factors, like past experiences and internal motivations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=Whan|author2=Daniel C. Smith |title=Product Level Choice: A Top-Down or Bottom-Up Process?|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=December 1989|volume=16|issue=3|pages=289–299|doi=10.1086/209215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===

Cuts and flashbacks represent types of editing that alter the normal temporal sequencing of events, creating non-linear narrative structures. Editing creates the transition between events. Research focusing on recall ability for linear versus non-linear narratives suggests that temporal changes impact memory of events, but not comprehension.&lt;ref name=lowe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowe|first=Phillip J.|author2=Durkin, Kevin |title=The effect of flashback on children's understanding of television crime content|journal=Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|date=1 January 1999|volume=43|issue=1|pages=83–97|doi=10.1080/08838159909364476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film cuts are instantaneous, perceptual, and sometimes temporal discontinuities that do not exist in our own realities. However, despite this, viewers accept cuts as a natural storytelling technique in film. Even though we see reality in a continuous flow of linked images, in movies, cuts seem to work, regardless of how experienced a viewer is. [[Walter Murch]] suggests that this is because viewers are in fact used to cuts in their everyday lives through the act of [[blinking]]. When you turn to look at an object, for example, you normally blink, thus creating a visual break in continuity between what you ''were'' looking at and what you are now looking at. Another possibility that Murch explores to explain humans’ innate acceptance of film cuts is the way in which we [[dream]]. Our dreams tend to jump around from place to place and situation to situation without any real sense of continuity. Thus the [[Oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] nature of [[film]]s is familiar to viewers and allows them to innately understand the [[editing]] despite discontinuities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33334569|title=In the blink of an eye : a perspective on film editing|last=1943-|first=Murch, Walter,|date=1995|publisher=Silman-James Press|isbn=9781879505230|edition= 1st |location=Los Angeles|oclc=33334569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwan &amp; Ildirar (2010), who focused solely on inexperienced viewers’ ability to comprehend film, found that the comprehensibility of films was determined by whether or not they followed a familiar line of action. Overall, our brains accept the perceptual discontinuities found in films, but it is ultimately easier for viewers, regardless of their experience, to understand cuts that follow a continuous and familiar line of action as opposed to ones that are more discontinuous. When a familiar line is not present, more experienced viewers are significantly better at comprehending a complex narrative by “filtering” out editing discontinuities.&lt;ref name="schwan"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=S.|author2=Ildirar, S.|date=7 June 2010|title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=7|pages=970–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, however, [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] linearity that creates temporal continuity is more important than [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] for recall and understanding of a [[Narrative structure|narrative’s]] events.[[Psychology of film#cite note-cowen-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Sequence of events===

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] research demonstrates that some movies can exert considerable control over brain activity and eye movements. Studying the neuroscience of film is based on the hypothesis that some films, or film segments, lead viewers through a similar sequence of perceptual, emotional and cognitive states. Using [[fMRI]] brain imaging, researchers asked participants to watch 30 minutes of [[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]] (1966) as they lay on their backs in the MRI scanner. Despite the seemingly uncontrolled task and complex nature of the stimulus, brain activity was similar across viewers’ brains, particularly in spatiotemporal areas. When compared to a random sequence of scenes, the specific order of events seemed to be strongly associated with this similarity in brain activity. It was also determined that the level of control a movie has on someone’s mental state is highly dependent upon the cinematic devices (pans, cuts and close-ups) it contains. Tightly edited films exert more control on brain activity and eye-movement than open-ended films. However, similar eye-movement and similarity in visual processing does not guarantee similar brain responses.&lt;ref name=hasson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hasson|first=Uri|author2=Landesman, Ohad |author3=Knappmeyer, Barbara |author4=Vallines, Ignacio |author5=Rubin, Nava |author6= Heeger, David J. |title=Neurocinematics: The Neuroscience of Film|journal=Projections|date=30 August 2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–26|doi=10.3167/proj.2008.020102|citeseerx=10.1.1.454.2650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the average correlation in taste between individual viewers is rather low and not well predicted by film critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.3167/proj.2017.110107|title = Strikingly Low Agreement in the Appraisal of Motion Pictures|journal = Projections|volume = 11|year = 2017|last1 = Wallisch|first1 = Pascal|last2 = Alden Whritner|first2 = Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Friends building.jpg|thumbnail|The Greenwich Village building seen in TV series Friends]]

===Spatial Information===

Viewing spaces on screen from a stable point of view is important for short-term spatial coding and long term spatial memory. Long-time viewers of the television show ''[[Friends]]'' were significantly better at accurately recalling spatial information about the show's set, because the camera never moves away from the "[[fourth wall]]". Equally experienced viewers of the show "[[ER (TV series)|E.R.]]" were less likely to recall information about the set and be able to mentally orient themselves inside it, because the show is filmed from many different angles.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Daniel T.|author2=Wang, Caryn |title=Spatial Representation in Cognitive Science and Film|journal=Projections|date=1 June 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=24–52|doi=10.3167/proj.2009.030103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study,&lt;ref name=hirose&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hirose|first=Yoriko|title=Perception and memory across viewpoint changes in moving images|journal=Journal of Vision|date=1 January 2010|volume=10|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1167/10.4.2|pmid=20465322}}&lt;/ref&gt; observers were instructed to look at short movies involving changes in point of view. They used 15 movie clips featuring a handbag, whose properties (color, position, identity, and shape) were manipulated across cuts. Observers' reactions were recorded by examining eye-movement, changes in behavior and memory performance. The researchers later asked the observers if they had noticed anything unusual occur during the clips, without directly referring to the handbag. Changing the position of objects, i.e. the handbag, between scenes was the only variable that did not appear to affect eye-movement or memory. Overall, observers were more likely to draw their attention and look sooner at the handbag-stimulus at the moment right after its properties changed. When specifically asked about it, they were more likely to describe the handbag in terms of its post-cut properties, after a change had occurred. Even though their visual system appeared to pick up on the changes, observers were not consciously aware of them or able to report noticeable differences across cuts. The results illustrate that observers construct and maintain internal visual representations of complex visual environments while viewing dynamic scenes. This also helps explain why movie viewers usually are not aware of continuity errors in editing.&lt;ref name="hirose"/&gt;

===Cinematic techniques===

Cinematic techniques are often regarded as grammatical structures or components of the cinematic art as a language made up of images.&lt;ref name=Messaris94&gt;{{cite book|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=Visual "Literacy": Image, Mind, Reality|year=1994|publisher=Westview|location=Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A period of visual adaptation is necessary before being able to understand images in movies or on [[television]].  Viewers need sufficient exposure to cinematic techniques and the meanings attributed to them to adequately interpret the images on the screen. At a very young age, we learn how to watch videos and understand different editing techniques. One study looked at adult participants who had very little exposure to film to see if they were able to understand simple editing techniques, such as [[point of view shot]]s, [[establishing shot]]s, [[Panning (camera)|pan shots]], [[Shot reverse shot|shot/reverse shot]], ellipsis of time, and [[cross-cutting]]. These viewers were able to understand some of the techniques, such as ellipses of time; however, more complex techniques, like shot/reverse shot were more difficult for them to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwan|first=Stephan|author2=Sermin Ildirar |title=Watching Film for the First Time: How Adult Viewers Interpret Perceptual Discontinuities in Film|journal=Association for Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|issue=7|pages=969–976|doi=10.1177/0956797610372632|pmid=20530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[filmmaking]] techniques derive meaning through past experiences or [[Ideology|ideologies]] that influence the way viewers see certain images or sequence of images. An example of this would be how [[camera angle]]s can affect our perception of what is occurring on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baranowski|first=Andreas|last2=Hecht|first2=Heiko|date=2017-05-30|title=Effect of Camera Angle on Perception of Trust and Attractiveness|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317237444|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=36|pages=90–100|doi=10.1177/0276237417710762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low angle shots in which the camera is pointed up at a subject tend to make the subject appear more powerful or stronger. While high angle shots can make a subject appear weaker. These interpretations of [[camera angle]]s, however, ultimately derive from the notion that bigger is better. The lateral movement of a subject across the screen can also influence an audience's interpretation of the subject.  For example, characters that move from left-to-right are perceived more positively than characters who move right-to-left. This partiality toward rightward movement likely has its roots in the predominance of right-handedness in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L Egizii|first=Matthew|last2=Denny|first2=James|last3=Neuendorf|first3=Kimberly|last4=D Skalski|first4=Paul|last5=Campbell|first5=Rachel|date=2012-05-01|title=Which Way Did He Go? Directionality of Film Character and Camera Movement and Subsequent Spectator Interpretation|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the practice of reading left-to-right in [[Western Romance languages|Western languages]].

====Changes in film techniques====

One study compiled data on the changing trends in techniques by examining 160 English-language films released from 1935-2010.&lt;ref name=cutting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutting|first=James E|author2=Brunick, Kaitlin L |author3=DeLong, Jordan E |author4=Iricinschi, Catalina |author5= Candan, Ayse |title=Quicker, faster, darker: Changes in Hollywood film over 75 years|journal=I-Perception|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=6|pages=569–576|doi=10.1068/i0441aap|pmid=23145246|pmc=3485803}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;  The findings demonstrate that over time shot lengths have become shorter, while the shorter the shot the more motion it is likely to contain. In addition, contemporary films have significantly more motion and movement than older ones. Motion is the optical change created by moving objects, people, and shadows; movement is that change created by camera motion or gradual lens change.
Presumably, the film industry has capitalized on the results of previous psychological research that shows motion and the onset of motion capture our attention.&lt;ref name=hillstrom&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillstrom|first=Anne P.|author2=Yantis, Steven |title=Visual motion and attentional capture|journal=Perception &amp; Psychophysics|date=1 July 1994|volume=55|issue=4|pages=399–411|doi=10.3758/BF03205298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally, films have become darker over time, as the overall brightness of the images on the movie screen has decreased.&lt;ref name="cutting" /&gt;

These changes in film-making choices increase attention manipulation and are thought to facilitate comprehension.

==Top-down factors==
Top-down factors refer to expectations and background knowledge that influence viewers' perception, understanding and appreciation of film. Expertise, attention and eye-movements are top-down factors that guide how viewers experience film.

===Expertise and awareness of audience manipulation===

Explicit awareness about the processes by which meaning is created by the visual media could be regarded as one measure of film expertise and sophistication. Increased awareness of the subtle techniques employed by filmmakers to “manipulate” audiences leads to increased admiration and aesthetic responses to film,&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=L.|title=Art as the communication of competence|journal=Social Science Information|date=1 December 1973|volume=12|issue=6|pages=115–141|doi=10.1177/053901847301200604}}&lt;/ref&gt;   as in other forms of visual art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffith|first=D.W.|title=When the Movies Were Young|year=1975|publisher=Benjamin Blom|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Researchers have identified a strong relationship between prior film experience and conscious awareness of visual manipulations, especially for people with practical experience in production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worth|first=Sol|title=Through Navajo Eyes: An Exploration in Film Communication and Anthropology|year=1972|publisher=Indiana University Press.|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study compared the participants’ ability to understand narrative in Hollywood versus experimental film, by measuring interpretational awareness. Subjects with significant, moderate and no formal background or experience in film viewed a film that contained both scenes with Hollywood-style and experimental-style editing. Regardless of expertise level, participants described the Hollywood-like scenes in “naturalistic terms,” as if their events had occurred in reality and tended not to make explicit references to stylistic techniques. This interpretational tendency reflects Hollywood’s “invisible style.” When describing the experimental scenes, inexperienced viewers struggled to construct a cohesive “naturalistic” narrative. More experienced viewers were more likely to make explicit reference to the “breaking of conventions” and the intentions behind them.&lt;ref name=messaris81&gt;{{cite journal|last=Messaris|first=Paul|title=The Film Audience's Awareness of the Production Process|journal=Journal of the University Film Association|year=1981|volume=33|issue=4|pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film editing seems to be a barrier of awareness for conventional Hollywood-type movies, as they create an illusion of “real life”.

===Segmentation===

Segmentation or event segmentation is a fundamental component of attention that facilitates understanding, object recognition and planning. Event segmentation constitutes breaking down dynamic scenes into spatial and temporal parts or units of events.

Event segmentation is viewed as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.”&lt;ref name=zacksj /&gt; 
It is considered to be an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were coded frame by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a button to identify units of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived at the end of one event and the beginning of another.&lt;ref name=zacksj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=J|title=Human Brain Activity Time-locked to Perceptual Event Boundaries|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=4|pages=651–655|doi=10.1038/88486|pmid=11369948|year=2001|last2=Braver|first2=TS|last3=Sheridan|first3=MA|last4=Donaldson|first4=DI|last5=Snyder|first5=AZ|last6=Ollinger|first6=JM|last7=Buckner|first7=RL|last8=Raichle|first8=ME|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Event Segmentation Theory (EST),&lt;ref name=zacks&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Swallow, Khena M. |author4=Braver, Todd S. |author5= Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Event perception: A mind-brain perspective|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1 January 2007|volume=133|issue=2|pages=273–293|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.2.273|pmid=17338600|pmc=2852534}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the perception of event boundaries is a side effect of prediction during ongoing perception. Prediction is an adaptive mechanism made up of cognitive event models that represent “what is going on now” to create expectations and attentive biases for ongoing processing. Prediction errors occur at situational changes and cause information processing segmentation.

Broader narrative comprehension theories have also been applied to the perception and memory of movies.&lt;ref name=zacks2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zacks|first=Jeffrey M.|author2=Speer, Nicole K. |author3=Reynolds, Jeremy R. |title=Segmentation in reading and film comprehension|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=1 January 2009|volume=138|issue=2|pages=307–327|doi=10.1037/a0015305|pmid=19397386|citeseerx=10.1.1.496.1792}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This reflects the hypothesis that the same mechanisms are used to understanding stories and real life. In one study, researchers illustrated the common episodic structure between text and film, by asking participants to match a constructed text story to the dialogueless movie [[The Red Balloon]]. This task required participants to locate episodes and their components within the cinematic story: exposition, complication and resolution.&lt;ref name=baggett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baggett|first=Patricia|title=Structurally equivalent stories in movie and text and the effect of the medium on recall|journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior|date=1 June 1979|volume=18|issue=3|pages=333–356|doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(79)90191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-movement===

Using an [[Eye tracking|eyetracker]], researchers have discovered a strong center-of-screen bias with a distribution of gaze points approximately peaking at the screen center. However, eye gazes rarely focus on the same location. Visual dispersion across the screen increases over time and particularly, after repeated exposure to the same video stimulus. Because of this, there is greater gaze dispersion when viewers are watching advertisements compared to a television show.&lt;ref name=brasel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brasel|first=S Adam|author2=Gips, James |title=Points of view: Where do we look when we watch TV?|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2008|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1890–1894|doi=10.1068/p6253|pmid=19227380|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230036|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driver|first=J.|title=Parietal neglect and visual awareness|journal=Nature Neuroscience|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–22|year=1998|doi=10.1038/217|pmid=10195103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rossetti and His Circle''''' is a book of twenty-three [[caricatures]] by English [[Caricature|caricaturist]], essayist and [[Parody|parodist]] [[Max Beerbohm]]. Published in 1922 by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|William Heinemann]], the drawings were Beerbohm's humorous imaginings concerning the life of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his fellow [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]], the period, as he put it, "just before oneself."&lt;ref name="max"&gt;Max Beerbohm, ''Rossetti and His Circle'', London: William Heinemann, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; The book is now considered one of Beerbohm's masterpieces.&lt;ref name="nysl"&gt;[http://www.nysoclib.org/collections/green/beerbohm_max.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219084148/http://www.nysoclib.org/collections/green/beerbohm_max.html |date=19 February 2012 }} Beerbohm on the [[New York Society Library]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beerbohm and Rossetti==

Beerbohm returned to England from his home in [[Rapallo]] in Italy so that he could study photographs of the subjects he depicted in his caricatures. During the winter of 1917 he rented a cottage in the English countryside near the home of his friend [[William Rothenstein]] so that he could work on his Rossetti drawings. Every day, carrying his portfolio of drawings with him, Beerbohm walked across the snow to visit Rothenstein. "No wonder Max was nervous of leaving his Rossetti caricatures in an empty cottage... What a remarkable reconstruction of a period!" Rothenstein later wrote.&lt;ref name="nysl"/&gt;
Rossetti and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] had captured Beerbohm's imagination. "In London, in the great days of a deep, smug, thick, rich, drab, industrial complacency," he wrote, "Rossetti shone, for the men and women who knew him, with the ambiguous light of a red torch somewhere in a dense fog. And so he still shines for me."&lt;ref name="nysl"/&gt;

Beerbohm's caricatures include [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] with his sister [[Christina Rossetti|Christina]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Millais]] and [[George Meredith]]. In plate 22, [[Oscar Wilde]], on his 1882 lecture tour in America, describes the delights of the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]] to a fascinated audience.&lt;ref name="nysl"/&gt; This tour had been organised by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] to publicise the new [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.

Sir [[Hugh Walpole]] bequeathed Beerbohm's original watercolour artwork for ''Rossetti and His Circle'' to the [[Tate|Tate Collection]] in London in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=722&amp;page=1 Link] The Beerbohm Collection at the [[Tate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A special limited edition of 380 numbered copies bound in white cloth was also published in 1922. These were signed by Beerbohm.

Mr. [[Frederic Leighton]] : "Think not for one moment, my dear Mr. Rossetti, that I am insensible to the charm of a life recluded, as yours is, from the dust of the arena, from the mire of the market-place. Ah no! I envy you your ivory tower. How often at some Council Meeting of the R.A. have I murmured within me that phrase of Wordsworth's, 'The world is too much with us'! But alas, in all of us there is a duality of nature. You, O felix nimium, are poet as well as painter. I, separated from my easel, am but a citizen. And the civistic passion yes, passion, dear Mr. Rossetti- restrains the instinct of the artist in me towards solitude, and curbs the panting of the hart in me for the water-brooks. I feel that I have, in conjunction with my colleagues, a duty to the nation. To improve the taste of the Sovereign, the taste of her ever-genial first-born and of his sweet and gracious consort, of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the faithful Commons, of the Judicial Bench, of those who direct the Army and Navy and Reserve Forces, of our merchant princes in Threadneedle Street and of our squires in the Shires, and through all these to bring light and improvement to those toiling millions on whom ultimately the glory of Great Britain rests all this is in me an ambition not to be stifled and an aspiration not to be foregone. You smile, Mr. Rossetti, yet I am not disemboldened to say to you now, as I have often wished to say to you, in the words of the Apostle Paul, 'Come over and help us!' Our President I grant you in confidence is not of all men the most enlightened. But I, in virtue of what is left to me of youth and ardour, conjoined with the paltry gift of tact, have some little influence at Burlington House. Come now! let me put your name down in our Candidates' Book."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35830">The '''slave narrative''' is a type of literary work that is made up of the written accounts of enslaved [[Africans]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and [[British Empire|its colonies]], including the later [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Caribbean]] nations. Some six thousand former [[slaves]] from [[North America]] and the Caribbean gave accounts of their lives during the 18th and 19th centuries, with about 150 narratives published as separate books or pamphlets. In the U.S. during the [[Great Depression]] (1930s), more than 2,300 additional oral histories on life during slavery were collected by writers sponsored and published by the [[Works Progress Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/17/opinion/greene-slave-narrative/index.html?hpt=hp_c1|title=America's 'Slave Narratives' should shock us|first= Bob|last=Greene|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (WPA) of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration. Most of the 26 audio-recorded interviews are held by the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="fountain"/&gt;

Some of the earliest [[memoir]]s of captivity known in England and the British Isles were written by white [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] and later [[United States|Americans]] captured and sometimes enslaved in [[North Africa]], usually by [[Barbary pirates]]. These were part of a broad category of "[[captivity narrative]]s" by English-speaking Europeans. Beginning in the 18th century, these included accounts by [[colonists]] and American settlers in North America and the United States who were captured and held by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Several well-known captivity narratives were published before the [[American Revolution]], and they often followed forms established with the narratives of captivity in North Africa. Later North American accounts were by Americans captured by western tribes during 19th-century migrations.

For the Europeans and Americans, the division between captivity as slaves and as [[prisoners of war]] was not always clear. Given the problem of international contemporary slavery in the 20th and 21st centuries, additional slave narratives are being written and published. It is an ubiquitous issue that still persists and remains largely undocumented.

== Slave narratives as a literary genre ==
The development of slave narratives from autobiographical accounts to modern fictional works led to the establishment of slave narratives as a literary [[genre]]. This large rubric of this so-called "captivity literature" includes more generally "any account of the life, or a major portion of the life, of a fugitive or former slave, either written or orally related by the slave himself or herself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/freedom/1609-1865/essays/slavenarrative.htm|title=How to Read a Slave Narrative|last=Andrews|first=William|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the first narratives told the stories of fugitive or freed slaves in a time of racial prejudice, they further developed into retrospective fictional novels and extended their influence until common days. Not only maintaining the memory and capturing the historical truth transmitted in these accounts, but slave narratives were primarily the tool for fugitive or former slaves to state their independence in the 19th century, and carry on and conserve authentic and true historical facts from a first-person perspective. They go further than just autobiographies, and are moreover "a source for reconstructing historical experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/literature-and-language-arts/essays/slave-narratives-genre-and-source|title=The Slave Narratives: A Genre and a Source {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=August 6, 2012|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|language=en|access-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freed slaves that wrote the narratives are considered as historians, since "memory and history come together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/881290138|title=The Oxford Handbook of the African American Slave Narrative|last=John,|first=Ernest,|date=January 1, 2014|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|isbn=9780199731480|oclc=881290138}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accounts link elements of the slave's personal life and destiny with key historical events, such as the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Underground Railroad]].

In simple, yet powerful storylines, slave narratives follow in general a plot common to all of them: starting from the initial situation, the slave in his master's home, the protagonist escapes in the wilderness and narrates the struggle for survival and recognition throughout his uncertain journey to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/800963917|title=Witnessing slavery : the development of ante-bellum slave narratives|last=Frances.|first=Smith Foster,|date=January 1, 1994|publisher=University of Wisconsin law school|isbn=9780299142148|oclc=800963917}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all, these narratives were written retrospectively by freed slaves and/or their abolitionist advocate, hence the focus on the transformation from the dehumanized slave to the self-emancipated free man. This change often entailed literacy as a means to overcome captivity, as the case of [[Frederick Douglass]] highlights. The narratives are very graphic to the extent as extensive accounts of e.g. whipping, abuse and rape of enslaved women are exposed in detail (see [[Treatment of slaves in the United States]]). The denunciation of the slave owners, in particular their cruelty and hypocrisy, is a recurring theme in slave narratives, and in some examples took a comic stance denouncing the double standards (e.g. in Douglass' narrative, his slave owner Hopkins is a very religious, but also brutal man).

According to James Olney, a typical outline looks the following way:

{{quote|
A. An engraved portrait, signed by the narrator.

B. A title page that includes the claim, as an integral part of the title, "Written by Himself" (or some close variant: "Written from a statement of Facts Made by Himself"; or "Written by a Friend, as Related to Him by Brother Jones"; etc.)

C. A handful of testimonials and/or one or more prefaces or introductions written either by a white abolitionist friend of the narrator (William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips) or by a white amanuensis/editor/author actually responsible for the text (John Greenleaf Whittier, David Wilson, Louis Alexis Chamerovzow), in the course of which preface the reader is told that the narrative is a "plain, unvarnished tale" and that naught "has been set down in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination"-indeed, the tale, it is claimed, understates the horrors of slavery.

D. A poetic epigraph, by preference from William Cowper.

E. The actual narrative:

1. a first sentence beginning, "I was born ... ," then specifying a place but not a date of birth;

2. a sketchy account of parentage, often involving a white father;

3. description of a cruel master, mistress, or overseer, details of first observed whipping and numerous subsequent whippings, with women very frequently the victims;

4. an account of one extraordinarily strong, hardworking slave often "pure African"-who, because there is no reason for it, refuses to be whipped;

5. record of the barriers raised against slave literacy and the overwhelming difficulties encountered in learning to read and write;

6. description of a "Christian" slaveholder (often of one such dying in terror) and the accompanying claim that "Christian" slaveholders are invariably worse than those professing no religion;

7. description of the amounts and kinds of food and clothing given to slaves, the work required of them, the pattern of a day, a week, a year;

8. account of a slave auction, of families being separated and destroyed, of distraught mothers clinging to their children as they are torn from them, of slave coffles being driven South;

9. description of patrols, of failed attempt(s) to escape, of pursuit by men and dogs;

10. description of successful attempt(s) to escape, lying by during the day, travelling by night guided by the North Star, reception in a free state by Quakers who offer a lavish breakfast and much genial thee/thou conversation;

11. taking of a new last name (frequently one suggested by a white abolitionist) to accord with new social identity as a free man, but retention of first name as a mark of continuity of individual identity;

12. reflections on slavery.

F. An appendix or appendices composed of documentary material bills of sale, details of purchase from slavery, newspaper items-, further reflections on slavery, sermons, anti-slavery speeches, poems, appeals to the reader for funds and moral support in the battle against slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://deceivingmemories.qwriting.qc.cuny.edu/files/2011/08/olney_iwasborn.pdf|title="I Was Born": Slave Narratives, Their Status as Autobiography and as Literature|last=Olney|first=James|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ))

There is no consensus about what exact type of literature slave narratives are, whether they can be considered as a proper genre, comprised in the large category [[Captivity narrative]], or are [[Autobiography|Autobiographies]], [[Memoir]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[Testimonial]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, or [[Novel]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s; nonetheless, they play a big part in keeping up the memory of slavery and in approaching a topic that was considered as a taboo for a long time - especially since many denied and still deny the existence of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://slavenorth.com/denial.htm|title=Slavery Denial|website=slavenorth.com|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the participation of abolitionist editors, influential historians, such as [[Ulrich B. Phillips]] in 1929, suggested that, as a class, "their authenticity was doubtful." With increased emphasis on using the slaves' own accounts and the research of broader classes of information, since the late 20th century historians have more often validated the accounts of slaves about their own experiences.&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=|first2=|year=1971|title=Slave Narratives: Dismissed Evidence in the Writing of Southern History|url=|format=|journal=Phylon|publisher=|volume=32|issue=4|pages=403–409|jstor=274066|last1=Nichols|first1=William W.|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North American slave narratives==
Slave narratives by African slaves from North America were first published in [[England]] in the 18th century. They soon became the main form of [[African-American literature]] in the 19th century. Slave narratives were publicized by [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], who sometimes participated as editors, or writers if slaves were not literate. During the first half of the 19th century, the controversy over slavery in the United States led to impassioned literature on both sides of the issue.

To present the reality of slavery, a number of former slaves, such as [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Harriet Jacobs]], and [[Frederick Douglass]], published accounts of their enslavement and their escapes to freedom. [[Lucy Delaney]] wrote an account that included the [[freedom suit]] waged by her mother in [[Missouri]] for their freedom. Eventually some 6,000 former slaves from North America and the Caribbean wrote accounts of their lives, with about 150 of these published as separate books or pamphlets. In total, it is believed that there exist 294 slave narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/docsouthdata/|title=Documenting the American South: North American Slave Narratives Database|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[American Civil War]], some authors wrote fictional accounts of slavery to create support for abolitionism. The prime example is ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. The success of her novel and the social tensions of the time brought a response by white [[Southern literature|southern writers]], such as [[William Gilmore Simms]] and [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Mary Eastman]], who published what were called [[anti-Tom novels]]. Both kinds of novels were bestsellers in the 1850s.

The North American slave narratives can be broadly categorized into three distinct forms: tales of religious redemption, tales to inspire the abolitionist struggle, and tales of progress. The tales written to inspire the abolitionist struggle are the most famous because they tend to have a strong autobiographical motif, such as in [[Frederick Douglass]]'s [[autobiographies]] and ''[[Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl]]'' by [[Harriet Jacobs]] (1861).

===Tales of religious redemption===
From the 1770s to the 1820s, the slave narratives generally gave an account of a spiritual journey leading to [[Christian]] redemption. The authors usually characterized themselves as Africans rather than slaves, as most were born in Africa.

Examples include:
*[[Ukawsaw Gronniosaw]], ''A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert "Ukawsaw Gronniosaw", an African Prince'', [[Bath, England]], 1772
*[[Olaudah Equiano]], ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano|The Interesting Narrative and the life of "Olaudah Equiano" or Gustavus Vassa, the African]]'', [[London]], 1789
*[[Venture Smith]], ''A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident Above Sixty Years in the United State of America'', [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], 1798
*[[Jeffrey Brace]], ''The Blind African Slave, Or Memoirs of Boyrereau Brinch, Nicknamed Jeffrey Brace'', as told to Benjamin F. Prentiss, Esq., [[St. Albans (town), Vermont|St. Albans, Vermont]], 1810;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/brinch/menu.html "Boyrereau Brinch and Benjamin F.

*[[John Jea]], ''The Life, History, and Unparalleled Sufferings of John Jea, the African Preacher'', 1811

===Tales to inspire the abolitionist movement===
From the mid-1820s, writers consciously chose the autobiographical form to generate enthusiasms for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. Some writers adopted literary techniques, including the use of fictionalized dialogue. Between 1835 and 1865 more than 80 such narratives were published. Recurrent features include: slave auctions, the break-up of families, and frequently two accounts of escapes, one of which is successful. As this was the period of the forced migration of an estimated one million slaves from the [[Upper South]] to the [[Deep South]] through the internal [[slave trade]], the experiences of auctions and separation of families were common to many.

Examples include:
*[[William Grimes (ex-slave)|William Grimes]], ''Life of William Grimes, the Runaway Slave'', [[New York City|New York]], 1825
*[[Solomon Bayley]], ''A Narrative of Some Remarkable Incidents in the Life of Solomon Bayley, Formerly a Slave in the State of Delaware, North America'', 1825

===Tales of progress===
[[Image:SlaveNarrativeTheExperienceOfThomasHJones1871.jpg|thumb|right|Slave narrative of [[Thomas H. Jones]] published in 1871]]
Following the defeat of the slave states of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate South]], the authors had less need to convey the evils of slavery. Some gave a sentimental account of plantation life and ended with the narrator adjusting to the new life of freedom. The emphasis of writers shifted conceptually toward a recounting of individual and racial progress rather than securing [[Freedom (political)|freedom]].

Examples include:
*''The Life of James Mars, A Slave Born and Sold in Connecticut'', [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], 1864
*[[Paul Jennings (slave)|Paul Jennings]], ''A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison'', 1865

===WPA slave narratives===
{{main|Slave Narrative Collection}}
During the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, the [[New Deal]] [[Works Projects Administration]] (WPA) employed writers and researchers from the [[Federal Writers' Project]] to interview and document the stories of African Americans who were former slaves. Most had been children when the [[Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] was passed. Produced between 1936 and 1938, the narratives recount the experiences of more than 2,300 former slaves. Some interviews were recorded; 23 of 26 known audio recordings are held by the [[American Folklife Center]] of the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name="fountain"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Project: WPA. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19446/19446-h/19446-h.htm ''Slave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States from Interviews with Former Slaves: Volume II, Arkansas Narratives, Part 3.''] Washington, DC: Library of Congress, 1941. Retrieved December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The last interview of a former slave was with [[Fountain Hughes]], then 101, in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1949.&lt;ref name="fountain"&gt;[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/110/ "Interview with Fountain Hughes, Baltimore, Maryland, June 11, 1949"], American Folklife Center, Library of Congress, World Digital Library. Retrieved May 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a grandson of a slave owned by President [[Thomas Jefferson]] at [[Monticello]].

==North African slave narratives==
In comparison to North American and Caribbean slave narratives, the [[North African]] slave narratives in English were written by [[British people|British]] and [[North America|American]] [[white slaves]] captured (often at sea or through the [[Turkish Abductions]]) and enslaved in North Africa in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These narratives have a distinct form in that they highlight the "otherness" of the [[Arab slave trade|Muslim slave traders]], whereas the African-American slave narratives often call slave traders to account as fellow [[Christian]]s.

Some captives used their experiences as North African slaves to criticize slavery in the United States, such as William Ray in his book ''Horrors of Slavery''. Slaves in North Africa suffered from many of the same conditions as their African counterparts in the United States, including hard labor, poor diet, and demeaning treatment. But, unlike those in America, slaves in North Africa  and could sometimes escape their condition by [[forced conversion]] to [[Conversion to Islam|Islam]] and adopting North Africa as their home through [[Dhimmitude]], be subject to [[eunuch|eunuch servitude]], or in some cases could be [[ransom]]ed by European powers. The [[Barbary pirates]] made a business out of capturing Europeans at sea and for ransom.

Narratives focused on the central themes of freedom and liberty which drew inspiration from the American Revolution. Since the narratives include the recurrence of themes and events, quoting, and relying heavily upon each other it is believed by scholars that the main source of information was other narratives more so than real captivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papadopoulou|first=Nikoletta|date=2017|title=The narrative's 'general truth': Authenticity and the mediation of violence in Barbary captivity narratives.|url=|journal=European Journal of American Cuture|volume=36|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female captives were depicted as [[Gothic fiction]] characters clinging to the hope of freedom thus more relatable to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=White Slaves, African Masters|last=Baepler|first=Paul|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women slave narratives ==
Some well-known slave narratives by women slaves include the memoirs of Harriet A. Jacobs, Mary Prince, Mattie J. Jackson, and "old Elizabeth," among others. Some of these accounts were edited and published in the late 1800s by white authors seeking to raise white opposition to slavery.

In her narrative, Mary Prince, a Bermuda-born woman and slave discusses her deep connection with her master's wife and the pity she felt for the wife as she witnessed the "ill-treatment" the wife suffered at the hands of her husband.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Prince, Mary. ''The History of Mary Prince, a West Indian Slave: Related by Herself'', University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Library, 2017. ProQuest Ebook Central.&lt;/ref&gt; Prince also recounts her experience of becoming literate after being taught English by one of her mistresses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Literacy, however, was not a common theme for all slave women. The life story of "old Elizabeth" was transcribed from her oral account at the age of 97.&lt;ref&gt;Old Elizabeth (2006). ''Memoir of Old Elizabeth, A Coloured Woman''. Extract in [[Margaret Busby]], ''[[Daughters of Africa]]'', Jonathan Cape, 1992, pp. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women slave narratives, such as those of "old Elizabeth" and Mattie J. Jackson, reveal the importance of spirituality and relationships in the lives of women slaves. These narratives, many published and edited by white women, may represent early efforts of racial and feminist solidarity in the United States.

==Other historical slave narratives==
As slavery has been practised all over the world for millennia, some narratives cover places and times other than these main two. One example is the account given by [[John R. Jewitt]], an English [[armourer]] enslaved for years by [[Maquinna]] of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. The ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia]]'' calls his memoir a "classic of captivity literature"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;ArticleId=A0004133|title=Jewitt, John Rodgers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409132245/http://www.canadianencyclopedia.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;ArticleId=A0004133|archivedate=April 9, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a rich source of information about the [[indigenous people]] of [[Vancouver Island]].
*''Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.''

Maria ter Meetelen (1704 in Amsterdam – fl. 1751), was a Dutch writer of an autobiography. Her biography is considered to be a valuable witness statement of the life of a former slave (1748).
* Maria ter Meetelen, ''The Curious and Amazing Adventures of Maria ter Meetelen; Twelve Years a Slave (1731- 43)'', Translated and Introduced by Caroline Stone. (Hardinge Simpole, 2010) [http://www.hardingesimpole.co.uk/series/travellers_in_the_wider_levant.htm].

==Contemporary slave narratives==
A contemporary slave narrative is a recent memoir written by a former slave, or [[ghost writer|ghost-written]] on their behalf. Modern areas of the world in which slavery occurs include the Sudan, and two narratives, ''Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity – and My Journey to Freedom in America'' (2003) by [[Francis Bok]] and Edward Tivnan, and ''Slave'' by [[Mende Nazer]] and Damien Lewis, derive from slavery experiences in the Sudan.

In his fictional novel [[The Underground Railroad (novel)]], National Book Award winner Colson Whitehead traces the escape of Cora, female slave on a cotton farm in Georgia through the [[Underground Railroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/964759268|title=The underground railroad : a novel|last=1969-|first=Whitehead, Colson,|isbn=9780385542364|oclc=964759268}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was well-received and said to possess "the chilling, matter-of-fact power of the slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers' Project in the 1930s, with echoes of Toni Morrison's [[Beloved (novel)]]" and can hence be considered as a modern-tale fictional slave narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/books/review-the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead.html|title=Review: 'Underground Railroad' Lays Bare Horrors of Slavery and Its Toxic Legacy|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=August 2, 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 7, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2016, filmmaker Michelle Williams launched a film series called "Another Slave Narrative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anotherslavenarrative.com/|title=Another Slave Narrative|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by an interview with a former slave, she decided to tell the stories of previously enslaved people in a series of short movies. A cast of 22 actors of mixed gender, race, and age, reads out individual slaves' interviews from the [[Slave Narrative Collection]] that includes more than 2,300 interviews conducted from 1936-38. Williams' aim is to document every single fate and hence approach the taboo of slavery, as well as to keep the memory of the slaves alive through these videos.

==Neo-slave narratives==
A neo-slave narrative — a term coined by [[Ishmael Reed]] while working on his 1976 novel ''Flight to Canada'' and used by him in a 1984 interview&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalkeyarchive.com/a-conversation-with-ishmael-reed-by-reginald-martin/ "A Conversation with Ishmael Reed By Reginald Martin"] (interview conducted July 1–7, 1983, in Emeryville, California), ''The Review of Contemporary Fiction'', Summer 1984, Vol. 4.2. At Dalkey Archive Press.&lt;/ref&gt; — is a modern fictional work set in the slavery era by contemporary authors or substantially concerned with depicting the experience or the effects of enslavement in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Ashraf H. A. Rushdy, "Neo-slave narrative", in William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster &amp; Trudier Harris (eds), ''Oxford Companion to African American Literature'', New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 533–535.&lt;/ref&gt; The works are largely classified as [[novel]]s, but may pertain to poetical works as well. The renaissance of the postmodern slave narratives in the 20th century was a means to deal retrospectively with slavery, and to give a fictional account of historical facts from the first-person perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushdy|first1=Ashraf H.A.|title=Neo-slave narratives: studies in the social logic of a literary form|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195125337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slow Design''' is a branch of the [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]], which began with the concept of [[Slow Food]], a term coined in contrast to ''fast food''. As with every branch of the Slow Movement, the overarching goal of Slow Design is to promote well being for individuals, society, and the natural environment. Slow Design seeks a holistic approach to designing that takes into consideration a wide range of material and social factors as well as the short and long term impacts of the design.

==Origin and meaning==
Slow Design refers to the goals and approach of the designer, rather than the object of the design.  In this way a Slow Design approach can be used within any [[design]] field.  The term was probably first coined by Alastair Fuad-Luke in his 2002 paper "'Slow Design' - a paradigm for living sustainably?", in which Slow Design is seen as the next step in the development of [[sustainable design]], balancing individual, socio-cultural, and environmental needs.&lt;ref name="FuadLuke2002"/&gt;

While Fuad-Luke focused on the design of physical products, the concept can be applied to the design of non-material things such as experiences, processes, services, and organizations. In fact, Slow Design may be seen as a path toward the [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] required for long-term sustainability as it takes into account the non-material nature of human well being and [[happiness]].

Beth Meredith and Eric Storm attempt to summarize the concept, stating: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Slow Design is a democratic and holistic design approach for creating appropriately tailored solutions for the long-term well being of people and the planet. To this end, Slow Design seeks out positive synergies between the elements in a system, celebrates diversity and regionalism, and cultivates meaningful relationships that add richness to life.&lt;ref name="MeredithStorm2010"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The editor and journalist [[Spencer Bailey]] has described Slow Design as “design that’s timeless and made to last, and done thoughtfully, with intent, and with care for our planet.”&lt;ref name="Spencer Bailey, editor, New York"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spencer Bailey, editor, New York”|url=http://www.slow-words.com/spencer-bailey-editor-new-york/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current and future practice ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}
Common qualities of Slow Design include:
* Holistic – taking into account as many relevant short and long term factors as possible.
* Sustainable – considering the [[Cradle to cradle design|cradle-to-cradle]] impacts and reducing harm as much as possible including the [[precautionary principle]].
* Elegant – finding the simplest and most concise solutions that provide the desired results.
* Tailored – creating specific solutions that fit a particular situation.
* Democratic – keeping the process and results accessible to those using and impacted by the design and to non-professionals.
* Adaptable – developing solutions that will continue to work over time or that can be modified as needed. 
* Durable – making sure solutions can be maintained over time while minimizing the need for repairs and replacement.
* Non-toxic – eliminating substances and processes that pollute or are toxic.
* Efficient – minimizing waste of time, labor, energy, and physical resources.
* Distinctive – promoting cultural, social, and environmental uniqueness and diversity.

Slow design is still a relatively new concept of design thinking, and its implications are yet to be fully developed and defined. It could evolve in the following ways:
* Longer design processes with more time for research, contemplation, real life impact tests, and fine tuning. 
* Design for manufacturing with local or regional materials and technologies or design that supports local industries, workshops, and craftspeople. 
* Design that takes into account local or regional culture both as a source of inspiration and as an important consideration for the design outcome. 
* Design that studies the concept of natural time cycles and incorporates them into design and manufacturing processes. 
* Design that looks at longer cycles of human behavior and sustainability.
* Design that takes into account deeper well being and the findings of [[positive psychology]].

'''Stephen Farthing''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (born 16 September 1950) is an English painter and writer on [[art history]].

==Education==
Stephen Farthing grew up in London and earned a bachelor's degree from [[Saint Martin's School of Art]] in 1973 and a master's degree in painting from the [[Royal College of Art]], London in 1976.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/academicians/painters/stephen-farthing-ra,175,AR.html |title=Stephen Farthing RA - Painters - Royal Academicians - Royal Academy of Arts |publisher=Royalacademy.org.uk |date=1950-09-16 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the final year of his master's program, Farthing won a scholarship to study at the [[British School in Rome]] for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.purdyhicks.com/artists/stephenfarthing/ |title=Purdy Hicks Artists Index |publisher=Purdyhicks.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Since his return from Italy in 1977, Farthing has had one-man shows in the UK, Brazil, Uruguay, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and the United States.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing's work featured in the 1989 [[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo Biennale]] and that same year he served as the Artist in Residence at the [[Hayward Gallery]] in London.  He also won prizes in the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition on eight separate occasions between 1976 and 1999.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;

Farthing was elected as a member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing's work is in the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)]] and he also showed at the [[Tate Britain]] in 2006 as part of a project called "Drawing from Turner," that he designed and curated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/drawingfromturner/ |title=Drawing from Turner |publisher=Tate |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farthing also painted large murals for the [[Cleveland Browns]] Football Club in Cleveland, Ohio (2004) and [[Aston Villa]] Football Club in Birmingham, UK (2008).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~1405273,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/marco.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193759/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/marco.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Farthing's teaching career began at [[Canterbury College of Art]] (1977–1979) where he was a lecturer of painting.  He went on to teach at the [[Royal College of Art]] (1980–1985) before becoming the Head of Painting and later the Head of Fine Art at [[West Surrey College of Art and Design]] (1985–1989).&lt;ref name="royalacademy1"/&gt;  Farthing spent the next ten years at [[Oxford University]] serving as the Ruskin Master at the [[Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art]].  He was also made a Professorial Fellow of Oxford's [[St Edmund Hall]] (1990–2000).  Upon leaving the university in 2000, Farthing was made a professor emeritus of St Edmund Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seh.ox.ac.uk/users/stephenfarthing |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Seh.ox.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing moved to New York in 2000 to become the Executive Director of the [[New York Academy of Art]] and led the Academy until he became the Rootstein Hopkins Research Chair of Drawing at the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2004, a position he held until 2017.&lt;ref name="chelsea.arts.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-staff/a-z/professor-stephen-farthing/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413150046/http://www.arts.ac.uk/research/research-staff/a-z/professor-stephen-farthing/ |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing has published extensively.  Most known for his authorship of ''1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die'' and ''501 Great Artists''.   He also authored the Intelligent Person's Guide to Modern Art, published in 2000 in addition to numerous academic essays and journal articles.&lt;ref name="chelsea.arts.ac.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/biblio.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208064936/http://stephenfarthing.com/biblio.htm |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Farthing continues to live and work in both the United Kingdom and the United States.

==Work==
[[File:Step9.gif|thumb|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''Louis XV Rigaud'' (1975), [[Walker Art Gallery]]]]''

Farthing described his work in a 2005 interview, saying "I have dined with the devil in terms of becoming a modern artist.  I have taken hold of history, tried to understand it—and then used and abused it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=196599&amp;sectioncode=26 |title=Draw the line at copying? Not him &amp;#124; General |publisher=Times Higher Education |date=2005-06-10 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's work reflects his education, personal experience and perspective on historical events that have captured his imagination.  After spending a period of study at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris while a student at the [[Royal College of Art]], Stephen Farthing inadvertently fell upon what one could later describe as a postmodernist relationship with history.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Paris, he painted an interpretation of [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]]'s portrait of [[Louis XV]] that as a student won him a prize at the John Moores Exhibition in Liverpool, today this painting stands as an early example of British post modernist painting.&lt;ref name="Stephen Farthing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |title='Louis XV Rigaud', Stephen Farthing - Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool museums |publisher=Liverpoolmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228131607/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/collections/20c/farthing.aspx |archivedate=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s whilst showing with Edward Totah in London, Farthing showed works that positioned Latin American vernacular culture within a modernist idiom and classicism within the vernacular.

During the 1990s, he reinvented history painting as a viable contemporary narrative taking on subject matters as diverse as the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], swagger portraiture, and the topographical mapping of cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |title=Stephen Farthing |publisher=Stephen Farthing |date= |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193821/http://www.stephenfarthing.com/writing/mcewan.htm |archivedate=2 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/122406/pro_122406079.shtml |title=Cleveland Browns owner getting his kicks from English football &amp;#124; Lubbock Online &amp;#124; Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |publisher=Lubbock Online |date=2006-12-24 |accessdate=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His most recent work makes explicit a theme that has consistently sat between Farthing and his audience, the "narrative" and "text".

[[File:MH.Trafalgar.2.20.06.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Hands of Fate. |''Hands of Fate'', ([[Battle of Trafalgar]])]]
[[File:GetAttachment-2.aspx.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Stephen Farthing.|''The Backstory: Boucher'' (2009)]]

Farthing commented that his work is, "not this thing about 'Oh, let's let the audience make up their mind what it is'…" but about "degrading it on purpose so it becomes not more ambiguous, but less what it was in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|title=Stephen Farthing : Marginally Out of Control|publisher=Lynnparr.co.uk|accessdate=2013-11-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193753/http://www.lynnparr.co.uk/articles/Farthing.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of 2009, Farthing had his first one-person show at the Purdy Hicks Gallery in London where, for the first time, he showed the "back-story" paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lerner,  "The Fourth Wall," in Stephen Farthing: The Fourth Wall, London: Purdy Hicks, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "back-story" paintings are a series of images painted with a text in reverse sitting on the picture plane between the audience and the image.  The text tells us what is going on not in the picture but behind it, so compromising and at the same time informing the image with  text.   His technically very skilled paintings  all seem to be grounded on one guiding principle  - that what we see will always be  always conditioned by what we know.

In November 2010, Farthing became the second living Royal Academician to be featured in the "laboratory" series of one man shows at the Royal Academy of Arts London. "The Back Story," featured an epic 30 foot painting of the Atlantic ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal Academy of Arts|title=Artists' Laboratory 02: Stephen Farthing RA, The Back Story|url=http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301044735/http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/artists-laboratory/artists-laboratory-02-stephen-farthing-ra-the-back-story,342,RAL.html|archivedate=1 March 2014|work=Press Release|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chelsea Space|title=Stephen Farthing's Ultra Marine Painting|url=http://www.chelseaspace.org/blog/archives/272|work=Atlantic Ocean|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farthing's  work  as a painter  sits midway between the conservative and the cutting edge  between a classical and radical painting.

'''''The Birds of America''''' is a book by [[natural history|naturalist]] and painter [[John James Audubon]], containing illustrations of a wide variety of [[List of birds of the United States|birds of the United States]]. It was first published as a series in sections between 1827 and 1838, in [[Edinburgh]] and London. Not all of the specimens collected in the work were collected by Audubon himself, some were sent to him by [[John Kirk Townsend]] who had collected them on [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]]'s 1834 expedition with [[Thomas Nuttall]].&lt;ref&gt; Mearns, B. &amp; R. ''John Kirk Townsend: Collector of Audubon’s Western Birds and Mammals'' (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Narrative of a Journey Across the Rocky Mountains to the Columbia River' by John Kirk Townsend &lt;/ref&gt; 

The work consists of 435 hand-coloured, life-size [[Printmaking|prints]], made from [[engraving|engraved]] plates, measuring around {{convert|39|by|26|in|cm}}. It includes images of six now-[[Extinction|extinc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;t birds:  [[Carolina parakeet]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[Labrador duck]], [[great auk]], [[Eskimo curlew]], and [[Heath hen|pinnated grouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web4.audubon.org/bird/boa/ExtinctBirds.html|title=Birds Extincted since Audubon's time|first=National Audubon|last=Society|website=web4.audubon.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historians describe the quality of Audubon's work as being of high and printed with "artistic finesse."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The plant-life backgrounds of some 50 of the bird studies were painted by Audubon's assistant [[Joseph Mason (artist)|Joseph Mason]] but he is not credited for his work in the book.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, DeVere.

==Early publication history==
[[File:1 Wild Turkey.jpg|thumbnail|left|Plate 1 by [[John James Audubon]] depicting a wild turkey, ([[Wild turkey|''Meleagris gallopavo'']]).]]
About 1820, around the age of 35, Audubon declared his intention to paint every bird in North America.&lt;ref name="NYT2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/arts/antiques-central-park-s-winged-tenants-by-audubon.html|title=Central Park's Winged Tenants, By Audubon|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In his bird art, he mainly forsook oil paint, the medium of serious artists of the day, in favour of [[watercolours]] and pastel crayons (and occasionally pencil, charcoal, chalk, [[gouache]], and pen and ink). As early as 1807, he developed a method of using wires and threads to hold dead birds in lifelike poses while he drew them.&lt;ref name="NYT2003"/&gt;
[[File:AudubonCarolinaParakeet2.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Audubon Carolina parakeet ([[Carolina Parakeet|''Conuropsis carolinensis'']])&lt;br/&gt;now extinct]]
In 1823, Audubon went to [[Philadelphia]] and New York, looking for financial support using [[Subscription business model|subscription]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to enable him to publish his artwork. He sold the copper engraving plates through on a subscription basis in North America and Europe. Those subscribed obtained five plates at a time. Each subscriber received prints of three smaller birds, a larger bird and a mid-sized bird. The prints were produced from 1827 to 1838 that cost each subscriber around $1,000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This is equivalent to $24,600 in 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.in2013dollars.com/1838-dollars-in-2015|title=1838 dollars in 2015 {{!}} Inflation Calculator|website=www.in2013dollars.com|language=en|access-date=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that no more than 120 complete sets exist today. Each set consists of 435 individual plates that are based upon the original paintings. Each plate was engraved, printed, and hand colored by Robert Havell of London. While William Lizars, of Edinburgh, engraved the first ten plates, Havell actually finished some of those.

Audubon often found support lacking.&lt;ref name="NYT2003" /&gt; As a result, in 1826, he set sail for the United Kingdom with 250 of his original illustrations, looking for the financial support of subscribers and the technical abilities of [[Engraving|engraver]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and printers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.uk/exhibitions/audubon/influence#lizars|title=Audubon and men of influence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After exhibiting his drawings in [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], he journeyed to Edinburgh, where he met the accomplished engraver [[William H. Lizars]]. Lizars engraved up to ten of the first plates but was unable to continue the project when his colourists went on strike.&lt;ref name="loccat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Liverpool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/artgall/audubon/birds_of_america.htm|title=Victoria Gallery &amp; Museum|publisher=University of Liverpool|work=liv.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1827, Audubon engaged the noted London animal engraver [[Havell family|Robert Havell Jr.]], and his father, [[Havell family|Robert Havell Sr]]. Havell Jr. oversaw the project through to its completion in 1838.&lt;ref name="Liverpool" /&gt;

The original edition of ''The Birds of America'' (sometimes called the Havell Edition&lt;ref name="minnies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minniesland.com/study_Havell_Edition.html|title=Original Audubon Prints - Antique Natural History Prints - Books - Havell - Bien - Imperial Folio - Bird and Animal Prints|work=minniesland.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619135214/http://www.minniesland.com/study_Havell_Edition.html|archivedate=19 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; after its printer, and sometimes called the [[Book size|"Double Elephant Folio"]], because of its size) was printed on handmade paper 39.5 inches tall by 28.5 inches wide. The principal printing technique was [[intaglio printing|copperplate]] etching, but engraving and [[aquatint]] were also used.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt; Colorists applied each color in assembly-line fashion (over fifty were hired for the work).&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, 2004, pp. 273, 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audubon funded the costly printing project through a pay-as-you-go subscription. From 1826 to 1829, he travelled around the UK and to Paris, lecturing on ornithology and frontier American life&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; in an effort to entice wealthy patrons to subscribe to the series of prints. Subscribers included the French king [[Charles X]], the British queen [[Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen]], [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]], and, later, the Americans [[Daniel Webster]] and [[Henry Clay]].&lt;ref name="NYT2000"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/03/books/antiques-rarae-aves-audubon-at-auction.html|title=Rarae Aves: Audubon At Auction|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prints were issued in sets of five every month or two in tin cases&lt;ref name="NYT2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/arts/antiques-vibrant-birds-of-america-via-germany.html|title=Vibrant Birds Of America, Via Germany|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each set usually included one very large bird, one medium-sized bird, and three small birds.&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; The plates were published unbound and without any text to avoid having to furnish free copies to the public libraries in England.&lt;ref name="loccat"/&gt; It is estimated that not more than 200 complete sets were ever compiled.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT2000"/&gt; An accompanying text, issued separately, was written by Audubon and the Scottish naturalist and ornithologist [[William MacGillivray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/biographies/william-macgillivray/|title=William MacGillivray|work=nhm.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in five volumes in [[Edinburgh]] between 1831 and 1839, under the title ''Ornithological Biography, or, An account of the habits of the birds of the United States of America''.&lt;ref name="loccat"/&gt; The additional cost of the five volumes of text brought the total cost of plates and text to about $1000.&lt;ref name="minnies"/&gt;

After the folio edition was completed, Audubon decided to produce a more affordable edition and employed a lithographer from Philadelphia named J. T. Bowen. Bowen and his team created a smaller [[Octavo#Size|Royal Octavo]] edition, which was issued to subscribers in seven volumes and completed in 1844 after selling 1,199 sets.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Five more octavo editions were completed through 1877. The octavo edition used the text of the Ornithological biography but increased the number of plates to 500, separating some birds which had originally appeared together. Some new drawings were included, mostly by John Woodhouse though Audubon and members of Bowen's team also contributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audubonhouse.org/audubon/octavo/bowen.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703042004/http://www.audubonhouse.org/audubon/octavo/bowen.cfm |archivedate=3 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abirdshome.com/Audubon/VolI/00000.html|title=The Registry Of Nature Habitats - Audubon Birds of America - Publisher's Preface|work=abirdshome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bien Edition (after [[chromolithography]] pioneer Julius Bien), was a full-sized reissue published in 1858 by Roe Lockwood in New York under the supervision of Audubon's youngest son, John Woodhouse Audubon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Ron|title=The Bien Edition / The Project, Quality, Errors and Market Value|url=http://www.auduboninfo.net/articles/BIEN%20ESSAY.htm|accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to the Civil War, the edition was never finished; only 15 parts of the 44 part series were completed. This edition consisted of 105 plates and included none of the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audubongalleries.com/guide/guide.php |title=Audubon Galleries Original Audubon Books and Prints |publisher=Audubongalleries.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than 100 subscriptions were sold, making this edition rarer than other early editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Flynn |url=http://www.auduboninfo.net/articles/audubon_story.htm |title=About Audubon and His Octavo Edition Prints |publisher=Auduboninfo.net |date= |accessdate=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audubon's practice of obtaining his subjects has been described as:“Audubon used what we like to call today as the barrel-of-the-shotgun method...After he killed the birds, he would use a complex system of wires and strings to position the birds. Previous artists would draw the birds in a stiff position, but Audubon was different. He drew the birds in dynamic ways, by positioning them how he would observe them in the field.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A full 8-volume, double-elephant folio version is on public display in the Audubon Room at the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library at the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]]. This, the first book purchased by the University, was bought in 1839 for $970 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|970|1839|r=-4}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}), at the time an amazing sum.

Since 1992, the [[Louisiana State University]] Libraries have hosted "Audubon Day," a semi-annual public showing of all four volumes of LSU's copy of the ''Birds of America.'' The set formerly belonged to one of the original subscribers, the [[Hugh Percy, 3rd Duke of Northumberland|Duke of Northumberland]], and was purchased with a grant from the Crown Zellerbach Corporation in 1964. In recent years, the event has drawn more than 200 visitors. It was profiled in a 2011 ''[[Wall Street Journal]] ''article titled "The Joys of Slow Looking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703421204576327750299277440|title=Birds of America by John James Audubon at Hill Memorial Library at Louisiana State University-The Joys of Slow Looking|work=Wall Street Journal|author=Willard Spiegelman|date=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[University of Pittsburgh]], which owns a complete collection of ''Birds of America'' that had been recently restored and preserved by the Etherington Conservation Center, mounted a major exhibition of 62 selected plates and other materials in its [[Frick Fine Arts Building#University Art Gallery|University Art Gallery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">'''The Book Collector''' is a [[London]] based journal that deals with all aspects of the book.

It is published quarterly and exists in both paper and digital form. It prints independent opinions on subjects ranging from typography to national heritage policy, from medieval libraries to modern first editions. It has run series on Unfamiliar Libraries, Literary and Scientific Autographs, Author Societies, Contemporary Collectors and many other subjects.

== History ==
An earlier series that preceded the Book Collector, was the ''Book Handbook''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Horrox, Reginald, (ed.) | title=Book handbook : an illustrated guide to old and rare books | publication-date=1951 | publisher=Berks | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13274412 | accessdate=23 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Book Collector'' was launched by the novelist [[Ian Fleming]] in the same year, 1952, that he wrote the first [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=British Library | title=The pleasures of Bibliophily: Fifty Years of The book Collector: An Anthology | publication-date=2003 | publisher=British Library ; New Castle, Del. : Oak Knoll Press | isbn=978-1-58456-097-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal has had only four editors since it was founded. After the death in 1965 of John Hayward, the friend and muse of [[T.S. Eliot]], it was edited for fifty years by [[Nicolas Barker]], sometime publisher and first head of conservation at the [[British Library]]. In 2015 he stepped down and James Fergusson, founding obituaries editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', 1986-2007, took his place.

Essays about book collecting by Geoffrey Keynes in the Book Collector has been published in a compilation volume. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Keynes, Geoffrey Sir, 1887-1982| title=To Geoffrey Keynes: articles contributed to "The Book Collector" to commemorate his eighty-fifth birthday|publication-date=1972|work=The Book Collector|isbn=978-0-903482-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
''The Book Collector'' publishes four times a year in March, June, September and December. Each issue consists of 192pp and is sent to subscribers by airmail, where appropriate. Subscribers also have digital access to every issue of ''The Book Collector'', as printed, since its first appearance in 1952 and to its predecessor ''Book Handbook'', which was published in twenty-eight numbers between 1947 and 1951.

'''''The Scapegoat''''' (1854–56) is a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]] which depicts the "[[scapegoat]]" described in the [[Book of Leviticus]]. On the [[Day of Atonement]], a goat would have its horns wrapped with a red cloth – representing the sins of the community – and be driven off.

Hunt started painting on the shore of the [[Dead Sea]], and continued it in his studio in London. The work exists in two versions, a small version in brighter colours with a dark-haired goat and a rainbow, in [[Manchester Art Gallery]], and a larger version in more muted tones with a light-haired goat in the [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]] in [[Port Sunlight]]. Both were created over the same period, with the smaller Manchester version being described as "preliminary" to the larger Lady Lever version, which was the one exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=379 ''The Scapegoat''], Lady Lever Art Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition catalogue Hunt wrote that "the scene was painted at [[Jabal Usdum|Oosdoom]], on the margin of the salt-encrusted shallows of the [[Dead Sea]]. The mountains beyond are those of [[Edom]]."&lt;ref name = "bron"&gt;Bronkhurst, Judith, ''Wiliam Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol. 1, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted most of the work on location in 1854, but completed the work in London in the following year, adding some touches in 1856 before it was exhibited at the academy in that year.&lt;ref name = "bron"/&gt;

The painting was the only major work completed by Hunt during his first trip to the Holy Land, to which he had travelled after a crisis of religious faith. Hunt intended to experience the actual locations of the Biblical narratives as a means to confront the relationship between faith and truth. While in [[Jerusalem]], Hunt had met [[Henry Wentworth Monk]], a [[millenarianism|millenarian]] prophet who had distinctive theories about the meaning of the scapegoat and the proximity of the [[Last Judgement]]. Monk was particularly preoccupied with [[Christian Zionism]].

Hunt chose a subject derived from the [[Torah]] as part of a project to convert Jews to Christianity. He believed that Judaic views of the scapegoat were consistent with the Christian conception of the Messiah as a suffering figure. He wrote to his friend [[John Everett Millais|Millais]], "I am sanguine that [the Scapegoat] may be a means of leading any reflecting Jew to see a reference to the Messiah as he was, and not as they understand, a temporal King."&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, G.H.,'' John Everett Millais: A Biography'', 1998, Constable, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Leviticus]] describes a "scapegoat" which must be ritually expelled from the flocks of the Israelite tribes as part of a sacrificial ritual of cleansing. In line with traditional Christian theology, Hunt believed that the scapegoat was a prototype for the redemptive sacrifice of Jesus, and that the goat represented that aspect of the [[Messiah]] described in [[Isaiah]] as a "suffering servant" of God. Hunt had the picture framed with the quotations "Surely he hath borne our Griefs and carried our Sorrows; Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of GOD and afflicted." ([[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 53:4) and "And the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a Land not inhabited." ([[Leviticus]] 16:22)

==Critical reception==

The reaction to the painting was not as Hunt expected. In his autobiography ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'', Hunt relates the first reaction to the painting by art dealer [[Ernest Gambart]]:
{{quote|Gambart, the picture-dealer, was ever shrewd and entertaining. He came in his turn to my studio, and I led him to ''The Scapegoat''. "What do you call that?"&lt;br/&gt;"''The Scapegoat''."&lt;br/&gt;"Yes; but what is it doing?"&lt;br/&gt;"You will understand by the title, ''Le bouc expiatoire''."&lt;br/&gt;"But why ''expiatoire''?" he asked.&lt;br/&gt;"Well, there is a book called the Bible, which gives an account of the animal. You will remember."&lt;br/&gt;"No," he replied, "I never heard of it."&lt;br/&gt;"Ah, I forgot, the book is not known in France, but English people read it more or less," I said, "and they would all understand the story of the beast being driven into the wilderness."&lt;br/&gt;"You are mistaken. No one would know anything about it, and if I bought the picture it would be left on my hands. Now, we will see," replied the dealer. "My wife is an English lady, there is a friend of hers, an English girl, in the carriage with her, we will ask them up, you shall tell them the title; we will see. Do not say more."&lt;br/&gt;The ladies were conducted into the room. "Oh how pretty! what is it?" they asked.&lt;br/&gt;"It is ''The Scapegoat''." I said.&lt;br/&gt;There was a pause. "Oh yes," they commented to one another, "it is a peculiar goat, you can see by the ears, they droop so."&lt;br/&gt;The dealer then, nodding with a smile towards me, said to them, "It is in the wilderness."&lt;br/&gt;The ladies: "Is that the wilderness now? Are you intending to introduce any others of the flock?" And so the dealer was proved to be right, and I had over-counted on the picture's intelligibility.|William Holman Hunt, loc cit.&lt;ref name=Hunt1906 /&gt; }}
[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], in a letter to [[William Allingham]] in 1856, called the painting "a grand thing, but not for the public". [[Ford Madox Brown]] wrote in his diary: "Hunt's ''Scapegoat'' requires to be seen to be believed in. Only then can it be understood how, by the might of genius, out of an old goat, and some saline encrustations, can be made one of the most tragic and impressive works in the annals of art.". Ernest Gambart, as related by Hunt, was less enthusiastic, and was later to remark: "I wanted a nice religious picture and he painted me a great goat."&lt;ref name=Rossetti1856 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cook1905 /&gt;  ''[[The Art Journal]]'' in 1860, at the time of the exhibition of Hunt's later work ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'', was to characterise the painting as "having disappointed even his warmest admirers".&lt;ref name=AJ1860 /&gt;

At the time of the exhibition of ''The Scapegoat'' itself, in 1856, ''The Art Journal'' questioned Hunt's eye for colour in the painting, casting doubt that the mountains of [[Edom]], seen in the background, really were in actual appearance as painted – which Matthew Dennison, writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2008 described the Manchester version as "Day-Glo striations of lilac, crimson and egg-yolk yellow". Dennison suggests the possibility that Hunt was painting the scene from memory, when he was finishing the painting in London after he had returned from his trip to the Dead Sea, and mis-remembered it.&lt;ref name=Dennison2008 /&gt; Hunt's own description of the landscape that he painted is that "never was so extraordinary a scene of beautifully arranged horrible wilderness. It is black, full of asphalte scum and in the hand slimy, and smarting as a sting – No one can stand and say that it is not accursed of God."&lt;ref name=Dennison2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fuller1989 /&gt; Art critic [[Peter Fuller]], in 1989, described the landscape of the painting as "a terrible image &amp;#91;&amp;hellip;&amp;#93; of the world as a god-forsaken wasteland, a heap of broken images where the sun beats".&lt;ref name=Fuller1989 /&gt;

==Synopsis==

[[File:Heinrich Vogeler - Illustration Die sechs Schwäne.jpg|thumb|Illustration by [[Heinrich Vogeler]]]]

A King gets lost in a forest, and an old woman helps him, on the condition that he marry her beautiful daughter. The King has a bad feeling about this but accepts anyway. He has six sons and a daughter from his first marriage, however, and fears that the children will be targeted by his new wife; so he sends them away and visits them in secret. 

The new queen and now [[stepmother]], who has learned witchcraft from her mother, finds out about her stepchildren and decides to get them out of her way. She sews six magical shirts and goes to the hidden castle where the children are hidden for safety, then tosses the shirts over the boys and transforms them into [[swan]]s. 

The brothers can only take their human forms for fifteen minutes every evening. They tell their still human younger sister that they've heard of a way to break such curses: she must make six shirts out of [[nettle]]s and can't make a sound for six years or the spell will never be broken. The girl agrees to do this and runs away, hiding in a hunter's hut and dedicating herself solely to gathering the nettles and sewing in silence.

Years later, the King of another country finds the girl doing this, is taken by her beauty, and takes her into the court with the intention of making her his queen. However, the King's snobbish mother hates her and does not consider her fit to be a Queen. When she gives birth to their first child, the wicked mother-in-law takes away the child and accuses the queen of killing and eating him, but the King refuses to believe it. 

The young Queen gives birth to two other children, but twice again the mother-in-law hides them away and falsely claims that she has killed and eaten her babies. The King is unable to keep protecting her, and unable to properly defend herself, the queen is sentenced to be [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] as a witch. All this time, she has held back her tears and her words, sewing and sewing the nettle shirts no matter what.

On the day of her execution, the Queen has all but finished making the shirts for her brothers. Only the last shirt misses a left arm. When she is brought to the stake she takes the shirts with her and when she is about to be burned, the seven years expire and the six swans come flying through the air. She throws the shirts over her brothers and they regain their human form, though the youngest prince's left arm remains a wing due to the missing sleeve. 

The queen is now free to speak, and she can defend herself against the accusations. She does so with the support of her brothers. In the end, the evil mother-in-law is the one who is burned at the stake as punishment.

==Adaptations==
* ''[[Daughter of the Forest]]'', the first book of the [[Sevenwaters trilogy]] by [[Juliet Marillier]], is a detailed retelling of this story in a medieval [[Celts|Celtic]] setting. A young woman named Sorcha must sew six shirts from a painful nettle plant in order to save her brothers (Liam, Diarmuid, Cormack, Connor, Finbar and Padriac) from the witch Lady Oonagh's enchantment, remaining completely mute until the task is finished. Falling in love with a British lord, Hugh of Harrowfield alias "Red", complicates her mission.

* An episode from the anime series ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |title=新グリム名作劇場 第10話 六羽の白鳥 &amp;#124; アニメ &amp;#124; 動画はShowTime (ショウタイム) |website=Web.archive.org |date=2013-06-22 |accessdate=2016-06-05 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622031028/http://www.showtime.jp/app/detail/contents/l15vid200206901088352/ |archivedate=June 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Mitsuko Horie]] as the Princess (here named Elise), [[Toshiko Fujita]] as the witch, [[Hideyuki Hori]] as the prince, [[Ishizuka Unsho]] as the king, and [[Koichi Yamadera]], [[Taku Takemura]], [[Masami Kikuchi]], and Keiichi Naniwa as the brothers. This plot differs in some parts from the Grimm's version, especially in the second part of the story. In the anime, the evil stepmother-queen kills her husband and puts a spell on his children to gain total control of the kingdom like in the original, but later she takes up the role of the Princess/Queen's evil mother-in-law and leaves Elise's baby son (her only child) in the forest. The swan-brothers find their nephew the forest and keep him alive, plus they're stuck in their swan forms all day/night long (though they still can speak) until their sister breaks the curse and they give her the baby back. Elise finishes the garments in time, therefore the youngest is not left with a swan wing in the end. When the wicked stepmother is exposed as the witch ''and'' as the one who framed Elise at the end, she uses her magic in an attempt to escape but then accidentally catches fire from Elise's pyre and burns to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPtShfBadw |title=GFTC - The Six Swans |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-05-28 |accessdate=2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Paul Weiland]]'s episode "The Three Ravens" of [[Jim Henson]]'s television series ''[[The Storyteller]]'' is another retelling of this classic tale. After the queen dies, an evil witch ensnares the king and turn his three sons into [[raven]]s. The princess escapes and must stay silent for three years, three months, three weeks and three days to break the spell. But after she meets a handsome prince, this is suddenly not so easy, for her stepmother has killed her father and remarried - to the prince's father. But when the witch attempts to burn the princess at the stake, the ravens attack her and she accidentally sets fire to herself instead, instantly turning into ashes. Her death almost fully reverses the spell, but the princess breaks her silence three minutes too soon, and her youngest brother subsequently keeps one wing forever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/me3/muppets/Story_ThreeRavens.html |title=The Storyteller Presents The Three Ravens |website=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The novel ''Birdwing'' by Rafe Martin follows the youngest prince, human but with a wing instead of his left arm, as he grows up with this "deformity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafemartin.com/bk_birdwing.html |title=Rafe Martin-Birdwing |website=Rafemartin.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Moonlight'' features a thirteen-year-old princess named Aowyn who loses her mother to a mysterious illness, and is charged with protecting her father and her six brothers from the conniving of a witch bent on taking the throne. This retelling is written by Ann Hunter and set on the Summer Isle, an alternate Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann Hunter |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620664-moonlight |title=Moonlight by Ann Hunter — Reviews, Discussion, Bookclubs, Lists |website=Goodreads.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom argues against what he calls the "[[School of Resentment]]", which includes [[feminist literary criticism]], [[Marxist literary criticism]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanians]], [[New Historicism]], [[Deconstruction]]ists, and [[Semiotics|semioticians]]. ''The Western Canon'' includes four appendices listing works that Bloom at the time considered canonical, stretching from earliest scriptures to [[Tony Kushner|Tony Kushner's]] ''[[Angels in America]]''. Bloom would later disown the list, saying that it was written at his editor's insistence and distracted from the book's intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Pearson|title=Harold Bloom [Interview]|url=https://www.vice.com/read/harold-bloom-431-v15n12|publisher=Vice Magazine|accessdate=29 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reception==
Norman Fruman wrote that "''The Western Canon'' is a heroically brave, formidably learned and often unbearably sad response to the present state of the humanities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Norma|last=Fruman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/specials/bloom-canon.html|title=Bloom at Thermopylae| newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist [[A. S. Byatt]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;Bloom's canon is in many ways mine. It consists of those writers all other writers have to know and by whom they measure themselves. A culture's canon is an evolving consensus of individual canons. Canonical writers changed the medium, the language they were working in. People who merely describe what is happening now don't last. Mine includes writers I don't necessarily like. [[D.H. Lawrence]], though I hate him in a way, [[Jane Austen]], too.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Tim; Guttridge, Peter. "Reloading the ancient canon". ''The Independent'' (London). 21 November 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4996">'''Tile art''' is a small arrangement of tiles, or in some cases a single tile, with a painted pattern or image on top. It is often used as an umbrella term that includes other forms of tile-based art, such as [[mosaic]]s, [[micromosaic]]s, and [[stained glass]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Unlike mosaics, tile art can include larger pieces of tiles that are pre-decorated. While mosaics use pieces of [[tessera]]e or another material to construct a pattern from small components, other methods, such as [[engraving]], [[carving]], and [[Molding (decorative)|molding]] may be used in tile art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsongtiles.com/making_tiles.html|title=Making Tiles|last=Gresham|first=Shannon|website=earthsongtiles.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mosaics (art)|journal=Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art|date=2008|pages=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mosaics are considered a type of tile art, there are many other forms that are also considered tile art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313918.001.0001/acref-9780195313918|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780195373417|location=|pages=Art 674|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195313918.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of tile art ==
Many types of art can be considered tile art. Different types of tile art have different features and can be created in different mediums, such as ceramic, porcelain, glass tiles, and other tiled mediums.

Listed below are some of the different types of artwork considered tile art:
* Mosaics
* Ceramic tiles
* Stained glass
* Carved tiles
* Photo tiles
* Tile [[mural]]s
* Engraving on a tile

== Modern tile art ==

=== Design ===
Many modern tile art designs are based on abstract and pattern-based designs. These are non-representational, unlike than older tile art formats, such as mosaics, which were often portraits or other representational forms of artwork.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/mosaic-vs-tile-art-everything-you-need-to-know/|title=Mosaic vs. Tile Art: Everything You Need to Know|website=Mozaico Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design on a piece of tile art may be used as decoration, but may also represent an idea, philosophy or pose a historical, religious or social significance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casey|first1=M.F|date=June 2008|title=The Fourteenth-Century Tring Tiles: A Fresh Look at Their Origin and the Hebraic Aspects of the Child Jesus' Actions|url=https://digital.kenyon.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1176&amp;context=perejournal|journal=Peregrinations|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of such non-representational art is a set of tiles integrated into an interior or exterior design. The design of the tile art is often based on the theme of the surrounding design. As tiles are built into the surrounding, they can be installed seamlessly integrated into the surrounding area.

=== Usage ===
Modern tile art serves many purposes. The general definition of tile art includes many mediums and many different designs achieved by various techniques and media. For example, tile art may be used to decorate one's home, but must also be practical as a wall or flooring element, as the tiles in an interior design could be replaced by tile art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.voegenstift.nl/|title=Voegen schoonmaken? Koop Voegenstift|last=David hanks|first=|date=|website=Voegenstift.nl|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tile art can also be used in the garden to compliment the colors in the plants and foliage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthsongtiles.com/plant_and_flower_tiles.html|title=plant and flower tiles|website=earthsongtiles.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using modern printing technology, images can be digitally printed onto a set of tiles or a tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crunchybetty.com/diy-picture-tiles-you-will-never-buy-a-photo-frame-again|title=DIY Picture Tiles - You Will Never Buy a Photo Frame Again  {{!}}|website=www.crunchybetty.com|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be used in lieu of hanging paintings or using wallpaper.

== Creation technique ==
The many different types of tile artwork mean that there are many different methods of creating a piece of tile artwork. 
* Engraving
* Carving
* [[Painting]]
* Molding
* [[Printing]]
* Trimming
* Tile staining

{{GreekWarfareArt}}
Warfare was a common occurrence in Greece from the [[Neolithic Greece|Neolithic Period]] through its conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] and until its conquest by the [[Roman Empire]]. Because of this, warfare was a typical theme in many pieces of [[ancient Greek art]]. Many works of art, like the [[Doryphoros]] or the [[chryselephantine]] statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], used military objects in their composition, and many others, like the [[Chigi vase]], had warfare as their main subject. Ancient Greek art is an important aspect of not just the history of art, but the history of warfare as well, due to its frequent spot on many works of ancient Greek art. As each different period in Greek history occurred, more and more types of art formed, as well as differing depictions of warfare.

== Bronze Age ==
In [[Minoan art]], warfare is not explicitly shown, but rather different interpretations were made that could tie into warfare. For example, [[bull leaping]] was an activity Minoan men did and the struggle between man and bull could be a depiction of warfare.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molloy|first=Barry|date=2012|title=Martial Minoans? War As Social Process, Practice and Event in Bronze Age Crete|jstor=41721880|journal=The Annual of the British School at Athens|volume=107|pages=87–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaic period ==

[[File:Attica, cratere di euphronios, 500-470 ac. ca. 02.JPG|thumb|left|The Arezzo 1465 Vase]]
During the Archaic Period, depictions of warfare in Greek Art held importance in status markings, and also provide insight as to the trading markets during this era. For example, the Arezzo 1465 vase, an Attic volute krater attributed to Euphronios in the Late Archaic Era, depicts an amazonomachy, and was found in the Etruria region, indicating the expanse of the trade networks. Warfare as a status symbol further solidifies a reasoning behind this trade, since any art with warfare depictions on it thereby becomes a sort of luxury item sought after by those wishing to elevate their own status because aspects and physical areas of Greek society tended to extol military prestige and virtue. .Proving oneself in battle distinguished one from the others and brought glory(klèos) to their families;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gwar/hd_gwar.htm|title=Warfare in Ancient Greece {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently owning any art depicting warfare displayed one's wealth and elite status.
 
[[File:Detail from the Chigi-vase.jpg|thumb|Hoplite Warfare on the Chigi Vase]]
During the Archaic period many artists began to depict the hoplite formation in art. Representations of the hoplite phalanx give historians a look into how the Greeks used this style of warfare in battle. Hoplites can be identified by their spear and their shield as well as their position next to other soldiers. One of the most popular representations of the hoplite phalanx is in the Chigi Vase. The hoplite formation is portrayed on many different types of pottery such as the Dinos, the Krater, and the Alabastron; and it many different styles such as black figure and white ground.

During the Archaic period there are pieces of artwork that depict the aulos player. One of the most prominent pieces show how the aulos player helped keep the hoplite soldiers in step by playing them into battle. With the help of the [[Aulos|aulete]], they were able to keep their shields close together to prevent the opposing phalanx from penetrating their ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit, Jeffrey M. “Reading the Chigi Vase.” ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens'', vol. 71, no. 1, 2002, pp. 1–22. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3182058.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Neer, at the temple of Hera "the Archaic votives are masculine and martial: helmets and 'smiting figurines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classical period ==

[[File:Terracotta calyx-krater (bowl for mixing wine and water) MET DP116942.jpg|thumb|Calyx-Krater by the Painter of the Berlin Hydra]]
The Classical Period involved many scenes relating and alluding to the Persian wars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ŞAHİN, Reyhan. 2017. "Representations of Mythological War Scenes n Attic Figure Pottery and Approaches in Research." ''Social Sciences Review Of The Faculty Of Sciences &amp; Letters University Of Uludag / Fen Edebiyat Fakültesi Sosyal Bilimler Dergisi'' 19, no. 32: 259-285. ''Academic Search Complete'', EBSCO ''host'' (accessed November 28, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; This allusion can include some of the numerous depictions of mythical battle scenes such as amazonomachies, gigantomachies, and centauromachies during the period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Such themes and mythological scenes can be seen in depictions like the one on the [[Calyx-Krater by the painter of the Berlin Hydria depicting an Amazonomachy]], or the [[Gigantomachy by the Suessula Painter]].

The first quarter of the Classical Period involved a lot of warfare, including the Persian Wars. Many Greek cities were sacked by the Persians during the second Persian War, taking a toll on several city-states. Themistoclean Walls were built quickly following the Greek victory of the Second Persian Wars, using destroyed sculptures and buildings to construct them. These re-purposed stones used in the building of Themistoclean walls is known as spolia. The Classical Period was also a time of Athenian control over Greece, powerwise, but also military wise and Athenian pottery was the most popular and well-spread over Greece.

[[File:Hellenistic-mediaeval tower Achinos.jpg|thumb|left|Hellenistic tower from Achinos, Phthiotis]]

== Hellenistic Period ==
Aside from a build up of architecture, other aspects of Greek culture, such as grave markers, were also becoming monumental. A majority of sculpture during this period was more grand and celebrated triumph and the power of the Greeks as a whole community or civilization.

Additionally, military monuments dedicated to the gods continued to remain prominent in Hellenistic culture. One such monument is the [[Neorion at Samothrace]], a monumentalized ship dedication within the [[Samothrace temple complex|Sanctuary of the Great Gods]] at the Greek island of [[Samothrace]]. Such architectural monuments demonstrate the continued importance of religiosity in art regarding warfare, even in a sanctuary concerned with larger mystery cults unrelated to war. This is a continued theme reflected in threads from the depiction of myth in the Archaic and Classical Periods, to the bull-leaping of the Minoans in the Bronze Age, which is considered potentially both religious and militaristic in nature.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Troy-ancient-city-Turkey|title=Troy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander the Great rose to prominence by winning the war which saw the end of the Persian Empire.  Paintings and sculptures depicting battles and participants in the war were common in this period.

==History==

The building dates probably from the late 16th century.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  It was originally two houses that were later combined as an inn, and have since been converted back into two houses.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 93| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

It has basically a [[timber framing|timber-framed]] structure, part of which has been replaced in brick.  Its panels are plastered, and it is roofed in grey [[slate]].  The building is in two storeys, with two [[bay (architecture)|bays]] facing each street.  The lower storey is mainly in painted brick, with brackets supporting the [[jettying|jettied]] upper storey.  The side facing Lower Bridge Street contains three [[casement window]]s, and that facing Shipgate Street has two similar windows and a doorway.  The upper storey is timber-framed, with [[close studding]].  On the side facing Lower Bridge Street are two five-light [[mullion]]ed windows, above which are two blank [[gable]]s; that facing Shipgate Street has two two-light mullioned windows, above which are two gables, each containing a four-light mullioned window.  The rear of the building is clad in brick.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;
