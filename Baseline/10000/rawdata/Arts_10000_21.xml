'''Alicia Florrick''' ([[given name#Name at birth|née]] '''Cavanaugh''')  is the lead character of [[CBS]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Good Wife]]'' and is portrayed by [[Julianna Margulies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Good Wife - CBS.com|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_good_wife/about/|website=www.CBS.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good Wife Cast: Julianna Margulies|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_good_wife/cast/61115/?pg=1|website=www.CBS.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has received positive reviews for her performance, winning two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julianna Margulies|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/julianna-margulies#awards|website=www.emmys.com|publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alicia's storyline focuses on her romantic relationships, including the struggle between staying with or divorcing her unfaithful husband, Peter Florrick, or pursuing other relationships with other men, most notably Will Gardner. Other storylines include Alicia's transformation from "the victim" to "the victimizer", her dealing with the negative consequences of her actions, her devotion to her children among political turmoil, her obsession with power, and her growth in confidence.

==Character biography==

=== Background ===
Alicia Cavanaugh was born in 1967 to Veronica Cavanaugh ([[Stockard Channing]]) and an unknown father, from whom Veronica separated from prior to her first appearance in the series in [[The Good Wife (season 4)|Season 4]]. She is the older sister of Owen Cavanaugh ([[Dallas Roberts]]), whom she loves very much, having grown close during their parents' separation, despite his tendency to meddle in her personal life. Her mother, now going by the name of Veronica Loy, makes her first appearance in "A Defense of Marriage" during Season 4, where it is revealed that Alicia had become estranged from her mother due to her various remarriages following her separation from Alicia's father as well as her infidelity. Veronica never afforded Alicia a motherly connection, and her father was never given the opportunity to, leading Alicia to become emotionally withdrawn, a tendency she has demonstrated frequently throughout the series. Ironically, Alicia has engaged in several of the same practices as her mother that she disapproves of, including infidelity, various relationships, and estrangement from her children.

Alicia attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]], where she graduated at the top of her class in 1992, despite her tendency to sleep during lectures she didn’t find interesting. While attending, she met and befriended [[Will Gardner]] ([[Josh Charles]]), who graduated alongside her. During their time in law school, Will and Alicia had an unofficial relationship, but never evolved into a proper relationship due to their "bad timing". Following her graduation from Georgetown, she became a junior litigate at mid-sized Chicago law firm Crozier, Abrams &amp; Abbott, where she clocked the most billable hours of any associate. While working there, she meets Peter Florrick ([[Chris Noth]]), another lawyer with political ambitions, whom she marries a few years later and adopts the Florrick surname. Alicia doesn’t share Peter's political ambition, but accommodates his, resigning from Crozier, Abrams &amp; Abbott to become a political "good wife" where she acts as a political instrument during campaigns and fundraisers. For this role, she receives the moniker of "Saint Alicia", a label she initially finds irritating, but later comes to think of as humorous. The two eventually move to Highland Parks, an upscale neighborhood in the Chicago suburbs where she and Peter raise Zachary "Zach" Florrick ([[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]]), and Grace Florrick ([[Makenzie Vega]]). She befriends her neighbors, but quickly becomes ostracized following a highly publicized sex scandal concerning her husband, the incumbent State's Attorney for [[Cook County, Illinois]].

Months prior to the series, a political rival of Peter's, Glenn Childs ([[Titus Welliver]]), who had his sights set on Peter's job, leaks a sex tape of Peter and Amber Madison ([[Kim Shaw]]), a Chicago escort. The tape raises questions over whether Peter abused his office, with accusations of trading political favors for sexual services and material items being lobbied against him. The story first breaks on CNBC, and Alicia immediately shields her children from all news stations to shield them from the news. Peter resigns in order to avoid impeachment, but is ultimately convicted of charges of corruption, leading Alicia to believed that she, as well as her children, had become collateral damage in a political feud between Peter and Childs. Upon his resignation, Alicia slaps Peter for victimizing her and their children.

Having been out of the workforce for nearly a decade, and left with no income, Alicia assumes the role of breadwinner of the Florrick family. Her, Zach, and Grace move to a condo in inner Chicago while she searches for a new job, which she has trouble doing due to her family's damaged reputation. Eventually, she reconnects with Will, who is now a name partner at Chicago law firm Stern, Lockhart, &amp; Gardner. He offers her a job at his firm, which she accepts, but soon comes to learn that the position offered to her was already filled by a younger, [[Harvard]]-educated lawyer, Cary Agos ([[Matt Czuchry]]). Being a friend of Will's, him and another name partner, [[Diane Lockhart]] ([[Christine Baranski]]), organize an arrangement by which the two will compete for the job and, in six months, one will be laid off.

=== Work Life ===
Alicia is designated the role by Diane of being "the branch between the legal and political", using her husband, who then resides in a county prison, to solicit information on cases she is working, much to the displeasure of judges, who view this practice as unethical. She is shown to be a competent lawyer, which allows her to keep her job at Lockhart/Gardner, resulting in a vindictive Cary being laid off. As a consequence, Alicia becomes the target of attacks by Cary, now working under Glenn at the State's Attorney's office.

Lockhart/Gardner enters financial trouble in the fourth season, finding itself hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Will and Diane hire an accountant (Clark Hayden) to ensure the firm remains solvent, but he soon becomes overzealous in his efforts and over-invested in the firm's financial survival that he attempts to remove Will and Diane as name partner following their inability to repay debts to their shareholders in a timely manner. In an effort to quickly raise capital for their repayments, Will and Diane offer Alicia a partnership at the firm. Believing this to be a reward for her efforts and success, Alicia is overjoyed to become a partner, but becomes furious when she learned that this had only been an attempt to raise money, as a partnership had been offered to all fourth-year associates, including a newly rehired Cary.

Cary proposed that he and Alicia begin their own firm, and take the other fourth year associates, as well as one of the in-house investigators, with them. While initially rejecting this offer, she begins to grow sympathetic to this idea due to her contempt for other employees at Lockhart/Gardner. Beginning in season five, Alicia and Cary conspire to leave Lockhart/Gardner and poach several big-name clients for themselves. While downloading documents for ongoing cases they intend to continue litigating at Florrick/Agos, Diane discovers her plot, and informs Will, who confiscates her laptop and cellphone. Will promptly fires Alicia and Cary, as well as all others who have been attempting to poach Lockhart/Gardner clients.

Will, betrayed due to the generosity he extended to Alicia, becomes reinvigorated, and initiates an expansion of Lockhart/Gardner into the east and west coast. However, Alicia utilizes Peter, who had been released from prison and subsequently elected governor of Illinois, to continue poaching clients. In one instance, Peter threatens to apply sales tax to the Internet and Internet-based companies in a subtle warning to ChumHum (a spoof of [[Google]]) that, should they not hire Florrick/Agos as their civil litigator firm, he will hurt their business. However, following Will's death, Diane and Alicia and Cary reunite to form Florrick/Agos &amp; Lockhart.

Alicia returns to work at Lockhart, Agos, &amp; Lee following her withdrawal from the state's attorney race, and on her first day back, her former coworkers stall her in a room so that they may poach remaining clients that left the firm when Alicia resigned. When Alicia discovers this, she proposes starting a law firm with Finn Polmar ([[Matthew Goode]]), an unofficial significant other. These plans fall through when Finn leaves town, so Alicia, in search of employment, becomes a bond court lawyer. There, she meets and befriends Lucca Quinn ([[Cush Jumbo]]), a fellow bond court lawyer. The two begin their own law firm, but this is eventually dissolved when both of them are hired by Lockhart, Agos, &amp; Lee. Diane, over the objections of Cary, makes Alicia a name partner in a bid to make a female-led firm. Cary, after a feud with Diane over Alicia's position, resigns to become a guest lecturer at a local college, sick of office politics he has been embroiled in over the past three years. Diane and Alicia eventually remove David Lee ([[Zach Grenier]]) as a name partner, and the two become the name partners of a female-led law firm.

Alicia has made no appearances on ''The Good Fight'', but has been revealed to have resigned from Florrick &amp; Lockhart within a year after the firm's readjustment.

=== Politics ===
The name of the show is a reference to Alicia's position within Peter's life: the political good wife. Her role is solely to bolster Peter's political career, a job she continues to do following Peter's release from prison. However, while she tolerates the political spotlight, she refuses to let her children be exploited so the same purposes, which often leads to conflict between her and Eli Gold ([[Alan Cumming]]), Peter's campaign manager, who sees Zach and Grace as effective political props.

At the end of season five, Eli, now Peter's chief of staff, proposes she run for state's attorney of Cook County, the office her husband previously occupied. While initially rejecting this offer, Alicia acquiesces due to her objections regarding the incumbent states attorney's abuse of power. The incumbent eventually departs from the race, and Alicia, instead, runs opposed to Frank Prady ([[David Hyde Pierce]]), a television legal analyst. Initially, Alicia and Prady form an alliance in which they both agree not to resort to personal attacks. However, both renege of their promises when Prady criticizes Alicia's ethics and accuses her of being open to political favors for her past clients and when Alicia released an ad that accused Prady of being a closeted-Republican, as well as insinuating that he may be [[gay]]. Alicia is also seen lying to influential Cook County figures in order to secure their endorsements. These lies included denying knowledge that Lemond Bishop ([[Mike Colter]]), infamous drug kingpin and [[serial killer]], donated to her campaign, when she had already been made aware of the fact that Bishop had set up her PAC, as well as suggesting that Prady is gay to a [[homophobia|homophobic]] Democratic donor in order to acquire funds.

Alicia eventually wins the election, but is forced to resign by Mike Landau ([[Mike Pniewski]]), head of the Illinois Democratic Party. After reports of voter fraud surface, Landau reveals to Alicia that he rigged the voting machines in order to preserve the Democratic supermajority in the Illinois state legislature. However, in order to maintain the façade of a fair election, Landau forces Alicia to resign.

In the seventh season, Peter runs for president, in hopes of becoming [[Hillary Clinton]]’s vice president, in which Alicia continues to support him. However, Peter comes in third in the [[Iowa caucuses]], diminishing any hope of him being tapped for the nomination, signaling Alicia’s exit from politics.

=== Finale ===
The seventh season follows Peter’s prosecution, once again, for corruption, accused of destroying evidence to secure funds from a wealthy Democratic donor, whose son was on trial, during his tenure as state’s attorney. Alicia agrees not to forestall their divorce until after the trial as to not exude the notion that he may be guilty. However, Alicia intends to pursue a divorce if Peter is acquitted, but any such separation would be jeopardized should Peter be convicted.

Desperate to acquit Peter so she may divorce him in favor of pursuing her relationship with Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Alicia, Diane, and Lucca pursue the strategy of proving Peter had no reason to discard the evidence because the donor’s son wasn’t guilty. In doing so, Alicia brings Diane’s husband, Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a ballistics expert, to testify that the bullets likely didn’t come from the donor’s son’s gun. This testimony is immediately undercut by another ballistics expert named Holly. Alicia, seeking to refute this testimony, calls Kurt back to the stand, and pressures him to contradict this testimony. But when Kurt refuses, Lucca accuses (at Alicia's request) him of protecting Holly due to an affair they had while Kurt was married to Diane.

Diane, hurt and betrayed, blames Alicia for destroying her marriage. After attending Peter’s resignation, she confronts Alicia and, without saying anything, slaps Alicia and walks away. This scene was significant to writer Robert and Michelle King, who saw this as symbolizing Alicia’s transition from being the "victimized", having her life ruined by her unfaithful and corrupt husband, to the "victimizer" having destroyed Kurt and Diane's marriage so she may pursue her own relationship. In effect, by the finale, Alicia had become Peter.

== Reception ==
The characterization of Alicia has received critical acclaim, with many favorable comparisons being drawn between her, ''[[The Sopranos]]''{{'}} [[Tony Soprano]], ''[[Breaking Bad]]''{{'}}s [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], and ''[[Mad Men]]''{{'}}s [[Don Draper]]. Writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Joanna Robinson writes, "While Alicia took her final bow in an era when the ice zombies on ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and the sweaty zombies on ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' rule pop-culture, Alicia Florrick belongs to the time of Walter White, Don Draper, and the other stars of the golden age of the TV antihero." However, Robinson highlights the difference between Alicia and other anti-heroes, writing "Alicia ends up more callous than either Walter White (who at least went out apologizing to [[Skyler White|Skyler]] and saving [[Jesse Pinkman|Pinkman]]) or Don Draper (who, hey, bought the world a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]!). Alicia throws Diane right under the bus in a way that the Kings describe as 'collateral damage.' The most charitable interpretation we can come ups with is that at least Alicia was partially thinking of Grace as she did it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/good-wife-recap-series-finale-end|title=Why The Good Wife Creators Think That Finale Was a Tragedy|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 8, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margulies has received critical acclaim for her performance as Alicia Florrick. In his initial review of the series, Rob Owen of ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' praised Margulies' performance, calling the show "a terrific showcase for actress Julianna Margulies, who elevates the already-good material with her perceptive, open performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Owen|title=Verdict: 'Good Wife' best new drama bet of fall season|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv-radio/2009/09/22/Verdict-Good-Wife-best-new-drama-bet-of-fall-season/stories/200909220189|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also praised Margulies' performance, writing that "the excellence of Margulies' performance has rested in her refusal to make Alicia easy to understand, in keeping up a complicated wall and choosing those few moments in which to expose emotional cracks." And later compared her performance to those of [[James Gandolfini]] on ''[[The Sopranos]]'' or [[Bryan Cranston]] on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', writing that "Margulies' performance sometimes put Alicia in that Tony Soprano/Walter White/Don Draper category of cable anti-heroes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Fienberg|title=Critic's Notebook: 'The Good Wife' Leaves Behind an Imperfect, Admirable Legacy|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/critics-notebook-good-wife-leaves-891008 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 5, 2016|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accolades ===
For her performance, Margulies won a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award]], two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and a [[Television Critics Association Award]].

'''Anthropotechnic''' is a term used in [[art]], [[science]] and [[literature]] to denote something with aspects of both man and machine.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Charwat, Hans Jürgen: Lexikon der Mensch-Maschine-Kommunikation. Oldenbourg, 1994, {{ISBN|3-486-22618-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s such as [[Max Ernst]]'s "Oedipus Rex" are early examples of the use of this quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famous-painters.org/Max-Ernst/Oedipus-Rex.shtm |title=Oedipus Rex - Max Ernst Painting Gallery |publisher=Famous-painters.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, it is any field of science that attempts to make machines and automation more user-friendly. In sociology, it is used to describe the relationship between man and anything that is perceived as inflexible or inhumane such as slavery, religion or animals.

==Uses==
* In her book ''Education in Human Creative Existential Planning'', [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] uses the term Genetic Anthropotechnic as a means of ensuring that only the desired characters are inherited by future generations of human beings though the usage of genetics and hence, avoidance of the "fatalism" of inheritance.&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Education in Human Creative Existential Planning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sG8NuWEIuIC&amp;pg=PA24|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6301-5|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in her ''Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience '', she uses the term Anthropotechnic with reference to the ability of human being to turn animals from being dangerous to "human-friendly".&lt;ref name="Tymieniecka2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka|title=Phenomenology of Life from the Animal Soul to the Human Mind: In search of experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3l8yyvfH5AQC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=3 June 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5191-3|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In their book ''In Medias Res: Peter Sloterdijk's Spherological Poetics of Being'', Willem Schinkel uses the term Anthropotechnic to define cultural forms of automated mental and physical exercises that we humans exhibit in the face of ambiguous risk.&lt;ref name="SchinkelNoordegraaf-Eelens2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Willem Schinkel|author2=Liesbeth Noordegraaf-Eelens|title=In Medias Res: Peter Sloterdijk's Spherological Poetics of Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCHqEP1r4FcC&amp;pg=PA8|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=15 February 2012|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-8964-329-2|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In their paper ''Anthropotechnics in vehicle control - Dynamic systems control and guidance by man in light of anthropotechnics, treating approaches to man machine systems optimization'', Bernotat uses the term to describe methods of adapting machine to men.&lt;ref name="berno"&gt;{{cite journal | author= R- K.

* In her book ''Bronze and iron: old Latin poetry from its beginnings to 100 B.C.'', Janet Lembke uses the Anthropotechnic to describe the "monstrous" connection between machine and man, as compared to social and intimate connections.&lt;ref name="Lembke1973"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janet Lembke|title=Bronze and iron: old Latin poetry from its beginnings to 100 B.C.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg5sESEkOqAC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=26 February 2012|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02164-8|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his book ''Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau: interactive art research'', Gerfried Stocker uses the term with reference to Web 2.0 and Search engines and describes it as "a technique for the humanization of humans".&lt;ref name="StockerSommerer2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerfried Stocker|author2=Christa Sommerer|author3=Laurent Mignonneau|title=Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau: interactive art research|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmcaVRcvJoEC&amp;pg=PT17|accessdate=26 February 2012|date=4 October 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-99015-5|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:T'oros Roslin (Armenian, active 1256 - 1268) - Canon Table Page - Google Art Project (6915047).jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from the 13th century, drawn by [[Toros Roslin]]]]
'''Armenian [[illuminated manuscript]]s''' form a separate tradition, related to other forms of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Armenian art, but also to the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] tradition. The earliest surviving examples date from the [[Golden Age]] of Armenian art and literature in the 5th century.  Early [[Armenia]]n Illuminated manuscripts are remarkable for their festive designs to the [[Armenian culture]]; they make one feel the power of art and the universality of its language.&lt;ref&gt;Matenadaran Ms No. 10675 P 19a.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest Armenian miniaturist, [[Toros Roslin]], lived in the 13th century.

The [[Matenadaran]] Institute in [[Matenadaran|Yerevan]], has the largest collection of Armenian manuscripts, including the [[Mugni Gospels]] and [[Echmiadzin Gospels]]. The second largest collection of Armenian illuminated manuscripts is stored in the depository of St. James, in the [[Armenian Quarter|Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem]], of the Patriarchate of Jerusalem of Armenia's Holy Apostolic Church. Other collections exist in the [[British Library]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], and other large collections at the [[Mechitarists|Mechitarist]] establishments in [[Venice]] and [[Vienna]], as well as in the United States. The [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) keeps an Armenian illuminated manuscript dating back to the 14th century among its collection of Armenian manuscripts, which is one of the largest in the world. They also have the manuscript of the [[Gladzor Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;Vrej Nersessian, ''The Bible in the Armenian tradition'', Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty Museum, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armenian Prayer Roll ==
[[File:Ewangeliarz ze Skewry 01.jpg|thumb|200px|A page from the ''Skevra Evangeliary'' ({{circa}} 1198), [[National Library of Poland]], Rps akc.17680.]]
Another form of an illuminated manuscript is a prayer roll, which traditionally included images from the Armenian iconography as well as Biblical passages or teachings but at a much smaller size was a more personal, and portable, religious treasure. Armenian prayer rolls could include iconography applicable to all Christian sects such as images of St. Mark, or St. Luke, or St. John as well as panels depicting important moments in the life of Jesus Christ. For the Armenians, however, the rolls would also include illustrations specific to the history of their country or church.  These included St. Gregory the Illuminator credited with bringing Christianity to Armenian in the 4th century or St. Nerses IV important to the growth of Christianity in Armenia in the 12th century as well as establishing the theology of icon veneration within the Armenian Church.&lt;ref&gt;Vrej Nersessian, ''Armenian Illuminated Gospels.'' London, British Library, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; As in the case of other traditional Armenian manuscripts, prayer rolls were drawn and illustrated by hand on vellum. The scroll served as a personal talisman for the protection of its owner or for needs and prayer intentions of members of their family. Prayer rolls were narrow in width and included panels of religious illustration followed by religious text. The rolls were always quite long although exact measurements varied, depending on the number of panels it contained. The owner of this religious artifact could tightly roll the vellum and conceal it when carried. Concealment was crucial for protection of the prayer roll, since illuminated manuscripts and prayer rolls were highly valued and targeted by thieves. Devout Armenians held manuscripts and other works of art of the Church in high regard due to the fact the church and its teachings were an important part of daily life in medieval Armenia; the church fulfilled all spiritual, social, moral and cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;Vrej Nersessian, ''The Bible in the Armenian Tradition'', Los Angeles, J. Paul Getty Museum, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armenian illuminated manuscript - Adoration of the Magi.jpg|thumb|A manuscript showing the [[Adoration of the Magi]] on the left-hand page, dates from 1632.]]
About 31,000 manuscripts&lt;ref name=Kouymjia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/index.htm |title=The Arts of Armenia (Accompanied by a Collection of 300 Slides in Color) |author=(c) Dr. Dickran Kouymjian |publisher=Armenian Studies Program at Cal State University, Fresno |date= |accessdate=2011-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820062953/http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/arts_of_armenia/index.htm |archivedate=2011-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; still survive after continuous invasions of Armenia throughout the centuries and the more recent Armenian Diaspora where hundreds of thousands of Armenians were displaced or massacred. Illuminated manuscripts mostly recount religious teachings and gospels of the Armenians and were handed down through families. So valuable were these manuscripts it was regarded as a sacrilege to sell or damage them, or to allow the manuscripts to fall into enemy hands. Most of the manuscripts were written and illustrated by monks located in monasteries. Many manuscripts are very elaborate, covered in gilt and brilliant colors. However, there is another type of manuscript which was stripped of unnecessary ornamentation, lacking colored backgrounds and painted with transparent colors, often with less than perfect artistry.&lt;ref&gt;Lydia A. Dournovo, ''Armenian Miniatures.'' Henry N. Adams, Inc., New York, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts were adorned with fantastical creatures and birds, which often formed the initial letters of chapters to attract the eye, while providing a mental break during which the beauty of the illustration could refresh the mind and spirit. These brilliantly illustrated letters were  followed by “erkat’agir”, an uncial script also known as iron script, as it originally was carved into stone. Notary script known as “notrgir” was used for writing the script and colophon and “bologir,” meaning “rounded letters”&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;Steyn, Carol.

University of South Africa, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avedis Krikor Sanjian, ''Medieval Armenian Manuscripts at the University of California,'' Los Angeles, Volume 14 ix. University of California Press, Los Angeles, California, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; was often used as a minuscule in writing the rubrics,&lt;ref name=Kouymjia/&gt; which are sections written in red ink in order to draw attention. Black lettering was used to write the chapters, symbolizing the pain of original sin, while the white paper space symbolized the innocence of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Ruben Malayan, [http://15levels.com/art/armeniancalligraphy ''The Art of Armenian Calligraphy''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128220024/http://15levels.com/art/armeniancalligraphy |date=January 28, 2012 }}, accessed July 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The colophon, also written in red ink, was usually found at the beginning or end of the manuscript and would provide information about the scribe, the patron, the artist, the date, when, where, and for whom the manuscript was created. Often the scribe would add notes about his working conditions or anecdotes of wisdom in the colophon and often was carried into the margins of the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Lesley.

Youtube upload by USF Libraries, 02/18/2008. Accessed July 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; So important was owning a manuscript, the owner would add his name into the script. If a manuscript had multiple owners, multiple signatures might be found within the script.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

'''Arthur's Day''' was an annual series of music events worldwide, originally organised by [[Diageo]] in 2009 to promote the 250th anniversary of its [[Guinness]] brewing company.

The 2009 events took place, internationally, in the cities of [[Dublin]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Lagos]], New York and [[Yaoundé]] on 23 September 2009. The event was broadcast internationally on [[Sky Digital (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky TV]],
[[ITV2]] and [[DirecTV]].&lt;ref name="GUINNESS Announces Further Details for Arthur's Day Global Celebrations"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Coughlan|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS186320+08-Sep-2009+PRN20090908|title=GUINNESS Announces Further Details for Arthur's Day Global Celebrations|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=12 September 2009|agency=Reuters  }}&lt;/ref&gt; €6 million was pledged to the Arthur Guinness Fund at the time.&lt;ref name="GUINNESS Announces Further Details for Arthur's Day Global Celebrations"/&gt; The so-called celebration was endorsed by several high-profile names, such as rock star-turned political activist [[Bob Geldof]], director and screenwriter [[Guy Ritchie]], footballer and Guinness football ambassador for Africa [[Michael Essien]] and British celebrities such as [[Peter Crouch]] and [[Sophie Dahl]].&lt;ref name="Celebrated by celebrities— and [[Siebel]] expert Bryan Cantwell.

Notable high-profile names who later spoke out against Arthur's day include: director [[Lenny Abrahamson]], singer-songwriter [[Christy Moore]], and musician [[Mike Scott (musician)|Mike Scott]] of [[The Waterboys]]. The event was also dubbed "Diageo Day" by [[The Huffington Post]] to promote a boycott of the event.&lt;ref name="Boycott Guinness on Arthur's Day -- or Should That Be Diageo Day?"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rory Fitzgerald|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rory-fitzgerald/boycott-guinness-on-arthu_b_1916921.html|title=Boycott Guinness on Arthur's Day – or Should That Be "Diageo Day"?|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=21 September 2013|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal College of Physicians Ireland highlighted a 30% increase in ambulance call-outs on each successive Arthur's Day and a doubling in alcohol-related liver disease over the previous decade, associated with drink promotion and the relative cheapness of alcohol.&lt;ref name="Doctors slam 'Arthur's Day' as drink-related deaths rise"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lyndsey Telford|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/doctors-slam-arthurs-day-as-drinkrelated-deaths-rise-29598566.html|title=Doctors slam 'Arthur's Day' as drink-related deaths rise|date=23 September 2013|work=The Irish Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guinness drinkers were asked by the brewing company to raise a glass to the memory of [[Arthur Guinness]] at 17:59 (5:59&amp;nbsp;pm), a reference to 1759, the year the Guinness Brewery was established.&lt;ref name="Beaumont pint would make Arthur turn in his grave"&gt;{{cite web|author=Roddy L'Estrange|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/0812/1224252419950.html|title=Beaumont pint would make Arthur turn in his grave|date=12 August 2009|accessdate=12 September 2009|work=The Irish Times |quote=There were ads on, one of which he'd seen before.

A new music programme to help emerging artists in Ireland called ''Guinness Amplify'' was launched to replace the event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0702/628069-guinness/|title= Guinness cancels Arthur's Day after five years|date=3 July 2014|work=RTÉ News|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dailyedge.ie/arthurs-day-axed-guinness-amplify-1550182-Jul2014/|title= Arthur’s Day axed: Guinness confirms celebration will not be returning|date=3 July 2014|work=Daily Edge|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
The event was criticised as a marketing ploy to increase sales of Guinness with Arthur's day, without understanding or appreciation for the sense of nostalgia and meaning behind the "Black Stuff" that the event promoted according to Diageo. Diageo also claimed that Arthur's Day was held on a Thursday, rather than an accurate yearly basis on the original date. Thursday was chosen according to Diageo as Thursdays were the traditional "student night" in Dublin and many towns in Ireland.&lt;ref name="We're buying into cheap marketing ploys"&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Clifford|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0828/1224253402209.html|title=We're buying into cheap marketing ploys|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=The Irish Times |quote=In reality, it is a cynical marketing ploy by the international drinks firm, Diageo, which owns Guinness. [...] "In reality, it is a cynical marketing ploy by the international drinks firm, Diageo, which owns Guinness."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Times]]'' has described Arthur's Day as "a masterclass in how to fabricate a national holiday" with its "''[[à la carte]]'' attitude to traditional holidays"&amp;nbsp;– noting its countdown to one minute before six (recalling New Year's Eve), "the faux-patriotism that comes with a celebration of a "national" drink" and the "[[hagiography|hagiographic]] treatment" of Arthur Guinness as some kind of [[saint]]. The paper warned, "If St Patrick's Day, Christmas, and Hallowe'en are festivals that offer an excuse for a drink, Diageo has flipped the concept on its head and made the drink an excuse for a festival".&lt;ref name=fabrication_and_libation&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Griffin|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0927/breaking50.html|title=Arthur's Day: fabrication and libation|newspaper=The Irish Times|publisher=Irish Times Trust|date=27 September 2012|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Artraker Awards differ from other awards such as the [[Turner Prize]] or the [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]]. Although like them, Artraker awards [[contemporary art]], it is not primarily interested in the significance of the artists’ contribution to the disciplines of [[art]] or [[photography]], but is focused instead on the ability of art to create opportunities for change and to co-create experiences of freedom even in the midst of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/ “Dr Bernadette Buckley, Artraker Jury and Advisory Member”], Unseen, Unknown, and Unsung – Artraker Story, 21 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Annual Awards are announced during the week of International Peace Day each year and include three [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 2500 cash prizes.  The Artraker Awards are designed by London-based wood artist Sebastian Cox.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandconflict.org.uk/news/global-artrakers-unleashed-on-international-peace-day/ “Global Artrakers unleashed on International Peace Day”], Culture+Conflict, 8 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Selected by an international jury from over 300 submissions from 90 countries, South African photographer Alexia Webster received the first Artraker Annual Award on [[International Day of Peace]] (21 September 2013) from [[Martin Bell]] at a ceremony which took place at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gostoli |first=Ylenia |url=http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/artraker/ |title=Art of Peace : Artraker Award Winners |publisher=[[Trebuchet Magazine]] |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Awards for 2014 were selected from 250 entries and included three award categories: The Artraker Award, Artraker Award for Social Impact, and Artraker Award for Innovation in Narrative (supported by a/political).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/artraker-awards/4571762059 “Artraker Awards 2014”]&lt;/ref&gt; The winners were San Zaw Htway (Artraker Award),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/san-zaw-htway/4586127186 “Recycling Myanmar's Dignity”]&lt;/ref&gt; Mirror Image (Artraker Award for Innovation in Narrative),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/mirror-image/4586001543 “Cutting Away the Void”]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lorena Wolffer (Artraker Award for Social Impact).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/lorena-wolffer/4586004589 “States of Exception”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Born in Canada in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://projectkaisei.org/aurora-robson/|title=Aurora Robson - Project Kaisei|work=Project Kaisei|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson grew up in Hawaii and now resides in New York.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/q-amp-a-with-artist-aurora-robson-49303|title=Q &amp; A with Artist Aurora Robson {{!}} artnet News|date=2013-08-07|work=artnet News|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upstartco-lab.org/artist/aurora-robson/|title=Upstart Co-Lab|work=Upstart Co-Lab|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robson attended [[Columbia University]] where she graduated with a B.A. in visual arts and art history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://beautifulpeopleliveart.com/aurora-robson/|title=Intercepting the Waste Stream by Aurora Robson|date=2016-02-17|work=Beautiful People Live Art|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Work==
Robson's primary focus is creating works made with plastic collected by intercepting the waste stream,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.upcycledzine.com/plastic-waste-upcycled-into-art-by-aurora-robson/|title=Plastic waste upcycled into art by Aurora Robson|website=www.upcycledzine.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/article/20120705/LIFESTYLE/307059707|title=Artist turns ubiquitous plastic water bottles into sculpture|last=Dispatch|first=Nancy Gilson, For The Columbus|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; repurposing plastic into art before it is sent to recycling. While her initial work was with common household plastics like water bottles and caps, she is currently focused on large scale sculptures made with industrial plastic. She also paints and creates 3-dimensional collages made with junk mail and excess packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.honoluluacademy.org/aurora-robson-on-appropriating-nightmares/|title=Aurora Robson on appropriating nightmares {{!}} Honolulu Museum of Art Blog|website=blog.honoluluacademy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Robson founded [[VORTEX projects|Project Vortex]], a not-for-profit organization consisting of artists, designers and architects from around the world that also work with plastic. The organization strives to bring awareness to [[plastic pollution]] and encourage cleanups of waterways.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicart.rice.edu/aurora_robson.aspx|title=Aurora Robson : Rice Public Art|website=publicart.rice.edu|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she gave a Ted talk at TedxPeachtree entitled "Trash+Love" &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Trash + love: Aurora Robson at TEDxPeachtree|date=2013-11-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVNInv8BkEw&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; introducing "Sculpture+Intercepting the Waste Stream,"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projectvortex.org/sculpture--intercepting-the-waste-stream.html|title=Sculpture + Intercepting the Waste Stream|website=Project Vortex|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an open source course she designed to foster creative stewardship at academic institutions. The course was first taught by Robson at [[Mary Baldwin University]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marybaldwin.edu/news/2012/11/06/doenges-scholar-combines-art-and-advocacy/|title=Doenges Scholar Combines Art and Advocacy - News at Mary Baldwin|website=www.marybaldwin.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her goal for the course is to inspire others to look at junk differently and rather than discard it, to create art.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Robson is the recipient of numerous grants including the Pollock Krasner Grant&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pkf-imagecollection.org/artist/Aurora_Robson/works/#!1409|title=Aurora Robson {{!}} Works {{!}} Pollock Krasner Image Collection|website=www.pkf-imagecollection.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Pollock-Krasner Foundation]], a [[New York Foundation for the Arts]] Fellowship in Sculpture, a TED/Lincoln Re-Imagine Prize&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://now.lincoln.com/recycling-plastic-into-art-with-aurora-robson/|title=Lincoln Now {{!}} Recycling Plastic into Art with Aurora Robson {{!}} Lincoln.com|website=now.lincoln.com|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Art Work Grant.

{{Culture of Australia}}
'''Australian folklore''' refers to the [[folklore]] and [[urban legends]] that have evolved in Australia from [[Aboriginal Australian]] myths to colonial and [[contemporary]] folklore including [[Australians|people]], places and events, that have played part in shaping the [[Australian culture|culture]], image and traditions that are seen today in Australia.

==Australian Aboriginal mythology==
{{main|Australian Aboriginal mythology}}
*[[Baijini]] - Unknown race mentioned in [[Yolngu]] folklore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/340571/AHM_21-36.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Bora (Australian)|Bora]] - Sacred Aboriginal initiation ceremony. Many sites still exist throughout Australia.
*[[Bunyip]] – According to legend, they are said to lurk in swamps, billabongs, creeks, riverbeds, and waterholes.
*[[Dreamtime]] - The Dreamtime to [[Aboriginal Australians]] is the beginning of time, the creation of knowledge from which their culture began more than 60,000 years ago.
[[Image:Bunyip (1935).jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Bunyip'' (1935), artist unknown, from the [[National Library of Australia]]]]
*[[Kata Tjuta#Legends|Kata Tjuta]] - Many Dreamtime stories are told by the [[Pitjantjatjara]] People, including a mythical creature that lurks the summit.
*[[Lake Mungo remains]] - Human skeletons found in 1969, believed to have lived between 40,000 and 68,000 years ago are the oldest human remains found in Australia.
*[[Rainbow Serpent]] – It is the sometimes unpredictable Rainbow Serpent, who vies with the ever-reliable Sun, that replenishes the stores of water, forming gullies and deep channels as he slithered across the landscape, allowing for the collection and distribution of water.
*[[Yara-ma-yha-who]] - According to Myth, the creature resembles a red frog-like creature that hides in trees waiting for an unsuspecting victim to consume.

== Animals &amp; Creatures ==
*[[Bob the Railway Dog]] - A Dog that was remembered for traveling along the South Australian Railway.
*[[Booie, Queensland#urban legend|Booie Monster]] - Reports of a monster lurking in a cave first reported in the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gympietimes.com.au/news/cave-monster-legend-never-buried-for-gympie-family/3206191/#/0&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Drop bear]] – Stories of drop bears are frequently related to visiting tourists as a joke. (see also the [[Queensland tiger]])
[[File:Red Dog Statue Front View.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Red Dog statue.]]
*[[Gippsland phantom cat]] – An urban legend centered on the idea that when United States soldiers were based in Victoria during [[WWII]], they released [[cougars]] into the wild, With many sightings of big cats been spotted across [[Gippsland]] and even the rest of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071113043212/http://www.smh.com.au/media/2003/11/02/1067597215449.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lyrebird]] – The lyrebird is said to mimic a wide variety of sounds. They have been said to be able to mimic chainsaws, cars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superb Lyrebird|url=https://museumsvictoria.com.au/forest/animals/lyrebird.html|website=Museum Victoria|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; alarms, horns, and even trains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lyrebirds|url=http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Lyrebirds|website=NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214134618/http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/npws.nsf/Content/Lyrebirds|archivedate=14 December 2005|date=December 16, 2004|access-date=28 November 2005|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a story about a lyrebird that used to halt 19th-century logging operations by mimicking the fire siren.
[[File:"Benjamin".jpg|thumb|right|The last known thylacine photograph taken in 1933]]
*[[Megalania]] – A giant [[goanna]] (lizard), generally believed to be extinct. However, there have been numerous reports and rumors of living Megalania in Australia, and occasionally New Guinea, but the only physical evidence that Megalania might still be alive today are plaster casts of possible Megalania footprints made in 1979.
*[[Platypus]] - Native Australian animal which is one of only two mammals that lay eggs (the other being the [[echidna]]), and one of the few species that is venomous. Due to its unique features the scientist who initially discovered and examined the creature thought it was made of several animals sewn together and deemed it to be a [[hoax]].
*[[Red Dog (Pilbara)|Red Dog]] - A dog that was known for his long travels through Western Australia's Pilbara region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiasnorthwest.com/Things_to_see_and_do/red-dog---the-pilbara-wanderer&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thylacine|Tasmanian tiger]] – Despite the widely held view that the thylacine (or Tasmanian tiger) became extinct during the 1930s, accounts of alleged sightings in eastern Victoria and parts of Tasmania have persisted to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;http://observer.com/2017/04/scientists-search-for-extinct-tasmanian-tiger/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Yowie (cryptid)]] – In the modern context, the Yowie is the generic (and somewhat affectionate) term for an unidentified hominid reputed to lurk in the Australian wilderness, analogous to the Himalayan [[Yeti]] and the North American [[Bigfoot]].
*The [[Dog on the Tuckerbox]] - an allegorical bullock driver's dog that loyally guarded the man's tuckerbox until its death. It has been immortalized in both a poem and a statue at Gundagai in southern NSW.  By way of explanation - tucker means food - so a tuckerbox is a (food) lunch box.

[[Image:Ned kelly day before execution photograph.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Ned Kelly]]]]
*[[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]] – Perhaps the greatest cricketer ever, the fact that he needed only 4 runs in his last innings in order to retire with a test average of 100 but was uncharacteristically bowled for a duck (leaving him stranded on an average of 99.94) has become a part of Australian folklore and added greatly to his mystique. (there are rumours that he has made the 4 runs in another match that was miscounted)
*[[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]] – Australian convict who escaped and became famous for living in an Aboriginal community for more than thirty years. Believed by many Australians to be the source of the saying [[William Buckley (convict)#You've got Buckley's Chance|"You've got Buckley's Chance"]].
*[[Azaria Chamberlain]] – the name of two-month-old Australian baby who disappeared on the night of 17 August 1980 on a camping trip with her family. Her parents, Lindy Chamberlain and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a [[dingo]], but they were arrested, tried, and convicted of her murder in 1982. Both were later cleared, and thus the case is best remembered for what was an injustice. The Chamberlains were [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and an urban myth had developed that they were required to sacrifice a child as part of their religious beliefs and that the name Azaria meant "sacrifice". These statements are false.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smh.com.au/comment/a-dingo-took-baby-azaria-chamberlain-the-case-that-shattered-faith-in-the-jury-system-20170112-gtqj6f.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[John Curtin]] - 14th [[Prime Minister of Australia]].

*[[Dawn Fraser]] –  perhaps the greatest Australian female swimmer of all time. Known for her [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] behaviour or [[larrikinism|larrikin]] character as much as her athletic ability, Fraser won eight Olympic medals, including four golds, and six [[Commonwealth Games]] gold medals. It was alleged that she took the flag from Emperor [[Hirohito]]'s palace, while this was proved false, the incident became part of the folklore.
*[[Harold Holt]] – a [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]] who [[Disappearance of Harold Holt|disappeared while swimming]] in 1967. Conspiracy theories include Holt being picked up by a Chinese submarine, faking his own death, suicide, and CIA involvement. Formal investigations determined that he drowned accidentally.
*[[Ned Kelly]] – Australian 19th-century [[bushranger]], many films, books and artworks have been made about him, possibly his exploits have been exaggerated in the public eye and become something of folklore. It especially surrounds his capture at [[Glenrowan, Victoria|Glenrowan]] where the Kelly gang tried to derail a train of Victorian police which were arriving, and were surrounded in the hotel. Kelly had made armour from stolen iron mould boards of ploughs, and came out shooting, whereupon he was shot in the legs. Some consider him as Australia's [[Robin Hood]] whiles others would disagree.

*[[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] – an Australian opera [[soprano]], the first Australian to achieve international recognition in the form. The French dessert [[peach Melba]] is named after her. Many old theatre halls in regional Australia persist with rumours that she once graced their stage, most notably, that of the gold mining town of [[Gulgong, New South Wales]]. She is also remembered in the vernacular Australian expression "more comebacks than Nellie Melba", which satirised her seemingly endless series of "retirement" tours in the 1920s.

== Places &amp; Structures==
*[[Finke River]] – "Oldest river in the world", a claim that has been attributed to "scientists" by a generation of [[central Australian]] bus drivers and tour brochure writers. Parts of the Finke River are likely the [[List of rivers by age|oldest major river known in the world]] or among the oldest, as shown in scientific literature, but this does not apply to the southern part of the river.   Neighboring, smaller rivers are just as old.
[[File:Pine Gap by Skyring.jpg|thumb|right|Pine Gap in The [[Northern Territory]]]]
*[[Franklin House (Launceston)#Review of haunting claims|Franklin House]] - Historic house in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] that has had reports of ghost sightings.
*[[Gallipoli]] – the name of a peninsula in [[Turkey]], but also the name given to the Allied [[Battle of Gallipoli|campaign]] on that peninsula during [[World War I]]. There were around 180,000 Allied casualties and 220,000 Turkish casualties. This campaign has become a "[[founding myth]]" for both Australia and [[New Zealand]], and [[Anzac Day]] is still commemorated as a holiday in both countries. The idea that Australian soldiers were mowed down by Turkish gunfire following stupid decisions of the British commanding officers is part of the folklore, as is the escape from Gallipoli, where the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|Anzac]]s used rifles rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger to make it seem like there were still soldiers in the trenches as they were leaving. Another aspect of the [[ANZAC spirit]] is the story of [[Simpson and his donkey]].
*[[The bush#Australia|Gentle Annie]] - Name for selected especially steep sections of bush roads, difficult to climb in wet weather.  The folk term may have arisen as early as in bullock team days, whether drawing wagons or timber jinkers.
*[[Gympie Pyramid]] - A small pyramid like structure in [[Gympie]], [[Queensland]] (That has been mostly destroyed) that many believe to be a construction made by Chinese or Incan origin. Although researchers would more likely argue that it is a [[hoax]]. In the Ancient Indian poem [[Ramayana]], the structure is said to be mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.booksfact.com/archeology/gympie-pyramid-australia-in-ramayana.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Monte Cristo Homestead]] - Historic estate in [[Junee, New South Wales]], said to be the most Haunted property in Australia.

*[[Australian regional rivalries|Sydney–Melbourne rivalry]] – there has been a long-standing rivalry, usually friendly yet sometimes heated, between the cities of Melbourne and Sydney, the two largest cities in Australia. It was this very rivalry that ultimately acted as the catalyst for the eventual founding of [[Canberra]] as the capital city of Australia.
[[File:Sydney Opera House, botanic gardens 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Opera House, backed by the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], from the eastern [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens]]]]
*[[Snowy River]] – immortalised in another Banjo Paterson poem, "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]". The river has received much attention of late for now being nothing more than a trickle, and in fact has become a symbol for wider Australian interest in the health of its great rivers, particularly those in the [[Murray-Darling basin]].
*[[St James railway station, Sydney#Underground tunnels|St James station Underground tunnels]] - The tunnel is home to many urban legends including being a secret military bunker during World War II and a large bell that sounds like [[Big Ben]].

== Socio-political events ==
* [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975]] – a real political crisis that has since taken on mythic proportions and elevated the protagonists to legendary status (depending on which side of the debate one takes). A visiting American politician at the time wryly observed that he was sure he had only heard the tip of the ice cube. [[Gough Whitlam]]'s speech "Well may we say [[God save the Queen]], because nothing will save the [[Governor General]]" is replayed frequently.
[[Image:Eureka stockade battle.jpg|thumb|330|right|Eureka Stockade battle by J. B. Henderson]]
* [[Eureka stockade]] – A miners' revolt in 1854 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia against the officials supervising the gold-mining region of [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]], in particular, the high prices of digging licenses. It is often regarded as the "Birth of Australian Democracy" and an event of equal significance to [[History of Australia|Australian history]] as the [[storming of the Bastille]] was to [[History of France|French history]], but almost equally often dismissed as being of little or no consequence. 
* [[The Stolen Generation]] - From the late 1800s to the early 1970s, young Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their families as children between the 1900s and the 1960s, to be brought up by white foster families or in institutions. In 1999 then-prime minister [[John Howard]] avoided using the word "sorry", to the families. In 2008 [[Kevin Rudd]] made an official apology to the stolen generation and their families, on behalf of the Australian government.
* [[Tenterfield Oration]] - Speech given by [[Sir Henry Parkes]] in 1889 calling for the six Australian colonies to be Federated, which would eventually lead to the [[Commonwealth of Australia]].

== Sport ==

*''[[Australia II]]'' – A [[12-metre class]] [[yacht]] that was the first successful challenger for the [[America's Cup]] after 132 years. On the morning of the victory (Australian time) the then Australian Prime Minister, [[Bob Hawke]], famously said that any employer who sacked any of their employees for not coming in that day was a "bum". The challenge also resulted in the popularisation of the [[boxing kangaroo]] representation.
[[Image:Phar Lap wins the Melbourne Cup.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Portrayal of [[Phar Lap]] winning the 1930 Melbourne Cup, from the 1983 movie "Phar Lap"]]
*[[Collingwood Football Club|Colliwobbles]] – The "colliwobbles" refers to the [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood Football Club's]] apparent penchant for losing grand finals over a 32-year period between 1958 and 1990. During this premiership drought, fans endured nine fruitless grand finals (1960, 1964, 1966, 1970, 1977 (drawn, then lost in a replay the following week), 1979, 1980, 1981). The term "Colliwobbles" was to enter the Victorian vocabulary to signify a choking phenomenon.
*[[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|The Invincibles]] - First [[Test cricket|Test match]] side to play an entire tour of England without losing, and is often considered to be one of the greatest cricket teams of all time.
*[[Kennett curse]] - A 5-year winning streak [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] had over [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] over comments made by then  Hawthorn club President [[Jeff Kennett]] saying that Geelong does not have the mental drive to defeat Hawthorn. Most games were decided by ten points or less and are considered some of the best in recent memory.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.com.au/sport/afl/geelong-cats-got-your-tongue-no-but-theyve-got-your-measure/news-story/fc4d17ab1251697ed8e283b3ab9f6c39&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Phar Lap]] – A [[thoroughbred]] horse who is considered by many to be the world's greatest [[horse-racing|racehorse]]{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}, and is probably subject to more conspiracy theories than any other racehorse (in relation to the cause of his death). His name entered the Australian lexicon in the expression "to have a heart bigger than Phar Lap's", referring to someone's tenacity and courage. It is part of Australian folklore that Phar Lap's heart was physically twice the size of the average horse's heart.
*[[Steven Bradbury]] - An Australian short track speed skater who memorably won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics at the 1,000 m short track, going from last to first after all other skaters were involved in a pile-up during the final metres. This led to the phrase 'doing a Bradbury', meaning to achieve something with the odds stacked against you.

[[Image:Bella Goodall.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Bella Goodall]]&lt;/center&gt;
'''Isabella Goodall''' (10 August 1851 – 2 February 1884)&lt;ref&gt;Dates are from Goodall's obituary notice in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 9 February 1884, p. 11. According to the obituary section of ''Who's Who in The Theatre'' (which gives the date of her death as ''3'' February 1884) she was aged 32 when she died, which accords with ''The Era''. If these sources are correct, she was only 13 when she was given the benefit performance in Liverpool, and 14 when she made her London debut&lt;/ref&gt; was an English [[soubrette]] of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] theatre. She made her name on the stage in her native city, [[Liverpool]], and later became a star of the London theatre, both in [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] and comic plays.

==Biography==
Goodall was born in [[Liverpool]]. By 1865, she was a star at the city's Theatre Royal, [[Williamson Square]]. In February 1865 she was granted a benefit performance in which she acted and sang. Works played on that occasion included [[Dion Boucicault]]'s [[burletta]] ''A Lover by Proxy''.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 6 February 1865, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; She also starred in productions in other Liverpool theatres at about this time.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 16 February 1865, p 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The author and journalist [[William Henry Rideing]] reminisced in 1912 about his boyhood in Liverpool, where he remembered Goodall as the reigning soubrette: "Then the orchestra would tune up and Miss Goodall, smiling and bowing, would open the most beautiful mouth in the world .... It bowled me over."&lt;ref&gt;Rideing, William H. [https://archive.org/stream/manycelebritiesa00riderich/manycelebritiesa00riderich_djvu.txt ''Many Celebrities''], Doubleday, 1912. Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her London debut in April 1865 at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in J P Wooler's ''The Winning Hazard'', attracting favourable reviews from ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', London's leading theatre journal,&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 16 April 1865, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Daily News.''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'', 17 April 1865, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In July of the same year, also at the Prince of Wales's, she made a success as a comic [[Lancashire|Lancastrian]] housemaid in a new farce, ''The Mudborough Election.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 16 July 1865, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1865 she was cast in [[pantomime]] in ''King Chess'' at the [[Surrey Theatre|New Surrey Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Era,'' 24 December 1865, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two years she continued to establish herself as a leading [[West End theatre|West End]] player in comic plays and burlesques. In 1866 she was cast as one of two "squabbling schoolgirls intent on marriage" in [[H. J. Byron]]'s ''One Hundred Thousand Pounds''.&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper'', 13 May 1866, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Her subsequent performances in this period included Byron's classical burlesque, ''Pandora's Box'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 3 February 1867, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; ''Magic Toys'' at the Prince of Wales's with [[Marie Wilton]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Daily News'', 26 April 1867, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]] and the farces, ''Mr and Mrs White'' and ''The Rendezvous''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Era,'' 28 July 1867, p. 8; and 17 November 1867, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In pantomime she was "a very dashing and prepossessing Princess Eglantine" in a version of ''[[Valentine and Orson]]'' for the 1867 Christmas season,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 26 December 1867, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and she successfully took a ''[[Travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'' (male) role in Boucicault's ''The Flying Scud'' at the Holborn Theatre, playing Lord Woodbie,&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 19 January 1868, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; followed by another trousers role, the valet Max, in Gilbert's burlesque, ''[[The Merry Zingara]]'', a parody of ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/merry_zing.doc Text of ''The Merry Zingara'',] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001011421/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/merry_zing.doc |date=1 October 2009 }} ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 20 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868 she joined the company of the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]] in the burlesque ''The Field of the Cloth of Gold'' and appeared with the company mainly in London but also on tour during the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', 1 September 1869, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870 she appeared as "a spirited [[St Patrick]]" in [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''Sir George and a Dragon'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 3 April 1870, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; in which her dancing was "a marvellous tour de force – perhaps more vigorous than graceful, but her Irish jig is decidedly one of the most attractive features in the burlesque."&lt;ref&gt;''Reynolds's Newspaper'', 10 April 1870, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; During her time with the Strand company the repertoire mixed burlesques and straight plays, including comedies such as ''Up in the World'', by Arthur Sketchley, in which she appeared in 1871 as a riotous page-boy.&lt;ref&gt;''Pall Mall Gazette'', 13 February 1871, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

She was evidently not only a practitioner of the theatre but also a teacher. In November 1868, ''The Era'' reported, "Miss Ada Arnold, a pupil of Miss Bella Goodall, made a successful debut at the Holborn Theatre on Saturday last in the burlesque of [[Lucrezia Borgia]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 22 November 1868, p 10&lt;/ref&gt;

She died at [[Pentonville Road]] and was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;West Norwood Cemetery, Burial index and Purchase register, Grave 12,361, square 78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Book rebinding''' is the renewal or replacement of the [[book cover|cover of a book]].  Typically, this requires restitching or renewal of the glue which holds the pages in place.

Collectors of [[book_collecting#Antiquarian_book_collecting|antique books]] such as [[incunabula]] would often have them rebound.  This might be done to improve their appearance by rebinding in a more fashionable colour or to assert ownership by having the book rebound in uniform covers which were stamped with an insignia such as a coat of arms.  One prominent collector who had this done was [[George_Spencer,_2nd_Earl_Spencer#Book_collecting|Earl Spencer]].  For example, when he acquired a medieval [[psalter]] of 1457, which was bound in pigskin on wooden boards, he had it rebound in mauve velvet over cardboard.  The [[Bodelian Library]] rebound additions to its collection for functional reasons — to indicate value and importance.  The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] requested 6600 francs for bookbinding in the eighth year of the [[French Republican Calendar|revolutionary calendar]], "those which come from our conquests in Germany and Italy, and while infinitely precious, they have arrived to us in a deplorable state".&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQVHVBQP8IIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:9781107000513&amp;hl=ent&amp;q=rebinding&amp;f=false#v=snippet&amp;q=rebinding&amp;f=false |title=Revolution and the Antiquarian Book: Reshaping the Past, 1780-1815 |chapter=Commemorating and obliterating the past |first1=Kristian |last1=Jensen |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2011 |isbn=9781107000513 |pages=137-175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
===Birds of America===
[[File:Dendroica auduboni (Audubon).jpg|thumb|right|One of the plates painted by Audubon — ''[[Dendroica auduboni]]'']]
The four-volume copy of [[John James Audubon|Audubon]]'s ''[[The Birds of America|Birds of America]]'' held in the [[Royal Collection]] was rebound in 2011 by conservators at [[Windsor Castle]].  The volumes are especially large and heavy, being printed on [[double elephant]] paper of about 50 by 28 inches, and weighing over 50 pounds.  The plates, which were published loose, had been originally bound by the royal bookbinder, James Mackenzie, around 1840.  That leather cover had perished and the tight sewing of the pages made viewing difficult as the pages might tear.  The rebinding was done in nine stages:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/conservation/case-study-audubons-birds-of-america/the-rebinding-of-audubons-birds-of-america |title=The rebinding of Audubon’s 'Birds of America' |publisher=Royal Collection Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:# the volumes were taken apart by cutting away the spine, cords, stitching and removing the glue
:# the plates were separated, cleaned, repaired and pressed flat
:# paper guards were added to the spinal edge of the plates - strips of paper which would bear the new sewing
:# the plates were grouped into sections of four which were then sewn to linen tapes
:# the spines of the plates assembled for a volume were then rounded by beating with a hammer
:# new [[endband|headband]]s of linen-covered [[vellum]] were added
:# new [[book cover|covers]] were made in the original style — boards covered with book cloth and leather reinforcement on the spine and corners
:# the original pastedowns and endpapers of [[marbled paper]] were restored for the inside of the cover
:# the leather of the cover was then tooled with hot brass and gold leaf to restore the titles and decoration in the style of the original binding

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4174">'''Ceramic tile cutters''' are used to cut tiles to a required size or shape. They come in a number of different forms, from basic manual devices to complex attachments for power tools.&lt;ref name="Press2013"&gt;{{citation|author=Editors of Cool Springs Press|title=HomeSkills: Ceramic Tile: How to Install Ceramic Tile for Your Floors, Walls, Backsplashes &amp; Countertops|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v5ygESBHKAYC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2013|publisher=Cool Springs Press|isbn=978-1-59186-580-3|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hand tools==


===Beam score cutters, cutter boards===
[[File:1era talladora antiga RUBI.tif|thumb|First Tile Cutter Invented by Boada Brothers]]
The ceramic tile cutter works by first scratching a straight line across the surface of the tile with a hardened metal wheel and then applying pressure directly below the line and on each side of the line on top. Snapping pressure varies widely, some mass-produced models exerting over 750&amp;nbsp;kg.

The cutting wheel and breaking jig are combined in a carriage that travels along one or two beams to keep the carriage angled correctly and the cut straight. The beam(s) may be height adjustable to handle different thicknesses of tiles.

The base of the tool may have adjustable fences for angled cuts and square cuts and fence stops for multiple cuts of exactly the same size.

The scoring wheel is easily replaceable.

==== History ====


The first tile cutter was designed to facilitate the work and solve the problems that masons had when cutting hydraulic mosaic or encaustic cement tiles (a type of decorative tile with pigmented cement, highly used in 50s, due to the high strength needed because of the high hardness and thickness of these tiles). 

Over the time the tool evolved, incorporating elements that made it more accurate and productive. The first cutter had an iron point to scratch the tiles. It was later replaced by the current tungsten carbide scratching wheel.

Another built-in device introduced in 1960 was the snapping element. It allowed users to snap the tiles easily and not with the bench, the cutter handle or hitting the tile with a knee as it was done before. This was a revolution in the cutting process of the ceramic world.

===Tile nippers===
Tile nippers are similar to small pairs of pincers, with part of the width of the tool removed so that they can be fit into small holes.  They can be used to break off small edges of tiles that have been scored or nibble out small chips enlarging holes etc.

===Glass cutter===
[[Image:Glass cutter.jpg|thumb|A glass cutter]] A simple hand held glass cutter is capable of scoring smooth surface glazes allowing the tile to be snapped.

==Power tools==
[[File:Grinder diamond blade.jpg|thumb|A grinder with a [[diamond blade]] for cutting tile.]]The harder grades of ceramic tiles like fully vitrified porcelain tiles, stone tiles, and some clay tiles with textured surfaces have to be cut with a diamond blade. The diamond blades are mounted in:-

===Angle grinders===

An angle grinder can be used for short, sometimes curved cuts.  It can also be used for "L" shaped cuts and for making holes.  It can be used dry and, more rarely, wet.

===Tile saws===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3291">'''Crux''' ([[Latin]] for "cross", "gallow", or "t-shape") is a term applied by [[palaeography|palaeographers]], [[textual criticism|textual critics]], [[bibliography|bibliographers]], and literary scholars to a point of significant corruption in a literary text. More serious than a simple slip of the pen or typographical error, a crux (probably deriving from Latin ''crux interpretum'' = "cross of the interpreters") is difficult or impossible to interpret and resolve. Cruxes occur in a wide range of pre-modern ([[ancient history|ancient]], [[Middle Ages|medieval]], and [[Renaissance]]) texts, printed and manuscript.

==Shakespearean examples==
Though widely exposed to readers and scholars, the texts of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays yield some of the most famous literary cruxes. Some have been resolved fairly well. In [[Henry V (play)|''Henry V,'']] II.iii.16-7, the [[First Folio]] text has the Hostess describe [[Falstaff]] on his death-bed like this:
{{quote|...his nose was sharp as a pen, and 'a Table of green fields.}}
[[Lewis Theobald]]'s editorial correction, "and 'a [he] babbl'd of green fields", has won almost universal acceptance from subsequent editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' pp. 945, 973.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the "dram of eale" In ''[[Hamlet]]'' I, iv, 36 can be sensibly interpreted as "dram of ev'l [evil]."&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, pp. 1148, 1188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Shakespearean cruxes have not been so successfully resolved. In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]],'' IV.ii,38-9, Diana observes to Bertram,
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre,
That we'll forsake ourselves.
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
Editors have reached no consensus on exactly what "ropes in such a scarre" can mean, or how it should be amended: "no satisfactory explanation or emendation has been offered."&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, pp. 530, 543.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the best alternative that has been proposed is "may rope 's [us] in such a snare." Another unresolved Shakespearean crux is the "runaway's eyes" in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' III, ii, 6.&lt;ref&gt;Blakemore Evans, p. 1077.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a crux will not require emendation, but simply present a knotty problem of comprehension. In ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]],'' IV, i, 98-9, Sir Richard Vernon describes Prince Hal and his comrades as appearing:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
All plum'd like estridges, that with the wind
bated like eagles having lately bath'd...
&lt;/poem&gt;}}
This is most likely a reference to some obscure assertion about animal behavior, and has sent researchers poring through dusty volumes in search of an explanation.

==Typographic conventions==
In editions of Greek and Roman authors, a crux is marked off by [[dagger (typography)|obeli]], to indicate that the editor is not confident enough either to follow the manuscript reading or to print a conjecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3894">'''Dan Kwian''' ({{lang-th|ด่านเกวียน}}) is a village and [[tambon|subdistrict]] in [[Chok Chai District]], [[Nakhon Ratchasima Province]]. It is known for its [[pottery]] and [[handicrafts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cummings|first=Joe|title=Thailand|year=2001|publisher=Lonely Planet Publications|isbn=1 86450 251 7|pages=580}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The village name Dan Kwian means toll station or check point (''Dan'') for oxcarts (''Kwian'').

==Location==
Dan Kwian sits at a [[narrows]] of the [[Mun River|Mun]] (Thai: แม่น้ำมูล) river and was a convenient [[Ford (river)|river crossing]] point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Louis|title=Traditional Thai Pottery Guide and Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Louis Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river provided the means for distributing utilitarian pottery produced in Dan Kwian to a wide market. The village, located on the road connecting [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] and [[Chok Chai]], is broken into two distinct parts. Dan Kwian Din Phao (ด่านเกวียนดินเผา), a congregation of larger [[Factory|factories]] and a roadside sales area for ceramics, both local and sourced from other centers in Thailand, is located about 2 kilometers north of the historic village Moo Baan Dan Kwian (หมู่บ้านด่านเกวียน). The Tambon covers a 10.17 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. The people of Dan Kwian are mostly employed in handicrafts and farming.

==History==
Pottery production is said to have started around 1740, although this date has not been verified. The same account states that pottery production began with [[Mon people|Mon]] (Thai: มอญ) refugees similar to the potters of [[Ko Kred]] (Kred Island). This claim, although popularly held, may not be accurate.&lt;ref name=Chiminok&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiminok|first=Nikom|title=Dankwean|year=2000|publisher=Publisher Unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to approximately 1972 nearly all the products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage [[jar]]s of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, [[mortar and pestle|mortars]], and [[Sink|basins]]. There is no evidence of [[tableware]] production at Dan Kwian.&lt;ref name=Chiminok/&gt; Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground [[Anagama kiln|anagama]]-style wood [[kiln]]s, although at least one [[Anagama kiln#Kiln variants|noborigama]] chamber kiln, many gas kilns, and at least one electric kiln have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or "fired black," and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), "fired red." Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately {{convert|1200|°C|°F}} and {{convert|1250|°C|°F}}. The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous. Phao Dam wares were prized for durability and lack of [[porosity]]. Most notable of these products are the once ubiquitous Dan Kwian water jars.

Starting around 1972, decorative ware started to be made in Dan Kwian to serve a new market of urban consumers centered in Bangkok. University-based designers became involved with developing new products for hotels and other public spaces as well as private homes. At first this decorative ware consisted simply of water jars ornamented with carved [[Decorative arts|decoration]]. Gradually the decorative ware expanded to include varied ornamental vessel forms, clay [[tile]], carved [[ceramic]] [[mural]]s, ceramic [[jewellery]], and free-standing [[sculpture]]. Other media are also now produced in Dan Kwian, most notably [[cement]]-based carved [[sandstone]] replicas.&lt;ref name=Chiminok/&gt;

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''''' (German: '''''Die altniederländische Malerei''''') is a pioneering 14-volume series of illustrated books by the German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] (1867–1958). The first volume was published in 1924, and the series ran until 1937. It was the first comprehensive modern art-historical survey of [[Early Netherlandish painting]],&lt;ref&gt;The painters are sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives&lt;/ref&gt; a  term often used in art history to describe artists of the [[Low Countries]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]].

Friedländer developed an interest in northern art of the period while director of the [[Bode Museum|Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The collection included a large selection of Flemish paintings, including [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'', [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and ''[[Altar of Saint John]]'', and  [[Hugo van der Goes]]' ''Adoration of the Maji''. Friedländer was struck by the lack of biographical detail on even the most accomplished of the artists, some of whom were still identified by [[notname]]s, the sometimes poorly supported attributions, and general historical neglect.&lt;ref name="mv"&gt;McNamee (1998), vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses on establishing biographical details for the painters, attributing individual works, and detailing their major stylistic themes and techniques. The undertaking was extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists.&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was a major influence on [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s equally seminal ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'', which expanded on Friedländer's biographical and stylistic analysis to focus on [[iconography]], intended meaning and historical context.&lt;ref name="mv" /&gt;

'''The Eight Views of Pyangyang''' are a collection of beautiful scenery of [[Pyongyang]], [[Korea]], that are alleged to have been handed down from the time of the [[Joseon]] dynasty, in the Korean poetry and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piks.or.tv/info/134.htm Eight Views of Pyongyang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914222852/http://www.piks.or.tv/info/134.htm |date=2007-09-14 }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

They were modeled after the [[Eight Views of Xiaoxiang]] of the [[Song Dynasty]] of [[China]].

'''''Everything That Rises Must Converge''''' is a collection of [[short story|short stories]] written by [[Flannery O'Connor]] during the final decade of her life. The collection's eponymous story derives its name from the work of [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = University of South Carolina Press | isbn = 1-57003-225-4 | last = Whitt | first = Margaret Earley | title = Understanding Flannery O'Connor | date = 1997-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Avon (Discus Edition) | last = Chardin | first = Pierre Teilhard De | title = Building the Earth and The Psychological Conditions of Human Unification | page = 11 | year = 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was published posthumously in 1965 and contains an introduction by [[Robert Fitzgerald]]. Of the volume's nine stories, seven had been printed in magazines or literary journals prior to being collected. "Judgment Day" is a dramatically reworked version of "The Geranium," which was one of O'Connor's earliest publications and appeared in her graduate thesis at the University of Iowa. "Parker's Back," the collection's only completely new story, was a last-minute addition.

== "Everything That Rises Must Converge" ==

The story is told from the close third-person point of view of Julian, a recent college graduate and self-styled intellectual who lives with his mother because he cannot afford his own lodgings with the pittance he earns as a typewriter salesman. The mother, whose worldview reflects the institutional racism of the mid-twentieth century American South, wishes to attend an exercise session at a nearby community center, but is wary of riding the bus by herself in light of the recent racial integration of the city's public transportation system. Though he despises his mother's racism, cheeriness, and intellectual aloofness, Julian resentfully agrees to escort her, if only out of a sense of duty to the woman who paid his way through college and continues to support him even afterward. His confrontational bitterness and her thoughtless prejudice bring the circumstances to a boil when they step onto the bus and join a widely disparate cast of characters, among them three African American citizens who inhabit vastly different regions of the social spectrum.

The title ''Everything That Rises Must Converge'' refers to a work by the French philosopher [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] titled the "[[Omega Point]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ThePhenomenonOfMan|title=The Phenomenon of Man|last=Pierre Teilhard de Chardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "''Remain true to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love!  At the summit you will find yourselves united with all those who, from every direction, have made the same ascent.  For everything that rises must converge.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://swc2.hccs.cc.tx.us/htmls/rowhtml/foc/analysis.html Analysis of Everything That Rises Must Converge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204070959/http://swc2.hccs.cc.tx.us/htmls/rowhtml/foc/analysis.html |date=2010-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film theory''' is a set of scholarly approaches within the [[academic]] [[discipline]] of '''cinema studies''' that questions the [[essentialism]] of [[film|cinema]] and provides conceptual frameworks for understanding [[film]]'s relationship to [[reality]], the other [[art]]s, individual viewers, and [[society]] at large. Film theory is not to be confused with general [[film criticism]], or [[film history]], though these three disciplines interrelate.

Although film theory originated from [[linguistics]] and [[literary theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Pieter Jacobus Fourie (ed.), ''Media Studies: Content, audiences, and production'', Juta, 2001, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; it also overlaps with the [[philosophy of film]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/film "Philosophy of Film" by Thomas Wartenberg – first published 2004; substantive revision m 2008. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' (1896) has been cited as anticipating the development of film theory during the birth of cinema. Bergson commented on the need for new ways of thinking about movement, and coined the terms "the movement-image" and "the time-image". However, in his 1906 essay ''L'illusion cinématographique'' (in ''L'évolution créatrice''; English: ''The cinematic illusion'') in ''Creative'', he rejects film as an exemplification of what he had in mind. Nonetheless, decades later, in ''[[Cinema 1|Cinéma I]] and Cinema II'' (1983–1985), the philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] took ''Matter and Memory'' as the basis of his [[philosophy of film]] and revisited Bergson's concepts, combining them with the [[semiotics]] of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].

Early film theory arose in the [[silent era]] and was mostly concerned with defining the crucial elements of the medium. It largely evolved from the works of directors like [[Germaine Dulac]], [[Louis Delluc]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Lev Kuleshov]], and [[Dziga Vertov]] and film theorists like [[Rudolf Arnheim]], [[Béla Balázs]] and [[Siegfried Kracauer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Stam]], ''Film Theory: an introduction", Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; These thinkers emphasized how film differed from reality and how it might be considered a valid art form. In the years after [[World War II]], the French film critic and theorist [[André Bazin]] reacted against this approach to the cinema, arguing that film's essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its difference from reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Bazin]], ''What is Cinema?'' essays selected and translated by Hugh Gray, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, film theory took up residence in academia importing concepts from established disciplines like [[psychoanalysis]], [[gender studies]], [[anthropology]], [[literary theory]], [[semiotics]]  and [[linguistics]]. However, not until the late 1980s or early 1990s did film theory ''per se'' achieve much prominence in American universities by displacing the prevailing humanistic, [[auteur theory]] that had dominated cinema studies and which had been focused on the practical elements of film writing, production, editing and criticism.&lt;ref name="Weddle"&gt;Weddle, David. "[http://articles.latimes.com/print/2003/jul/13/magazine/tm-filmschool28 Lights, Camera, Action. Marxism, Semiotics, Narratology: Film School Isn't What It Used to Be, One Father Discovers]." ''Los Angeles Times'', July 13, 2003; URL retrieved 22 Jan 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; American scholar [[David Bordwell]] has spoken against many prominent developments in film theory since the 1970s, i.e., he uses the derogatory term "SLAB theory" to refer to [[film studies]] based on the ideas of Saussure, Lacan, Althusser, and Barthes. Instead, Bordwell promotes what he describes as "[[Neoformalism (film theory)|neoformalism]]" (a revival of [[formalist film theory]]).

During the 1990s the digital revolution in image technologies has influenced film theory in various ways. There has been a refocus onto celluloid film's ability to capture an "indexical" image of a moment in time by theorists like [[Mary Ann Doane]], Philip Rosen and [[Laura Mulvey]] who was informed by psychoanalysis. From a psychoanalytical perspective, after the [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian notion of "the Real", [[Slavoj Žižek]] offered new aspects of "the [[gaze]]" extensively used in contemporary film analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek]], ''Welcome to the Desert of the Real'', London: Verso, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1990 onward the Matrixial theory of artist and  psychoanalyst [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; revolutionized [[feminist film theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Chare, ''Sportswomen in Cinema: Film and the Frailty Myth''. Leeds: I.B.Tauris 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Batcho, ''Terrence Malick's Unseeing Cinema. Memory, Time and Audibility''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Her concept [[The Matrixial Gaze]],&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Gaze''. Published by Leeds University, 1995. Reprinted in: ''Drawing Papers'', nº 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; that has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of "coemergence", offering a critique of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s and [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''After-effects – After-images''. Manchester University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Humm, Feminism and Film''. Edinburgh University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by female authors, like [[Chantal Akerman]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Nagib and Anne Jerslev (ends.), ''Impure Cinema''. London: I.B.Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by male authors, like [[Pedro Almodovar]].&lt;ref&gt;Julian Daniel Gutierrez-Arbilla, ''Aesthetics, Ethics and Trauma in the Cinema of [[Pedro Almodovar]]''. Edinburgh University Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger's notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Rutledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a historical revisiting of early cinema screenings, practices and spectatorship modes by writers Tom Gunning, [[Miriam Hansen]] and Yuri Tsivian.

In ''Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice'' (2011), Clive Meyer suggests that 'cinema is a different experience to watching a film at home or in an art gallery', and argues for film theorists to re-engage the specificity of philosophical concepts for cinema as a medium distinct from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Critical Cinema: Beyond the Theory of Practice | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | journal=Media International Australia | volume= 147 | page= 171 | year= 2013 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2763909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gloss is a marginal notation regarding the main text in a document. Shown is a parchment page from the Royal Library of Copenhagen.]]
A '''gloss''' ({{ety|la|glossa}}; {{ety|gre|''γλῶσσα'' glōssa|language}}) is a brief notation, especially a [[marginalia|marginal]] one or an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. 

A collection of glosses is a ''[[glossary]].'' A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by [[glossators]], is called an ''apparatus''. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of [[lexicography]], and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The [[German Romanticism|German Romantic movement]] used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish [[Décima]] style. 

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a [[classical language]]; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear [[translation]]s of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today [[bracket#Parentheses|parenthetical]] explanations in [[scientific writing]] and [[technical writing]] are also often called glosses. [[Hyperlink]]s to a [[glossary]] sometimes supersede them.

==Etymology==
The word "gloss" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to "explain away" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/gloss|title=Gloss|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Biblical gloss}}
Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical [[theology]], and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the "three heavenly witnesses" or the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'', which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek [[Textus Receptus]] collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as [[Westcott and Hort]], [[Tischendorf]], and [[Nestle-Aland]].

==In law==
{{See also|Glossator}}
In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on [[Roman law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] created standards of reference, so-called ''sedes materiae'' (literally: seat of the matter). In [[common law]] countries, the term "judicial gloss" refers to what is considered an authoritative or "official" [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of a statute or regulation by a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the [[constitutionality]] of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or ''glosa'', is a verse in traditional [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the "''mote''"). See also [[villancico]].

==In philology==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] are glosses added to this Latin codex that are now considered the first phrases written in the [[Castilian language]].]]
Glosses are of some importance in [[philology]], especially if one language&amp;mdash;usually, the language of the author of the gloss&amp;mdash;has left few texts of its own. The [[Reichenau Glosses]], for example, gloss the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] in an early form of one of the [[Romance languages]], and as such give insight into late [[Vulgar Latin]] at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the [[Old English language]] to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see ''[[Old English Bible translations]]''. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for [[syntax]], because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its [[idiom]]s literally.

==In linguistics{{anchor|In linguistics}}==
{{Main|Interlinear gloss}}
In [[linguistics]], a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word.

{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}

'''Greek tragedy''' is a form of [[theatre]] from [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Asia Minor]]. It reached its most significant form in [[Athens]] in the 5th century BC, the works of which are sometimes called '''Attic tragedy'''. Greek tragedy is widely believed to be an extension of the ancient rites carried out in honor of [[Dionysus]], and it heavily influenced the theatre of [[Theatre of Ancient Rome|Ancient Rome]] and the [[Renaissance tragedy|Renaissance]]. Tragic plots were most often based upon [[myth]]s from the oral traditions of archaic [[epic (genre)|epics]]. In tragic theatre, however, these narratives were presented by actors.  The most acclaimed Greek tragedians are [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].

== Etymology ==

=== Aristotelian hypothesis ===
The origin of the word ''tragedy'' has been a matter of discussion from ancient times. The primary source of knowledge on the question is the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' of [[Aristotle]]. Aristotle was able to gather first-hand documentation from theater performance in [[Attica]], which is inaccessible to scholars today. His work is therefore invaluable for the study of ancient tragedy, even if his testimony is open to doubt on some points.

According to Aristotle, tragedy evolved from the satyr [[dithyramb]], an Ancient Greek [[hymn]], which was sung along with dancing in honor of Dionysus. The term {{lang|grc|τραγῳδία}}, derived from {{lang|grc|τράγος}} "goat" and {{lang|grc|ᾠδή}} "song", means "song of the goats," referring to the chorus of [[satyrs]]. Others suggest that the term came into being when the legendary [[Thespis]] (the root for the English word ''thespian'') competed in the first tragic competition for the prize of a goat (hence tragedy).&lt;ref name=Hart1/&gt;

[[Image:Dionysos mask Louvre Myr347.jpg| thumb | left | Mask of [[Dionysus]] found at  [[Myrina (Aeolis)]] of ancient Greece  c. 200 BC – 1 BC, now at the [[Louvre]]]]

=== Alexandrian hypothesis ===
[[Alexandrian grammarians]] understood the term {{lang|grc|τραγῳδία}} as a "song for the sacrifice of the goat" or "song for the goat", believing the animal was a prize in a race, as attested by [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'': {{Quote |text= "The poet, who first tried his skill in tragic verse for the paltry prize of a goat, soon after exposed to view wild satyrs naked, and attempted raillery with severity, still preserving the gravity of tragedy." |sign= Horace |source= ''Ars Poetica'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0065%3Acard%3D220 220] (Smart &amp; Buckley translation).}}

=== Other hypotheses ===

[[Image:Cratère de Derveni 0010.jpg|thumb | 130px | Maenads dancing, bringing a sacrificial lamb or kid]]

There are other suggested etymologies for the word ''tragedy''. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' adds to the standard reference to "goat song", that:&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the reason of the name, many theories have been offered, some even disputing the connection with ‘goat’.&lt;ref name=OLD1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

J. Winkler proposed that "tragedy" could be derived from the rare word ''tragizein'' ({{lang|grc|τραγίζειν}}), which refers to "adolescent voice-change" referring to the original singers as "representative of those undergoing social puberty".
&lt;ref name=Winkler1/&gt; [[Silvio D'Amico|D'Amico]], on the other hand, suggests that ''tragoidía'' does not mean simply "song of the goats", but the characters that made up the satyr chorus of the first Dionysian rites.&lt;ref name=Damico1/&gt;

Other hypotheses have included an etymology that would define the tragedy as an ode to beer. Jane Ellen Harrison pointed out that Dionysus, god of [[wine]] (a drink of the wealthy classes) was actually preceded by Dionysus, god of [[beer]] (a drink of the working classes). Athenian beer was obtained from the fermentation of barley, which is ''tragos'' in Greek. Thus, it is likely that the term was originally meant to be "odes to [[spelt]]," and later on, it was extended to other meanings of the same name. She writes: 
"Tragedy I believe to be not the 'goat-song', but the 'harvest-song' of the cereal 
''tragos'', the form of spelt known as 'the goat'." 
&lt;ref name=Harrison1/&gt;

== The evolution of tragedy ==

=== Origin of tragedy ===
The origin of Greek tragedy is one of the unsolved problems of  [[classical scholarship]]. [[Ruth Scodel]] notes that, due to lack of evidence and doubtful reliability of sources, we know nearly nothing about tragedy's origin.&lt;ref name=Scodel1/&gt; Still, R.P. Winnington-Ingram points out that we can easily trace various influences from other genres.&lt;ref name=Easterling2/&gt; The stories that tragedy deals with stem from [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Greek lyric|lyric poetry]], its meter — the [[iambic trimeter]] — owed much to the political rhetoric of [[Solon]], and the choral songs' dialect, meter and vocabulary seem to originate in choral lyric. How these have come to be associated with one another remains a mystery however.

Speculating on the problem, Scodel writes that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Three innovations must have taken place for tragedy as we know it to exist. First, somebody created a new kind of performance by combining a speaker with a chorus and putting both speaker and chorus in disguise as characters in a story from legend or history. Second, this performance was made part of the City Dionysia at Athens. Third, regulations defined how it was to be managed and paid for. It is theoretically possible that all these were simultaneous, but it is not likely."&lt;ref name=Scodel1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From dithyramb to drama ===
[[Image:Dionysos satyrs Cdm Paris 575.jpg|thumb | Dionysus surrounded by satyrs]] 
Aristotle writes in the ''Poetics'' that, in the beginning, tragedy was an [[improvisational theater|improvisation]] "by those who led off the [[dithyramb]]",&lt;ref name=Aristotle1/&gt; which was a hymn in honor of Dionysus. This was brief and burlesque in tone because it contained elements of the [[Satyr play]]. Gradually, the language became more serious and the meter changed from [[trochaic tetrameter]] to the more prosaic [[iambic trimeter]]. In [[Herodotus]] ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''&lt;ref name=Herodotus1/&gt; and later sources,&lt;ref name=Suda4/&gt; the lyric poet [[Arion|Arion of Methymna]] is said to be the inventor of the dithyramb. The dithyramb was originally improvised, but later written down before performance. The [[Greek chorus]] of up to 50 men and boys danced and sang in a circle, probably accompanied by an [[aulos]], relating to some event in the life of Dionysus.&lt;ref name=Easterling3/&gt;

Scholars have made a number of suggestions about the way the dithyramb changed into tragedy. 
"Somebody, presumably Thespis, decided to combine spoken verse with choral song. ... As tragedy developed, the actors began to interact more with each other, and the role of the chorus became smaller.&lt;ref name=Scodel1/&gt;" Scodell notes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Greek word for “actor” is ''hypocrites'', which means “answerer” or “interpreter,” but the word cannot tell us anything about tragedy’s origins, since we do not know when it came into use.&lt;ref name=Scodel1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also, Easterling says: &lt;blockquote&gt;There is ..  much to be said for the view that ''hypokrites'' means 'answerer'. He answers the questions of the chorus and so evokes their songs. He answers with a long speech about his own situation or, when he enters as messenger, with a narrative of disastrous events ... Naturally, the transformation of the leader into an actor entailed a dramatization of the
chorus.&lt;ref name=Easterling3/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The first tragedies ===
Tradition attributes [[Thespis]] as the first person to represent a character in a play. This took place in 534 BC during the [[Dionysia]] established by [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]].&lt;ref name=Sinisi1/&gt; Of his tragedies we know little except that the choir was still formed by [[Satyr]]s and that, according to Aristotle, he was the first to win a dramatic contest, and the first ({{lang|grc|ὑποκριτής}}) who portrayed a character rather than speaking as himself. Moreover, [[Themistius]], a writer of the 4th century AD, reports that Thespis invented the prologue as well as the spoken part ({{lang|grc|ῥῆσις}}). Other playwrights of the time were [[Choerilus (playwright)|Choerilus]], author of probably one hundred and sixty tragedies (with thirteen victories), and [[Pratinas|Pratinas of Phlius]], author of fifty works, of which thirty-two are satyr plays.&lt;ref name=Easterling4/&gt; We have little record of these works except their titles. At this time, satyr plays were presented alongside tragedies. Pratinas definitely competed with Aeschylus and worked from 499 BC.

Another playwright was [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]].&lt;ref name=Easterling5/&gt; [[Aristophanes]] sings his praises in his plays: for example, ''[[The Wasps]]'' presents him as a radical democrat close to Themistocles. Besides introducing dialogues in [[iambic trimeter]] and including female characters for the first time, Phrynichus also introduced historical content to the genre of tragedy (e.g. in the ''[[Capture of Miletus]]''). His first victory in a [[Agon|contest]] was in 510 BC. At this time, the organization of plays into [[trilogy|trilogies]] began.

=== Aeschylus: the codification ===
{{Main|Aeschylus}}
Aeschylus was to establish the basic rules of tragic drama.&lt;ref name=Aeschylus1/&gt; He is credited with inventing the [[trilogy]], a series of three tragedies that tell one long story, and introduced the second actor, making the dramatization of a conflict possible. Trilogies were performed in sequence over a full day, sunrise to sunset. At the end of the last play, a [[satyr play]] was staged to revive the spirits of the public, possibly depressed by the events of the tragedy.{{refn|group=note|name=Griffith1}}

In the work of Aeschylus, comparing the first tragedies with those of subsequent years, there is an evolution and enrichment of the proper elements of tragic drama: dialogue, contrasts, and theatrical effects.&lt;ref name=Italica1/&gt; This is due to the competition in which the older Aeschylus was with other playwrights, especially the young [[Sophocles]], who introduced a third actor, increased plot complexity and developed more human characters, with which the audience could identify.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Aeschylus was at least partially receptive to Sophocles' innovations, but remained faithful to a very strict morality and a very intense religiosity. So, for instance, in Aeschylus, [[Zeus]] always has the role of ethical thinking and action.{{refn|group=note|name=Prometheus1}} Musically Aeschylus remains tied to the ''nomoi'', rhythmic and melodic structures developed in the Archaic period.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== The reforms of Sophocles ===
{{main|Sophocles}}

[[Plutarch]], in the ''Life of Cimon'', recounts the first triumph of the young talented Sophocles against the famous and hitherto unchallenged Aeschylus.&lt;ref name=Plutarch2/&gt; This competition ended in an unusual manner, without the usual draw for the referees, and caused the voluntary exile of Aeschylus to [[Sicily]]. Many innovations were introduced by Sophocles, and earned him at least twenty triumphs.&lt;ref name=Sophocles1/&gt; He introduced a third actor, increased the number of chorus members to fifteen; he also introduced [[scenery]] and the use of [[scene (drama)|scene]]s.

Compared to Aeschylus, the chorus became less important in explaining the plot and there was a greater emphasis on character development and conflict. In ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'', the chorus repeats "not to be born is best." The events that overwhelm the lives of the heroes are in no way explained or justified, and in this we see the beginning of a painful reflection on the human condition, still current in the contemporary world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== The realism of Euripides ===
{{main|Euripides}}

[[Image:NAMA Bacchantes.jpg| thumb | 250px | Votive relief that probably celebrates the triumph of the ''[[Bacchae]]'']]

The peculiarities that distinguish the Euripidean tragedies from those of the other two playwrights are the search for technical experimentation, and increased attention for [[feeling]]s, as a mechanism to elaborate the unfolding of tragic events.&lt;ref name=Euripides1/&gt;

The experimentation carried out by Euripides in his tragedies can be observed mainly in three aspects that characterize his theater: he turned the prologue into a monologue informing the spectators of the story's background, introduced the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' and gradually diminished the choir's prominence from the dramatic point of view in favor of a [[monody]] sung by the characters.

Another novelty of Euripidean drama is represented by the [[realism (literature)|realism]] with which the playwright portrays his characters' psychological dynamics. The hero described in his tragedies is no longer the resolute character as he appears in the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles, but often an insecure person, troubled by internal conflict.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

He uses female protagonists of the plays, such as [[Andromache]], [[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] and [[Medea]], to portray the tormented sensitivity and irrational impulses that collide with the world of reason.&lt;ref name=Michelini1/&gt;

== Structure ==
The structure of Greek tragedy is characterized by a set of conventions. The tragedy usually begins with a prologue, (from'' pro'' and'' logos'', "preliminary speech") in which one or more characters introduce the drama and explain the background of the ensuing story. The prologue is followed by the ''[[parodos]](entry of the characters/group)'' (πάροδος), after which the story unfolds through three or more episodes (ἐπεισόδια, epeisodia). The episodes are interspersed by [[stasimon|stasima]] (στάσιμoν, stasimon), choral interludes explaining or commenting on the situation developing in the play. The tragedy ends with the ''exodus'' (ἔξοδος), concluding the story. Some plays do not adhere to this conventional structure. Aeschylus' "The Persians" and "Seven Against Thebes" for example, have no prologue.

== Language ==
The [[Ancient Greek dialects|Greek dialects]] used are the [[Attic dialect]] for the parts spoken or recited, and a literary [[Doric Greek|Doric dialect]] for the vocals. For the [[metre (poetry)|metre]], the spoken parts mainly use the [[iamb (foot)|iamb]]ic ([[iambic trimeter]]), described as the most natural by Aristotle,&lt;ref name=Aristotle1/&gt; while the choral parts rely on a variety of meters.  Anapaests were typically used as the chorus or a character moved on or off the stage, and lyric metres were used for the choral odes.  These included Dactylo-epitrites and various Aeolic metres, sometimes interspersed with iambics.  Dochmiacs often appear in passages of extreme emotion.&lt;ref name=Brunet1/&gt;

== Greek tragedy in dramatic theory ==

=== Mimesis and catharsis ===
{{main|Mimesis|Catharsis}}

As already mentioned, Aristotle wrote the first critical study of the tragedy: the ''Poetics''. He uses the concepts of ''[[mimesis]]'' ({{lang|grc|μίμησις}}, "imitation"), and ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''katharsis'' ({{lang|grc|κάθαρσις}}, "cleansing") to explain the function of tragedy. He writes: "Tragedy is, therefore, an imitation (''mimēsis'') of a noble and complete action [...] which through [[pity|compassion]] and fear produces purification of the passions."&lt;ref name=Aristotle2/&gt; Whereas ''mimēsis'' implies an imitation of human affairs, ''catharsis'' means a certain emotional cleansing of the spectator. What exactly is meant by "emotional cleansing" (κάθαρσις των παθήματων) however, remains unclear throughout the work. Although many scholars have attempted to define this element vital to the understanding of Aristotle's ''Poetics'', they remain divided on the subject.&lt;ref name=Lear1/&gt;

Gregory, for instance, argues that there is "a close relationship between tragic ''katharsis'' and the transformation of pity and fear [...] into essentially pleasurable emotions in the theater".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Katharsis, on this reading, will denote the overall ethical benefit that accrues from such an intense yet fulfillingly integrated experience. Exempt from the stresses that accompany pity and fear in social life, the audience of tragedy can allow these emotions an uninhibited flow that ... is satisfyingly attuned to its contemplation of the rich human significance of a well-plotted play. A ''katharsis'' of this kind is not reducible to either ‘‘purgation’’ or ‘‘purification.’’
{{sfn|Gregory|2005|p=405}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lear&lt;ref name=Lear1/&gt;
promotes as "the most sophisticated view of katharsis", the idea that it "provides an education for the emotions." "Tragedy ... provides us with the appropriate objects towards which to feel pity or fear."

=== The three unities ===
The three [[Aristotelian unities]] of drama are the unities of time, place and action.

#''Unity of action'': a play should have one main action that it follows, with no or few subplots.
#''Unity of place'': a play should cover a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place.
#''Unity of time'': the action in a play should take place over no more than 24 hours.

[[Aristotle]] asserted that a play must be complete and whole, in other words, it must have unity, i.e. a beginning, a middle and an end. The philosopher also asserted that the action of epic poetry and tragedy differ in length, "because in tragedy every effort is made for it to take place in one revolution of the sun, while the epic is unlimited in time."

These unities were considered key elements of the theatre until a few centuries ago, although they were not always observed (such as by authors like [[Shakespeare]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] and [[Moliere]]).

=== Apollonian and Dionysian: the analysis of Nietzsche ===
{{main|The Birth of Tragedy}}
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] at the end of the 19th century highlighted the contrast between the two main elements of tragedy: firstly, the Dionysian (the passion that overwhelms the character) and the Apollonian (the purely pictorial imagery of the theatrical spectacle).&lt;ref&gt;"The Apollonian&amp;hellip;belongs to [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]’s world of representation. Metaphysically, it stands for the false, the illusory, for 'mere appearance.' Epistemologically, the Apollonian indicates a dreamlike state in which all knowledge is knowledge of surfaces. Aesthetically, the Apollonian is the beautiful, the world experienced as intelligible, as conforming to the capacities of the representing intellect." (Berys Gaut and Dominic McIver Lopes, editors, ''Routledge Companion to Aesthetics'', Chapter 8, "Nietzsche," "Art and Metaphysics," p. 78.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasted with that is ''nemesis'', the divine punishment that determines the fall or death of the character.

In ancient Greek culture, says Nietzsche, "there is a conflict between the plastic arts, namely the Apollonian, and non-plastic art of music, the Dionysian." &lt;blockquote&gt;"Both drives, so different from each other, go side by side, mostly in open discord and opposition, always provoking each other to new, stronger births, in order to perpetuate in themselves the struggle of opposites which is only apparently bridged over by the common word 'art'; until, finally, by a wonderful act of Hellenic 'will,' they seem to pair up and in this pairing, at last, produce Attic Tragedy, which is as much a Dionysian as an Apollonian artwork."&lt;ref&gt;''The Birth of Tragedy'', § 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== The tragic theatre as a mass phenomenon ==
[[Image:DionisosTheatre.JPG| thumb | 250px | The [[theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]]]]
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

Greek tragedy as we understand it today, was not merely a show, but rather a collective ritual of the ''[[polis]]''.{{refn|group=note|name=Emilio1}} It took place in a sacred, consecrated space (the altar of the god stood at the center of the theatre).

&lt;blockquote&gt;A spectator of a Greek dramatic performance in the latter half of the fifth century B.C. would find himself seated in the ''theatron'', or ''koilon'',a semi-circular, curved bank of seats, resembling in some respects the closed end of a horseshoe stadium. ... Below him, in the best location in the theatre, is the throne of the priest of Dionysus who presides in a sense over the whole performance. The theatron is large-in fact, the one in Athens, in the Theatre of Dionysus, with its seats banked up on the south slope of the Acropolis, seated approximately 17,000 persons.

The spectator sees before him a level circular area called the ''orchestra'',
which means literally the "dancing place". ... In the centre of the orchestra stands an
altar. A part of the dramatic action will take place in the orchestra, as
well as the manoeuvres and dance figures performed by the Chorus as
they present their odes. To the right and left of the theatron are the
''paradoi'', which are used not only by the spectators for entering and
leaving the theatre, but also for the entrances and exits of actors and
the Chorus. Directly beyond the circular ''orchestra'' lies the ''skene'' or scene building. ... In most plays the skene represents the facade of a house, a palace, or a temple.
The skene normally had three doors which served as additional entrances and exits
for the actors. Immediately in front of the scene-building was a level
platform, in the fifth century B.C. in all probability only a single step
above the level of the orchestra. This was called the ''proskenion'' or ''logeion'' where much of the dramatic action of the plays takes place. Flanking the
proskenion were two projecting wings, the so-called ''paraskenia''. It must
be remembered that the skene, since at first it was only a wooden structure,
was flexible in its form, and was probably modified frequently.&lt;ref name=Oates1/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theatre voiced ideas and problems from the democratic, political and cultural life of Athens. Tragedies can discuss use the Greek mythical past as a metaphor for the deep problems of current Athenian society.&lt;ref name=Sinisi2/&gt; In such plays, "the poet alludes directly to fifth-century events or developments, but moves them back into the mythological past. In this category [can be placed] Aeschylus’ Persians and Oresteia."{{sfn|Gregory|2005|p=5}}

In the case of Aeschylus' tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', it was performed in 472 BC in Athens, eight years after the battle of Salamis, when the war with Persia was still in progress. It tells the story of the Persian fleet's [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] and how the ghost of former Persian King [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]] accuses his son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] of ''[[hubris]]'' against the Greeks for waging war on them.

"The possibility that a reflection of Athens is to be seen in Aeschylus’ Persian mirror could explain why the poet asks his audience to look at Salamis through Persian eyes and elicits great sympathy for the Persians, including Xerxes."{{sfn|Gregory|2005|p=8}}

Other tragedies avoid references or allusions to 5th century BC events, but "also draw the mythological past into the present."&lt;blockquote&gt; The bulk of the plays in this category are by Euripides. Strains of fifth-century Athenian rhetoric, sketches of political types, and reflections of Athens’ institutions and society lend plays of this category a distinctly fifth-century Athenian flavor. The emphasis in Euripides’ Orestes on political factions, for example, is directly relevant to the Athens of 408 BCE.{{sfn|Gregory|2005|p=8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The performances of the tragedies took place in Athens on the occasion of the Great Dionysia, feasts in honor of Dionysus celebrated in the month of [[Elaphebolion]], towards the end of March.{{refn|group=note|name=Dionysia1}} It was organized by the State and the [[eponymous archon]], who picked three of the richest citizens to pay for the drama's expenses. In the Athenian democracy wealthy citizens were required to fund public services, a practice known as [[Liturgy (ancient Greece)|''liturgy'']].

During the Dionysia a [[Agon|contest]] took place between three plays, chosen by the ''archon eponymous''. This procedure might have been based on a provisional script, each of which had to submit a [[tetralogy]] consisting of three tragedies and a [[satyr play]]. Each tetralogy was recited in one day, so that the recitation of tragedies lasted three days. The fourth day was dedicated to the staging of five comedies.{{refn|group=note|name=reduced1}} At the end of these three days a jury of ten people chosen by lot from the body of citizens chose the best choir, best actor and best author. At the end of the performances, the judges placed a tablet inscribed with the name of their choice inside an urn, after which five tablets were randomly selected. The person who received the highest number of votes won. The winning author, actor and choir were thus selected not purely by lot, but chance did play a part.

The passion of the Greeks for the tragedy was overwhelming: Athens, said the critics, spent more on theatre than on the fleet. When the cost for the shows became a sensitive subject, an admission fee was instated, alongside the so-called ''[[theorikon]]'', a special fund to pay for festival's expenses.&lt;ref name=Plutarch1/&gt;

== The surviving tragedies ==
Of the many tragedies known to have been written, full-length texts by only three authors, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, survive.

=== Aeschylus ===
[[Image:Aischylos Büste.jpg|thumb | 150px | Aeschylus]]

Seventy-nine titles of [[Aeschylus]]' works are known (out of about ninety works),&lt;ref name=Suda1/&gt; both tragedies and satyr plays. Seven of these have survived, including the only complete trilogy which has come down from antiquity, the ''[[Oresteia]]'', and some papyrus fragments:{{sfn|Rossi|Nicolai|2006|p=27-28}}
* '' [[The Persians]]'' ({{lang|grc|Πέρσαι|italic=yes}} / {{lang|grc-Latn|Persai}}), 472 BC;
* '' [[Seven Against Thebes]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἑπτὰ ἐπὶ Θήβας|italic=yes}} / {{lang|grc-Latn|Hepta epi Thebas}}), 467 BC;
* '' [[The Suppliants (Aeschylus)|Suppliants]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἱκέτιδες|italic=yes}} / {{lang|grc-Latn|Hiketides}}), probably 463 BC;
* The trilogy'' [[Oresteia]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ὀρέστεια|italic=yes}} / {{lang|grc-Latn|Oresteia}}), 458 BC, consisting of:

=== Sophocles ===
[[File:Sophocles pushkin.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sophocles]]
According to [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], [[Sophocles]] wrote 130 plays, 17 of which are spurious; the [[Suda]] lexicon counted 123.&lt;ref name=Suda3/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Aristophanes1}} Of all Sophocles's tragedies, only seven remain intact:
* ''[[Ajax (Sophocles)|Ajax]]'' ({{lang|grc|Αἴας|italic=yes}} / {{lang|grc-Latn|Aias}}) around 445 BC;
* ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιγόνη|italic=yes}} / {{lang|grc-Latn|Antigone}}), 442 BC;

Apart from the plays that have survived in their entirety, we also possess a large part of the satyr play {{lang|grc|Ἰχνευταί|italic=yes}} or ''[[The Trackers|Trackers]]'', which was found at the beginning of the 20th century on a papyrus containing three-quarters of this work.&lt;ref name=Privitera1/&gt;

=== Euripides ===
[[Image:Euripides Statue.jpg|150px | thumb |Euripides]]

According to the Suda, [[Euripides]] wrote either 75 or 92 plays, of which survive eighteen tragedies and the only complete surviving satyr play, the ''Cyclops''.&lt;ref name=Suda2/&gt;

&lt;ref name=Aristophanes1&gt;Some scholars equate the two sources, assuming an error of Aristophanes, of 17 instead of 7. Cf. Rossi &amp; Nicolai 2006, p 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Emilio1&gt;Paul Judges Emilio assumed that it was for this reason that the construction of the theatre needed a certain size to hold all the free citizens of Athens. See his ''History of Theatre in Italy'' p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Griffith1&gt;Some discussion exists on the function of satyr plays, however. See: Griffith (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Prometheus1&gt;An exception is ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', in which Zeus strikes tyrannical attitudes.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=Prometheus2&gt;The presence of attacks on Zeus casts doubt onto the authorship of Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=reduced1&gt;During the [[Peloponnesian War]] the number of comedies was reduced to three, to be performed once a day, at the end of the tetralogies. It has been argued, the Athenians took this decision due to their financial situation at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Judith Slaying Holofernes''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] early [[Baroque]] artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]]  completed between 1614 and 1620.&lt;ref name="Gardner583"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The work shows the scene of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], common in art since the early [[Renaissance]], as part of the group of subjects art critics have called the "[[Power of Women]]", which show women triumphing over powerful men. The subject takes an episode from the [[apocrypha]]l [[Book of Judith]] in the [[Old Testament]],  which recounts the assassination of the [[Assyria]]n general [[Holofernes]] by the [[Israelite]] heroine [[Judith]]. The painting shows the moment when Judith, helped by her maidservant, beheads the general after he has fallen asleep drunk.

The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide [[spurts of blood]] to the energy of the two women as they perform the act.&lt;ref name="Gardner583" /&gt; The effort of the women's struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, who is younger than in most paintings, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Although the painting depicts a classic scene from the Bible, Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor [[Agostino Tassi]], who was tried for and convicted of her rape, as Holofernes. Gentileschi's biographer Mary Garrard famously proposed an autobiographical reading of the painting, stating that it functions as "a cathartic expression of the artist's private, and perhaps repressed, rage".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Garrard, ''Artemisia Gentileschi'' (1989), qtd. in {{cite book

Gentileschi's self-insertion was reversed in an influential composition by [[Cristofano Allori]] (c. 1613 onwards), which exists in several versions and copied a conceit of Caravaggio's recent ''[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)|David with the Head of Goliath]]''; here the head is a portrait of the artist, Judith his ex-mistress, and the maid her mother.&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p. 270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-902163-29-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentileschi painted another painting, ''[[:File:Gentileschi judith1.jpg|Judith and her Maidservant]]'' (1613–14), which shows Judith holding a dagger while her maidservant carries a basket containing a severed head. ''[[:File:Gentileschi judith1.jpg|Judith and her Maidservant]]'' is displayed in the Palazzo Pitti, in Florence. A further three paintings by Gentileschi, in Naples, Detroit and Cannes, show her maid covering the head of Holofernes, while Judith herself looks out the frame of the picture.

[[Judith beheading Holofernes]] has been depicted by a number of artists including [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Caravaggio]].

[[File:Judith Beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio.jpg|left|thumb|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]],'' c. 1598–1599. In Caravaggio's version the beheading seems effortless, in stark contrast to Gentileschi's depictions]]
[[Caravaggio]]'s ''[[Judith Beheading Holofernes (Caravaggio)|Judith Beheading Holofernes]]'' is believed to be the main source of this work, and his influence shows in the naturalism and violence Gentileschi brings to her canvas. In both there is a notable absence of decorative detail in the background.&lt;ref name="WGOA"&gt;"[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/g/gentiles/artemisi/judit.html Judith Beheading Holofernes]". [[Web Gallery of Art]]. Retrieved on June 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gentileschi's father, [[Orazio Gentileschi]], was also a famous painter; he was also very much influenced by Caravaggio's style and painted his own version of the tale, ''[[:File:Orazio Gentileschi - Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes.JPG|Judith and Her Maidservant with the Head of Holofernes]]''.

'''Kalo Dungar''' or '''Black Hill''' is the highest point in [[Kutch]], [[Gujarat]], India, at 462 m.  It is located at 97 km from District headquarters of [[Bhuj]] and 25 km from nearest town [[Khavda]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.gujarattourism.com/showpage.aspx?contentid=34&amp;webpartid=42]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://bichhubooti.wordpress.com/2010/06/16/the-jackals-and-legend-of-kalo-dungar/ The Jackals and Legend of Kalo Dungar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZRLGZNZEoEC&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=kalo+dungar&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DczQTZLaIc7irAep9anCCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kalo%20dungar&amp;f=false KALO DUNGAR]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is probably the only place in Kachchh from where a panoramic view of the [[Great Rann of Kutch]] is possible. Since it is located very near to the Pakistan border, there is an Army post at the top; beyond here, only military personnel are allowed.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

The Kalo Dungar is also famous for a 400-year-old [[Dattatreya]] temple. Legend says that when Dattatreya walked on the earth, he stopped at the Black Hills and found a band of starving jackals. Being a god, he offered them his body to eat and as they ate, his body continually regenerated itself. Because of this, for the last four centuries, the priest at the temple has prepared a batch of [[prasad]], cooked rice, that is fed to the jackals after the evening [[aarti]].&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=c/&gt;

Another, legend has it that there was once a holy man named Lakkh Guru residing at Kala Dungar and worshiping the Lord Dattatreya. He used to feed wild jackals. There came a day when he found he had no food, so cutting-off a part of his body he offered it to the jackals, saying, “Le ang!’ (Take body part). Over the centuries, this got corrupted to ‘Long’.&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

A strange phenomenon was observed at Kalo Dungar, when some visitors noticed that their vehicles were hurtling down the hill at speeds over 80 km/h even with the ignition switched off.  The team of experts from the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), and Institute of Seismological Research, [[Gandhinagar]] and [[Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur]] studied the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-26/ahmedabad/28256947_1_gsdma-rann-utsav-phenomenon Experts set to probe mystery roll-down at Kalo Dungar] TIMES OF INDIA, DEC 26,2010&lt;/ref&gt; It is concluded that the vehicle hurtle down fast due to the more gradient of the slope.&lt;ref name="Kaushik 2011"&gt;{{cite web | last=Kaushik | first=Himanshu | title=Nothing magnetic about Kala Dungar | website=The Times of India | date=20 October 2011 | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Nothing-magnetic-about-Kala-Dungar/articleshow/10421349.cms | accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''La Ilustración Española y Americana''''' was a weekly Spanish magazine that was published from 1869 to 1921 on the 8th, 15th, 22nd and 30th of every month. It was also published biweekly.&lt;ref name=pen/&gt;

== History ==
The magazine was a continuation of ''[[El Museo Universal]]'', which was published from 1857 to 1869,&lt;ref name=pen&gt;{{cite book |year=2008 |title=Hold That Pose: Visual Culture in the Late Nineteenth-Century Spanish Periodical |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |author= Lou Charnon-Deutsch }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was modeled after prestigious European publications such as ''[[L'Illustration]]'' and ''[[Le Monde Illustré]]'' in France, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Illustrirte Zeitung|de}}'' in Germany, and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Illustrazione Italiana|it}}''.

On its [[Masthead (publishing)|masthead]], it was described as a magazine of "sciences, arts, literature, trade and useful knowledge". It was founded in 1869 in Madrid by {{Interlanguage link multi|Abelardo de Carlos|es}}, a writer and entrepreneur who had previously published two other magazines (''La Revista Médica'' and ''La Moda Elegante e Ilustrada''). Three years later, the building where it was printed collapsed, killing three people, so Carlos rebuilt with a new, state-of-the-art press. He served as the magazine's Director until 1881, when management passed to his sons Abelardo and Isidro, and he died in 1884.

Among the major writers who made contributions may be numbered [[José Zorrilla]], [[Ramón de Campoamor]], [[Juan Valera]], [[Leopoldo Alas]], [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]].&lt;ref&gt;Miguel B. Márquez, ''Abelardo de Carlos y "La Ilustración Española y Americana"'', from ''Ámbitos'' #13-14 (2005), ISSN 1139-1979 [http://grupo.us.es/grehcco/ambitos13-14/11mbmarquez.pdf online]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also one of the vehicles favoured by [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]] for the publication of her short stories, in particular between 1909 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fernández Cubas|first=Cristina|authorlink=Cristina Fernández Cubas|title=Emilia Pardo Bazán|url=|accessdate=|year=2017|publisher=Ediciones Omega|isbn=84-282-1240-6|editor=|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular political and journalistic contributors included [[Emilio Castelar]] and [[Manuel Cañete]].

As its name would indicate, it was profusely illustrated with scenes from daily life in Spain and Latin America, where it was also distributed. It became an "authentic school for masters of the graphic arts". {{ill|Bernardo Rico y Ortega|es}}, an engraver and brother of the painter, [[Martín Rico]], was the Artistic Director; responsible for the magazine's design and printing. 

The variety of themes encouraged specialization among the magazine's artistic contributors, such as [[Josep Lluís Pellicer]] who, like the later [[photojournalist]]s of the 20th century, produced first-hand scenes from the [[Third Carlist War]] and the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]]. It included also the [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trenc |first=Eliseu |title=La prensa ilustrada en España: las "Ilustraciones", 1850-1920 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ecoaAQAAIAAJ |year=1996 |location=Montpellier |pages=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[costumbrism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bermúdez |first=Lola |title=Traducción y cultura: La literatura traducida en la prensa hispánica (1868-98) |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=zuKndmQLDxUC&amp;pg=PA148 |language=es |first2=Marta |last2=Giné |first3=Solange |last3=Hibbs |year=2010 |publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]] |isbn=9783034303668 |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Realism (arts)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bozal |first=Valeriano |title=La ilustración gráfica del XIX en España |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=2oKjAQAACAAJ |year=1979 |location=Madrid |editor-last=Corazón |editor-first=Alberto |pages=234 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The long list of regular illustrators included the painters [[Alejandro Ferrant]], [[Enrique Simonet]] and [[Valeriano Bécquer]], and humorous cartoonists such as [[Francisco Ortego Vereda]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">[[File:La Vie Parisienne 1918 cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of the French erotic men's magazine ''La Vie parisienne'' from 1918]]

'''''{{lang|fr|La Vie Parisienne}}''''' (the Parisian life) was a French weekly magazine founded in Paris in 1863 and was published without interruption until 1970. It was popular at the start of the 20th century. Originally it covered novels, sports, theater, music and the arts. In 1905 the magazine changed hands and the new editor Charles Saglio changed its format to suit the modern reader. It soon evolved into a mildly risqué erotic publication. During [[World War I]], [[John J. Pershing|General Pershing]] personally warned American servicemen against purchasing the magazine, which boosted its popularity in the United States.

''La Vie parisienne'' was hugely successful because it combined a new mix of subjects—short stories, veiled gossip and fashion banter, also comments about subjects from love and the arts to the stock exchange—with beautiful cartoons and full-page color illustrations by leading artists of the age. Alongside this the magazine also reflected the changing interests and values of the start of the 20th century population such as fashion and frivolity.

The artwork of ''La Vie parisienne'' reflected the stylization of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] illustration, mirroring the aesthetic of the age as well as the values, and this coupled with the intellectualism, wit and satire of its written contributions was a combination that proved irresistible to the French public.

The largest collection of ''La Vie parisienne'' magazine artwork in the UK is held by [[The Advertising Archives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advertisingarchives.co.uk/?service=category&amp;action=show_content_page&amp;language=en&amp;category=19&amp;pid=63|title=''La Vie Parisienne'' collection |publisher=The Advertising Archives|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a free-to-view resource holding cover and interior artwork of illustrators including [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]], [[Chéri Herouard]], [[Georges Léonnec]] and [[Maurice Milliere]].

The historical ''La Vie parisienne'' ceased to exist in 1970. A new magazine of the same name started in 1984 and is still in existence.

'''Lachesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|k|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-el|Λάχεσις}}, ''Lakhesis'', "disposer of lots", from {{lang|grc|λαγχάνω}}, ''lanchano'', "to obtain by lot, by fate, or by the will of the gods"), in [[ancient Greek religion]], was the second of the Three Fates, or [[Moirai]]: [[Clotho]], Lachesis and [[Atropos]].  Normally seen clothed in white, Lachesis is the measurer of the thread spun on Clotho's spindle, and in some texts, determines Destiny, or thread of life.&lt;ref name="Weigle2007"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Marta Weigle|last=Weigle|first=Marta|title=Spiders and Spinsters: Women and Mythology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1aLCcrYU0LwC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=29 July 2013|date=1 July 2007|publisher=Sunstone Press|isbn=978-0-86534-587-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Roman equivalent was [[Decima (mythology)|Decima]]. Lachesis was the apportioner, deciding how much time for life was to be allowed for each person or being.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Edith (1942). ''Mythology'', p. 49. Little, Brown and Company, Boston. {{ISBN|978-0-316-34114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She measured the thread of life with her rod. She is also said to choose a person's destiny after a thread was measured. In mythology, it is said that she appears with her sisters within three days of a baby's birth to decide its fate.

==Origin==
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Lachesis and her sisters ([[Atropos]] and [[Clotho]]) were the daughters of [[Erebus]] (Darkness) and [[Nyx]] (Night), though later in the same work (ll. 901-906) they are said to have been born of [[Zeus]] and [[Themis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 901–6; cf. {{cite book|last1=Hansen|first1=William|last2=Hansen|first2=William Freeman|title=Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks And Romans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_s8nSgrD0jkC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=29 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530035-2|page=153}}, {{cite web|url=http://cantos33.weebly.com/atropos.html |title=Dante's Inferno: Cantos XXXIII - Atropos |publisher=Cantos33.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lachesis is also mentioned in the tenth book of the ''Republic'' of Plato as the daughter of [[Ananke (mythology)|Necessity]]. She instructs the souls who are about to choose their next life, assign them lots, and presents them all of the kinds, human and animal, from which they may choose their next life.

In [[library science]] and architecture, a '''stack''' or '''bookstack''' (often referred to as a library building's ''stacks'') is a book storage area, as opposed to a reading area.  More specifically, this term refers to a narrow-aisled, multilevel system of iron or steel shelving that evolved in the nineteenth century to meet increasing demands for storage space.&lt;ref name="petroski"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petroski|first=Henry|title=The Book on the Book Shelf|year=1999|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|pages=167–168, 170–172, 184, 191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An "open-stack" library allows its patrons to enter the stacks to browse for themselves; "closed stacks" means library staff retrieve books for patrons on request.

==Early development==
French architect [[Henri Labrouste]], shortly after making pioneering use of iron in the [[Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve]] of 1850, created a four story iron stack for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref name="ELH"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiegand|first=Wayne, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Library History|year=1994|publisher=Garland|pages=352–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1857, multilevel stacks with grated iron floors were installed in the [[British Library]].&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;  In 1876, William R. Ware designed a stack for [[Gore Hall]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt;  In contrast to the structural relationship found in most buildings, the floors of these bookstacks did not support the shelving, but rather the reverse, the floors being attached to, and supported by, the shelving framework.  Even the load of the building's roof, and of any non-shelving spaces above the stacks (such as offices), may be transmitted to the building's foundation through the shelving system itself. The building's external walls act as an envelope but provide no significant structural support.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Library of Congress and the Snead system==
For the [[Thomas Jefferson Building]] of the [[Library of Congress]], completed in 1897, [[Bernard Richardson Green]] made a number of alterations to the Gore Hall design, including the use of all-metal shelving. The contract was won by the Snead and Company Ironworks, which went on to install its standardized design in libraries around the country.&lt;ref name="snead 11" /&gt; Notable examples include the [[Widener Library]] at Harvard and the seven level stack supporting the Rose Reading Room of the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt;

The Library of Congress bookstacks were designed and patented by Bernard R. Green (1843-1914), the engineer in charge of the Library of Congress construction, where this type of book storage was first used. Although the structure was of cast iron, the shelves were made from strips of thin U section steel, designed to be as light as an equivalent pine shelf. The top surface of the U section was ground, polished and 'lacquered' (the constituents of the lacquer are not known). Green designed the stacks to be modular, able to be erected several stories high as a single freestanding structural entity incorporating staircases and floors, and even capable of supporting a roof structure. He designed the shelves so that they could adjust to book sizes using a simple lug system without the need for any bolts or fixings. Although the bookstacks were decorated and very simply embellished, they are of machine-age industrial design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salvoweb.com/salvonews/item-snead-cast-iron-bookstack-features-at-hindmans-chicago-sale_23258 |title=Snead cast iron bookstack features at Hindman's Chicago sale |website=salvoweb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stacks were typically envisioned for access by library staff fetching books for patrons waiting elsewhere, and so were often built in ways making them unsuitable for public access.  Increasing concern with opening stacks to the public,&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt; the desire to construct buildings adaptable to changing uses,&lt;ref name="petroski" /&gt; and concerns over the feasibility of storing truly comprehensive collections of books contributed to the decline of the Snead stack. [[Angus Snead Macdonald]], president of the Snead Company from 1915 to 1952, himself advocated for the transition to modular, open plan libraries in the mid twentieth century.&lt;ref name="ELH" /&gt;

==Forms==
For closed stacks, [[mobile shelving]] may be used to minimize floor space.  With computerized indexing, filing by book size saves up to 40% space as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quito|first1=Anne|title=The New York Public Library has adopted a very unusual sorting system|url=http://qz.com/802744/the-legendary-new-york-public-library-shelves-books-in-its-underground-stacks-by-size-not-subject/|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=[[Quartz (publication)]]|publisher=[[Atlantic Media]]|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Linda Aronson''' (born 20 March 1950) is a British-born Australian [[screenwriter]], educator and author. She wrote the [[Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts|AACTA]]-nominated drama ''[[Kostas (film)|Kostas]]'' and several television series, such as ''[[Something in the Air]]'' and ''[[G.P.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aacta.org/winners-nominees/1970-1979/1979.aspx AACTA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/A157?mainTabTemplate=agentWorksBy Austlit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[London]], Aronson moved out to [[Essex]] at a young age. She studied at [[Ulster University]], then did late nineteenth century fiction at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], but abandoned it to pursue a career as a writer. Her first paid writing job was a 1973 radio adaptation of her own [[Play (theatre)|stage play]], ''Closing Down'' for ABC. This was followed by ''Cafe in a Side Street'' in 1975, and ''The Fall Guy'' in 1976. The latter success lead to her writing ''Kostas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adelaidescreenwriter.blogspot.com/2013/01/an-interview-with-linda-aronson.html Adelaide Screenwriter Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The 21st Century Screenplay'' ==
Aronson is also a prolific author, having written several books including the screenwriting guide ''The 21st Century Screenplay.'' The book was written as a response to standard screenwriting teaching that focused on linear, single protagonist stories. Aronsson, instead, discusses how to write for non-linear stories with multiple characters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lindaaronson.com/21st-century-screenplay.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scriptangel.com/writing-non-linear-flashback-and-ensemble-scripts-by-linda-aronson/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.livingspiritgroup.com/podcasts/vodcasts/linda-aronson/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.networkisa.org/modules/curious/view/writing-non-linear-and-ensembles-for-film-and-tv-with-linda-aronson&lt;/ref&gt;

:''[[Printmaking]] art techniques such as [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[woodcut]] and [[lithography]] are covered more fully in their respective articles.''
'''Line art''' or '''line drawing''' is any image that consists of distinct straight or curved lines placed against a (usually plain) background, without gradations in [[shading|shade]] (darkness) or [[hue]] ([[color]]) to represent two-dimensional or three-dimensional objects. Line art can use lines of different colors, although line art is usually monochromatic.
Line art emphasizes [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]] and [[Outline drawing|outline]], over color, shading, and [[wikt:texture|texture]]. However, areas of solid [[pigment]] and dots can also be used in addition to lines. The lines in a piece of line art may be all of a constant width (as in some [[Sketch (drawing)|pencil drawings]]), of several (few) constant widths (as in [[technical illustration]]s), or of freely varying widths (as in brush work or [[engraving]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Line art may tend towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] (as in much of [[Gustave Doré]]'s work), or it may be a [[caricature]], [[cartoon]], [[ideograph]], or [[glyph]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Before the development of [[photography]] and of [[halftone]]s, line art was the standard format for [[illustrations]] to be used in [[Printing|print]] publications, using black ink on white paper.  Using either [[stippling]] or [[hatching]], shades of gray could also be simulated.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

One of the most fundamental elements of art is the line. An important feature of a line is that it indicates the edge of a two-dimensional (flat) shape or a three-dimensional form.  A shape can be indicated by means of an outline and a three-dimensional form can be indicated by [[contour lines]].&lt;ref&gt;Sayre, Henry M. ''A World of Art''. Prentice Hall. Upper Saddle River, NJ: 2010. {{ISBN|978-0205887576}}  pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louis-Pierre Verwee''' or '''Louis Pierre Verwée''' ([[Kortrijk]], 19 March 1807 – [[City of Brussels|Brussels]], November 1877) was a [[Belgian]] painter known for his rural landscapes with cattle and winter landscapes.&lt;ref name=sim&gt;[https://www.simonis-buunk.nl/kunstwerk/verwee-l-p/19198 Louis-Pierre Verwee, ''Boerderij met landvolk en dieren''] at Kunsthandel Simonis &amp; Buunk {{link language|nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the principal representative of the Romantic school in Belgian landscape painting characterised by a return to nature.&lt;ref name=uk&gt;[https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=89768 Attributed to Louis-Pierre Verwee, ''Landscape with Cattle''] at the Cheltenham Art Gallery &amp; Museum on the site of the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life== 
Louis-Pierre Verwee was born in [[Kortrijk]]. He abandoned school prematurely to become a student at the Academy of Fine Arts of Kortrijk. Here his instructors included prominent landscape and animal painter [[Jan Baptiste de Jonghe]] (1785–1844). He later studied with the landscape and animal painter [[Eugène Verboeckhoven]] in Ghent. He established a lifelong friendship with Verboeckhoven and the two artists regularly created artworks together. He followed Verboeckhoven to Brussels.&lt;ref name=dob&gt;[https://www.dobiaschofsky.com/g158-A120-10394.html# Louis Pierre Verwée and Eugène Verboeckhoven ''Eisvergnügen mit Schlittschuhläufern und einem Eisfischer''] at Kunsthandel Simonis &amp; Buunk {{link language|de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Louis Pierre Verwée - Sheep among the ruins of Villers-la-Ville.jpg|thumb|220px|''Sheep among the ruins of Villers-la-Ville'']]
Later in his life he traveled through Germany, France and the Netherlands and stayed in London from 1867 to 1868. He was a friend of [[Constant Troyon]] and [[Gustave Courbet]].&lt;ref name="auction"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.auction.fr/_fr/lot/verwee-verboeckhoven-landscape-with-shepherd-mid-19th-c-6039099|title=Verwée and Verboeckhoven, Landscape with Shepherd, Mid 19th C, Maîtres Anciens et Peintures du 19ème siècle à Auctionata Paddle8 AG|website=Auction.fr|accessdate=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Claire van der Smissen, with whom he had one daughter and three sons, two of whom became painters: [[Alfred Verwee]] became an internationally renowned animal painter and [[Louis-Charles Verwee]] was a genre and portrait painter.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

==Work== 
Louis-Pierre Verwee was a landscape and animal painter. His early works were very close to those of his master Verboeckhoven, to the extent that it is often difficult to distinguish their work. Verboeckhoven sometimes painted the figures and animals in Verwee's pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://vads.ac.uk/large.php?uid=89768 Louis-Pierre Verwee, ''Shepherd with Animals''] at Maidstone Museum and Bentlif Art Gallery on the site of the National Inventory of Continental European Paintings&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Louis Pierre Verwee - Wooded river landscape with shepherdess and cattle.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Wooded river landscape with shepherdess and cattle'']]

Verwee's painting forests and rivers are in the stereotypical, romantic way that can be found in the landscapes of the painters [[Andreas Schelfhout]] (1787–1870), [[Barend Cornelis Koekkoek]] (1803–1862), [[Frans Keelhoff]] (1820–1893) and [[Johann Bernard Klombeck]] (1815–1893).

In the later part of his career he strived for innovation, but from 1837 onwards he became stuck in ever-changing winter landscapes. This type of winter landscapes had become popular thanks to the work of [[Barend Cornelis Koekkoek]] and Andreas Schelfhout. Louis-Pierre Verwee depicted these landscapes with low-hanging, heavy snow clouds over wintry land and waterways and dotted with figures. He used light blue and metallic gray in his color palette in an effort to suggest the intimate, moody aspect of such landscapes. In some of these paintings [[Florent Willems]] and Verboeckhoven painted the figures.&lt;ref name=dob/&gt;

He made a number of [[lithograph]]s after works of Eugène Verboeckhoven.

'''Maquet''' is a French manufacturer of luxury stationery, leather goods, and art prints, established in Paris in 1841 by the Maquet brothers, Hector and Charles. One of the most renowned Parisian luxury houses, Maison Maquet became official purveyor to [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] as well as to several royal courts, winning multiple awards and medals at various [[World's fair]]s over the course of its history.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=May 1923|title=Le quartier de la Paix hier et aujourd'hui|journal=La Renaissance de l’Art Français et des Industries du Luxe|pages=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Maison Maquet ==

=== Stationery manufacturer since 1841 ===
The Maquet brothers, Hector and Charles, established Maison Maquet in 1841. The eldest Maquet sibling was [[Auguste Maquet]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/espace-professionnels/professionnels/chercheurs/rech-rec-art-home/notice-artiste.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=37077&amp;retouroeuvre=%252Ffr%252Fcollections%252Fcatalogue-des-oeuvres%252Fnotice.html%253Fnnumid%253D64652|title=Photographie d'Auguste Maquet par Hector Maquet. Musée d'Orsay: Notice d'Artiste|website=musee-orsay.fr|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the novelist, playwright and famous ghost-writer of [[Alexandre Dumas]], for whom he co-wrote several masterpieces such as ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|Queen Margot]]'' and [[The Count of Monte Cristo|''The Count of'' ''Monte-Cristo'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Histoire d'une collaboration: Alexandre Dumas et Auguste Maquet. Documents inédits, portraits et fac-similés|last=Simon|first=Gustave|publisher=Le Joyeux Roger|year=2012|isbn=|location=Montreal|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maquet company was created to commercialize the patent for the first machine-made [[envelope]]s, the use of which was still little known. This patent, the application for which was filed in 1841 and granted by the French Patent Office on 17 January 1842, described how to manufacture and use the "envelope-card-letter" (''enveloppe-carte-lettre'', in French), also called "a word in the Mail" (''un mot à la Poste'').&lt;ref&gt;Patent filed by Maquet on 16 August 1841 and granted on 17 January 1842, INPI, 1BA9546. Database of 19th-century French patents: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://bases-brevets19e.inpi.fr/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the envelope was the culminating point of a variety of measures taken since the 17th century to preserve correspondence confidentiality.

In 1846, Hector and Charles Maquet separated their activities: Charles managed the envelopes factory, while Hector ran the boutique shop on [[Rue de la Paix, Paris|Rue de la Paix]]. In 1864, Hector Maquet registered as a trademark an elegant monogram mixing his initials.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark no. 1984, filed by Hector Maquet at the Commerce Court of Paris, 1864, INPI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Maison Maquet changed address numbers several times but remained on [[Rue de la Paix, Paris|Rue de la Paix]] in Paris: the house was first located at No. 20 from 1841 to 1846, then at No. 24 from 1847 to 1867, and finally at No. 10 from 1868, where it remained for about a century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the early 1970s, the house moved to 45 [[Rue Pierre Charron, Paris|Rue Pierre Charron]], where it kept a boutique shop until 1993. Though it did not have any commercial branch in the 19th century, Maquet eventually opened one in [[Nice]] at 16 Masséna Avenue (now Avenue de Verdun) in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.fr/pin/451697037618982326/|title=Maison Maquet (Paris-Nice)|website=Pinterest|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Official Purveyor to Empress of France and to celebrity customers ===
Maison Maquet soon became one of the most fashionable personal stationery houses and enjoyed great fame during the [[Second French Empire|French Second Empire]]. It even obtained the warrant of "official purveyor to [[Eugénie de Montijo|Her Majesty the Empress]]". Empress Eugénie, wife of [[Napoleon III]] regularly visited the shop on Rue de la Paix, where she was served by Madame Maquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rapport du Comité d’Installation, Papeterie et Papetiers, Exposition Universelle Internationale de 1900|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maquet was also favored by French aristocratic elites, and its clients included the [[Pauline von Metternich|Princess Pauline von Metternich]], as well as the Rohan-Chabot and Costa de Beauregard families.&lt;ref&gt;Invoices for the wedding of their respective daughters, Countess of Rohan Chabot, February 1895, and Countess Costa de Beauregard, June 1895. Forney Library, 4-MS-FG-00122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maison Maquet's products were particularly trendy among foreign royal courts. Maquet notably supplied the Russian court, including the [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Altenburg|Great Duchess]] and the [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Great Duke Konstantin of Russia]]. In fact, the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' reported in 1875 that the "stationary was adorned with the Great Duke's [[coat of arms]], embellished with gold and colors enamel; of unparalleled richness and elegance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=21 October 1875|title=Petite Gazette|work=Le Figaro|page=3|language=fr|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k275744h/f3.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince Axel of Denmark was also a faithful client of Maquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drouotonline.com/vente-aux-encheres-drouot/4673/souvenirs-historiques?offset=0&amp;query=&amp;lotGroupTheme=|title=Collection du prince et de la princesse Axel de Danemark – Souvenirs historiques militaria|website=''drouotonline.com''|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, with the change of political regime and the onset of the [[French Third Republic|IIIrd Republic]], Maquet renewed its clientele and started to supply Republican institutions, including the Presidential Palace known as [[Élysée Palace|Palais de l’Elysée]], Paris City Hall – the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville de Paris]] – and French embassies, as well as financial institutions such as the [[Bank of France|French National Bank]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Commercial catalog of Maison Maquet, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prestigious customer was the [[Paris Opera]], for which Maquet printed several leaflets and programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Théâtre national de l'opéra. La légende de Saint-Christophe de M. Vincent d'Indy : [estampe]|year=1920|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8438184d|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A new era for Maquet ===
In 1908, Maquet changed hands: it became the property of businessman and architect Léon Tissier,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58270813|title=Archives commerciales de la France : journal hebdomadaire...|date=25 December 1907|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; who rejuvenated the company through multiple artistic collaborations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=L'Art du parfum : Découverte et collection des flacons de parfum|last=Lefkowith|first=Christie Mayer|publisher=Celiv|year=|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissier, the son of a travel items manufacturer, also extended Maquet's range of leather goods products.&lt;ref&gt;"Un Lalique au Ministère de la Défense?" on ''www.memoiredeshommes.sga.defense.gouv.fr''&lt;/ref&gt; Intent on making his way into the world of printing, he invested in new buildings and printing machinery located rue de Langhouat in the [[Goutte d'Or|Goutte d’Or]] neighborhood in Paris, which he eventually yielded to the Établissements Gérault-Fouqueray in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5578233p|title=Archives commerciales de la France : journal hebdomadaire...|date=22 April 1936|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5578238r|title=Archives commerciales de la France : journal hebdomadaire...|date=24 April 1936|publisher=[s.n.]|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Maison Maquet was acquired by stationery manufacturer and engraver Cassegrain, only to cease its operations in 1994.

Twenty years later, in 2014, Maquet was taken over by [[Luvanis]], a private investment company specializing in reviving sleeping beauty brands, which was notably behind the revival of trunk maker [[Moynat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/designer-luxury/de-lummens-revival-model-5886947/|title=Arnaud de Lummen: Fashion’s Brand Reviver|last=Socha|first=Miles|date=2 May 2012|work=Women's Wear Daily|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of couture house [[Paul Poiret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://madame.lefigaro.fr/style/les-dessous-de-la-renaissance-de-la-griffe-paul-poiret-sur-les-podiums-paris-yiqing-yin-270218-147461|title=Les dessous de la renaissance de la griffe Paul Poiret sur les podiums parisiens|work=Madame Figaro|access-date=11 May 2018|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and services ==
Maison Maquet was long regarded as the finest luxury personal stationery in Paris.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At first, the house specialized in envelopes and luxury stationery, creating custom-made papers with coats of arms and monograms, heraldic paintings on parchment, business cards, wedding invitations, birth announcements, dinner invitations, and dance cards.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Commercial catalogs of Maison Maquet, non-dated and 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; It then extended its expertise to manufacture luxury leather goods, metalwork, and watches, before branching out to engraving and art printing.

Maquet advertized through witty commercial catalogs, theatre programs, and fashion magazines such as the luxury magazine ''Les Modes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O693530/trade-card-unknown/|title=Maquet {{!}} Trade card {{!}} V&amp;A Search the Collections|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parismuseescollections.paris.fr/fr/musee-carnavalet/oeuvres/etrennes-objets-d-art-curiosites-fayences-montees#infos-principales|title=Maquet {{!}} Etrennes, objets d'art, curiosités, fayences montées {{!}} Paris Musées|website=parismuseescollections.paris.fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luxury stationery ===
Maison Maquet originally produced envelopes and various items of fine stationery. Its most famous in-house paper was known as the "empress paper" (''papier impératrice''), in an elegant shade of pearly grey between white and azure paper.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie de Fontanges, ''Les Succès du Jour'', May 1869.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maquet also manufactured travel diaries and notebooks. The French author [[Prosper Mérimée]] notably wrote the short novel ''La Chambre Bleue'' in 1866,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/La_Chambre_bleue_(M%C3%A9rim%C3%A9e)|title=La Chambre bleue (Mérimée) – Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org|language=fr|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]], on a Maquet notebook bound with dark green Morocco leather, discreetly hand-tooled in gold leaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Catalogue de l’exposition organisée pour commémorer le 150e anniversaire de la naissance de Prosper Mérimée|last=|first=|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale|year=1953|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Maquet’s, one could find all manners of writing accessories, from inkpots to blotting paper, including notepads, pencils, dip pens, and even paper knives and letter openers made of chiselled silver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Luxury leather goods ===
While still producing envelopes and stationery, Maison Maquet became a leading luxury leather goods manufacturer. In addition to her personal stationery, [[Eugénie de Montijo|Empress Eugénie]] also purchased her leather goods at Maquet.

Maquet's luxury leather goods department catered to a clientele of artists such as the French comedian Jane Sabrier, who matched one of her fashionable outfits with a Maquet bag in reindeer leather in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=15 November 1909|title=La mode actuelle au théâtre|journal=Comoedia Illustré|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maison Maquet proposed a wide range of leather goods, including handbags and travel bags, as well as vanity cases, wallets, cardholders and purses. Maquet also sold lawyers’ satchels (''serviettes d’avocats'') and garnished tourist blotters ("''buvards-touriste garnis''").&lt;ref&gt;Commercials for Maquet in ''L’Illustration'', on 5 November 1910, and 4 January 2 August and 3 November 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

The house developed a whole line of travel items. Inkpots, paper trays, as well as small leather goods, both sturdy and beautiful, were featured in the house's commercial catalogs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1938, Maquet was selected to contribute pieces to the trousseau of the two dolls gifted to [[Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] during the official visit of their parents, [[George VI|King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]. The gift, intended to reinforce the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'' between France and the United Kingdom, displayed French craftsmanship through a 360-piece trousseau in the tradition of Parisian haute couture. Maquet's contributions consisted in leather goods and accessories: two writing cases, one in blue, the other in red, each with its notepaper monogrammed to the dolls’ initials, and a miniature gold pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dolls for the Princesses: The Story of France and Marianne|last=Eaton|first=Faith|publisher=Royal Collection Enterprises|year=2002|isbn=|location=London|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/93234/writing-cases|title=Maquet [Paris]  - Writing cases|website=''royalcollection.org.uk''|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Hubert de Givenchy]]'s muse, shopped at Maquet's for her leather goods. She notably possessed five Maquet-branded wallets, all made of black leather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/audrey-hepburn-personal-collection-part-iii/five-black-leather-wallets-55/56049|title=Maquet, Five Black Leather Wallets. Audrey Hepburn: The Personal Collection, Part III|last=Christies|website=''Christies.com''|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watches and silverware ===
Maquet added watchmaking to its activities, selling bracelet watches and clocks for [[Phaeton (carriage)|phaetons]] and automobiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Applying the same craftsmanship to tobacco articles, the house commercialized lighters, cigar and cigarette boxes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In the early 20th century, it made many lighters from Chinese snuff boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.fr/claudefp/maison-maquet-paris-nice-briquets-%C3%A0-friction/|title=Maison Maquet (Paris-Nice): briquets à friction|website=Pinterest|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maquet became famous for combining old components into new objects in the [[Orientalism|orientalist fashion]] typical of [[decorative arts]] at the time.

Furthermore, Maquet boxes, renowned for their refinement, were used to store letters as much as jewels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Photographs ===
Hector Maquet notably shot the portrait of his brother [[Auguste Maquet|Auguste]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Soon he sold works of other photographers in the Paris boutique, including those of Polish photographer [[Bolesław Matuszewski|Boleslaw Matuszewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazaraki|first=Magdalena|date=1 December 2004|title=Boleslaw Matuszewski :photographe et opérateur de cinéma|url=https://journals.openedition.org/1895/301|journal=1895.

=== Engraving and art printing ===
In the early 20th century, Maison Maquet diversified into engraving, and art printing.

==== Artistic menus ====
Maquet thus made artistic menus for:

* The Paris [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], such as the lunch offered to [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on 25 April 1910;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bibliotheques-specialisees.paris.fr/ark:/73873/pf0000649974?highlight=Maquet&amp;posInPage=12&amp;bookmark=aa62aa06-ccda-4f9e-8e84-6685b670d0ba&amp;queryid=b6ccfbab-b3ff-4b81-b968-14b90435448c&amp;searchType=all|title=Municipalité de Paris.

==== Posters ====
Maison Maquet printed, among others, a poster for the third French National Defense Loan, which was conceived by [[Paul-Albert Besnard|Albert Besnard]] in 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://recherche.archives.somme.fr/ark:/58483/a011353927000nPXrpu|title=Documents isolés – 3e emprunt de défense nationale.

Maquet created posters for [[Ocean liner]]s, including for the Compagnie de Navigation Sud-Atlantique  and for the [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]], commonly known as the "French Line.”

==== Bookplates ====
Maquet, with its experience in stationery, engraving, and printing, as well as its ties to literary men, quite naturally started to develop exclusive [[bookplate]]s. The Prince of Hohenlohe, who was the Chancellor of the German Empire from 1894 to 1900, had his bookplate engraved by Maquet, as did [[André Kostolany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebay.fr/itm/EX-LIBRIS-ANDRE-B-KOSTOLANY-1906-1999-GRAVE-PAR-MAQUET/352270162829?hash=item5204f01b8d:g:vtAAAOSwEeFVL7RK|title=Ex-libris André B. Kostolany (1906–1999), gravé par Maquet|website=eBay|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raoul Warocqué]] (who ordered no less than 10,000 ex-libris from Maquet),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=DM1HAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=maquet+ex+libris&amp;dq=maquet+ex+libris&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1suWpqNvaAhUNY1AKHTAXCYUQ6AEILDAB|title=La vie quotidienne de grands bourgeois au XIXe siècle: les Warocqué|last=Eynde|first=Maurice Van Den|date=1989|publisher=Musée Royal de Mariemont|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thyra Seillière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.edition-originale.com/en/literature/first-and-precious-books/bataille-la-vierge-folle-1910-20998|title=La vierge folle|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Commercial catalogues, fans, and packaging ====
Maison Maquet developed tight commercial links to other Parisian luxury houses for which it created commercial catalogues. Specifically, Maquet devised the commercial catalogues of perfumers Rigaud,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; L.T. Piver,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalogue.gazette-drouot.com/html/g/recherche.jsp?numPage=1&amp;minEstim=&amp;query=maquet+piver&amp;maxEstim=&amp;npp=20&amp;filterDate=2&amp;_exact=&amp;email=&amp;Submit=OK|title=Divers objets créés par Maquet pour LT Piver, dont des éventails publicitaires, des emballages et boîtes|website=catalogue.gazette-drouot.com|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.delcampe.net/fr/collections/calendriers/grand-format-1921-40/carte-ancienne-parfumee-calendrier-1933-1934-maison-l-t-piver-parfumeur-paris-parfum-daventure-maquet-grav-554279867.html|title=Carte ancienne parfumée – Calendrier 1933 / 1934 – Maison L.T. PIVER parfumeur PARIS – Parfum d'Aventure – Maquet Grav.|website=Delcampe – La Marketplace des collectionneurs|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Guerlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6495030b|title=[Notice sur l'histoire de la parfumerie Guerlain]|last=Guerlain|publisher=impr. de Maquet|location=Paris|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Maquet conceived ephemerals and various advertising materials for champagne houses such as [[Moët &amp; Chandon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/moet-chandon-epernay-maison-fondee-en-1743|title=Moët &amp; Chandon Epernay. Maison fondée en 1743 {{!}} Les Arts décoratifs|website=collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr|language=fr|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, it notably printed a commercial for [[Charles Heidsieck (Champagne)|Charles Heidsieck]].

The house conceived and printed many commercial fans, some of which are kept in the collections of the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/skinwebsearch?f%5B0%5D=field_skfulltext:maquet|title=Maquet {{!}} Les Arts décoratifs|website=collections.lesartsdecoratifs.fr|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Maquet printed many illustrations on advertising fans of [[Duvelleroy|Maison Duvelleroy]].

More importantly, Maison Maquet built fruitful partnerships with Paris haute couture houses, such as [[Paul Poiret]], for which it created heading paper,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Lepape, heading paper of Paul Poiret, printed by Maquet, 1910s, Palais Galliéra, GALK3054.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jeanne Paquin]], for which it created a luxury commercial catalog for "Fans and fur at Paquin" in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coutaubegarie.com/html/fiche.jsp?id=2771326&amp;np=6&amp;lng=fr&amp;npp=20&amp;ordre=&amp;aff=1&amp;r|title=Lepape, Iribe, Barbier, L'éventail et la fourrure chez Paquin, Maquet|website=Couteau-Bégarie|language=fr|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape,'' 1911 ====
Maquet printed the volume ''Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape'' in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/353154|title=Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose enduring success mirrors its great influence on the renewal of fashion illustration. Poiret collaborated with drawing artists, including [[Paul Iribe]] and Georges Lepape. This 1911 volume broke away from traditional fashion plates and gives both a graphic and a stylized representation of fashion.

==== The ''Modes et manières d’aujourd’hui'' magazine, 1912–1914 ====
Following the example set by ''Les Choses de Paul Poiret vues par George Lepape'' (1911), Maison Maquet began publishing an annual luxury magazine, ''Modes et manières d’aujourd’hui,'' each issue of which was beautifully illustrated by a different artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/162875|title=Modes et Manières d&amp;#39;Aujourd&amp;#39;hui {{!}} French {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|dead-url=|access-date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue, out in 1912, relied once again on Georges Lepape who created 12 colored plates printed on Japanese paper. In 1913, the magazine commissioned Martin, and in 1914 [[George Barbier (illustrator)|George Barbier]].

==== Artistic collaborations ====
Maison Maquet collaborated with drawing artists, lithographers, poster makers, and engravers,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; including:

* Guy Arnoux

[[File:MAVO Dance.jpg|thumb|MAVO Dance]]

'''MAVO''' was a radical Japanese art movement of the 1920s. Founded in 1923, as a re-institution of the Japanese Association of Futurist Artists, the anarchistic artist group displayed an outdoor exhibit in Ueno Park in Tokyo in protest of conservatism in the Japanese art world. The group leader was [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]] (1901 - 1977). The group deployed an interdisciplinary array of performance art, painting, illustration and architecture, to communicate anti-establishment messages to the mainstream. Fueled by responses to industrial development, the MAVO group created works about crisis, peril and uncertainty. Art Historian, [[Gennifer Weisenfeld]] has written that Mavo sought to reintegrate art into daily life.  Other artists involved in the movement include [[Masamu Yanase]], [[Kamenosuke Ogata]], [[Shuzo Oura]] and [[Shinro Kadowaki]], and later [[Osamu Shibuya]], [[Shuichiro Kinoshita]], [[Iwane Sumiya]], [[Tatsuo Okada]], [[Michinao Takamizawa]], [[Kimimaro Yabashi]], [[Tatsuo Todai]], [[Masao Kato]] and [[Kyojiro Haiwara]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weisenfeld|first1=Gennifer|title=Mavo: Japanese Artists and the Avant-Garde, 1905-1931|date=2002|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520223387|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520223387}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Yang|title=Russia Constructed: the Practice of Avant-gardism in Taisho-era Japan, 1912-1926|date=December 2009|url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/.../1/New_RU_JP_Hayes.pdf|website=osu.edu|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;“Mavoist” artists sought to disrupt or blur the boundaries between art and daily life. They rebelled against the establishment by combining industrial products with painting or printmaking, usually in collage form. Their performance art protests against social injustice deployed theatrical eroticism, that mocked public norms for morality at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monskop.org|title=MAVO|url=http://monoskop.org/Mavo|website=Monoskop|accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

During the 1923 demonstration, [[Takamizawa Michinao]], one of the members of MAVO, threw rocks in protest, through a glass ceiling of a building housing an exhibition of artworks curated by Nika-kai (The Second Society). Nika-kai was established in 1914 to oppose the conservative [[Bunten]], the governmental Ministry of Education Exhibition. Murayama had spent 1922 in Berlin where he became familiar with the social satire painting of [[Georg Grosz]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s "spiritual" abstract paintings, [[El Lissitzky]]'s constructivist works, and [[Alexander Archipenko]]'s sculptures. As a cultural leader and public figure, Murayama had a confident, flamboyant personality, an androgynous physical presence sporting a bob-hairstyle, and posing for photographs in states of undress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Larking|first1=Matthew|title=Mavo, the movement that rocked Japan’s art scene|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2012/04/26/arts/mavo-the-movement-that-rocked-japans-art-scene-2/#.VttW5ulE90A|accessdate=5 March 2016|publisher=The Japan Times|date=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==

Tatsuo Okada and Tomoyoshi Murayama edited MAVO magazine, that published seven issues between July 1924 and August 1925. The publication included essays on socio-cultural art, poetry, and theatrical texts. The pages included original linocut prints and photographic reproductions of visual art that often appropriated the work of their own members. Reuse and recycling from one project to another was one of the group's trademark strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=William|title=Poetry and New Media: An Essay on the 1920's Avant-garde, Focusing on Hagiwara Kyojiro's "Advertising Tower !"  詩と新メディア : 萩原恭次郎の｢広告塔！｣を中心にした一九二〇年代のアヴァンギャルド論考|journal=Comparative Literature and Culture|date=1999|issue=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists' books==

Several members of the group produced short-run artist's books including Hagiwara Kyojiro's ''Shikei senkoku'' (Death Sentence), an anthology of visual poetry published in 1925, and illustrated by MAVO; Ernst Toller's ''Tsubame no sho'', (The Swallow Book) illustrated by Tatsuo Okada and translated by Tomoyoshi Murayama (1925); and Hideo Saito's ''Aozameta douteikyo'',  (The Pale-faced Virgin's Mad Thoughts) visual poetry published in 1926 and illustrated by Tatsuo Okada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weisenfeld|first1=Gennifer|title=Mavo's Conscious Constructivism: Art, Individualism, and Daily Life in Interwar Japan|journal=Art Journal|date=Autumn 1996|volume=55|issue=3|pages=64–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a January 14, 2000 interview with Bookreporter.com, [[Dean Koontz]] was quoted as saying "I'm half way through ''Ride the Storm'', the third Christopher Snow story, but another book will appear between ''False Memory'' and ''Ride''." 

As of 2003, Koontz was still reportedly "halfway through" ''Ride the Storm.''&lt;ref name="teenreads"&gt;[http://www.teenreads.com/authors/au-koontz-dean.asp Interview with Dean Koontz], teenreads.com, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, there is still no word on if ''Ride the Storm'' will ever be finished or released.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37726">[[File:L'adoration des bergers (La Tour).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Georges de La Tour]] c. 1644]]
[[File:Meister von Hohenfurth 002.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Master of Vyšší Brod]], a [[Bohemia]]n master, c. 1350. The influence of Italian Byzantine painting was strong in the court of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]].]]

The [[Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of [[Christian art]] since the 4th century.

The artistic depictions of the ''Nativity'' or birth of [[Jesus]], celebrated at [[Christmas]], are based on the narratives in the Bible, in the [[Gospel]]s of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] and [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and further elaborated by written, oral and artistic tradition. Christian art includes a great many representations of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]]. Such works are generally referred to as the "[[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]]" or "Virgin and Child". They are not usually representations of the ''Nativity'' specifically, but are often devotional objects representing a particular aspect or attribute of the Virgin Mary, or Jesus. ''Nativity'' pictures, on the other hand, are specifically illustrative, and include many narrative details; they are a normal component of the sequences illustrating both the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] and the [[Life of the Virgin]].

The Nativity has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, [[panel painting]]s, [[manuscript illumination]]s, [[stained glass]] windows and [[oil painting]]s. The subject of the Nativity is often used for [[altarpiece]]s, many of these combining both painted and sculptural elements. Other sculptural representations of the Nativity include ivory miniatures, carved stone sarcophagi, architectural features such as capitals and door lintels, and free standing sculptures.

Free-standing sculptures may be grouped into a [[Nativity scene]] (crib, ''creche'' or ''presepe'') within or outside a church, home, public place or natural setting. The scale of the figures may range from miniature to life-sized. These Nativity scenes probably derived from acted ''[[tableau vivant]]s'' in Rome, although Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] gave the tradition a great boost. This tradition continues to this day, with small versions made of [[porcelain]], plaster, plastic or cardboard sold for display in the home. The acted scenes evolved into the [[Nativity play]].

== The wider Nativity story in art ==
[[File:Spišské Podhradie Narodenie (1490).jpg|thumb|The stable is just outside the city walls, with the shepherds on the hill behind; Slovakia, c. 1490]]
The scope of the subject matter which relates to the Nativity story begins with the [[genealogy of Jesus]] as listed in the Gospels of both Matthew and Luke. This lineage, or [[family tree]] is often depicted visually with a [[Tree of Jesse]], springing from the side of [[Jesse]], the father of [[King David]].

The Gospels go on to relate that a virgin, Mary, was betrothed to a man [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], but before she became fully his wife, an [[angel]] appeared to her, announcing that she would give birth to a baby who would be the [[Son of God]]. This incident, referred to as the [[Annunciation]] is often depicted in art. Matthew's Gospel relates that an angel dispelled Joseph's distress at discovering Mary's pregnancy, and instructed him to name the child Jesus (meaning "God saves").&lt;ref&gt;Matthew:1:21. The name Jesus is the Biblical Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua meaning "God, our salvation".&lt;/ref&gt; This scene is depicted only occasionally.

In Luke's Gospel, Joseph and Mary travelled to [[Bethlehem]], the family of Joseph's ancestors, to be listed in a tax census; the Journey to Bethlehem is a very rare subject in the West, but shown in some large Byzantine cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:58&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Mary gave birth to the infant, in a stable, because there was no room available in the inns. At this time, an angel appeared to shepherds on a hillside, telling them that the "Saviour, Christ the Lord" was born. The shepherds went to the stable and found the baby, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in the feed trough, or "manger", as the angel had described.

In the liturgical calendar, the Nativity is followed by the [[Circumcision of Christ]] on January 1, which is mentioned only in passing in the Gospels,&lt;ref&gt;Luke 2:21&lt;/ref&gt; and which is assumed to have taken place according to Jewish law and custom, and the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] (or "Candlemas"), celebrated on February 2, and described by Luke.&lt;ref&gt;The dates vary slightly between churches and calendars – see the respective articles. In particular, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches celebrate the visit of the Magi, as well as the Nativity, on December 25th of their [[Julian calendar|liturgical calendar]], which is January 7th of the usual [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both have iconographic traditions, not covered here.

The narrative is taken up in the Gospel of Matthew, and relates that "wise men" from the east saw a [[Star of Bethlehem|star]], and followed it, believing it would lead them to a new-born king. On arriving in Jerusalem they proceed to the palace where a king might be found, and enquire from the resident despot, King Herod. Herod is worried about being supplanted, but he sends them out, asking them return when they have found the child. They follow the star to Bethlehem, where they give the child gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The men are then warned in a dream that Herod wished to kill the child, and so return to their country another way. Although the gospel mentions neither the number nor the status of the wise men, known as "the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]]", tradition has extrapolated that since there were three gifts, there were three wise men, who are generally also given the rank of king, and so they are also called the "Three Kings". It is as kings that they are almost always depicted in art after about 900.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:105&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of subjects but the [[Adoration of the Magi]], when they present their gifts, and, in Christian tradition, worship Jesus, has always been much the most popular.

Either the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] by the angel, or the [[Adoration of the Shepherds]], which shows the shepherds worshipping the infant Christ, have often been combined with the Nativity proper, and the visit of the Magi, since very early times. The former represented the spreading of the message of Christ to the Jewish people, and the latter to the heathen peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kerald (Meister des Codex Egberti) 001.jpg|thumb|[[Massacre of the Innocents]], [[Egbert, Archbishop of Trier|Codex Egberti]], late 10th century.]]

There are also many detailed series of artworks, ranging from stained glass to carved capitals to fresco cycles that depict every aspect of the story, which formed part of both of the two most popular subjects for cycles: the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' and the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''. It is also one of the [[Twelve Great Feasts]] of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], a popular cycle in [[Byzantine art]].

The story continues with [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] asking his advisers about ancient prophesies describing the birth of such a child. As a result of their advice, he sends soldiers to kill every boy child under the age of two in the city of Bethlehem. But Joseph has been warned in a dream, and flees to Egypt with Mary and the baby, Jesus. The gruesome scene of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], as the murder of the babies is generally referred, was particularly depicted by Early Renaissance and [[Baroque]] painters. The [[Flight into Egypt]] was another popular subject, showing Mary with the baby on a donkey, led by Joseph (borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine ''Journey to Bethlehem'').

[[File:Toppling of the Pagan Idols (Bedford Master).jpg|thumb|left|Gothic toppling idol on the flight]]

From the [[Early Netherlandish painting|15th century in the Netherlands]] onwards, it was more usual to show the non-Biblical subject of the [[Holy Family]] resting on the journey, the ''Rest on the Flight to Egypt'', often accompanied by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent, [[James the Brother of the Lord]], interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The subject only emerges in the second half of the 14th century. Schiller:124. In some Orthodox traditions the older boy is the one who protects Joseph from the "shepherd-tempter" in the main Nativity scene.&lt;/ref&gt; The background to these scenes usually (until the [[Council of Trent]] tightened up on such additions to scripture) includes a number of apocryphal [[miracle]]s, and gives an opportunity for the emerging genre of [[landscape painting]]. In the ''Miracle of the Corn'' the pursuing soldiers interrogate peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully say it was when they were sowing their [[wheat]] seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the ''Miracle of the Idol'' a pagan statue falls from its plinth as the infant Jesus passes by, and a spring gushes up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In further, less commonly seen, legends a group of robbers abandon their plan to rob the travellers, and a [[date palm]] tree bends down to allow them to pluck the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:117–123. The date palm incident is also in the [[Quran]]. There are two different falling statue legends, one related to the arrival of the family at the Egyptian city of Sotina, and the other usually shown in open country. Sometimes both are shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another subject is the meeting of the infant Jesus with his cousin, the infant [[John the Baptist]], who, according to legend was rescued from Bethlehem before the massacre by the [[Archangel Uriel]], and joined the Holy Family in Egypt. This meeting of the two Holy Children was to be painted many artists during the Renaissance period, after being popularized by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and then [[Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Leonardo's [[Virgin of the Rocks]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Depiction ==

=== Early Christianity ===
[[File:Adoration magi Pio Christiano Inv31459.jpg|thumb|Magi bearing gifts, 4th-century sarcophagus, Rome]]
The earliest pictorial representations of Jesus' Nativity come from [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in [[Rome]] and [[Gallia Narbonensis|Southern Gaul]] of around this date.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:59&lt;/ref&gt; They are later than the first scenes of the [[Adoration of the Magi]], which appears in the [[catacombs of Rome]], where [[Early Christian]]s buried their dead, often decorating the walls of the underground passages and vaults with paintings. Many of these predate the legalisation of Christian worship by the [[Emperor Constantine]] in the early 4th century. Typically the Magi move in step together, holding their gifts in front of them, towards a seated Virgin with Christ on her lap. They closely resemble the motif of [[tribute]]-bearers which is common in the art of most Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cultures, and goes back at least two millennia earlier in the case of Egypt; in contemporary Roman art defeated barbarians carry golden wreaths towards an enthroned Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:9821 - Milano - Sant'Ambrogio - Sarcofago di Stilicone - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 25-Apr-2007.jpg|thumb|left|4th-century sarcophagus, [[Milan]]; one of the earliest Nativity images]]
The earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or [[wicker]] basket. The [[ox]] and [[donkey|ass]] are always present, even when Mary or any other human is not. Although they are not mentioned in the Gospel accounts they were regarded as confirmed by scripture from some [[Old Testament]] verses, such as [[Isaiah]] 1,3:"The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib" and [[Habakkuk]] 3,2: "in the midst of the two beasts wilt thou be known", and their presence was never questioned by theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:60. In fact this sense of the Habakkuk is found in the Hebrew and Greek Bibles, but [[Jerome]]'s Latin [[Vulgate]], followed by the [[Authorised Version]], translates differently:"O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known" in the AV&lt;/ref&gt; They were regarded by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Ambrose]] and others as representing the [[Jewish]] people, weighed down by the Law (the ox), and the pagan peoples, carrying the sin of idolatry (the ass). Christ was arrived to free both from their burdens. Mary is only shown when the scene is the ''Adoration of the Magi'', but often one of the shepherds, or a [[prophet]] with a [[scroll]], is present. From the end of the 5th century (following the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]]), Mary becomes a fixture in the scene; then as later Joseph is a more variable element. Where a building is shown, it is usually a ''tugurium'', a simple tiled roof supported by posts.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:59–62&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Byzantine image ===
[[File:Mural - Birth of Christ.jpg|thumb|Modern Greek Orthodox mural in [[Jordan]], using a depiction little changed in over a millennium.]]

A new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], was to set the essential form of [[Eastern Orthodox]] images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave – or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the [[Church of the Nativity]], and well-established as a place of [[pilgrimage]], with the approval of the Church. Above the opening a mountain, represented in miniature, rises up.&lt;ref&gt;The mountain follows Scriptural verses such as Habakkuk 3.3 "God [came] from Mount Paran", and the title of Mary as "Holy mountain". Schiller:63&lt;/ref&gt; Mary now lies recovering on a large stuffed cushion or couch ("kline" in Greek) beside the infant, who is on a raised structure,&lt;ref&gt;partly reflecting the arrangement in the Church of the Nativity, where pilgrims already peered under an altar into the actual cave (now the altar is much higher). The actual altar is sometimes shown. Schiller:63&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Joseph rests his head on his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:62-3&lt;/ref&gt; He is often part of a separate scene in the foreground, where Jesus is being bathed by midwives (Jesus is therefore shown twice). Despite the less than ideal conditions, Mary is [[lying-in]], the term for the period of enforced [[bed rest]] in the [[postpartum period]] after [[childbirth]] that was prescribed until modern times.  The midwife or midwives come from early apocryphal sources; the main one is usually called [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], and has her own ''miracle of the withered hand'', although this is rare in art. They featured in most medieval dramas and [[mystery play]]s of the Nativity, which often influenced painted depictions. Several apocryphal accounts speak of a great light illuminating the scene, also taken to be the [[Star of Bethlehem#Eastern Orthodoxy|star]] of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and this is indicated by a circular disc at the top of the scene, with a band coming straight down from it – both are often dark in colour.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magi may be shown approaching at the top left on horseback, wearing strange pillbox-like headgear, and the shepherds at the right of the cave. Angels usually surround the scene if there is room, including the top of the cave; often one is telling the shepherds the good news of Christ's birth. The figure of an old man, often dressed in animal skins, who begins as one of the shepherds in early depictions, but later sometimes addresses Joseph, is usually interpreted as the Prophet [[Isaiah]], or a hermit repeating his prophecy, though in later Orthodox depictions he sometimes came to be regarded as the "Tempter" (the "shepherd-tempter"), an Orthodox term for [[Satan]], who is encouraging Joseph to doubt the Virgin Birth.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:66. In late  works a young man may fend the tempter off. See: Léonid Ouspensky, ''The Meaning of Icons'', p. 160, 1982, [[St Vladimir's Seminary]], {{ISBN|0-913836-99-0}}. In pp.157–160 there is a full account of the later Orthodox iconography of the Nativity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox icon of the Nativity uses certain imagery parallel to that on the [[epitaphios (liturgy)|epitaphios]] ([[burial shroud]] of Jesus) and other icons depicting the [[burial of Jesus]] on [[Good Friday]].  This is done intentionally to illustrate the [[theology|theological]] point that the purpose of the [[Incarnation of Christ]] was to make possible the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. The [[icon]] of the Nativity depicts the [[Christ Child]] wrapped in [[swaddling clothes]] reminiscent of his burial wrappings. The child is often shown lying on a stone, representing the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]], rather than a [[manger]]. The Cave of the Nativity is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried. Some icons of the Nativity show the Virgin Mary kneeling rather than reclining, indicating the tradition that the [[Theotokos]] gave birth to Christ without pain (to contradict the perceived [[heresy]] in [[Nestorianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sources of light are the infant Jesus, the shepherds' fire on the hill behind, and the angel who appears to them.]]
The West adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the stable rather than the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being got ready or with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in [[Giotto]], one may hand Jesus over to his mother. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:74&lt;/ref&gt;

The image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of Saint [[Bridget of Sweden]] (1303–1373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself, and describes the Virgin as blond-haired; many depictions reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect, and the Nativity remained very commonly treated with [[chiaroscuro]] through to the Baroque. Other details such as a single candle "attached to the wall", and the presence of [[God the Father]] above, also come from Bridget's vision:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the virgin knelt down with great veneration in an attitude of prayer, and her back was turned to the manger.... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in a moment she gave birth to her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle.... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. Then I heard also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Schiller:78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; After this the Virgin kneels to pray to her child, to be joined by Saint Joseph, and this (technically known as the "Adoration of Christ" or "of the Child") becomes one of the commonest depictions in the 15th century, largely replacing the reclining Virgin in the West. Versions of this depiction occur as early as 1300, well before Bridget's vision, and have a [[Franciscan]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:76-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pierre Bladelin Triptych central panel WGA.jpg|thumb|left|250|This Nativity by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], part of the [[Bladelin Altarpiece]], follows Bridget's vision, with [[donor portrait]] and Romanesque ruins]]

[[Saint Joseph]], traditionally regarded as an old man, is often shown asleep in Nativities, and became a somewhat comical figure in some depictions, untidily dressed, and unable to help with proceedings. In some depictions, mostly German, he wears a [[Jewish hat]].&lt;ref&gt;For example Schiller, figs. 173 &amp; 175, both from [[Lower Saxony]] between 1170 and 1235, &amp; fig. 183, 14th century German.&lt;/ref&gt;  In medieval [[mystery play]]s, he was usually a comic figure, amiable but somewhat incapable, although he is sometimes showing cutting up his [[hose (clothing)|hose]] to make the swaddling-cloth for the child,&lt;ref&gt;from about 1400; apparently this detail comes from popular songs. Schiller:80&lt;/ref&gt; or lighting a fire. 

Saint Joseph's cult was increasingly promoted in the late Middle Ages in the West, by the [[Franciscan]]s and others. His feast was added to the Roman [[Breviary]] in 1479. By the 15th century he is often more dignified, and this improvement continued through the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]], until a resurgence of Marian emphasis in the 17th century again often leaves him stranded on the margins of Nativity compositions. The candle lit by Saint Joseph in Bridget's vision becomes an attribute, which he is often shown holding, lit or unlit, in broad daylight.

In a fully illuminated [[Book of hours]] it was normal to include pages illustrating all four of the ''Nativity'', the ''Announcement to the Shepherds'', the ''Adoration of the Magi'' and the ''Flight into Egypt'' (and/or the ''Massacre of the Innocents'') as part of the eight images in the sequence of the [[Hours of the Virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, John, ''The Book of Hours'',p.28 , 1977, Thomas Y Crowell Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-690-01654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativity images became increasing popular in panel paintings in the 15th century, although on [[altarpiece]]s the [[Holy Family]] often had to share the picture space with [[donor portrait]]s. In [[Early Netherlandish painting]] the usual simple shed, little changed from Late Antiquity, developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]]. The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of [[Jan van Eyck]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49–50.

In fact the Basilica was built in the 4th century. Some later painters used the remains as a basis for their depictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Renaissance and after ===
From the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper, partly as the subject lent itself to many pictorial details and rich colouration, and partly as paintings became larger, with more space for the more crowded subject. The scene is increasingly conflated with the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' from the late Middle Ages onwards, though they have been shown combined on occasions since [[Late Antiquity]]. In the West the Magi developed large exotically-dressed retinues, which sometimes threaten to take over the composition by the time of the Renaissance; there is undoubtedly a loss of concentration on the religious meaning of the scenes in some examples, especially in 15th-century [[Florence]], where large secular paintings were still a considerable novelty. The large and famous wall-painting of the ''Procession of the Magi'' in the [[Magi Chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici]] there, painted by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]] in 1459–1461 and full of portraits of the family, only reveals its religious subject by its location in a chapel, and its declared title. There are virtually no indications that this is the subject contained in the work itself, although the altarpiece for the chapel was the ''[[Adoration in the Forest (Lippi)|Adoration in the Forest]]'' by [[Filippo Lippi]] (now Berlin).

[[File:Magi St Andrews.JPG|thumb|250px|''The Magi'', stained glass by John Hardman and Co in [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney]]]]

From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, though [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''. The compositions, as with most religious scenes, becomes more varied as artistic originality becomes more highly regarded than iconographic tradition; the works illustrated by [[Gerard van Honthorst]], [[Georges de La Tour]], and [[Charles Le Brun]] of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' all show different poses and actions by Mary, none quite the same as the traditional ones. The subject becomes surprisingly uncommon in the artistic mainstream after the 18th century, even given the general decline in religious painting. [[William Blake's illustrations of On the Morning of Christ's Nativity|William Blake's illustrations of ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'']] are a typically esoteric treatment in [[watercolour]].  [[Edward Burne-Jones]], working with [[Morris &amp; Co.]], produced major works on the theme, with a set of stained glass windows at [[Trinity Church, Boston]] (1882), a tapestry of the [[Adoration of the Magi (tapestry)|''Adoration of the Magi'']] (ten copies, from 1890) and a [[Star of Bethlehem (painting)|painting of the same subject]] (1887). Popular religious depictions have continued to flourish, despite the competition from secular Christmas imagery.

The '''Northern''' or '''Northwestern''' is a [[genre]] in various arts which tell stories set primarily in the later half of the 19th century in the north of North America, primarily in [[Canada]] but also in [[Alaska]].  It is similar to the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]] but many elements are different, as appropriate to its setting.  It is common for central character to be a [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mountie]] instead of a [[cowboy]] or [[sheriff]].  Other common characters include fur trappers and traders, [[lumberjack]]s, [[Prospecting|prospectors]], [[First Nations]] people, settlers and townsfolk.

International interest in the region and the genre was fuelled by the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896–99) and subsequent works surrounding it, fiction and non-fiction.  The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years of the twentieth century.  Northerns are still produced but popularity waned in the late 1950s.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Nwmp 1900.jpg|thumb|The North-West Mounted Police, and later the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], were often the heroes of Northern fiction]]
[[File:Yukon Donjek Valley 001.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Yukon]] (occasionally near the [[Canada–United States border|Alaskan border]]) was a common setting for Northern fiction.]]
Northerns are similar to [[Western (genre)|westerns]] but are set in the frozen north of [[North America]]; that is, [[Canada]] or [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chasing the Sun: A Reader's Guide to Novels Set in the American West|first=Edward Joseph|last=Beverly|publisher=Sunstone Press|year=2008|isbn=9780865346031|chapter=Preface|page=11|quote=Some book reviewers, however, contend that the one thing all Western settings have in common is aridity, and wouldn't consider novels set in Missouri or along the Pacific Coast or in the other non-arid regions to be Western fiction. Some include stories set in Canada and Alaska; others differentiate these as 'Northerns.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the two, Canada was the most common setting, although many tropes could apply to both.  Popular locations within Canada are the [[Yukon]], the [[Barren Grounds]], and area around [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref name="Pronzini"&gt;{{cite book|title=Six-Gun in Cheek|first=Bill|last=Pronzini|chapter=The Bull Moose and Other Scourges of the Frozen North|publisher=Courier Dover|year=2017|isbn=9780486820347|quote=Northerns—tales set in the rough-and-tumble frontier days of Alaska, the Yukon, the Canadian Barrens, the Hudsons's Bay region—were a popular adjunct to the Western story during the first half of this century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generic names used for this general setting included the "Far North", the "Northlands", the "North Woods", and the "Great Woods".

Common settings include [[Boreal forest of Canada|boreal forests]], isolated cabins, and mining towns.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt; Snow featured to such an extent that Northern films were sometimes termed "snow pictures".&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;  Animals were a common feature too.  Dogs and [[dog sled]]s were popularized by ''The Call of the Wild'' and ''White Fang''.  Scenes involving attacks by bears date back to ''The Klondyke Nugget''.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

The primary antagonist in a Northern can be the wilderness, the weather and other natural elements, which the protagonists must endure, overcome and survive.&lt;ref name="Hutchison"&gt;{{cite book|year=1998|chapter=Introduction: Scarlet Fiction|title=The Scarlet Riders|first=Don|last=Hutchison|isbn=9780889626478|publisher=Mosaic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

Northerns often explore the 'Matter of Canada' (the national mythos of Canada, after the [[Matter of Rome]]).&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;  Common elements of which are the [[Black Donnellys|Black Donnelly murders]] (February 1880), the [[North-West Rebellion]] (1885), the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] (1896–99), the pursuit of [[Albert Johnson (criminal)|Albert Johnson]] (January 1932), the [[October Crisis]] (October 1970), and persistent national anxiety about [[Annexation movements of Canada|potential annexation]] by the United States.&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;

The Western idea of [[lawlessness]] set in American towns was not a part of the Canadian Northern, though individual lawbreakers or uprisings by Canadians feature in works such as ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951), ''[[Riel (film)|Riel]]'' (1979), and ''[[Northwest Mounted Police (film)|Northwest Mounted Police]]'' (1940).  In Northerns and wider crime fiction, the general Canadian preference is for law enforcement to be performed by the state rather than vigilantes or private investigators.&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;  Likewise, Northerns rarely feature the heroic outlaws often found in Westerns.&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt;  On the subject, David Skene-Melvin writes "Canada never had a Wild West because the Mounties got there first,"&lt;ref name="SkeneMelvin" /&gt; while [[Margaret Atwood]] writes "No outlaws or lawless men for Canada; if one appears, the Mounties always get their man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature]]|authorlink=Margaret Atwood|first=Margaret|last=Atwood|year=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law and order in Northerns set in Canada is most often represented by the Mounties, either the [[North-West Mounted Police]] or [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] depending on era.  Like snow, Mounties are a common enough feature to become a synonym for the genre, with Northern films sometimes called "Mountie films".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=9781134317066|section=Canada|quote='Mounties' (RCMP officers) have been widely mythologized and lampooned in Anglophone popular culture, from the dozens of early Hollywood Mountie films or 'Northerns' (''McGuire of the Mounted'', ''Rose Marie'') and popular television series ''Sergeant Preston of the Yukon'' and ''Due South'', to the cinematic spoof ''Dudley Do-Right'' [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their popularity was not confined to film; by 1930, 75 volumes of written Mountie fiction had been published, not including juvenile fiction and material published in magazines.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introduction|title=Best Mounted Police Stories|first=Dick|last=Harrison|publisher=University of Alberta|year=1978|isbn=9780888640543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a protagonist in a Western is often part of both civilization and the wild (whether native or criminal), Mounties in Northerns are entirely a part of civilization.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;  The nature of fictional Mounties can vary depending on the nationality of the author.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;  Mounties as written by British authors are often younger members of upper class British families serving the British Empire in the colonies.  American-authored Mounties are often little different from [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshalls]] and project the values of Westerns in that they place their individual sense of justice and conscience above their duty to the law. Canadian-authored Mounties represent, and are self-abnegating champions of, the Canadian establishment and its laws.  Further, their authority does not come from either their social class or physical abilities; such a Mountie "upholds the law by moral rather than physical force".&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;  A common story outline for Northerns involving Mounties is a pursuit, confrontation and capture: the Mountie's pursuit of a fugitive takes place across the Canadian wilderness and may be resolved non-violently.&lt;ref name="Harrison" /&gt;

According to [[Pierre Berton]] "the French-Canadian was to the northerns what the Mexican was to the westerns — an exotic primitive, adaptable as a chameleon to play a hero or a heavy."&lt;ref name=Berton&gt;{{cite book|first=Pierre|last=Berton|authorlink=Pierre Berton|chapter=Hollywood's Canada|title=Canadian Culture|editor-first=Elspeth|editor-last=Cameron|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|year=1997|isbn=9781551300900}}&lt;/ref&gt; French-Canadians were a ubiquitous element of the genre.  As characters, French-Canadians are typically depicted as rustic and uneducated. These characters were usually divided into two broad types: the heroic, happy-go-lucky bon-vivant and the villainous, lecherous killer.  Some later examples merged the two stereotypes into a charming, roguish [[anti-villain]].&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  Common visual elements were a [[tuque]], a sash and a pipe.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  All were present in the first appearance in film, in ''[[A Woman's Way (film)|A Woman's Way]]'' (1908).&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  Female French-Canadian characters also followed the "tempestuous" stereotype of female Mexican characters.  Mexican actress [[Lupe Vélez]], in line with her identity as "The Mexican Spitfire", played the title character in ''[[Tiger Rose (1929 film)|Tiger Rose]]'' (1929) in this mode; as did [[Renée Adorée]] in ''[[The Eternal Struggle (film)|The Eternal Struggle]]'' (1923) and Nikki Duval in ''[[Quebec (1951 film)|Quebec]]'' (1951).&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;

A common anachronism in Northerns was the tyranny and absolute power of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and its officers, even into the modern period.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  This was repeated not just in fiction but by reviewers and critics too.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  The concept of ''La Longue Traverse'', or the Journey of Death, comes from ''[[The Call of the North (1914 film)|The Call of the North]]'' (1914) and was popular in later films.  In this, the Hudson's Bay Company executes convicts by forcing them into the wilderness without equipment or supplies.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;  In 1921, the Hudson's Bay Company successfully sued the [[Famous Players-Lasky|Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]] for the villainous portrayal of their Company in the latters' remake ''[[The Call of the North (1921 film)|The Call of the North]]''.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;

[[Alaska Natives]] or [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] are featured in some depictions.

Besides being set in [[Canadian Prairies]], the stories often contrast the [[American frontier]] with the Canadian frontier in several ways.  In films such as ''[[Pony Soldier]]'' and ''[[Saskatchewan (film)|Saskatchewan]]'' the North-West Mounted Police display reason, compassion and a sense of fair play in their dealings with [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal people]] ([[First Nations]]) as opposed to hotheaded American visitors (often criminals), lawmen or the American Army who seem to prefer [[Genocide|extermination]] with violence.

==History==
David Skene-Melvin classes the "second period" of Canadian crime literature (1880–1920), as "the heyday of the 'Northern' and the literary exploration of Canada's remote and romantic frontiers."&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Skene-Melvin|chapter=Canadian Crime Writing in English|title=Detecting Canada|editor-first=Jeannette|editor-last=Sloniowski|editor-first2=Marilyn|editor-last2=Rose|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|year=2014|isbn=9781554589289}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He refers to [[Joseph Edmund Collins]] as an important figure in this period because, despite his work being of low quality, he was the first Canadian author to address some aspects of the 'Matter of Canada' in his novels, such as ''The Story of Louis Riel: The Rebel Chief'' (1885) and ''Annette, the Métis Spy'' (1886).&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin /&gt;  Northerns continued to be written after 1920 but Canadian authors largely moved to other genres after World War 1 as they moved away from a frontier and colonial ethos.&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin /&gt;

The [[Klondike Gold Rush]] during the 1890s in Canada and Alaska brought a lot of wider, international attention to the far north of North America.&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;  Adventure novels from veterans of the gold rush—such as [[Jack London]]'s ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'' (1903), [[Rex Beach]]'s ''[[The Spoilers (Beach novel)|The Spoilers]]'' (1906) and [[Robert W. Service]]'s ''[[The Trail of Ninety-Eight]]'' (1909)—became best sellers.&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;  These inspired more adventure fiction which grew in popularity throughout the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;  The genre was extremely popular in the inter-war years,&lt;ref name="Pronzini" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt; with a "Mountie craze" hitting its peak during the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name="Berton" /&gt;

A large amount of Northern fiction is the work of non-Canadians.  Nevertheless, Skene-Melvin writes "Just as the Western is widely regarded as emblematic of American culture, it can be argued that the Northern is the only truly indigenous Canadian art form, even if most of its exponents have been foreigners."&lt;ref name=SkeneMelvin /&gt;

One of the earliest international examples of the genre is the British play ''The Klondyke Nugget'', which was first performed in 1898.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;  Its author, [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] initially wrote it as a Western but changed the location to capitalize on the contemporary gold rush.&lt;ref name="Solomon" /&gt;

[[Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin's]] 1925 film ''[[The Gold Rush]]'' is a comedy that parodies some of the cliches of the Northern genre.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Solomon|title=The Gold Rush|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=9781137516114|quote=Chaplin's decision to have ''The Gold Rush'' take place during the 1897–8 Klondike Gold Rush placed it squarely within the well established Northern genre, which spanned theatre, literature and film, encompassing stories about trappers, adventurers, lumberjacks, miners, Mounties, Eskimos, and others-even animals-in the Far North.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Looney Tunes]] character [[Blacque Jacque Shellacque]], who first appeared in the 1959 short ''[[Bonanza Bunny]]'', is another parody.&lt;ref name="Hutchison" /&gt;

While the Hollywood [[Western (genre)|Western]] began to change in the post-World War 2 era and the Western myth was eventually debunked, Hollywood Northerns remained unchanged until they stopped being produced in the late 1950s and the underlying mythology was never examined.&lt;ref name=Berton /&gt;

The color '''opponent process''' is a color theory that states that the human [[visual system]] interprets information about [[color]] by processing signals from [[cone cell|cones]] and [[rod cell|rods]] in an antagonistic manner.  The three types of cones (L for long, M for medium and S for short) have some overlap in the [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record ''differences'' between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels: [[red]] versus [[green]], [[blue]] versus [[yellow]], and [[black]] versus [[white]] (the last type is [[Grey|achromatic]] and detects light-dark variation, or [[luminance]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Text-book of physiology | author = Michael Foster | publisher = Lea Bros. &amp; Co | year = 1891 | page = 921 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Swn8ztLFTdkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA921&amp;dq=hering+red-green+yellow-blue+young-helmholtz+date:0-1923 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170118063526/https://books.google.com/books?id=Swn8ztLFTdkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA921&amp;dq=hering+red-green+yellow-blue+young-helmholtz+date:0-1923 | archivedate = 2017-01-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color.  That is, opposite opponent colors are never perceived together – there is no "greenish red" or "yellowish blue".

While the [[Trichromacy|trichromatic theory]] defines the way the [[retina]] of the [[human eye|eye]] allows the visual system to detect color with three types of cones, the opponent process theory accounts for mechanisms that receive and process information from cones.  Though the trichromatic and opponent processes theories were initially thought to be at odds, it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for the opponent process receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level.&lt;ref name="Kandel"&gt;Kandel ER, Schwartz JH and Jessell TM, 2000. ''Principles of Neural Science'', 4th ed., McGraw–Hill, New York. pp.&amp;nbsp;577–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the cones, which detect light entering the eye, the biological basis of the opponent theory involves two other types of cells: [[Retina bipolar cell|bipolar cells]], and [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]]. Information from the cones is passed to the bipolar cells in the retina, which may be the cells in the opponent process that transform the information from cones. The information is then passed to ganglion cells, of which there are two major classes: [[magnocellular cell|magnocellular]], or large-[[cell (biology)|cell]] layers, and [[parvocellular cell|parvocellular]], or small-cell layers.  Parvocellular cells, or P cells, handle the majority of information about color, and fall into two groups: one that processes information about differences between firing of L and M cones, and one that processes differences between S cones and a combined signal from both L and M cones.  The first subtype of cells are responsible for processing red–green differences, and the second process blue–yellow differences. P cells also transmit information about intensity of light (how much of it there is) due to their [[receptive field]]s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==History==
[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] first studied the physiological effect of opposed colors in his ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html | title = Goethe's Color Theory | work = Vision science and the emergence of modern art | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080916130507/http://www.webexhibits.org/colorart/ch.html | archivedate = 2008-09-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe arranged his color wheel symmetrically "for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. Thus, yellow demands purple; orange, blue; red, green; and vice versa: Thus again all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other."&lt;ref&gt;

[[Ewald Hering]] proposed opponent color theory in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Hering E, 1964. ''Outlines of a Theory of the Light Sense''. Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the colors red, yellow, green, and blue are special in that any other color can be described as a mix of them, and that they exist in opposite pairs.  That is, either red or green is perceived and never greenish-red: Even though yellow is a mixture of red and green in the RGB color theory, the eye does not perceive it as such. In 1957, [[Leo Hurvich]] and [[Dorothea Jameson]] provided quantitative data for Hering's color-opponent theory. Their method was called ''hue cancellation''. Hue cancellation experiments start with a color (e.g. yellow) and attempt to determine how much of the opponent color (e.g. blue) of one of the starting color's components must be added to eliminate any hint of that component from the starting color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurvich|first=Leo M.|author2=Jameson, Dorothea|date=November 1957|title=An opponent-process theory of color vision|journal=Psychological Review|volume=64|issue=6, Part I|pages=384–404 | doi=10.1037/h0041403|pmid=13505974}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Kluender, &amp; Levi, (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponent color theory can be applied to [[computer vision]] and implemented as the ''[[Gaussian color model]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Geusebroek, J.-M. |author2=van den Boomgaard, R. |author3=Smeulders, A.W.M. |author4=Geerts, H. |title=Color invariance|journal=Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on|volume=23|issue=12|date=December 2001|pages=1338–1350| doi=10.1109/34.977559}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[natural-vision-processing model]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barghout, Lauren. (2014). "Visual taxometric approach to image segmentation using fuzzy-spatial taxon cut yields contextually relevant regions". ''Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems''. Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barghout, Lauren, &amp; Lee, Lawrence. (2004-03-25). ''Perceptual information processing system''. Patent US20040059754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barghout, Lauren. (2014). ''Vision: Global Perceptual Context Changes Local Contrast Processing, Updated to include computer vision techniques''. Scholars' Press, (21 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have applied the idea of opposing stimulations beyond visual systems, described in the article on ''[[opponent-process theory]]''. In 1967, [[Rod Grigg]] extended the concept to reflect a wide range of opponent processes in biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, E. R. N. (1967). ''Biologic Relativity''. Chicago: Amaranth Books.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Richard Solomon (psychologist)|Solomon]] &amp; Corbit expanded Hurvich &amp; Jameson's general neurological opponent process model to explain emotion, drug addiction, and work motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Solomon |first1=R.

==Complementary-color afterimages==
{{main|Afterimage#Negative_afterimages|l1=Negative afterimages}}

If someone stares at a red square for forty seconds, and then immediately looks at a white sheet of paper, they often perceive a cyan square on the blank sheet. This [[complementary color]] afterimage is more easily explained by the trichromatic color theory than the traditional RYB color theory; in the opponent-process theory, fatigue of pathways promoting red produce the illusion of a cyan square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Griggs  | first = R.

[[Image:Mesdag-Scheveningen.png|thumb|300px|[[Scheveningen]] village, a small section of the ''Panorama Mesdag'', with fake terrain in the foreground.]]
'''''Panorama Mesdag''''' is a [[panorama]] by [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]]. Housed in a purpose-built museum in [[The Hague]], the panorama is a cylindrical painting (also known as a [[Cyclorama]]) more than 14 metres high and about 40 metres in diameter (120 metres in circumference). From an observation gallery in the centre of the room the cylindrical perspective creates the illusion that the viewer is on a high sand dune overlooking the sea, beaches and village of Scheveningen in the late 19th century. A foreground of fake terrain around the viewing gallery hides the base of the painting and makes the illusion more convincing.

==History==
Mesdag was a notable marine painter of the [[Hague School]]; in 1880 he was engaged by a Belgian company to paint the panorama, which with the assistance of his wife [[Sina Mesdag-van Houten|Sientje Mesdag-van Houten]] and some student painters (including [[George Hendrik Breitner]]), was completed by 1881. However, the vogue for panoramas was coming to an end, and the company went bankrupt in 1886. Mesdag purchased the panorama and met its losses from his own pocket. The panorama is now the oldest surviving panorama in its original location.

'''Paubhā''' ([[Devanagari]]: पौभा) is a traditional religious painting made by the [[Newar]] people of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chitrakar |first=Madan |title=Nepali Art |publisher=Teba-Chi Studies Centre |location=Kathmandu |year=2012 |pages=35–52 |chapter=Paubha Art|isbn=978-9937-2-4933-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paubhas depict deities, [[mandala]]s or monuments, and are used to help the practitioner meditate. The [[Tibetan art|Tibetan]] equivalent is known as [[Thangka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, A.W. and Stahl, Anne Vergati (1979) ''Newar Art: Nepalese Art during the Malla Period.'' New Delhi: Vikas Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most paubhas show [[Buddhist]] subjects, but a few have [[Hindu]] themes. The paintings are made to earn religious merit both for the artist and the patron. Newar Buddhists commission artists to paint paubhas which are displayed during festivals and other special occasions. The traditional painters of paubhas are the [[Chitrakar]] caste who are known as Pun (पुं) in [[Nepal Bhasa]].&lt;ref&gt;Chitrakar, Madan (2000) ''Tej Bahadur Chitrakar: Icon of a Transition.'' Kathmandu: Teba-Chi (TBC) Studies Centre. {{ISBN|99933-879-7-5}}. Page 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==

A paubha of [[Amitabha Buddha]] at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|Los Angeles County Museum]] is believed to be the earliest specimen which is done in a style dating from the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

 ([[Nepal Sambat]] 485). It is a specimen of the skill of Newar artists that made them sought-after throughout the Himalayan region and as far as China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2011/c-welch-part-ii-l11228/overview.html| title = The Stuart Cary Welch Collection | work = | publisher = Sotheby's| year=| accessdate =24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newar artists and merchants took the paubha art to Tibet from which the Tibetan thangka evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| title =The Nepalese Legacy in Tibetan Painting| work =| publisher =Rubin Museum of Art| year =| accessdate =25 September 2012| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111120102024/http://www.rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| archivedate =20 November 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==

Paubhas are painted on a rectangular piece of canvas. It is prepared by applying a mixture of buffalo glue and white clay on it. The surface is then rubbed with a smooth stone to give it polish. The painting is done according to the rules and dimensions handed down by tradition, and artists cannot exercise their creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pradhan|first=Ujjwal |title=A heritage in peril
|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2010/07/09/features/a-heritage-in-peril/210299/ |date=10 July 2010 | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The paint is made from minerals and plants. Gold and silver paint are also used on paubhas. The eyes of the deity are painted when the rest of the painting has been completed, and is known as "mikhā chāyekegu" (opening the eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Gurung (Pradhan)| first =Renuka| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/13/paubha-painting-the-traditional-art-of-nepal.html| title =Paubha Painting: The Traditional Art of Nepal| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brocade is sewn to the edge of the paubha to make a frame for display.

From a composition perspective, the surface of Paubha is usually occupied of a large figure in the center that is placed inside a shrine and surrounded by registers of smaller figures on the sides; the background is usually filled in with natural elements such as rocks rendered in abstract patterns. The color is often deep and subdued with subtle shadings of the figures and exquisite renderings of details that are the hallmarks of early Nepalese paubhas&lt;ref&gt;Huu Phuoc Le, Le Huu Phuoc, '''Buddhist Architecture '''', Grafikol, 2010 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==

An annual exhibition of statues of [[Dipankara Buddha]] and paubhas is held in sacred courtyards in the [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The ceremony is known as Bahidyah Bwayegu (बहीद्यः ब्वयेगु), and is held during the month of [[Gunla]]. Gunla, which corresponds to August, is a holy month for Newar Buddhists. Groups of devotees led by musical bands make a tour of the courtyards to view the displays. In recent times, the traditional exhibitions have become fewer and shorter due to fear of art thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Shakya| first =Min Bahadur| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/16/paubha-paintings.html| title =Paubha Paintings| work = | publisher = Arts of Nepal| date=2011| accessdate = 26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Post-black art''' is a category of contemporary [[African American art]]. It is a paradoxical genre of art where race and racism are intertwined in a way that rejects their interaction.  I.e., it is art about the black experience that attempts to dispel the notion that race matters.  It uses enigmatic themes wherein black can substitute for white.&lt;ref name=RRJMM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.newcity.com/2008/09/09/review-rashid-johnsonmonique-meloche/|title=Review: Rashid Johnson/Monique Meloche|accessdate=2009-01-12|year=2008|publisher=Newcity Communications, Inc.|work=Newcity Art|author=Calder, Jaime}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some suggest the term is attributable to the 1995 book ''The End of Blackness'' by [[Debra Dickerson]].

However, [[Thelma Golden]] claimed to have coined the term ‘post-black’ art with friend and artist [[Glenn Ligon]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thelma Golden, ''Freestyle'', exhibition catalogue. (New York: Studio Museum in Harlem, 2001), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the phrase was explained in detail in the exhibition catalogue for [[The Studio Museum in Harlem]]’s exhibition entitled "Freestyle." &lt;ref name=RRJMM/&gt; ''Freestyle'' was an exhibition that included twenty-eight up and coming artists of African American backgrounds. Golden defined post-black art as that which includes artists who are “adamant about not being labeled ‘black’ artists, though their work was steeped, in fact deeply interested, in redefining complex notions of blackness.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  She continued, “They are both post-[[Jean-Michel Basquiat|Basquiat]] and post-[[Biggie]]. They embrace the dichotomies of high and low, inside and outside, tradition and innovation, with a great ease and facility.”&lt;ref&gt;Thelma Golden, ''Freestyle'', exhibition catalogue. (New York: Studio Museum in Harlem, 2001), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Meyers interprets this as “cutting edge works that are defined by not being defined as African American art.”&lt;ref&gt; Laura Myers, “African American art moves beyond black and white; collectors, curators and galleries are embracing a greater diversity of genres and styles in African American art while other artists move toward a ‘post-black’ art which cannot be defined in terms of race,” ''Art Business News''  Jan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Golden stated her initial interest as an attempt to remove some of the negative associations with the phrase black art as well as comment on the diversity of artists of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;“Thelma Golden, Curator,” ''gothamist.com'' April 27 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In the exhibition catalogue, Golden proclaims, “Post-black was the new black.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

As Golden explained, post-black art refers to a younger, post-[[Civil Rights]] generation of artists who are in search of a language through which they can explore their artistic interests and identities. Because artists of African descent have historically been [[marginalized]] and left outside of the general discourse on Western [[art history]], there has not been one style or school of [[African American art]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Myers, “African American art moves beyond black and white; collectors, curators and galleries are embracing a greater diversity of genres and styles in African American art while other artists move toward a ‘post-black’ art which cannot be defined in terms of race,” ''Art Business News''  Jan 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;  The term ‘post-black’ attempts to encompass artists who have a variety of backgrounds and experiences, but all share experiences as a person of African descent. 

While the notion of ‘post-black’ attempts to avoid identity labels, the title of ‘post-black’ serves as an ethnic marker. Some have found fault with this terminology, stating, “racism is real, and many artists who have endured its effects feel the museum is promoting a kind of art – trendy, postmodern, blandly international – that has turned the institution into a ‘boutique’ or ‘country club’, as [[David Hammons]] puts it.”&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon, “The Downtowning of Uptown,” ''The New York Times'' Aug 19 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Golden has even stated that ‘post-black’ is “both a hollow social construction and a reality with an indispensable history.”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Valdez, “Freestyling – Studio Museum in Harlem,” ''Art in America'' Sep 2001. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Artists featured in [[The Studio Museum in Harlem]]’s ''Freestyle'' show included [[Kori Newkirk]], [[Laylah Ali]], [[Eric Wesley]], [[Senam Okudzeto]], [[David McKenzie (artist)|David McKenzie]], [[Susan Smith-Pinelo]], [[Sanford Biggers]], [[Louis Cameron]], [[Deborah Grant (artist)|Deborah Grant]], [[Rashid Johnson]], [[Arnold Kemp]], [[Julie Mehretu]], [[Mark Bradford]] and [[Jennie C. Jones]].

Ratpert probably entered the monastery as an [[oblate]] while still a child.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Stotz: ''Ardua spes mundi. Studien zu lateinischen Gedichten aus Sankt Gallen'' (= Geist und Werk der Zeiten. Arbeiten aus dem Historischen Seminar der Universität Zürich, Band 32), Herbert Lang, Bern 1972, {{ISBN|3-261-00431-2}}, S. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;   The monastery operated two schools in parallel:  the "inner school" prepared pupils for the monastic life while the "outer school" trained boys for the secular&lt;ref&gt;"Secular priests" were those working in the churches and parishes outside the monastery walls.&lt;/ref&gt; priesthood.   Ratpert attended the St Gallen [[Monastic school|monastic "inner school"]], so was destined by his schooling to become a monk.

Ratpert's contemporaries in the "Inner School" included [[Notker the Stammerer|Notker the Poet]] and the charismatic poet-polymath [[Tuotilo|Tuotilo of St Gallen]]:  the three later became close colleagues in the monastery.   Meanwhile, an "outer school" contemporary was the combative [[Solomon III (bishop of Constance)|Salomo]], later [[Bishopric of Constance|Bishop of Constance]] and [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Abbot at St Gallen]] itself.   Ratpert's teachers were Iso and the (by provenance Irish) Moengal. Moengal had originally arrived with his uncle Marcus, an [[Episcopi vagantes|itinerant bishop]], when they turned up at St Gallen as pilgrims, visiting the shrine of their compatriot, [[Saint Gall]]us.   The uncle, Marcus, had moved on while Moengal had stayed at St Gallen and entered the monastery.   Here the monks renamed him Marcellus (Little Marcus), recalling the name of his departed uncle.

Ratpert took his own [[Religious vows|monastic vows]] some time round 873.   The earliest surviving example of his writing than can be firmly dated is a [[Legal instrument|legal deed]] dated 29 May 876.   He himself taught at the Monastery School for many years.   The last example of his work as a [[Legal instrument|deed]] writer that can be dated was produced on 10 February 902.   His precise year of death is not known, but has been placed by recent research around 911.  The month and day of his year were 25 October, and his name is recorded under this day in the monastery's Book of the Dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Monumenta Germaniae historica. Necrologia Germaniae'', Band 1: ''Dioeceses Augustensis, Constantiensis, Curiensis'', edited by [[:de:Franz Ludwig Baumann|Franz Ludwig Baumann]], 1866/68, Nachdruck 1983, {{ISBN|3-88612-004-X}}, S. 483.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
In addition to his duties as monastery school master and his activities as a writer of [[Legal instrument|legal records]], Ratpert produced poetry and chronicled the History of [[Abbey of Saint Gall|The Abbey]].   Little of his poetry has survived.

His other works include the [[All Saints' Day]] [[Litany]], "Ardua spes mundi" (''*The World's highest hope"''),)&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced with a German translation in: Peter Stotz: ''Ardua spes mundi. Studien zu lateinischen Gedichten aus Sankt Gallen'' (= Geist und Werk der Zeiten. Arbeiten aus dem Historischen Seminar der Universität Zürich, Band 32), Herbert Lang, Bern 1972, {{ISBN|3-261-00431-2}}, S. 36–41.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Eucharist]] song "Laudes, omnipotens, ferimus" (''"We bring you praise, all powerful one"''),&lt;ref&gt;Reproduced with a German translation in: Peter Stotz: ''Ardua spes mundi. Studien zu lateinischen Gedichten aus Sankt Gallen'' (= Geist und Werk der Zeiten. Arbeiten aus dem Historischen Seminar der Universität Zürich, Band 32), Herbert Lang, Bern 1972, {{ISBN|3-261-00431-2}}, S. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; an  [[Old High German]] "St Gallen Song" and his Chronicle of the Monastery, "Casus sancti Galli" (''literally "The Matter of St Gallen"'').   The Chronicle of the Monastery was subsequently, in the eleventh century, continued by [[Ekkehard IV]] (c.980 - c. 1056) who at the time was also in charge of the Monastery School.   Ratpert's original "St Gallen Song" survives today only in the form of its [[Latin]] translation, which was also penned by [[Ekkehard IV]].

'''''Saint George and the Dragon''''' is a painting by [[Paolo Uccello]] dating from around 1470. It is on display in the [[National Gallery, London]], [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paolo-uccello-saint-george-and-the-dragon Paolo Uccelo | Saint George and the Dragon | NG6294], [[The National Gallery, London]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly housed in the [[Palais Lanckoroński]] in Vienna, belonging to Count Lanckoroński and sold by his son and heir Anton in 1959 through Mr Farago. The first mention of it being there is 1898.

Gothicizing tendencies in Paolo Uccello's art are nowhere  more apparent than in this painting. It shows a scene from the famous story of [[Saint George and the dragon]]. On the right George is spearing the beast, and on the left the princess is using her belt as a leash to take the dragon up to the town.

The eye in the storm gathering on the right of Saint George is lined up with his spear showing there has been divine intervention.

An earlier less dramatic version of the same subject by the Italian artist is in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris.  

The painting is used as the basis for the [[U. A. Fanthorpe]] poem, ''Not My Best Side'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://english.emory.edu/classes/paintings&amp;poems/uccello.html|title= Not My Best Side, U.A. Fanthrope|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|publisher= Emory University|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have served as inspiration for [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]'s illustration of the [[Jabberwock]] in ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin (1999) ''The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition''.

'''Shabby chic''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|iː|k}}) is a form of [[interior design]] where furniture and [[furnishing]]s are either chosen for their appearance of age and signs of wear and tear or where new items are [[distressing|distressed]] to achieve the appearance of an antique. At the same time, a soft, opulent, yet cottage-style decor, often with an affected feel is emphasized to differentiate it from genuine period decor.

==Description==
Shabby chic items are often heavily painted through the years, with many layers showing through obviously time-worn areas. The style is imitated in [[faux painting]] using [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] or by painting then rubbing and sanding away the top coat to show the wood or base coats, known as "distressing" the finish of the furniture. Furniture pieces that are not genuine antiques are usually selected for their resemblance to older furniture styles, and may be reproduction furniture with a distressed finish. Elaborate furniture [[applique]]s depicting flower [[Swag (motif)|swags]] and [[garland]]s, [[cherubs]], and other motifs may be added.

Fabrics tend to be cottons and linens, with linen being particularly popular, inspired by old French linens. Pure whites, as well as [[ecru]]s and worn or [[bleach]]ed out [[Pastel (color)|pastel]] colors are favorites. Fabric is often stained with tea to give it the look of old fabric. Bleached and faded are terms often applied to the style. Vintage floral patterns with pastel colors, cotton [[ticking]] patterns, or linen in earth tones, are all typical of shabby chic style.

Antique pieces such as [[pie safe]]s and jelly cupboards are popular in shabby chic [[décor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shabby Chic Decorating|url=http://hotelsouthdakota.com/best-ways-select-bedspreads-luxury-bedding-sheets/shabby-chic-decorating-ideas/|work=Source|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides white, the shabby chic style also includes soft neutral colors such as sky blue, rose pink and beige tones. Hints from French-style interior design often show in shabby chic homes such as [[Rococo]]-style lighting fixtures, furniture or wall paneling.

The shabby chic aesthetic also expands to the garden, with the same design principles of using timeworn garden furniture and feminine accessories. Rose gardens are popular with the shabby chic style of décor.

Other popular décor items are pillows made of vintage [[barkcloth]] fabric, vintage linens, [[Chenille fabric|chenille]] bedspreads, vintage chandeliers, and anything with roses in the design. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used the term to describe [[avant-garde]] fashion designer [[Martin Margiela]]'s 1992 fall fashion show, which took place in a [[Salvation Army]] furniture store and featured models in "wrinkled jackets, baggy-kneed pants and coats with inner linings hanging down from unfinished hems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darnton|first1=N|title=Night of the living dead|journal=Newsweek|date=April 6, 1992|volume=119|issue=14|page=50|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decorators consider shabby chic a soft, relaxed, romantic style that looks comfortable and inviting, and is usually associated as feminine. Masculine shabby chic would be "rustic", with deeper or richer colors,  [[Rustic furniture]] using unfinished wood, denim, burlap, sailcloth and homespun.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Burch, [http://homeguides.sfgate.com/mix-shabby-chic-rustic-76828.html How to Mix Shabby Chic &amp; Rustic]. ''SFGate'', undated article in Home Guides.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of shabby chic style include:

* [[Cottage chic]]
* [[Beach cottage chic]]
* [[French country]]
* [[Gustavian]] (Swedish)

==History==
[[File:Distressed finish vintage dresser.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Dressing table|dresser]] with a [[Distressing|distressed]] finish and mismatched drawer knobs, in Shabby chic style]]
The style started in [[Great Britain]] and evokes the type of decoration found in large country houses where there are worn and faded old [[chintz]] sofas and curtains, old paintwork and unassuming "good" taste. The end result of shabby chic is to achieve an elegant overall effect, as opposed to the sentimentally cute Pop-Victorian. Recycling old furniture and fabrics is an important aspect of the look and was especially popular with modern Bohemians and artisans that made up a sidelined counter-culture movement during the 1980s when expensive quality decor became very fashionable with the upper middle classes. The original shabby chic interiors were usually considered in themselves works of art.

The early forms of shabby chic were rather grand but the style has evolved taking inspiration from many forms of decoration. These range from 18th century [[Sweden|Swedish]] painted decoration, the French [[Chateau]] as well as the American [[Shakers]] where simplicity and plainness was essential.

Rachel Ashwell founded a furniture chain called Shabby Chic, and in 1996, published a book around the aesthetic she described as "the aura of old money, cushy comfort, and crafted indifference."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williamson|first1=Gayle A|title=Book reviews: Arts &amp; humanities|journal=Library Journal|date=September 15, 1996 |volume=121 |issue=15 |page=66 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term==
The term was coined by ''[[World of Interiors|The World of Interiors]]'' magazine in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-2688810/Threadbare-carpets-creaky-floors-Dont-fret-shabby-chic-never-fashionable.html|publisher=MailOnline|date=11 July 2014|first=Jenny|last=Coad|title=Threadbare carpets, grubby walls, creaky floors? Don't fret - the shabby chic look has never been more fashionable}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became extremely popular in the [[United States]] in the 1990s with a certain eclectic surge of decorating styles with paints and effects, notably in metropolitan cultural centers on the West Coast of America, such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]], with heavy influences from Mediterranean cultures such as [[Provence, France|Provence]], [[Tuscany]], and [[Greece]].{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The '''Tabnit sarcophagus''' is the sarcophagus of the [[Phoenicia]]n king Tabnit of [[Sidon]] (c. 490 BCE),&lt;ref name="HF-Sidon"&gt;{{cite web|title=Middle East Kingdoms Ancient Central Levant States - Sidon|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsMiddEast/CanaanSidon.htm|publisher=Kessler Associates|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the father of King [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus|Eshmunazar II]]. The sarcophagus is decorated with two separate and unrelated inscriptions – one in [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]] and one in [[Phoenician script]]. It was created in the early 5th century BC, and was unearthed in 1887 by [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] at the Ayaa Necropolis near [[Sidon]] together with the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]] and other related sarcophagi. Tabnit's body was found floating perfectly preserved in the original [[embalming fluid]].&lt;ref name=Lembke/&gt;{{sfn|Torrey|1902|pp=168–9 (footnote)|ps=: "When the sarcophagus of Tabnit was exhumed, in the year 1887, and the lid was removed, the body of the king was found to be in a very good state of preservation. It was lying in a brownish-colored, somewhat "oily" fluid, which nearly filled the sarcophagus. The eyes were gone; the nose, lips, and the most prominent part of the thorax, which had not been covered by the liquid, had decayed away; in other respects, however, the corpse was like that of a man only recently buried. It was but slightly emaciated; plenty of flesh remained on both face and limbs, and the skin was soft to the touch. The vital organs and viscera had not been removed (a note-worthy circumstance), and were perfectly preserved. Dr. Shibly Abela, of Sidon, a physician of education and experience, remarked that the face showed traces of small-pox; it was not apparent, however, that the king had died of that disease. The color of the skin was described as somewhat "coppery," the tinge being perhaps due to the influence of some substance, or substances, held in solution by the enveloping fluid. The fluid itself may have been partly, or even wholly, rain-water, which finds its way into most of the tombs about Sidon; but in any case it is evident, from the facts just given, that the body of the king had been skilfully embalmed. I do not know that any similar case has ever been observed and reported. After the body had been removed from the sarcophagus and exposed to the sun. it decomposed and shrunk to withered skin and bones in a very short time. My chief authority for these facts is the Rev. William K. Eddy, of Sidon, a keen observer and cautious reporter, who was one of the few who saw and touched the body of Tabnit when it was first exposed to view. Mr. Eddy was positive in his opinion that the king, at the time of his death, had not passed middle life; the face, he thought, was that of a man of less than fifty years of age."}} Both the sarcophagus and Tabnit's decomposed skeleton are now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/web/33-97-1-1/muze_-_en/museum/museum/history/ İstanbul Archaeological Museums]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sarcophagus, together with the [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus]], were possibly acquired by the Sidonians following their participation in the [[Battle of Pelusium (525 BC)]],{{sfn|Nitschke|2007|p=71|ps=: "Three of these Egyptian sarcophagi manufactured during the twenty-sixth dynasty were apparently acquired by the Sidonians, perhaps as a result of Phoenician participation in Cambyses’ conquest of Egypt in 525 B.C."}} and served as models for later Phoenician sarcophagi.{{sfn|Nitschke|2007|p=72}}

==Discovery==
[[File:Ayaa Necropolis, Sidon.png|thumb|left|Cross-section of the Ayaa Necropolis. The Tabnit sarcophagus is at the bottom left.]]
The tombs near Sidon were discovered in 1887 by the American [[Presbyterian]] minister William King Eddy (the father of [[William A. Eddy]]). [[William Wright (orientalist)|William Wright]] sent a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' with news of Eddy's discovery and imploring the [[British Museum]] to "take immediate measures to secure these treasures and prevent their falling into the hands of the vandal Turk". This alerted the new curator of the fledgling [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]], [[Osman Hamdi Bey]], who arranged for a full excavation and the transfer of the sarcophagi to Istanbul.{{sfn|Jessup|1910|p=507a|ps=: "On the 14th of March a letter came from Mr. Eddy of a wonderful discovery in Sidon of ancient tombs, containing some white polished marble sarcophagi of exquisite beauty and marvellous sculpture. Mr. Eddy had been into the tombs hewn in the solid rock thirty feet below the surface and had measured and described all the sarcophagi of white and black marble with scientific exactness. On the 21st Dr. Eddy received from his son an elaborate report on the discovery which was intended to be sent to his brother Dr. Condit Eddy in New Rochelle. I obtained permission to make a copy for transmission to Dr. William Wright of London, and sent it by mail the next day. Dr. Wright sent it to the London Times with a note in which he expressed the hope that the authorities of the British Museum would "take immediate measures to secure these treasures and prevent their falling into the hands of the vandal Turk". The Times reached Constantinople. Now it happened that the department of antiquities at that time as now was under the charge of Hamdi Beg, a man educated in Paris, an artist, an engineer, and well up in archaeology. When he saw that article of Mr. Eddy's in the Times and Dr. Wright's letter, he said to himself (as he afterwards told us), "I'll show what the 'Vandal Turk' can do!"}}

During the excavation, the workmen opened the Tabnit sarcophagus and found "a human body floating in perfect preservation in a peculiar fluid". Whilst Hamdi Bey was at lunch, the workmen overturned the sarcophagus and poured the fluid out, such that the "secret of the wonderful fluid was again hidden in the Sidon sand".{{sfn|Jessup|1910|p=507b|ps=: "One sarcophagus, when the lid was opened, contained a human body floating in perfect preservation in a peculiar fluid. The flesh was soft and perfect in form and colour. But, alas, while Hamdi Beg was at lunch, the over-officious Arab workmen overturned it and spilled all the precious fluid on the sand. The beg's indignation knew no bounds, but it was too late and the body could not be preserved, and the secret of the wonderful fluid was again hidden in the Sidon sand."}}&lt;ref name=Lembke&gt;{{citation|title=Phönizische Anthropoide Sarkophage by Katja Lembke|first=Eric|last=Gubel|journal=Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research|volume=332|year=2003|pages=98–100|jstor=1357812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamdi Bey noted in 1892 that he had kept a portion of the sludge that remained in the bottom of the sarcophagus.{{sfn|Hamdi Bey|1892|pp=101–103|ps=:"Alors seulement nous pûmes enfin voir l'intérieur du sarcophage. Une couche de sable jaunâtre et humide de laquelle émergeaient la face décharnée, les clavicules, les rotules, ainsi que le bout des pieds auxquels manquaient les doigts, remplissait le fond de la cuve jusqu'à 25 centimètres de ses bords... Débarrassé du couvercle, je fis d'abord tirer de la cuve le corps du roi et j'ordonnai de l'étendre sur une planche pour l'emporter dehors et le confier au docteur Mourad Effendi, médecin municipal de Saïda, que j'avais chargé de le mettre en état d'être transporté à constantinople; car tous les muscles des parties postérieures ainsi que tous les organes internes du thorax et de l'abdomen étaient parfaitement conservés. Apres avoir fait vider la cuve, je conservai une portion de la boue formée de sable et de pourriture qu'elle contenait, et je fis passer le reste à travers un crible quand cette boue eut été, au préalable, délayée dans l'eau. Rien n'y a été trouvé, si ce n'est quelques fragments d'anneaux en argent."}}

==Inscription==
The inscription is known as '''[[Kanaanäische und Aramäische Inschriften|KAI]] 13'''. The [[Egyptian hieroglyphic]] inscription shows that the sarcophagus was originally intended for an Egyptian general named "Pen-Ptah" (pꜣ-n-pth).&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/context-of-scripture/the-sarcophagus-inscription-of-tabnit-king-of-sidon-2-56-aCOSB_2_56 Context of Scripture 2.56], P.

I, Tabnit, priest of [[Astarte]], king of [[Sidon]], the son of Eshmunazar, priest of Astarte, king of Sidon, am lying in this sarcophagus.&lt;br&gt;
Whoever you are, any man that might find this sarcophagus,&lt;br&gt;
don't, don't open it and don't disturb me,&lt;br&gt;
for no silver is gathered with me, no gold is gathered with me, nor anything of value whatsoever,&lt;br&gt;
only I am lying in this sarcophagus.&lt;br&gt;
Don't, don't open it and don't disturb me,&lt;br&gt;
for this thing is an abomination to Astarte.&lt;br&gt;
And if you do indeed open it and do indeed disturb me,&lt;br&gt;
may you not have any seed among the living under the sun,&lt;br&gt;
nor a resting-place with the [[Rephaite]]s.

==Dating==
[[File:Sarcophagus of Horkhebit2007.jpg|thumb|150px|The sarcophagus of Horkhebit, from [[Saqqara]], is very similar in style.]]
Both the Tabnit sarcophagus and the [[Eshmunazar II sarcophagus]] are thought to originally date from the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt]], which had its capital at [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]].{{sfn|Nitschke|2007|p=72}} This is partially due to their resemblance to similar sarcophagi such as the [[Psamtik II]]-era Horkhebit sarcophagus from [[Saqqara]], now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

'''''The Vale of Dedham''''' is an 1828 oil painting by the English painter [[John Constable]] which depicts [[Dedham Vale]] on the Essex-Suffolk border in eastern England. It is in the permanent collection of the [[National Galleries of Scotland]], Edinburgh. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/4766/vale-dedham|title=John Constable - The Vale of Dedham|publisher=National Galleries of Scotland |accessdate= 27 November 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The view from Gun Hill along the [[River Stour, Suffolk|River Stour]] to Dedham village and the distant Stour estuary was a favourite subject of Constable which he painted several times, most noticeably the 1802 version in the [[Victoria  and Albert Museum]].

In this work the paint is thickly applied with touches of white to emphasise the reflection of sunlight. The work was primarily responsible for his admission to the prestigious [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1829.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Transitions''' in [[fiction]] are words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs, or [[punctuation]] that may be used to signal various changes in a story, including changes in time, location, [[narrative mode|point-of-view character]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], [[tone (literature)|tone]], [[emotion]], and [[pace (speed)|pace]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Polking|Polking]], 1990, p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; Transitions are sometimes listed as one of various [[fiction-writing modes]].

==Purpose==
Transitions provide for a seamless [[narrative]] flow as a story shifts in time, location, or [[Point of view (fiction) | point-of view]].  They aid the internal logic of a story by moving readers from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph, idea to idea, [[scene (drama)|scene]] to scene, and [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] to chapter with grace and ease.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morrell|Morrell]], 2006, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qhufPkfjmXgC&amp;pg=PA281-2 281-2].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Transitions in fiction may take any of several forms, including [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] breaks, [[section break]]s, and [[:wikt:summarization|summarization]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rosenfeld|Rosenfeld]], 2008, p. 258-265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Marshall|Marshall]], 1998, p.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8824">Women have made significant contributions to [[literature]] from the earliest times. The involvement of women in writing occurred in several early civilizations.

==History==

One of the earliest known female writer was [[Enheduanna]], whom also is the earliest known [[poet]] whose name has been recorded. She was the [[Ordination of women#Sumeria and Akkadia|High Priestess]] of the goddess [[Inanna]] and the moon god [[Nanna (Sumerian deity)|Nanna]] (Sin). She lived in the [[Sumer]]ian city-state of [[Ur]].&lt;ref&gt;''Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary'' by Jeremy Black and Anthony Green (1992, {{ISBN|0-292-70794-0}}), p. 134 (entry "Nanna-Suen").&lt;/ref&gt;

Enheduanna's contributions to [[Sumerian literature]], definitively ascribed to her, include several personal devotions to Inanna and a collection of hymns known as the "Sumerian Temple Hymns". Further additional texts are ascribed to her.&lt;ref&gt;[[William W. Hallo|Hallo]] and Van Dijk 1968 p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes her the first named author in world history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberta Binkley|title=Rhetoric before and beyond the Greeks|year=2004|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791460993|pages=47|chapter=Reading the Ancient Figure of Enheduanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the first known woman to hold the title of [[EN (cuneiform)|EN]], a role of great political importance that was often held by royal daughters.&lt;ref&gt;J Renger 1967: "Untersuchungen zum Priestertum in der altbabylonischen Zeit", ''Zeitschrift für Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Archäologie''. Vol. 58. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; She was appointed to the role by her father, King [[Sargon of Akkad]]. Her mother was probably Queen [[Tashlultum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society: The ancient Near East |author=Elisabeth Meier Tetlow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONkJ_Rj1SS8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Tashlultum#v=onepage&amp;q=Tashlultum&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-8264-1628-5 |year=2004 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East |author=Michael Roaf |authorlink=Michael Roaf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SapVAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Tashlultum&amp;dq=Tashlultum|publisher=Stonehenge Press |isbn=978-0-86706-681-4 |year=1992 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Enheduanna was appointed to the role of High Priestess in a shrewd political move by Sargon to help secure power in the south of his kingdom, where the City of Ur was located.&lt;ref name="Franke, p. 831"&gt;Franke, p. 831&lt;/ref&gt;

===7th century B.C.===
'''Sappho''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|f|oʊ}}; [[Aeolic Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ψαπφώ}} ''Psapphô''; c. 630 &amp;ndash; c. 570 BC) was an [[archaic Greek]] poet from the island of [[Lesbos]].{{efn|The fragments of Sappho's poetry are conventionally referred to by fragment number, though some also have one or more common names. The most commonly used numbering system is that of E. M. Voigt, which in most cases matches the older Lobel-Page system. Unless otherwise specified, the numeration in this article is from Diane Rayor and André Lardinois' ''Sappho: A New Translation of the Complete Works'', which uses Voigt's numeration with some variations to account for the fragments of Sappho discovered since Voigt's edition was published.}} Sappho is known for her [[Greek lyric|lyric poetry]], written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre.{{sfn|Freeman|2016|p=8}} Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has survived only in fragmentary form, except for one complete poem: the "[[Ode to Aphrodite]]". As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually [[Hellenistic]] imitations of Sappho's style.
