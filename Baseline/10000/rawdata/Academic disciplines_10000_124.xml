      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7407">An '''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)''' is a grouping of generalized [[Finite state machine#Acceptors_and_recognizers|acceptors]]. Informally, an acceptor is a device with a finite state control, a finite number of input symbols, and an internal store with a read and write function. Each acceptor has a start state and a set of accepting states. The device reads a sequence of symbols, transitioning from state to state for each input symbol. If the device ends in an accepting state, the device is said to accept the sequence of symbols. A family of acceptors is a set of acceptors with the same type of internal store. The study of AFA is part of AFL ([[abstract family of languages|abstract families of languages]]) theory. &lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;[[Seymour Ginsburg]], ''Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages'', North-Holland, 1975, {{ISBN|0-7204-2506-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definitions==

===AFA Schema===
An ''AFA Schema'' is an ordered 4-tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma, I, f, g)&lt;/math&gt;, where
# &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are nonempty abstract sets.
# &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the ''write'' function: &lt;math&gt;f : \Gamma^* \times I \rightarrow \Gamma^* \cup \{\empty\}&lt;/math&gt; (N.B. * is the [[Kleene star]] operation).
# &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the ''read'' function, a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;g (\epsilon) = \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. (N.B. &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the empty word).
# For each &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt;, there is an element &lt;math&gt;1_\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma', 1_\gamma) = \gamma'&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma')&lt;/math&gt;.
# For each ''u'' in ''I'', there exists a finite set &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_u&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, such that if &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1&lt;/math&gt;  ⊆ &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1^*&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u) \ne \empty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;(\Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_u)^*&lt;/math&gt;.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An ''abstract family of acceptors (AFA)'' is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; such that:
#&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered 6-tuple (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;), where
## (&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;) is an AFA schema; and
## &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are infinite abstract sets
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt; is the family of all acceptors &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = (&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;), where
##&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;  are finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; respectively, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;; and
##&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; (called the ''transition'' function) is a mapping from &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times  (\Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \}) \times g(\Gamma^*)&lt;/math&gt; into the finite subsets of &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times I&lt;/math&gt; such that the set &lt;math&gt;G_D = \{ \gamma &lt;/math&gt; | &lt;math&gt;\delta(q,a,\gamma) &lt;/math&gt; ≠ ø for some &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \}&lt;/math&gt; is finite.


For a given acceptor, let &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; be the relation on &lt;math&gt;K_1 \times  \Sigma_1^* \times \Gamma^*&lt;/math&gt; defined by: For &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1 \cup \{ \epsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(p,aw,\gamma) \vdash (p',w,\gamma')&lt;/math&gt; if there exists a &lt;math&gt;\overline{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\overline{\gamma}&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;g(\gamma)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(p',u)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\delta(p,a,\overline{\gamma})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(\gamma,u)=\gamma'&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\vdash^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt;.


Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; be an AFA and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; = (&lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;q_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;) be in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. Define &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* | \exists q \in F . (q_0,w,\epsilon) \vdash^* (q,\epsilon,\epsilon)\}&lt;/math&gt;. For each subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{E}) = \{L(D) | D \in \mathcal{E} \}&lt;/math&gt;.


Define &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;\{ w \in \Sigma_1^* | \exists(q \in F)\exists(\gamma \in \Gamma^*) . (q_0,w,\epsilon) \vdash^* (q,\epsilon,\gamma)\}&lt;/math&gt;. For each subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{D}&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{E}) = \{L_f(D) | D \in \mathcal{E} \}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Informal discussion==

===AFA Schema===
An AFA schema defines a store or memory with read and write function. The symbols in &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are called ''storage symbols'' and the symbols in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are called ''instructions''. The write function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; returns a new storage state given the current storage state and an instruction. The read function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; returns the current state of memory. Condition (3) insures the empty storage configuration is distinct from other configurations. Condition (4)  requires there be an identity instruction that allows the state of memory to remain unchanged while the acceptor changes state or advances the input. Condition (5) assures that the set of storage symbols for any given acceptor is finite.

===Abstract family of acceptors===
An AFA is the set of all acceptors over a given pair of state and input alphabets which have the same storage mechanism defined by a given AFA schema. The &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; relation defines one step in the operation of an acceptor.  &lt;math&gt;L_f(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor enter an accepting state. &lt;math&gt;L(D)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of words accepted by acceptor &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; by having the acceptor simultaneously enter an accepting state and having an empty storage.

The abstract acceptors defined by AFA are generalizations of other types of acceptors (e.g. [[finite state automata]], [[pushdown automata]], etc.). They have a finite state control like other automata, but their internal storage may vary widely from the stacks and tapes used in classical automata.

==Results from AFL theory==
The main result from AFL theory is that a family of languages &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.  Equally important is the result that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a full semi-AFL if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_f(\mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt; for some AFA &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{D})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Origins==

[[Seymour Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Sheila Greibach]] of [[Harvard University]] first presented their AFL theory paper at the [[IEEE]] Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory in 1967.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2891921 IEEE conference record of 1967 Eighth Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory] : papers presented at the Eighth Annual Symposium, University of Texas, October 18-20, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Air Stripper for Wikipedia.png|thumb|right|250px|Figure 1. An air stripper]]
'''Air stripping''' is the  transferring of [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] components of a liquid into an air stream. It is an [[environmental engineering]] technology used for the purification of groundwaters and wastewaters containing volatile compounds.

Volatile compounds have relatively high [[vapor pressure]] and low aqueous solubility characterized by the compound’s [[Henry's law]] coefficient, which is the ratio of the concentration in air that is in equilibrium with its concentration in water. Pollutants with relatively high Henry’s Law coefficients can be economically stripped from water. These include [[BTEX]] compounds ([[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylene]] found in gasoline), and solvents including [[trichloroethylene]] and [[tetrachloroethylene]]. [[Ammonia]] can also be [[ammonia stripping|stripped]] from wastewaters and liquid digestates (often requiring pH adjustment prior to stripping). Since Henry’s law coefficient increases with temperature, stripping is easier at warmer temperatures.

==Air strippers==

Although any device that promotes contact between air and water strips some volatile compounds, air strippers are usually packed towers or [[Theoretical tray|tray]] towers operated with countercurrent flow of water and air. Packed towers, such as shown in Figure 1, usually use engineered or random plastic packings. Design criteria for packed towers include surface area provided by the packing, column height and diameter, and air to water flow rates.

Since many of the compounds stripped are [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants|hazardous air pollutants]], the air exiting a stripper may require emissions control. [[Activated carbon#Applications|Carbon adsorption]] is often used and [[catalytic oxidation]] is another option.

The '''Beaver Hall Group''' refers to a [[Montreal]]-based group of [[Canadians|Canadian]] painters who met in the late 1910s while studying art at a school run by the [[Art Association of Montreal]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Group is notable for its equal inclusion of men and women artists, as well as for its embrace of Jazz Age modernism. They painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, landscapes, urban scenes and still lifes, in a mix of [[Modern art|Modernist]] and traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All ten of the group's participants had studied under [[William Brymner]] (1855–1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meadowcroft|first1=Barbara|title=Painting friends: the Beaver Hall women painters|date=1999|publisher=Véhicule Press|location=Montreal, Quebec, Canada|isbn=1-55065-125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of [[Randolph Stanley Hewton]], [[Edwin Holgate]], [[Mabel May]] and [[Lilias Torrance Newton]].&lt;ref&gt;http://artcore.ca/beaverhall.html&lt;/ref&gt; The group's name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the [[downtown Montreal]] studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included [[Mabel Lockerby]], [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]], and President of the group, [[A.Y. Jackson]].

The first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, [[A.Y. Jackson|Jackson]] emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel "with utter disregard for what
has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. 'Schools' and 'isms' do not trouble us," Jackson stressed, "individual expression is our chief concern".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; He identified its goals as being those of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the ''Montreal Gazette'' and ''La Presse'' gave generous coverage to the vernissage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO926-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The association only survived for two years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Evelyn|title=The women of Beaver Hall: Canadian modernist painters|date=2005|publisher=Dundurn Press|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=1-55002-588-0|pages=12–13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k4APse3bdiMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Beaver%20Hall%20Group&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an information association into the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Nora McCullough's (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition "The Beaver Hall Hill Group". Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough's aim was to expose the talent of Quebec's women artists to western Canada. [[Anne Savage (artist)|Anne Savage]] and [[A.Y. Jackson]] had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, ''1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group'' at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, "As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn't the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ngcmagazine.ca/correspondents/jazz-age-montreal-and-the-beaver-hall-group-canada-s-other-modernist-art-movement|title = Jazz Age Montreal and the Beaver Hall Group: Canada's Other Modernist Art Movement|date = December 14, 2015|accessdate = January 5, 2016|website = Magazine|publisher = National Gallery of Canada|last = Singhal|first = Sheila}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson : Professor of Classical and Near Eastern Studies and of Law|publisher=Law.umn.edu|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Levinson earned an Honors B.A. from [[York University]] in 1974, where he majored in Humanities and English and graduated with first class honors. He received his M.A in Religious Studies from [[McMaster University]] in 1978. Following his two years at McMaster, he spent a year as Visiting Researcher in Bible and Semitic Languages at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1991, under the advisor [[Michael Fishbane]], he received a Ph.D. in [[Near Eastern]] and Judaic Studies from [[Brandeis University]].

==Professional career==
Bernard Levinson began his professional teaching career at [[Middlebury College]] in Vermont, teaching there for a semester each in 1983 and 1984. In 1987, he received a fellowship as the Stroum Fellow in Advanced Jewish Studies at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle. Subsequently, while working on his dissertation, he taught full-time for two years in the Religious Studies Program at [[The Pennsylvania State University]]. Upon the completion of his dissertation, he was appointed to [[Indiana University]] in Bloomington, as an assistant professor in its Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, with adjunct appointments to both Jewish Studies and Religious Studies.  Midway through his appointment, he was invited to spend a year as a visiting scholar in the Faculty of Protestant Theology at Johannes Gutenberg University, in Mainz, Germany (1992–1993). After being tenured at Indiana University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721192357/http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/iubot/view?docId=apr0497&amp;chunk.id=d1e792&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d1e792&amp;brand=iubot | title=DynaXML Error: Invalid Document}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was appointed to the University of Minnesota's Department of Classical and Near Eastern Studies as the first inhabitant of the Berman Family Chair in Jewish Studies and Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~chouweb/News/startribune2.html|title=U loses some, wins some in fight to hire and retain stars|publisher=Princeton.edu|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was the first endowed chair in the College of Liberal Arts and was seen as distinctive for confirming the significance of the academic study of religion within a public and state university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/m/summer98/window.html |accessdate=October 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920200426/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/m/summer98/window.html |archivedate=September 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after his arrival, he received an appointment to the Law School as an affiliated faculty member.&lt;ref name="Son"/&gt;  In 2009, he was promoted to the rank of full professor, and in 2010, honored as a scholar of the College of Liberal Arts 2010–2013.

The interdisciplinary significance of Levinson's work has been recognized with appointments to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] (1997); the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin/Berlin Institute for Advanced Study (2007); and to the National Humanities Center (Research Triangle, NC), as the Henry Luce Senior Fellow in Religious Studies (2011 academic year). Bernard Levinson seeks to bring the academic biblical scholarship to the attention of a broader, non-specialist readership&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiousstudies.umn.edu/events/perspectives/index.php?entry=204229|title=Perspectives: the Magazine of the Program in Religious Studies : Vol. 4, No. 1|publisher=Religiousstudies.umn.edu|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, he has recently written on the impact of the [[James I of England|King James]] Version of the Bible upon the American Founding;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/LevinsonBermanKJV400HistoryChannel.pdf|format=PDF|title=King James Bible at 400|publisher=Sbl-site.org|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawn attention in the national press to the role of early feminist Bible scholars like [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] in helping win the vote for women;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/25/opinion/l-religion-led-to-rift-among-mothers-of-feminism-075710.html|title=Religion Led to Rift Among Mothers of Feminism|date=25 July 1998|publisher=Nytimes.com|accessdate=12 December 2014|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in his attention to language, has been cited in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.is/20130708141101/http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/258271?p=emailAkHJ62R7ZZSpc&amp;d=258271 | title=Oneiromancer, n. : Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2010, he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research, the oldest professional organization of Judaica scholars in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aajr.org/officers-and-fellows/] {{dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows are nominated and elected by their peers and thus constitute the most distinguished and most senior scholars teaching Judaic studies at American universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aajr.org/|title=American Academy of Jewish Research|publisher=Aajr.org|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levinson was at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Hebrew University of Jerusalem during the 2012–13 academic year. During his time at IAS, he co-directed an international research team on a project titled "Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory: Bridging the Academic Cultures of Israel, North America, and Europe" and co-organized an international conference, which was held on May 12–13, 2013. The conference featured presentations from a range of scholars and sought to further international exchange and establish a shared intellectual dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.as.huji.ac.il/content/convergence-and-divergence-pentateuchal-theory-bridging-academic-cultures-israel-north/|title=Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory: Bridging the Academic Cultures of Israel, North America, and Europe  - The Institute for Advanced Studies|publisher=As.huji.ac.il|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Levinson has co-organized a second international conference at IAS with the title "The Pentateuch within Biblical Literature: Formation and Interaction." This upcoming conference, scheduled for May 25–29, 2014, in Jerusalem, will focus primarily on the formation of the Pentateuch and its interaction with both the prophetic corpus and the historiographic literature of the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ias.huji.ac.il/pentateuch|title=The Pentateuch within Biblical Literature: Formation and Interaction|publisher=Ias.huji.ac.il|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological bet hedging''' occurs when organisms suffer decreased fitness in their typical conditions in exchange for increased fitness in stressful conditions. Biological bet hedging was originally proposed to explain the observation of a [[Soil seed bank|seed bank]], or a reservoir of ungerminated seeds in the soil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Dan|date=1966-09-01|title=Optimizing reproduction in a randomly varying environment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022519366901883|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=119–129|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(66)90188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Annual plant|annual plant's]] [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] is maximized for that year if all of its seeds germinate. However, if a drought occurs that kills germinated plants, but not ungerminated seeds, plants with seeds remaining in the seed bank will have a fitness advantage. Therefore, it can be advantageous for plants to "hedge their bets" in case of a drought by producing some seeds that germinate immediately and other seeds that lie dormant.

== Overview ==

=== Categories ===
There are three categories (strategies) of bet-hedging: "conservative" bet-hedging, "diversified" bet-hedging, and "adaptive coin flipping."

====Conservative bet hedging====
In conservative bet hedging, individuals lower their expected fitness in exchange for a lower variance in fitness.  The idea of this strategy is for an organism to "always play it safe" by using the same successful low-risk strategy regardless of environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="strategies"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olofsson|first1=H.|last2=Ripa|first2=J.|last3=Jonzen|first3=N.|title=Bet-hedging as an evolutionary game: the trade-off between egg size and number|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=27 May 2009|volume=276|issue=1669|pages=2963–2969|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0500|pmc=2817213}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this would be an organism producing [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] with a constant egg size that may not be optimal for any environmental condition, but result in the lowest overall variance.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

====Diversified bet hedging====
In contrast to conservative bet hedging, diversified bet hedging occurs when individuals lower their expected fitness in a given year while also increasing the variance of survival between offspring.  This strategy uses the idea of not "putting all of your eggs in a basket."&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt; Individuals implementing this strategy actually invest in several different strategies at once, resulting in low variation in long-term success.  This could be demonstrated by a clutch of eggs of different sizes, each optimal for one potential environment of the offspring.  While this means that offspring specialized for another environment are less likely to survive to adulthood, it also protects against the possibility of no offspring surviving to the next year.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;

====Adaptive coin flipping====
An individual using this type of bet hedging chooses what strategy to use based on a prediction of what the environment will be like. Organisms using this form of bet hedging make these predictions and select strategies annually.  For example, an organism may produce clutches of different egg sizes from year to year, increasing variation in offspring success between clutches.&lt;ref name="strategies" /&gt;  Unlike conservative and diversified bet hedging strategies, adaptive coin flipping isn't concerned with minimizing the variation in fitness between years.

== Evolution ==
To determine if a bet hedging allele is favored, the long-term fitness of each allele must be compared.  Particularly in highly variable environments where bet hedging is likely to evolve, long-term fitness is best measured using the [[geometric mean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dempster|first=Everett R.|date=1955-01-01|title=MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC HETEROGENEITY|url=http://symposium.cshlp.org/content/20/25|journal=Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology|language=en|volume=20|pages=25–32|doi=10.1101/SQB.1955.020.01.005|issn=0091-7451|pmid=13433552}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is multiplicative instead of additive like the [[arithmetic mean]].  The geometric mean is highly sensitive to small values.  Even rare occurrences of zero fitness for a [[genotype]] result in it having an expected geometric mean of zero. This makes it appropriate for circumstances where a single genotype may have variable fitness depending on environmental circumstances.

Bet hedging is understood to be a mode of response to environmental change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=Andrew M.|date=2011-06-07|title=Modes of response to environmental change and the elusive empirical evidence for bet hedging|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|volume=278|issue=1712|pages=1601–1609|doi=10.1098/rspb.2011.0176|issn=1471-2954|pmc=3081777|pmid=21411456}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations that allow organisms to survive in fluctuating environmental conditions provide an evolutionary advantage.  While a bet hedging trait may not be optimal for any one environment, this is outweighed by the benefits of higher fitness across a variety of environments.  Therefore, bet hedging [[allele]]s tend to be favored in more variable environments.  In order for a bet hedging allele to spread, it must persist in the typical environment through [[genetic drift]] long enough for the alternative environment, in which the bet hedger has an advantage, to occur. At that point, selection may [[Selective sweep|sweep]] the allele to fixation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Oliver D.|last2=Masel|first2=Joanna|date=2007-12-01|title=The evolution of bet-hedging adaptations to rare scenarios|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580907000925|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=72|issue=4|pages=560–575|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2007.08.006|pmc=2118055|pmid=17915273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example used when describing bet hedging is comparing the arithmetic and geometric fitness between specialist and bet hedging genotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippi|first=Tom|last2=Seger|first2=Jon|title=Hedging one's evolutionary bets, revisited|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0169534789901389|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=41–44|doi=10.1016/0169-5347(89)90138-9|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford surveys in evolutionary biology|last=Seger|first=Jon|last2=Brockmann|first2=H.

The good year specialist has the highest fitness during a good year but does very poorly during a bad year, while the reverse is true for a bad year specialist. The conservative bet hedger does equally well in all years and the diversified bet hedger in this example uses the two specialist strategies each 50% of the time; they perform better than the conservative bet hedger in good years, but worse during a bad year.

In this example, fitness is approximately equal within the specialist and bet hedger strategies, with the bet hedgers having a significantly higher fitness than the specialists. While the good year specialist' has the highest arithmetic mean, the bet hedging strategies are still preferred due to their higher geometric mean.

It is also important to realize that the fitness of any strategy is dependent on a large number of factors, such as the ratio of good to bad years and its relative fitness between good and bad years. Small changes in the strategies or environment having a large impact on which is optimal.  In the above example, the diversified bet hedger outweighs the conservative bet hedger if it uses the good year specialist strategy more often. In contrast, if the relative fitness of the good year specialist was 0.35 in a bad year, it becomes the optimal strategy.

== In organisms ==

=== Prokarya ===
Experiments in bet hedging using prokaryotic model organisms provide some of the most simplified views of the evolution of bet hedging. As bet hedging involves a stochastic switching between [[phenotype]]s across generations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beaumont | first1 = H. J. E. | last2 = Kost | first2 = C. | last3 = Rainey | first3 = P. B. | last4 = Gallie | first4 = J. | last5 = Ferguson | first5 = G. C. | year = 2009 | title = Experimental evolution of bet hedging | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 462 | issue = 7269| pages = 90–93 | doi = 10.1038/nature08504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[prokaryote]]s are able to display this phenomenon quite nicely due to their ability to reproduce quickly enough to track evolution in a single population over a short period of time. This rapid rate of reproduction has allowed for the study of bet hedging in labs through experimental evolution models. These models have been used to deduce the evolutionary origins of bet hedging.

Within prokarya, there are a multitude of bet hedging examples. In one example, the bacterium ''[[Sinorhizobium meliloti]]'' stores carbon and energy in a compound known as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in order to withstand carbon-deficient environments. When starved, ''S. meliloti'' populations begin to display bet hedging by forming two non-identical [[Cell division|daughter cells]] during [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. The daughter cells display either low PHB levels or high PHB levels, which are better suited to short and long-term starvation, respectively. It has been reported that the low-PHB must compete effectively for resources in order to survive, whereas the high-PHB cells can survive for over a year without food. In this example, the PHB phenotype is being ‘bet-hedged’, as the survivability of the offspring largely depends on their environment, where only one phenotype is likely to survive under specific conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ratcliff | first1 = W. C. | last2 = Denison | first2 = R. F. | year = 2010 | title = Individual-level bet hedging in the bacterium sinorhizobium meliloti | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 20 | issue = 19| pages = 1740–1744 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2010.08.036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of bet hedging arises in ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''. In a given population of this bacteria, persister cells exist with the ability to arrest their growth, which leaves them unaffected by dramatic changes to the environment. Once the persister cells grow to form another population of its species, which may or may not be [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistant]], they will produce both cells with normal cell growth and another population of persisters to continue this cycle as the case may be. The ability to switch between the persister and normal phenotype is a form of bet-hedging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veening | first1 = J. | last2 = Smits | first2 = W. K. | last3 = Kuipers | first3 = O. P. | year = 2008 | title = Bistability, epigenetics, and bet-hedging in bacteria | url = | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 193–210 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.62.081307.163002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prokaryotic persistence as a method of bet hedging is thus of importance to the field of medicine due to bacterial persistence. Because bet hedging is designed to produce genetically diverse offspring randomly in order to survive catastrophe, it is difficult to develop treatments for bacterial infections, as bet hedging may ensure the survival of its species within its host, heedless to the antibiotic.

=== Eukarya ===
Eukaryotic bet hedging models, unlike prokaryotic models, tend to be used to study more complex evolutionary proceces. In the context of eukaryotes, bet hedging is best used as a way to analyze complex environmental influences  affecting the selective pressures underlying the principle  of bet hedging. However, because Eukarya is a broad category, this section has been subdivided into kingdoms [[Animal]]ia, [[Plant]]ae, and [[Fungus|Fungi]].

==== Vertebrates ====
In example, West [[Atlantic salmon]] ([[Atlantic salmon|''Salmo salar'']]) have been hypothesized to have [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC)-dependent mating systems, which have been shown in other species to be important for determining disease resistance among offspring. Namely, there is evidence that selection for increased MHC diversity is a strong influence on mate choice, where it is thought that individuals are more likely to mate with individuals whose MHC is less similar to their own in order to produce variable offspring. In accordance with the bet hedging model, it has been found that the reproductive success of mating pairs of Atlantic salmon is environmentally dependent, where certain MHC constructs are only advantageous under specific environmental circumstances. Thus, this supports the evidence that MHC diversity is crucial for the long-term reproductive success of the parents, as the tradeoff for an initial decrease in short-term reproductive fitness is mediated by the survival of a few of their offspring in a variable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Evans | first1 = M. L. | last2 = Dionne | first2 = M. | last3 = Miller | first3 = K.

A second example among vertebrates is the marsupial species [[Stripe-faced dunnart|''Sminthopsis macrour'']], which use a [[torpor]] strategy in order to reduce their metabolic rate to survive environmental changes. Reproductive [[hormone]] cycles have been shown to mediate the timing of torpor and reproduction, and in mice have been shown to mediate this process entirely, heedless to the environment. In the marsupial species, however, an adaptive coin flipping mechanism is employed where neither torpor nor reproduction are affected by manipulation of hormones, suggesting that this [[marsupial]] species makes a more active decision about when to use torpor that is better-suited to the uncertain environment in which it lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAllan | first1 = B.

==== Invertebrates ====
Many invertebrate species are known to exhibit various forms of bet hedging. ''Diaptomus sanguineus,'' an aquatic crustacean species found in many ponds of the Northeast United States, is one of the most well-studied examples of bet hedging. This species uses a form of diversified bet hedging called germ banking, in which emergence timing among offspring from a single clutch is highly variable. This reduces the potential costs of a catastrophic event during a particularly vulnerable time in offspring development. In ''Diaptomus sanguineus'', germ banking occurs when parents produce dormant eggs prior to annual environmental shifts that yield increased risk for developing offspring. For example, in temporary ponds, ''Diaptomus sanguineus'' production of dormant eggs peaks just before the annual dry season in June when ponds levels decrease. In permanent ponds, dormant egg production increases in March, just before an annual increase in feeding activity of sunfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Margaret E K|last2=Dennehy|first2=John J|date=2005-12-01|title=Germ Banking: Bet‐Hedging and Variable Release from Egg and Seed Dormancy|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/498282|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=80|issue=4|pages=431–451|doi=10.1086/498282|issn=0033-5770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example demonstrates that germ banking may take different forms within a species depending on the environmental risk presented. Bet hedging through variable egg hatching patterns are seen in other crustaceans as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radzikowski|first=J.|date=2013-07-01|title=Resistance of dormant stages of planktonic invertebrates to adverse environmental conditions|url=https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article/35/4/707/1528340/Resistance-of-dormant-stages-of-planktonic|journal=Journal of Plankton Research|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=707–723|doi=10.1093/plankt/fbt032|issn=0142-7873}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hakalahti|first=Teija|last2=Häkkinen|first2=Heli|last3=Valtonen|first3=E.

Invertebrate bet-hedging has also been observed in the mating systems of some species of spider. Female sierra dome spiders (''Linyphia litigiosa)'' are polyandrous, mating with secondary males in order to compensate for uncertainty regarding the quality of the primary mate. Primary male mates are considered to be of higher fitness than secondary males, as primary mates must overcome intrasexual fighting prior to mating with a female, while secondary male mates are chosen through female choice. Scientists believe multiple paternity has evolved in response to virgin insemination by low quality secondary male mates who have not undergone selection through intrasexual fighting. Females have developed a mechanism for sperm precedence to retain control over offspring paternity and increase offspring fitness. Further examination of female genitalia has supported this hypothesis. The sierra dome spider exhibits this behavior as a form of genetic bet hedging, reducing the risk of producing low quality offspring and contracting venereal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Paul J.|date=1991-02-01|title=Multiple paternity as genetic bet-hedging in female sierra dome spiders, Linyphia litigiosa (Linyphiidae)|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347205804865|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=41|issue=2|pages=343–360|doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80486-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of bet hedging is notably different than most other forms of bet hedging, as it has not arisen in response to environmental conditions, but rather it has arisen as a result of the species mating system.

===== Fungi =====

Bet hedging is employed in fungi similarly to bacteria, but in fungi, it is more complex. This phenomenon is beneficial to fungi, but in some cases, it has harmful effects on humans, illustrating that bet hedging has clinical importance. One study suggests that bet hedging may even contribute to the failure of chemotherapy in cancer due to mechanisms similar to that of bet hedging used in fungi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meadows|first1=Robin|title=Yeast Survive by Hedging Their Bets|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001327|website=PLOS Biology|pages=e1001327|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001327|date=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One way fungi use bet hedging is by displaying different colony morphologies when grown on agar plates.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Sasha F.|last2=Ziv|first2=Naomi|last3=Siegal|first3=Mark L.|title=Bet Hedging in Yeast by Heterogeneous, Age-Correlated Expression of a Stress Protectant|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325|website=PLOS Biology|pages=e1001325|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001325|date=8 May 2012|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This variation allows for colonies with different morphologies, including resistances that allow them to survive, to thrive and reproduce in different conditions or environments. As a result, fungal infections may be more difficult to treat if bet hedging is involved. For example, pathogenic strains of yeast like ''[[Candida albicans]]'' or ''[[Candida glabrata]]'' using this strategy will resist treatments. These fungi are known to cause an infection known as [[candidiasis]].

While bet hedging in fungi is important, not much is known about the mechanisms for the different strategies employed by different species. Researchers have studied ''[[S. cerevisiae]]'' to determine the mechanism of bet hedging in this species.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It was determined that in ''S. cerevisiae'', variation exists in the distribution of growth rates among yeast micro-colonies and that slow growth is a predictor of resistance to heat. Tsl1 is one gene that was determined as a factor in this resistance. The abundance of this gene was shown to correlate with heat and stress resistance, and thus survival of the yeast micro-colonies under harsh conditions by using bet hedging. This illustrates that by using bet hedging, pathogenic strains of this yeast that are harmful to humans are more difficult to treat.

A group of researchers studied another way bet hedging is used by looking at the ascomycete fungus ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Jeffrey K.|last2=Smith|first2=Myron L.|last3=Simons|first3=Andrew M.|title=Experimental evolution of bet hedging under manipulated environmental uncertainty in Neurospora crassa|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1787/20140706|website=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|pages=20140706|language=en|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0706|date=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was observed that this species produces [[ascospores]] with variation in their dormancy because non-dormant ascospores can be killed by heat, but dormant ascospores will survive. The only con is that it will take longer for the dormant ascopores to be germinated.

==== Plantae ====
Plants provide simple examples for studying bet hedging in wildlife, allowing for field studies but without as many confounding factors as animals.  Studying closely related plant species can help us understand more about the circumstances under which bet hedging evolves.

The classic example of bet hedging, delayed seed germination,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; has been extensively studied in desert annuals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clauss|first=M. J.|last2=Venable|first2=D. L.|date=2000-02-01|title=Seed Germination in Desert Annuals: An Empirical Test of Adaptive Bet Hedging.|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/303314|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=155|issue=2|pages=168–186|doi=10.1086/303314|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Philippi|first=Thomas|date=1993-09-01|title=Bet-Hedging Germination of Desert Annuals: Variation Among Populations and Maternal Effects in Lepidium lasiocarpum|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/285551|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=142|issue=3|pages=488–507|doi=10.1086/285551|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gremer|first=Jennifer R.|last2=Venable|first2=D. Lawrence|date=2014-03-01|title=Bet hedging in desert winter annual plants: optimal germination strategies in a variable environment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ele.12241/abstract|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=380–387|doi=10.1111/ele.12241|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; One four-year field study&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; found that populations in historically worse (drier) environments had lower germination rates. They also found a large range of germination dates and flexibility in germination for drier populations when exposed to rain, a phenomenon known as [[phenotypic plasticity]]. Other studies of desert annuals&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; have also found a relationship between temporal variation and lower germination rates. One of these  studies&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; also found the density of seeds in the seed bank to affect germination rates.

Bet hedging through a seed bank has also been implicated in the persistence of weeds. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=H. A.|last2=Feast|first2=Patricia M.|date=1972-12-01|title=Fate of Seeds of Some Annual Weeds in Different Depths of Cultivated and Undisturbed Soil|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3180.1972.tb01226.x/abstract|journal=Weed Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=316–324|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3180.1972.tb01226.x|issn=1365-3180}}&lt;/ref&gt; of twenty weed species showed that the percentage of viable seeds after 5 years increased with soil depth, and germination rates decreased with soil depth (although specific numbers varied between species). This indicates that weeds will engage in bet hedging at higher rates in circumstances where the costs of bet hedging are lower.

Collectively, these findings do provide evidence for bet hedging in plants, but also show the importance of competition and phenotypic plasticity that simple bet hedging models often ignore.

=== Archaea ===
Thus far, research on bet hedging involving species in the domain [[Archaea]] hasn't been easily accessible.

The '''Eli and Edythe L. Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|r|oʊ|d}}), often referred to as the '''Broad Institute''', is a biomedical and [[genomic]] research center located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. The institute is independently governed and supported as a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit research organization under the name Broad Institute Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonprofit Report for BROAD INSTITUTE INC.|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/26-3428781/broad-institute.aspx|website=GuideStar.org|accessdate=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute-MIT &amp; Harvard|url=http://www.manta.com/c/mmn4bcl/broad-institute-mit-harvard|publisher=Manta Media Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is partners with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], and the five Harvard [[teaching hospitals]].

== History ==

The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of research collaborations among MIT and Harvard scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2007-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One cornerstone was the Center for Genome Research of [[Whitehead Institute]] at MIT. Founded in 1982, the Whitehead became a major center for genomics and the [[Human Genome Project]]. As early as 1995, scientists at the Whitehead started pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among young scientists interested in genomic approaches to cancer and human genetics. Another cornerstone was the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology established by [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1998 to pursue chemical genetics as an academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its screening facility was one of the first high-throughput resources opened in an academic setting. It facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.

To create a new organization that was open, collaborative, cross-disciplinary and able to organize projects at any scale, planning took place in 2002–2003 among philanthropists [[Eli Broad|Eli and Edythe Broad]], MIT, the Whitehead Institute, Harvard and the Harvard-affiliated hospitals (in particular, the [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]], [[Children's Hospital Boston]], the [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] and the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]).

The Broads made a founding gift of $100 million and the Broad Institute was formally launched in May 2004. In November 2005, the Broads announced an additional $100 million gift to the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Facilities ==

The Broad Institute's facilities at 320 Charles Street in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], house one of the largest genome [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] centers in the world. As [[WICGR]] (Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research), this facility was the largest contributor of sequence information to the [[Human Genome Project]].

In February 2006, The Broad Institute expanded to a new building at 415 Main Street, adjacent to the [[Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broad.mit.edu/info/visiting.html|title=Contact - Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seven-story {{convert|231000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building contains office, research laboratory, retail and museum space. In 2011, the institute announced plans to construct an additional tower adjacent to the 415 Main Street site at 75 Ames Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipinski|first=Pearle|title=Broad plans extension in Cambridge Center|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N9/broad.html|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2014, the Broad officially inaugurated a 375,000-square-foot research building at 75 Ames Street in Cambridge’s [[Kendall Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broad Institute celebrates opening of new building|url=https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/5748|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new facility has 15 floors, 11 of which are occupied, and has [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] gold certification. As of July 2014, it has around 800 occupants.

==Funding==

The '''Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act''' ('''CISPA''' {{USBill|112|HR|3523}} (112th Congress), {{USBill|113|HR|624}} (113th Congress), {{USBill|114|HR|234}} (114th Congress)) was a proposed law in the United States which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies. The stated aim of the bill is to help the U.S. government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security of networks against cyberattacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HR 3523 as reported to the House Rules Committee | url=http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228035632/http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | archivedate=February 28, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation was introduced on November 30, 2011, by Representative [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Michael Rogers]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[List of United States Representatives from Michigan|MI]]) and 111 co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=H.R. 3523 | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3523: | publisher=Library of Congress | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Current Status of CISPA | url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3523 | publisher=GovTrack | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed in the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012, but was not passed by the [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 192 | url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll192.xml | accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]]'s advisers have argued that the bill lacks confidentiality and civil liberties safeguards, and the White House said he would [[veto]] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=Cyber-security bill Cispa passes US House | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17864539 | newspaper=[[BBC News]] | date=April 26, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015 a version of CISPA was hidden in the total federal budget.

CISPA had garnered favor from corporations and lobbying groups such as [[Microsoft]], [[Facebook]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[IBM]], and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], which look on it as a simple and effective means of sharing important cyber threat information with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=CISPA: Who’s for it, who’s against it and how it could affect you | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/cispa-whos-for-it-whos-against-it-and-how-it-could-affect-you/2012/04/27/gIQA5ur0lT_story.html | author=Hayley Tsukayama | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=April 27, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has however been criticized by advocates of [[Internet privacy]] and [[civil liberties]], such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], [[Fight for the Future]], and [[Avaaz.org]], as well as various [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups including the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], TechFreedom, [[FreedomWorks]], [[Americans for Limited Government]], [[Liberty Coalition]], and the [[American Conservative Union]]. Those groups argue CISPA contains too few limits on how and when the government may monitor a private individual’s Internet browsing information. Additionally, they fear that such new powers could be used to spy on the general public rather than to pursue malicious hackers.&lt;ref name="techdirt1"&gt;{{cite web | last=Masnick  | first=Mike  | url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120402/04425118325/forget-sopa-you-should-be-worried-about-this-cybersecurity-bill.shtml  | title=Forget SOPA, You Should Be Worried About This Cybersecurity Bill  | publisher=Techdirt  | date=April 2, 2012  | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2012/04/19/5-reasons-the-cispa-cybersecurity-bill-should-be-tossed/ 5 Reasons the CISPA Cybersecurity Bill Should Be Tossed] Time Techland, By Matt Peckham&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some critics saw wording included in CISPA as a second attempt to protect intellectual property after the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] was taken off the table by Congress after it met opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=CISPA legislation seen by many as SOPA 2.0 | author=Morgan Little | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/09/news/la-pn-cispa-legislation-seen-by-many-as-sopa-20-20120409 | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 9, 2012 | accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intellectual property]] theft was initially listed in the bill as a possible cause for sharing Web traffic information with the government, though it was removed in subsequent drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=House Cybersecurity Bill Backs Off On IP Theft Provisions | url=http://www.law360.com/articles/330398/house-cybersecurity-bill-backs-off-on-ip-theft-provisions | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
CISPA is an amendment to the [[National Security Act of 1947]], which does not currently contain provisions pertaining to cybercrime. It adds provisions to the Act describing cyber threat intelligence as "information in the possession of an element of the intelligence community directly pertaining to a vulnerability of, or threat to, a system or network of a government or private entity, including information pertaining to the protection of a system or network from either "efforts to degrade, disrupt, or destroy such system or network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/CyberBillDiscussion113011.pdf H.R. 3523 Discussion Draft] - U.S. House of Representatives - November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CISPA requires the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to allow [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] elements to share cyber threat intelligence with private-sector entities and encourage the sharing of such intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CRS report on CISPA | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03523:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; | publisher=Congressional Research Service | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kominsky|first=Mitchell|date=February 2014|title=The Current Landscape of Cybersecurity Policy: Legislative Issues in the 113th Congress|url=http://harvardnsj.org/2014/02/the-current-landscape-of-cybersecurity-policy-legislative-issues-in-the-113th-congress/|journal=Harvard Law School National Security Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 16, 2012, press release, the [[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence|House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] announced the approval of several amendments to CISPA, including the addition of a new provision "to permit federal lawsuits against the government for any violation of restrictions placed on the government’s use of voluntarily shared information, including the important privacy and civil liberties protections contained in the bill," the inclusion of an anti-tasking provision to "explicitly prohibit the government from conditioning its sharing of cyber threat intelligence on the sharing of private sector information with the government", and the prevention of the government from using the information for "any other lawful purpose unless the government already has a significant cybersecurity or national security purpose in using the information". Relevant provisions were also clarified to "focus on the fact that the bill is designed to protect against unauthorized access to networks or systems, including unauthorized access aimed at stealing private or government information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Discussion Draft HR 3523 | url=http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/bill-status-update-hr-3523 | publisher=[[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence]] | accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, already collected cyberthreat data can also be used to investigate "the imminent threat of bodily harm to an individual" or "the exploitation of a minor," bringing the bill into line with existing law codified by the [[Patriot Act]] and the PROTECT Our Children Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s1738|title=PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 (2008; 110th Congress S. 1738) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which these two conditions already allow for protected entities to share data voluntarily with the United States government, law enforcement agencies, and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].

==Recent developments==
Bill sponsors [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] and [[Dutch Ruppersberger]], the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, respectively, said on April 25, 2012, that the Obama administration's opposition is mostly based on the lack of critical infrastructure regulation, something outside of the jurisdiction of the Intelligence committee; they have also since introduced a package of amendments to the legislation that, "address nearly every single one of the criticisms leveled by the Administration, particularly those regarding privacy and civil liberties of Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Albanesius | first=Chloe | title=White House Threatens to Veto CISPA | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403549,00.asp | publisher=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the opposition the bill has experienced, the co-sponsors are planning to amend the bill to address many of the concerns of its opponents—including limiting its scope to a narrower definition of cyber-threats, and stating that the "theft of intellectual property" refers to the theft of [[research and development]]. In addition, there will now be penalties if private companies or the government uses data from CISPA for purposes "unrelated to cyberthreats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/new-cispa-amendments-expected-but-the-fight-will-go-on/ New CISPA amendments expected - but the fight will go on] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/cispa-and-sopa-like-apples-and-oranges-say-chief-co-sponsors/ CISPA and SOPA like 'apples and oranges,' say chief co-sponsors] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sharan Bradford Franklin, of the [[Constitution Project]] states, "Although we appreciate the Intelligence Committee's efforts to improve the bill and willingness to engage in a dialogue with privacy advocates, the changes in its most current draft do not come close to addressing the civil liberties threats posed by the bill, and some of the proposals would actually make CISPA worse.

Rainey Reitman, of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] states, "To date, the authors of the bill have been unresponsive to these criticisms, offering amendments that are largely cosmetic. Dismissing the grave concerns about how this bill could undermine the core privacy rights of everyday Internet users, Rep. Mike Rogers characterized the growing protests against CISPA as 'turbulence' and vowed to push for a floor vote without radical changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-is-dangerously-vague | title=CISPA Is Dangerously Vague | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendall Burman of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] states, "The authors of CISPA have made some positive changes recently. Unfortunately, none of the changes gets to the heart of the privacy concerns that Internet users and advocacy groups have expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-not-the-right-way-to-achieve-cybersecurity | title=CISPA Not the Right Way to Achieve Cybersecurity | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Office of Management and Budget]] of the Executive Office of the President of the United States released a statement strongly opposing the current bill and recommending to veto it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saphr3523r_20120425.pdf Statement of Administration Policy - H.R. 3523 - Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act] - Office of Management and Budget, April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2012, the House of Representatives passed CISPA.

On February 13, 2013, United States Representative Mike Rogers reintroduced the CISPA bill in the 113th Congress as H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=CISPA-reintroduced/&gt;

On April 18, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=Final-Vote-Results/&gt; The Senate has reportedly refused to vote on the measure and is drafting competing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Gerry | title=Senate Won't Vote On CISPA, Deals Blow To Controversial Cyber Bill | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/cispa-cyber-bill_n_3158221.html | accessdate=April 29, 2013 | newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has also issued a statement opposing the bill stating, "The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act would create a cybersecurity exception to all privacy laws and allow companies to share the private and personal data they hold on their American customers with the government for cybersecurity purposes."

*The [[Sunlight Foundation]] states, "The new cybersecurity bill, CISPA, or HR 3523, is terrible on transparency.

*[[Reporters Without Borders]] states, "Reporters Without Borders is deeply concerned with the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011 (CISPA), the [[cyber security]] bill now before the US Congress. In the name of the war on cyber crime, it would allow the government and private companies to deploy draconian measures to monitor, even censor, the Web.

The bill still retains its dangerously over-broad language, still lacks civilian control, still lacks judicial oversight, and still lacks clear limits on government monitoring of our Internet browsing information.

The '''Department of Musicology''' is an institute of [[Palacký University]] [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], which conducts research and provides education in the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Fine art#Academic study|fine art]]. While the Faculty of Philosophy dates back to 1576 and has provided education for a number of [[Aesthetics|art theorists]], the separate Department of Musicology was established in 1946. It is sited in the building of University Art Centre (former Jesuit College), together with other two art departments of Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]].

==History==
Established in 1573, the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]] has a long history of musical scholarship. Olomouc prominently excels in the sphere of [[classical music]] ([[Jacobus Gallus|J. H. Gallus]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W. A. Mozart]], [[Antonín Dvořák|A. Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|G. Mahler]], [[Jan Kubelík|J. Kubelík]], [[Ema Destinová|E. Destinová]], who all spent some part of their lives in Olomouc). Among the Olomouc University graduates are both [[Aesthetics|art theorists]] ([[Karel Slavíček]], [[Raphael Georg Kiesewetter]], [[Rudolf Eitelberger]], etc.) as well as composers ([[Pavel Vranický]], [[Pavel Křížkovský]], [[Eduard Schön]], [[Emil Viklický]], etc.).

The modern tradition of musicological research and education goes back to 1946 when the ''Institute of Music Education and Science'' was established at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] by [[Robert Smetana]] (1904–1988). 1960’s &amp; 70’s saw a strong growth of the department (since 1972 led by [[Vladimír Hudec]]; however, the institute was  transformed into the ''Department of Music Education'' and transferred to the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]] in 1980 by the decision of the Ministry of Education.

Soon after the [[Velvet revolution|fall of the communist régime]] in 1989, the [[musicology]] returned to the ground of Philosophical Faculty, this time as part of the ''Department of Combined Art Studies''. Independent '''Department of Musicology''' was renewed in 1992 and through the enthusiasm of excellent professionals grew into a modern academic institution. Since 2002 it is sited in the ''University Art Centre'', former Jesuit College building, together with another two art departments of the Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of the Faculty of Education.

==Current Research Objectives &amp; Other Activities==
Research has a fundamental role for the Department. The Department hosts the annual ''International Musicological Conference'' (usually late November) and regular public workshops and seminars which are enriched by occasional activities such as conference on ''Zdeněk Fibich - the 19th Century Middle European Composer'' held in spring 2010.

The Department’s activities embrace a wide variety of modes of research (Regional and [[History|Historical Studies]], [[Organology]], [[Critical Edition of Musical Sources]], [[Jazz]], [[Art Rock]], [[Film Music]], and so on). Department’s research is  supported by a major funds from the [[European Union]] and [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Czech Government]] (principal among these are the ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1890-1905'', ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1906-1949'', ''Zdeněk Fibich’s 19th century Operas'', ''Moravia and the World'' ...). Department participated on ''Music Media Training Programme For the Czech Republic (1995 - 1998)'' and ''Musical Life in Europe (1997 - 2001)''. Since 1997 the Department is linked to [[Saint Cloud State University]] through the ''Art and Music in the Czech Republic Programme''.

The Department also benefits from a number of collaborative research and educational partnerships, including those with

Miller]], [[Christopher Shultis]] and others).

'''Desanders''' and '''desilters''' are solid control equipment with a set of [[hydrocyclone]]s that separate [[sand]] and [[silt]] from the [[drilling fluids]] in [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rigs]]. Desanders are installed on top of the mud tank following the [[shale shaker]] and the [[degasser]], but before the desilter. Desander removes the abrasive solids from the [[drilling fluids]] which cannot be removed by shakers. Normally the solids diameter for desander to be separated would be 45~74μm, and 15~44μm for desilter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/shale-shaker-screen.html|title=Shale Shaker Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[centrifugal pump]] is used to pump the [[drilling fluids]] from mud tank into the set of [[hydrocyclone]]s.

==Solids control==
Desanders have no  moving parts. The larger the internal diameter of the desander is, the greater the amount of drilling fluids it is able to process and the larger the size of the solids removed. A desander with a ({{convert|10|in|mm}} cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 40-50 μm (micrometre) range at a flow rate of {{convert|500|USgal/min|L/s}}, whilea  desilter ({{convert|4|in|mm}}  Cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 15-20 μm range at a flow rate of {{convert|60|USgal/min|L/s}}. Micro-fine separators are able to remove 50% of solids within the 10-15 μm range at a flow rate of {{convert|15|USgal/min|L/s}}. A desander is typically positioned next-to-last in the arrangement of [[solids control]] equipment, with a desander [[centrifuge]] as the subsequent processing unit. Desanders are preceded by gas busters, gumbo removal equipment (if utilized), [[shale shaker]], [[mud cleaner]] (if utilized) and a vacuum degasser. Desanders are widely used in oilfield drilling.
Practice has proved that [[hydrocyclone]] desanders are economic and effective equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/desander.html|title=Desander for solids control in many fields|publisher=Aipu solids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward J. Dent, 1900.jpg|thumb|Dent at [[King's College, Cambridge]], 1900]]

'''Edward Joseph Dent''', generally known by his initials as '''E. J. Dent''' (16 July 1876, [[Ribston Hall|Ribston]], [[Yorkshire]] – 22 August 1957, [[London]]), was a British writer on music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/archive-centre/archive-month/march-2013.html|title=Fields of study: Edward Dent, musicologist|website=www.kings.cam.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Dent was the son of the landowner and politician [[John Dent (Liberal MP)|John Dent]].  He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=DNT895EJ|name=Dent, Edward Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he sat the Classical Tripos  in 1898. He was elected a [[Fellow]] of the college in March 1902 having distinguished himself in music both as researcher and a composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=17 March 1902 |page_number=11 |issue=36717| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dent was Professor of Music at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] from 1926 to 1941. He was President of the [[International Society for Contemporary Music|I.S.C.M.]] from its foundation in 1922 until 1938 and was President of the International Music Society between 1931 and 1949. He was a governor of [[Sadler's Wells Opera]], and translated many [[libretto|libretti]] for it. He wrote influential books on [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Ferruccio Busoni]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Opera in English|English operas]] and the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].

He was a Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and was awarded honorary degrees from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], Cambridge and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Universities. After [[World War I]], Dent sought to bring together the artistic communities of the two countries. After his death the [[Royal Musical Association]] instituted the Dent Medal for work in musicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Papers of Edward Joseph Dent|website=Archives Hub (archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk)|url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/bf7f54d0-10e9-38b0-b263-9454edd5c0a8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental engineering''' is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments, both local and global, from  potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and improvement of environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaees.org/ The American Academy of Environmental Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental engineering system can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation, protection of assets and control of waste from human and animal activities. Furthermore, it is concerned with finding plausible solutions in the field of public health, such as [[waterborne diseases]], implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban, rural and recreational areas. It involves [[Water pollution|waste water management]], [[air pollution]] control, recycling, [[waste disposal]], radiation protection, industrial hygiene, animal agriculture, environmental sustainability, [[public health]] and [[environmental engineering law]]. It also includes studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction projects.

Environmental engineers system study the effect of technological advances on the environment. To do so, they conduct studies on hazardous-[[waste management]] to evaluate the significance of such hazards, advise on treatment and containment, and develop regulations to prevent mishaps. Environmental engineers design [[water purification|municipal water supply]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Beychok, Milton R. | title=[[Aqueous Wastes from Petroleum and Petrochemical Plants]] | edition=1st | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=1967 | id= [[Library of Congress Control Number|LCCN]] 67019834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tchobanoglous, G. |author2=Burton, F.L. |author3= Stensel, H.D. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Wastewater Engineering (Treatment Disposal Reuse) / Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|edition=4th|publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company|year=2003|isbn=0-07-041878-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; They address local and worldwide environmental issues such as the effects of [[acid rain]], [[global warming]], [[ozone depletion]], water pollution and air pollution from [[Automobile emissions control|automobile exhausts]] and [[AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors|industrial sources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor.U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm |title=Architecture and Engineering Occupations : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Career Information Center.

Many universities offer environmental engineering programs at either the department of [[civil engineering]] or the department of [[chemical engineering]] at engineering faculties. Environmental "civil" engineers focus on hydrology, water resources management, [[bioremediation]], and water treatment plant design. Environmental "chemical" engineers, on the other hand, focus on environmental chemistry, advanced air and water treatment technologies and separation processes.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Some subdivision of environmental engineering include [[natural resources engineering]] and agricultural engineering.

More engineers are obtaining specialized training in law ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) and are utilizing their technical expertise in the practices of [[environmental engineering law]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

Most jurisdictions also impose licensing and registration requirements.

{{anchor|History}}

==Development==
Ever since people first recognized that their health is related to the [[Environmental quality|quality of their environment]], they have applied principles to attempt to improve the quality of their environment. The ancient Indian [[Harappan civilization]] utilized early sewers in some cities more than 5000 years ago. More specifically, the Indus Valley Civilization (also called the Harappan civilization) had advanced control over the water in their society. The public work structures found at various sites in the area include wells, public baths, storage tanks, a drinking water system, and a city-wide sewage collection system. They also had an early version of a canal irrigation system that was needed for their large scale agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Evolution of Sanitation and Wastewater Technologies through the Centuries|last=Angelakis|first=Andreas N.|last2=Rose|first2=Joan B.|publisher=IWA Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781780404851|location=|pages=25-40|chapter=Chapter 2: "Sanitation and wastewater technologies in Harappa/Indus valley civilization (ca. 2600-1900 BC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman aqueduct|Romans constructed aqueducts]] to prevent drought and to create a clean, healthful water supply for the [[Metropolitan area|metropolis]] of [[Rome]]. In the 15th century, [[Bavaria]] created laws restricting the development and degradation of alpine country that constituted the region's water supply.

The field emerged as a separate environmental discipline during the middle third of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and pollution and increasingly extensive environmental quality degradation. However, its roots extend back to early efforts in public health engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation.(Dec. 3, 2009).Environmental Engineering"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=501029 |title=Funding - Environmental Engineering - US National Science Foundation (NSF) |publisher=nsf.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern environmental engineering began in [[London]] in the mid-19th century when [[Joseph Bazalgette]] designed the first major [[sewage collection and disposal|sewerage]] system that reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases such as [[cholera]]. The introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities.&lt;ref name="Water industry from The Oxford Companion to British History online"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Waterborne_infections.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, as societies grew, actions that were intended to achieve benefits for those societies had longer-term impacts which reduced other environmental qualities. One example is the widespread application of the pesticide [[DDT]] to control agricultural pests in the years following [[World War II]]. While the [[agriculture|agricultural]] benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically thus reducing world hunger substantially, and [[malaria]] was controlled better than it ever had been, numerous species were brought to the verge of extinction due to the impact of the DDT on their reproductive cycles. The story of DDT as vividly told in [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement and of the modern field of "environmental engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Sustainable Development (n.d.) Environmental Science|publisher=Detroit|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservation movement]]s and [[law]]s restricting public actions that would harm the environment have been developed by various societies for millennia. Notable examples are the laws decreeing the construction of [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]]s in [[London sewerage system|London]] and [[Paris Sewer Museum|Paris]] in the 19th century and the creation of the U.S. national park system in the early 20th century.

===Environmental impact assessment and mitigation===
{{Main article|Environmental impact assessment}}

Scientists have air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes.
They apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality, air quality, [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] quality, [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], agricultural capacity, [[traffic]] impacts, social impacts, ecological impacts, noise impacts, visual (landscape) impacts, etc. If impacts are expected, they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts. An example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of [[wetland]]s in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road.

In the United States, the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on January 1, 1970, the effective date of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA). Since that time, more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere. NEPA is applicable to all federal agencies in the United States.&lt;ref name="McGraw-Hill, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|title= McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Environmental Science and Engineering |edition=3rd|publisher= McGraw-Hill, Inc|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water supply and treatment===
[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]]]]
Engineers evaluate the water balance within a [[drainage basin|watershed]] and determine the available water supply, the water needed for various needs in that watershed, the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store, treat, and convey water for various uses. Water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses. In the case of a [[potable water]] supply, water is treated to minimize the risk of [[infectious disease]] transmission, the risk of non-infectious illness, and to create a palatable water flavor. Water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use, fire suppression, and [[irrigation]].

===Wastewater treatment===
[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|200px|Water pollution]]

There are numerous wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials, a secondary treatment system consisting of an [[aeration]] basin followed by [[flocculation]] and [[settling|sedimentation]] or an [[activated sludge]] system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological [[nitrogen]] removal system, and a final [[disinfection]] process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge).  The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and [[phosphorus]] and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Sims, J.|title= Activated sludge, Environmental Encyclopedia |publisher=Detroit|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air pollution management===

Scientists have developed [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion models]] to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] and industrial [[flue gas stack]] emissions. To some extent, this field overlaps the desire to decrease [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from combustion processes.

==Environmental Protection Agency==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve key issues. An important component of EPA's mission is to protect and improve air, water, and overall environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects.

==Ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid West African regions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D. Masse|author2=JL. Chotte|author3=E. Scopel|title=Ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid West African regions|journal=Fiche thématique du CSFD|date=2015|issue=11|page=2|url=http://www.csf-desertification.eu/combating-desertification/item/ecological-engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Ecological engineering offers new alternatives for the management of agricultural systems that are more tailored to the ever-changing social and environmental necessities in these regions. This requires managing the complexity of agrosystems, while striving to mimic the functioning of natural ecosystems of West African drylands and taking advantage of traditional practices and local know-how resulting from a long process of adaptation to environmental constraints.
# Acting on biodiversity. Biodiversity is essential to the productivity of ecosystems and their temporal stability under the impact of external disturbances. Several ecological processes related to biodiversity may be intensified for the benefit of agrosilvopastoral systems: promoting diversity and soil microorganism activity to benefit&amp;nbsp;plants, associating and utilizing the mutual benefits of plants
# Utilizing organic matter and nutrient cycles. The productivity of agrosystems with low chemical input use in dryland regions is primarily based on efficient organic resource management, and in turn on the nutrient and energy flows they induce. It is thus possible to intervene at several levels: enhancing crop-livestock farming integration to preserve natural resources, restoring the biological activity of soils via specific organic&amp;nbsp;inputs, supplying nutrients to plants locally.
# Enhancing available water use. Water supplies are limited and irregular in dryland areas. Current management of these supplies—which involves capturing rainwater and surface runoff—could be improved in several ways: adapting to erratic rainfall or drought risks by focusing on: (i) the organization of the farm and community (farm plot patterns in association with the random rainfall distribution, etc.), and on (ii) cropping techniques to reduce crop water needs (plant choices, weeding, etc.), preserving water in crop fields by hampering runoff, accounting for the essential role of trees regarding soil and water in drylands.
# Managing landscapes and associated ecological processes. Ecological crop pest regulation by their natural enemies is one ecosystem service provided by biodiversity. Better pest management could be considered in association with promoting biodiversity at different scales, e.g. from the plant to the landscape.

==Education==
Courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into broad classes:
*''[[Mechanical engineering]]'' courses oriented towards designing machines and mechanical systems for environmental use such as water treatment facilities, pumping stations, garbage segregation plants and other mechanical facilities;
*''Environmental engineering or environmental systems'' courses oriented towards a civil engineering approach in which structures and the landscape are constructed to blend with or protect the environment;
*''[[Environmental chemistry]]'', ''sustainable chemistry'' or ''environmental [[Chemical engineer|chemical]] engineering'' courses oriented towards understanding the effects (good and bad) of chemicals in the environment.  Focus on mining processes, pollutants and commonly also cover biochemical processes;
*''[[Environmental technology]]'' courses oriented towards producing electronic or electrical graduates capable of developing devices and artifacts able to monitor, measure, model and control environmental impact, including monitoring and managing energy generation from renewable sources.

The curation of extraterrestrial samples (astromaterials) obtained by [[sample-return mission]]s take place at facilities specially designed to preserve both the sample integrity and protect the Earth. Astromaterials are classified as either ''non-restricted'' or ''restricted'', depending on the nature of the Solar System body. Non-restricted samples include the [[Moon]], [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, [[Solar wind|solar particles]] and [[space dust]].  Restricted bodies include planets or moons suspected to have either past or present [[Planetary habitability|habitable environments]] to microscopic life, and therefore must be treated as extremely [[biohazard]]ous.

==Overview==

Spacecraft instruments are subject to mass and power constraints, in addition of the limitations imposed by the extreme environment of [[outer space]] on the sensitive science instruments, so bringing extraterrestrial material to Earth is desired for extensive scientific analyses. For the purpose of [[planetary protection]], astromaterial samples brought to Earth by [[sample-return mission]]s must be received and curated in a specially-designed and equipped [[biocontainment]] facility that must also double as a [[cleanroom]] to preserve the science value of the samples.

Samples brought from non-restricted bodies such as the Moon, asteroids, comets, solar particles and space dust, are processed at specialized facilities rated [[Biosafety level]]-3 ('''BSL-3'''). Samples brought to Earth from a planet or moon suspected to have either past or present [[Planetary habitability|habitable environments]] to microscopic life would make it a [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] body, and must be curated at facilities rated Biosafety level-4 ('''BSL-4'''), as agreed in the Article IX of the [[Outer Space Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IX]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Full text of the Outer Space Treaty [http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708075800/http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/gares/html/gares_21_2222.html |date=2013-07-08 }}'' - See Article IX''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='CNES'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnes.fr/web/CNES-en/5210-planetary-protection-treaties-and-recommendations.php | title = Planetary protection treaties and recommendations | accessdate = 2012-09-11 | author = Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) | date = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the existing BSL-4 facilities in the world do not have the complex requirements to ensure the preservation and protection of Earth and the sample simultaneously.&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'&gt;[https://www.space.com/7625-protect-mars-samples-earth.html How to Protect Mars Samples on Earth].

==Non-restricted materials==

[[File:Stardust Capsule on Ground.jpg|thumb| ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'''s sample-return capsule after reentry to Earth]]

As of 2018, JAXA's [[Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Center]] and NASA's [[Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science]] are the only two BSL-3 laboratories in the world exclusively dedicated to the curation of samples from non-restricted bodies.&lt;ref name='Davies 2018'&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/why-sample-return.html What's the benefit of sample-return?] Jason Davis, ''The Planetary Society''. 5 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009281911000031 Curating NASA's extraterrestrial samples—Past, present, and future.] Carlton Allen, Judith Allton, Gary Lofgren, Kevin Righter, Michael Zolensky, etal.

==Restricted materials==

[[File:NIAID Integrated Research Facility - Positive Pressure Personnel Suit.jpg|thumb|Working inside a Biosafety level 4 laboratory with air hoses providing positive air pressure]]
Return-samples obtained from a [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] body, must be curated at facilities rated Biosafety level-4 (BSL-4). Because the existing BSL-4 facilities in the world do not have the complex requirements to ensure the preservation and protection of Earth and the sample simultaneously,&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'/&gt; there are currently at least two proposals to build a BSL-4 facility dedicated to curation of restricted (potentially [[biohazard]]) extraterrestrial materials. 

The first is the [[European Sample Curation Facility]] (ESCF),&lt;ref name='ESCF 2017'&gt;[https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/2346/73091/ICES_2017_323.pdf EURO EURO-CARES Extraterrestrial Sample Curation Facility: Architecture as an enabler of science].

Accessed: 25 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed to be built in [[Vienna]], would curate non-restricted samples as well as BSL-4 biocontainment of restricted material obtained from [[Planetary protection#Category V|Category V]] bodies such as [[Mars]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Enceladus]], etc.&lt;ref name='ESCF 2017'/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The other proposal is by NASA and is tentatively known as the [[Mars Sample-Return Receiving facility]] (MSRRF).&lt;ref name=samplereceivingfacility&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/pss/presentations/200803/04-Atlas-PPSonMSR.pdf|title=Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility|publisher=NASA |author= Ronald Atlas|date=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least three different designs were submitted in 2009.&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'/&gt; If funded, this American facility would be expected to take 7 to 10 years from design to completion,&lt;ref name='Assessment 2009'&gt;{{cite report |title=Assessment of Planetary Protection Requirements for Mars Sample Return Missions |publisher=National Research Council |year=2009 |chapter=7: "Sample-Receiving Facility and Program Oversight" |page=59 |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=12576&amp;page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSRtaskgroup&gt;[http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/summary/msr Mars Sample Return: Issues and Recommendations (Planetary Protection Office Summary)] Task Group on Issues in Sample Return. National Academies Press, Washington, DC (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional two years is recommended for the staff to become proficient and accustomed to the facilities.&lt;ref name='Assessment 2009'/&gt; NASA is also assessing a 2017 proposal to build a mobile and modular BSL-4 facility to secure a sample return capsule at the landing site to conduct preliminary biohazard analyses.&lt;ref name='Mobile BSL4'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170001664.pdf Mobile/Modular BSL-4 Facilities for Meeting Restricted Earth Return Containment Requirements]. M. J. Calaway, F. M. McCubbin, J. H. Allton, R. A. Zeigler, and L. F. Pace. (PDF) NASA. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After completion of biohazard testing, decisions could be made to sterilize the sample or transport all or portions to a permanent quarantine storage facility anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name='Mobile BSL4'/&gt;

The systems of such facilities must be able to contain unknown biohazards, as the sizes of any putative alien  microorganisms or infectious agents are unknown. Ideally it should filter particles of 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm or larger, and release of a particle 0.05&amp;nbsp;µm or larger is unacceptable under any circumstance.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602150139/http://science.nasa.gov/media/medialibrary/2013/01/17/ESF_Mars_Sample_Return_backward_contamination_study.pdf |date=2016-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this extremely small size limit of 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm is for consideration of [[gene transfer agent]]s (GTAs) which are virus-like particles that are produced by some microorganisms that package random segments of [[DNA]] capable of [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt; These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth microorganisms in the same way.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt; Another reason for the 0.01&amp;nbsp;µm limit is because of the discovery of [[ultramicrobacteria]] as small as 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm across.&lt;ref name='GTA 2013'/&gt;

Robotic advocates consider that humans represent a significant source of contamination for the samples, and that a BSL-4 facility with robotic systems is the best way forward.&lt;ref name='Hsu 2009'/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11491">'''Gradualism''', from the Latin ''gradus'' ("step"), is a hypothesis, a theory or a tenet assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McGowran. (2008). ''Biostratigraphy: Microfossils and Geological Time''. Cambridge University Press. p. 384. {{ISBN|978-0521048170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uniformitarianism]], [[incrementalism]], and [[reformism]] are similar concepts.

==Geology and biology==
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

In the natural sciences, gradualism is the [[theory]] which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes, often contrasted with [[catastrophism]].  The theory was proposed in 1795 by [[James Hutton]], a Scottish geologist, and was later incorporated into [[Charles Lyell]]'s theory of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]].  Tenets from both theories were applied to [[biology]] and formed the basis of early [[evolution]]ary theory.

[[Charles Darwin]] was influenced by Lyell's ''Principles of Geology'', which explained both uniformitarian methodology and theory. Using uniformitarianism, which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed (see [[catastrophism]]), Darwin theorized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually, not in [[Saltation (biology)|saltations]], since saltations are not presently observed, and extreme deviations from the usual phenotypic variation would be more likely to be selected against.

Gradualism is often confused with the concept of [[phyletic gradualism]]. It is a term coined by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Niles Eldredge]] to contrast with their model of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which is gradualist itself, but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability (called stasis), which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution.&lt;ref name=punc1972&gt;Eldredge, Niles, and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism."] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman, Cooper and Company, pp. 82-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phyletic gradualism ===
{{main|Phyletic gradualism}}
[[Phyletic gradualism]] is a model of [[evolution]] which theorizes that most [[speciation]] is slow, uniform and gradual.&lt;ref name=pe1972&gt;Eldredge, N. and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; When evolution occurs in this mode, it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole [[species]] into a new one (through a process called [[anagenesis]]). In this view no clear line of demarcation exists between an ancestral species and a descendant species, unless [[cladogenesis|splitting]] occurs.

=== Punctuated gradualism ===
{{main|Punctuated gradualism}}
[[Punctuated gradualism]] is a [[microevolution]]ary [[hypothesis]] that refers to a species that has "relative stasis over a considerable part of its total duration [and] underwent periodic, relatively rapid, morphologic change that did not lead to lineage branching". It is one of the three common models of [[evolution]]. While the traditional model of palaeontology, the phylogenetic model, states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation, the relatively newer and more controversial idea of [[punctuated equilibrium]] claims that major evolutionary changes don't happen over a gradual period but in localized, rare, rapid events of branching speciation.  Punctuated gradualism is considered to be a variation of these models, lying somewhere in between the [[phyletic gradualism]] model and the punctuated equilibrium model. It states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states.

== Politics and society ==
{{Social democracy sidebar |Development}}

In [[politics]], gradualism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small, discrete increments rather than in abrupt strokes such as [[revolution]]s or [[rebellion|uprisings]]. Gradualism is one of the defining features of political [[liberalism]] and [[reformism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.isj.org.uk/?id=903 | title=Left reformism, the state and the problem of socialist politics today | author=Paul Blackledge | year=2013 | work= | publisher=International Socialist Journal | accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Machiavellian]] politics pushes politicians to espouse gradualism.

In [[socialism|socialist politics]] and within the socialist movement, the concept of gradualism is frequently distinguished from reformism, with the former insisting that short-term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long-term goals. It is most commonly associated with the [[libertarian socialist]] concept of [[dual power]] and is seen as a middle way between reformism and [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionism]].

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was opposed to the idea of gradualism as a method of eliminating [[racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. The government wanted to try to integrate [[African-American]]s and European-Americans slowly into the same society, but many believed it was a way for the government to put off actually doing anything about racial segregation:

== Linguistics and language change ==
In [[linguistics]], [[language change]] is seen as gradual, the product of chain reactions and subject to [[Drift (linguistics)#Long-term cyclic drift|cyclic drift]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henri Wittmann]] (1983). "Les réactions en chaîne en morphologie diachronique."  ''Actes du Colloque de la Société internationale de linguistique fonctionnelle'' 10.285-92.[http://www.nou-la.org/1983c-morphodia.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that [[creole language]]s are the product of [[catastrophism]] is heavily disputed.

==Morality==
===Christianity===
{{main|Law of graduality}}

Gradualism has also been used in a religious sense, especially in the [[Catholic Church]] (specifically, in [[Catholic ethics|ethics]] and [[Catholic moral theology|moral theology]]), to describe the view that certain individuals and families that make up a parish or community may be living at various points along a line extending from being in a state of [[mortal sin]], to being at least minimally in the "[[State (theology)|state]] of [[Grace in Christianity|grace]]" and able to receive the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Eucharist]], and to a level of greater [[Universal call to holiness|holiness]]. This view teaches that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as [[Agape|sacrificial love]] and consistent respect. It holds that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations. Catholic clergy who espouse this view include the Bishop of [[San Diego, California]], [[Robert W. McElroy]], who in 2016 wrote: {{quote|The principle of gradualness reaches far beyond the question of marriage to embrace all elements of the Christian moral life, for it really is an embodiment of the pastoral method of the Lord himself. Pope Francis repeatedly cites the example of Jesus’ conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well as a prism through which to construct the Church’s outreach to young couples, a prism which embraces them in their humanity and their love, rather than categorizing them as living in sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://cruxnow.com/church/2016/05/11/san-diego-bishop-backs-pope-on-divorced-and-remarried/|title=San Diego bishop backs pope on divorced and remarried|work=Crux|date=May 11, 2016|author=Michael O'Loughlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies===
{{main|Subitism}}
&lt;!--"Five precepts" links here.--&gt; 
Gradualism is the approach of certain schools of Buddhism and other Eastern philosophies (e.g. [[Theravada]] or [[Yoga]]), that [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] can be achieved step by step, through an arduous practice. The opposite approach, that [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] is attained all at once, is called [[subitism]]. The debate on the issue was very important to the history of the development of [[Zen]], which rejected gradualism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Miscellaneous/ChanZenStudies.htm Bernard Faure, ''Chan/Zen Studies in English: The State Of The Field'']&lt;/ref&gt; and to the establishment of the opposite approach within the [[Tibetan Buddhism]], after the [[Debate of Samye]]. It was continued in other schools of [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and [[Chinese philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Gregory | first =Peter N. (editor) | year =1991 | title =''Sudden and Gradual. Approaches to Enlightenment in Chinese Thought'' | place =Delhi | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types==
[[Lorenzo Peña#Contradictorial gradualism|Contradictorial gradualism]] is the paraconsistent treatment of [[Fuzzy logic|fuzziness]] developed by [[Lorenzo Peña]] which regards true contradictions as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence.

Gradualism in [[social change]] implemented through [[reformist]] means is a moral principle to which the [[Fabian Society]] is committed. In a more general way, [[reformism]] is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a [[society]]'s fundamental [[economic system]] and political structures; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present-day [[capitalism]]. That hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to [[revolutionary socialism]], which contends that [[revolution]] is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur.

In the terminology of [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Gradualism|NWO]]-related speculations, gradualism refers to the gradual implementation of a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[world government]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4403">In [[astronomical spectroscopy]], the '''Gunn–Peterson trough''' is a feature of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] of [[quasars]] due to the presence of neutral [[hydrogen]] in the [[Intergalactic space|Intergalactic Medium (IGM)]]. The trough is characterized by suppression of [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic emission]] from the quasar at wavelengths less than that of the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] line at the [[redshift]] of the emitted light. This effect was originally predicted in 1965 by [[James E. Gunn (astronomer)|James E. Gunn]] and [[Bruce Peterson (astronomer)|Bruce Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gunn | first = J.E. |author2=Peterson, B.A. | title=On the Density of Neutral Hydrogen in Intergalactic Space | journal=Astrophysical Journal | date=1965 | volume=142 | pages=1633–1641 | bibcode=1965ApJ...142.1633G | doi=10.1086/148444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First detection==

For over three decades after the prediction, no objects had been found distant enough to show the Gunn–Peterson trough. It was not until 2001, with the discovery of a quasar with a redshift z = 6.28 by Robert Becker and others&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Becker | first=R. H. |display-authors=etal | title=Evidence For Reionization at z ~ 6: Detection of a Gunn-Peterson Trough in a z=6.28 Quasar | date=2001 | journal=Astronomical Journal | volume=122 | issue=6 | pages=2850–2857 | bibcode=2001AJ....122.2850B | doi=10.1086/324231|arxiv = astro-ph/0108097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using data from the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]], that a Gunn–Peterson trough was finally observed. The paper also included quasars at redshifts of z = 5.82 and z = 5.99, and, while each of these exhibited absorption at wavelengths on the blue side of the Lyman-alpha transition, there were numerous spikes in flux as well. The flux of the quasar at z = 6.28, however, was effectively zero beyond the Lyman-alpha limit, meaning that the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM must have been larger than ~10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Evidence for reionization==
{{See also|Reionization}}

The discovery of the trough in a z = 6.28 quasar, and the absence of the trough in quasars detected at redshifts just below z = 6 presented strong evidence for the hydrogen in the universe having undergone a transition from neutral to ionized around z = 6. After [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], the universe was expected to be neutral, until the first objects in the universe started emitting light and energy which would [[reionization|reionize]] the surrounding IGM. However, as the scattering cross section of photons with energies near that of the Lyman-alpha limit with neutral hydrogen is very high, even a small fraction of neutral hydrogen will make the [[optical depth]] of the IGM high enough to cause the suppression of emission observed. Despite the fact that the ratio of neutral hydrogen to ionized hydrogen may not have been particularly high, the low flux observed past the Lyman-alpha limit indicates that the universe was in the final stages of reionization.

Following the first release of data from the [[WMAP]] spacecraft in 2003, the determination by Becker that the end of reionization occurred at z ≈ 6 appeared to conflict with estimates made from the WMAP measurement of the electron column density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kogut |first=A. |display-authors=etal | title=First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Temperature-Polarization Correlation | date=2003 | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=148 | issue=1 | pages = 161–173 | bibcode=2003ApJS..148..161K | doi=10.1086/377219|arxiv = astro-ph/0302213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the WMAP III data released in 2006 now seems to be in much better agreement with the limits on reionization placed by observation of the Gunn–Peterson trough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Page | first=L. |display-authors=etal | title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Polarization Analysis | date=2007 | journal=Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=170 | issue=2 | pages=335–376 | bibcode=2007ApJS..170..335P | doi=10.1086/513699|arxiv = astro-ph/0603450 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''HD Radio''' is a [[trademark]]ed term for [[iBiquity]]'s [[in-band on-channel]] (IBOC) [[digital radio]] technology used by [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio station]]s to transmit [[Sound|audio]] and [[data]] by using a [[Digital data|digital]] signal embedded "on-frequency" immediately above and below a station's standard [[analog signal]], providing the means to listen to the same program in either HD (digital radio with less noise) or as a standard broadcast (analog radio with standard sound quality).  The HD format also provides the means for a single radio station to simultaneously broadcast one or more different programs in addition to the program being transmitted on the radio station's analog channel.  In September 2015 iBiquity was acquired by [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] bringing the HD Radio technology under the same banner as DTS' eponymous theater surround sound systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dts.com/news/articles/2015/08/dts-and-ibiquity-digital-corp.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;.

It was selected by the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in 2002 as a digital audio broadcasting method for the United States,&lt;ref name="FCC-memo"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-02-286A1.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Federal Communication Commission |title=Digital Audio Broadcasting Systems and Their Impact on the Terrestrial Radio Broadcast Service |date=2002-10-11 |accessdate=2008-12-31 |last=Dortch |first=Marlene H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mediaweek"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/tvstations/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003561802 |title=FCC approves HD Radio Rules |work=Mediaweek |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=2007-03-22 |accessdate=2008-12-31 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103013650/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/tvstations/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003561802 |archivedate=November 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the only digital system approved by the FCC for digital AM/FM broadcasts in the United States. It is officially known as '''NRSC-5''', with the latest version being '''NRSC-5-D'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrscstandards.org/ |work=National Radio Systems Committee |title=Newest Releases |accessdate=2017-10-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916152113/http://nrscstandards.org/ |archivedate=2017-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other digital radio systems include [[FMeXtra]], [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)]] (Eureka 147), [[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM30 and DRM+ configurations), and [[CAM-D|Compatible AM-Digital]] (CAM-D).

While HD Radio does allow for an all-digital mode, this system currently is used by some AM and FM radio stations to [[simulcast]] both digital and analog audio within the same channel (a hybridized digital-analog signal) as well as to add new FM channels and text information. Although HD Radio broadcasting's content is currently [[free-to-air]], listeners must purchase new receivers in order to receive the digital portion of the signal.

By May 2018, HD Radio technology was claimed to be used by more than 3500 individual services, mostly in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hdradio.com/broadcasters |website=HD Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This compares with more than 2200 services operating with the DAB system.

HD Radio increases the bandwidth required in the FM band to 400&amp;nbsp;kHz for the analog/digital hybrid version.  This makes adoption outside the United States problematic.  In the United States the FM broadcast band channels have a spacing of 200&amp;nbsp;kHz, as opposed to the 100&amp;nbsp;kHz that is normal elsewhere.  The 200&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing means that in practice, stations having concurrent or adjacent coverage areas will not be spaced at less than 400&amp;nbsp;kHz in order to respect protection ratios which would not be met with 200&amp;nbsp;kHz spacing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BS.412 : Planning standards for terrestrial FM sound broadcasting at VHF|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.412-9-199812-I!!PDF-E.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  This also leaves space for the digital sidebands.  Outside the US, spacing can be 300&amp;nbsp;kHz, which causes problems with the digital sidebands.

The FCC has not indicated any intent to force off analog radio broadcasts as it has with [[analog television]] broadcasts,&lt;ref name="FCC-memo"/&gt; as it would not result in the recovery of any [[radio spectrum]] rights which could be sold. Thus, there is no deadline by which consumers must buy an HD Radio receiver. In addition, there are many more analog AM/FM radio receivers than there were analog televisions, and many of these are car stereos or portable units that cannot be upgraded.

==Overview==
Digital information is [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmitted]] using [[OFDM]] with an audio [[compression algorithm]] called HDC ([[High-Definition Coding]]). (HDC is a proprietary codec based upon, but incompatible with, the MPEG-4 standard [[HE-AAC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theori.io/research/nrsc-5-c|title=Receiving NRSC-5|author=|date=|website=theori.io|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820185827/http://theori.io/research/nrsc-5-c|archivedate=20 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; HD Radio equipped stations pay a one-time licensing fee for converting their primary audio channel to iBiquity's HD Radio technology, and 3% of incremental net revenues for any additional digital subchannels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiquity.com/i/Licensing_%20Fact_%20Sheet_2009.pdf iBiquity Licensing Fact Sheet 2009 (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713000748/http://www.ibiquity.com/i/Licensing_%20Fact_%20Sheet_2009.pdf |date=2011-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of converting a radio station can run between $100,000 and $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ce.org/Press/CEA_Pubs/2068.asp |title=Terrestrial Digital Radio |work=Consumer Electronics Association |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108040523/http://www.ce.org/Press/CEA_Pubs/2068.asp |archivedate=2009-01-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiver manufacturers pay a royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiquity.com/manufacturers/receiver_manufacturers/license_agreement |work=iBiquity Digital Corporation |title=Becoming an HD Radio IP Licensee |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231021515/http://www.ibiquity.com/manufacturers/receiver_manufacturers/license_agreement |archivedate=2008-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the primary digital signal (HD-1) is lost the HD Radio receiver will revert to the analog signal, thereby providing seamless operation between the newer and older transmission methods.  The extra HD-2 and HD-3 streams are not simulcast on analog, causing the sound to drop-out or "skip" when digital reception degrades (similar to digital television drop-outs). Alternatively the HD Radio signal can revert to a more-robust 20 [[kilobit per second]] stream, though the sound is reduced to AM-like quality. [[Datacasting]] is also possible, with [[metadata]] providing song titles or artist information.

iBiquity Digital claims that the system approaches [[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Audio format|CD quality audio]] and offers reduction of both interference and static;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hdradio.com/how_does_hd_digital_radio_sound.php |work=HD Digital Radio |title=How does HD Digital Radio Sound? |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121104611/http://hdradio.com/how_does_hd_digital_radio_sound.php |archivedate=2009-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some listeners have complained of increased interference on the analog AM band (see AM, below).

===AM===
[[File:KNX HDlock.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of information displayed by an AM HD station locking.]]

Sending pure digital data through the approximately 20 kilohertz AM channel is roughly equivalent to sending data through two 33 kbit/s analog telephone lines, thus limiting the maximum throughput possible. By using [[spectral band replication]] the HDC+SBR codec is able to simulate the recreation of sounds up to 15,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, thus achieving moderate quality on the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]-tight AM band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SBR explained |url=http://www.codingtechnologies.com/products/sbr.htm |work=Dolby |publisher=Coding Technologies |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216004340/http://www.codingtechnologies.com/products/sbr.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt; The HD Radio AM hybrid mode offers two options which can carry approximately 40 or 60 kbit/s of data, but most AM digital stations default to the more-robust 40 kbit/s mode which features redundancy (same signal broadcast twice).

HD Radio also provides a pure digital mode, which lacks an analog signal for [[fallback (disambiguation)|fallback]] and instead reverts to a 20 kbit/s signal during times of poor reception. The pure digital mode transmissions will stay within the AM station's channel instead of spilling into the channels next to the station transmitting "HD radio" as the hybrid (digital-analog) stations do.

The AM version of HD Radio technology uses the 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channel (+/- 10&amp;nbsp;kHz), and overlaps 5&amp;nbsp;kHz into the opposite sideband of the [[adjacent channel]] on both sides. When operating in pure digital mode, the AM HD Radio signal fits inside a standard 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channel (20-40 kbit/s) or an extended 30&amp;nbsp;kHz channel (40-60 kbit/s), at the discretion of the station manager. As AM radio stations are spaced at 9&amp;nbsp;kHz (Europe) or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz (Americas) intervals, much of the digital information overlaps adjacent channels when in hybrid mode. Some nighttime listeners have expressed concern this design harms reception of adjacent channels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karlzuk.blogspot.com/2007/09/night-of-bees.html |work=Write or Karl me! |title=Night of the Bees |last=Zuk |first=Karl |publisher=Blogspot |accessdate=2008-12-31 |date=2007-11-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708045014/http://karlzuk.blogspot.com/2007/09/night-of-bees.html |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MP3 sample of the interference: [http://www.wysl1040.com/media_files/wysl/IBOC_OBSERVATIONS.mp3 IBOC Observations Soundclip] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325090032/http://www.wysl1040.com/media_files/wysl/IBOC_OBSERVATIONS.mp3 |date=2009-03-25 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; with one formal complaint filed regarding the matter: [[WYSL]] owner Bob Savage against [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] in Boston.

The digital radio signal received on a conventional AM receiver tuned to an adjacent channel sounds like a large waterfall or similar white noise-like hiss, as can be heard in the audio soundclip referenced in the previous sentence.{{ambiguous|date=May 2016}}

===FM===
[[File:HD-Sideband-DX.ogg|thumb|right|200px|Unintentional Interference:|HD radio DX during a band opening]]

[[File:Pittsburgh-HD-Radio-Emergency-Alert-System-Test.ogv|thumb|right|200px| HD Radio [[Emergency Alert System|EAS]] Test using [[KDKA-FM]] HD1]]

The FM hybrid digital/analog mode offers four options which can carry approximately 100, 112, 125, or 150 kbit/s of data carrying ([[lossy]]) compressed digital audio depending upon the station manager's power budget and desired range of signal. The HD Radio also provides several pure digital modes with up to 300 kbit/s bitrate, and enabling extra features like surround sound. Like AM, pure digital FM provides a "[[fallback (disambiguation)|fallback]]" condition where it reverts to a more robust 25 kbit/s signal.

FM stations have the option to subdivide their datastream into sub-channels (e.g., 88.1 HD1, HD2, HD3) of varying audio quality. The multiple services are similar to the [[digital subchannel]]s found in [[ATSC]]-compliant [[digital television]] using [[multiplexed]] broadcasting. For example, some [[top 40]] stations have added [[hot AC]] and [[classic rock]] to their [[digital subchannel]]s to provide more variety to listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiquity.com/hd_radio/hdradio_find_a_station?state=MD&amp;sortBy=undefined&amp;thisBeColorOver=ff920f&amp;thisBeColorOut=11839d#stationlist |title=Stations in Maryland broadcasting on HD Signals |work=iBiquity Digital Corporation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713001240/http://www.ibiquity.com/hd_radio/hdradio_find_a_station?state=MD&amp;sortBy=undefined&amp;thisBeColorOver=ff920f&amp;thisBeColorOut=11839d |archivedate=2011-07-13 |accessdate=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stations may eventually go all-digital, thus allowing as many as three full-power channels and four low-power channels (seven total). Alternatively, they could broadcast one single channel at 300 kbit/s.

Where the digital signal fails, the analog signal is used as a fallback for the main digital channel (normally HD1), requiring [[synchronization]] of the two.  This requires a significant delay being added to the analog service.  Current FCC rules require that one channel be a simulcast of the analog signal. In some cases, particularly during [[tropospheric ducting]] events, an HD Radio receiver will lock on to the digital sidebands of a distant station, even though there is a much stronger local analog-only station on the [[co-channel|same frequency]]. With no automatic identification of the station on the analog signal, there is no way for the receiver to recognize that there is no correlation between the two. (Station identification is sent by voice, or as [[Radio Data System|RBDS]] data, but not all stations use RBDS.) The listener can possibly turn HD reception off (to listen to the local station, or avoid random flipping between the two stations), or [[TV/FM DX|listen to the distant stations]] and try to get a [[station ID]].

Although the signals may be synchronized at the transmitter and reach the receiving equipment simultaneously, what the listener hears through an HD unit and an analog radio played together can be distinctly unsynchronized. This is because all analog receivers process analog signals faster than HD radios can process digital signals. The digital processing of analog signals in an HD radio delays them also. The resulting unmistakable "reverb" or echo effect from playing radios of both types in the same room or house can be annoying. It is more noticeable with simple voice transmission than with complex musical program content. (Multiple HD receivers of the same make and model, or multiple analog receivers in the same room or house, will not cause noticeable echo.)

Stations can transmit HD Radio through their existing antennas using a [[diplexer]] as on AM, or are permitted by the FCC to use a separate antenna at the same location, or at a site licensed as an analog [[Backup site|auxiliary]], provided it is within a certain distance and height referenced to the analog main signal. This limitation assures that the two have about the same [[broadcast range]], and that they maintain the proper [[D/U ratio|ratio]] of [[signal strength]] to each other so as not to cause [[destructive interference]] with each other at any given location where they may be received.

====Artist Experience====
[[File:2017-VW-Golf-HDRadio-101.5-KGB-FM.jpg|thumb|200px|2017 VW Golf entertainment system displaying song metadata including Artist Experience from San Diego's [[KGB-FM]].]]
HD Radio supports a service called Artist Experience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdradio.com/broadcasters/engineering-support/artist-experience/|title=Artist Experience®|first=|last=Juan@HDRadio|date=24 July 2013|website=hdradio.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725040142/http://hdradio.com/broadcasters/engineering-support/artist-experience|archivedate=25 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the transmission of album art, logos and other artwork can be displayed on the radio. Album art and logos are displayed at the station's discretion and require extra equipment. An HD Radio manufacturer should pass the iBiquity certification, which includes displaying the artwork properly.

====EAS Alerts====

Since 2016, newer HD radios support [[Bluetooth]] and [[Emergency Alert System|EAS]] alerts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hdradio.com/get-a-radio/home-radio/sparc-hd-radio-receiver-w/bluetooth-and-emergency-alerts|title=Sparc HD Radio Receiver w/Bluetooth and Emergency Alerts|first=|last=Juan@HDRadio|date=28 October 2016|website=hdradio.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414172420/https://hdradio.com/get-a-radio/home-radio/sparc-hd-radio-receiver-w/bluetooth-and-emergency-alerts|archivedate=14 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the transmission of traffic, weather, AMBER and security alerts can be displayed on the radio. As with Artist Experience, emergency alerts are displayed at the station's discretion and requires extra equipment.

====Bandwidth and power====
FM stations typically require up to 280 kilohertz of [[radio spectrum|spectrum]] when carrying a stereo transmission. The bandwidth of a FM carrier is found by doubling the sum of the peak deviation (usually 75&amp;nbsp;kHz) and the highest baseband modulating frequency (around 60&amp;nbsp;kHz when RBDS is used).  Only 15&amp;nbsp;kHz of the baseband bandwidth is used by analog [[monaural]] audio (baseband), with the remainder used for [[FM stereo|stereo]], [[RBDS]], [[pager|paging]], [[radio reading service]], [[Subsidiary Communications Multiplex Operation|rental to other customers]], or as a [[transmitter/studio link]] for in-house [[telemetry]].

In regular hybrid mode a station has ±100&amp;nbsp;kHz of analog bandwidth and adds an extra ±30&amp;nbsp;kHz [[guard band]] and ±70&amp;nbsp;kHz for its digital signals, thus taking a full 400&amp;nbsp;kHz of width. FM stations also have the option to discontinue existing [[subcarrier]] services (usually at 92&amp;nbsp;kHz and 67&amp;nbsp;kHz) in order to carry extended HD Radio, though such services can be restored through use of the [[digital subchannel]]s that are then made available. However, this requires the replacement of all related equipment both for the broadcasters and all of the receivers that use the discontinued services.

The ratio of power of the analog signal to the digital signal was initially standardized at 100:1 (-20&amp;nbsp;dBc), making the digital signal 1% of the analog carrier power.  Unlike with subcarriers, where the total [[baseband]] [[modulation]] is reduced, there is no reduction to the analog [[carrier wave|carrier]] [[effective radiated power|power]].  The National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) requested a 10&amp;nbsp;dB (10×) increase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.radioworld.com/pages/s.0100/t.11018.html |title=NAB Will Ask FCC to Up FM IBOC Power |work=Radio World |date=2008-02-01 |accessdate=2008-12-31 |publisher=NewBay Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804123749/http://www.radioworld.com/pages/s.0100/t.11018.html |archivedate=2008-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the digital signal from the FCC.  This equates to an increase to 10% of the analog carrier power, but no decrease in the analog signal.  This was shown to reduce analog coverage because of interference, but results in a dramatic improvement in digital coverage.  Other levels were also tested, including a 6&amp;nbsp;dB or fourfold increase to 4% (−14dBc or 25:1). [[National Public Radio]] was opposed to any increase because it is likely to increase interference to their member stations, particularly to their [[broadcast translator]]s, which are secondary and therefore left unprotected from such interference.  Other broadcasters are also opposed (or indifferent), as increasing power would require expensive changes in equipment for many, and the already-expensive system has so far given them no benefit.

There are still some concerns that HD Radio on FM will increase interference between different stations even though HD Radio at the 10% power level fits within the FCC spectral mask.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/uploadedImages/Radio_World/Views/Guest_Commentaries/figure1_1014.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628000612/http://www.radioworld.com/uploadedImages/Radio_World/Views/Guest_Commentaries/figure1_1014.jpg |archivedate=2017-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  North American FM channels are spaced 200&amp;nbsp;kHz apart. An HD Radio station will not generally cause interference to any analog station within its 1&amp;nbsp;mV/m [[service contour]], the limit above which the FCC protects most stations. However, the IBOC signal resides within the analog signal of the first-adjacent station. With the proposed power increase of 10&amp;nbsp;dB, the potential exists to cause the degradation of the second-adjacent analog signals within its 1&amp;nbsp;mV/m [[service contour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.v-soft.com/web/IBOC%20Coverage%20and%20Interference%20Issues2.pdf |format=PDF |title=IBOC Coverage and InterferenceIBOC Coverage and Interference |year=2006 |accessdate=2008-12-31 |last=Veriner |first=Doug |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325090032/http://www.v-soft.com/web/IBOC%20Coverage%20and%20Interference%20Issues2.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldsupercaster.blogspot.com/2005/08/hd-radio-less-choice-more-noise.html |work=Worldsupercaster |title=HD Radio - Less choice more noise! |date=2005-08-16 |accessdate=2008-12-31 |publisher=Blogspot |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019011838/http://worldsupercaster.blogspot.com/2005/08/hd-radio-less-choice-more-noise.html |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diymedia.net/feature/fdigital2.htm |work=DIY Media |title=Feature: Going Digital - The End of Radio As We Know It |date=2002-01-03 |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111041932/http://www.diymedia.net/feature/fdigital2.htm |archivedate=2009-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transmitterreviews.com/best-fm-broadcast-transmitter-with-antenna/ |title=FM-HD 10db Power Increase |work=Is HD Radio a Farce |first=Robert |last=Struble |accessdate=2008-12-31 |date=July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2010, the U.S. FCC approved a [[report and order]] to voluntarily increase the maximum digital [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) to 4% of analog ERP (−14&amp;nbsp;dB[[carrier wave|c]]), up from the previous maximum of 1% (−20dBc).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/audio/DA-10-208A1.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20140523212426/http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/audio/DA-10-208A1.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-05-23 |author=FCC |title=Digital power increase for FM stations approved.

If at least six verified complaints of ongoing [[RF interference]] to another station come from locations within the other station's [[service contour]], the interfering station will be required to reduce to the next level down of 4%, 2% (−17&amp;nbsp;dB), or 1%, until the FCC makes a final determination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rwonline.com/article/94652{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The station to which the interference is caused bears the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and its associated expenses, rather than the station that causes the problem.  For [[grandfathered]] FM [[list of superpower broadcast stations|stations]] which are allowed to remain over the limit for their [[list of broadcast station classes|class]], these numbers are relative to that lower limit rather than their actual power.

==Comparison to other digital radio standards==

===HD Radio versus DAB===
Some countries have implemented [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|Eureka-147 Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) or its successor DAB+. DAB broadcasts a single station that is approximately 1500 kilohertz wide (~1000 kilobits per second). That station is then subdivided into multiple digital streams of between 9 and 12 programs. In contrast FM HD Radio which requires 400&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth is assigned to the traditional 200 kilohertz channel spacing used in the United States, with capability of 300 kbit/s in pure digital mode.

The first generation DAB uses the [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2) audio codec which has less efficient compression than newer codecs. The typical bitrate for DAB stereo programs is 128 kbit/s or less and as a result most radio stations on DAB have a lower sound quality than FM does under similar conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=52348 |last=Holm |first=Steve |publisher=Digitale Utgivelser ved UiO |title=Lydkvalitetet i DAB digitalradio |year=2007 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501073857/http://wo.uio.no/as/WebObjects/theses.woa/wa/these?WORKID=52348 |archivedate=2008-05-01 |df= }} ([[Nynorsk|Norwegian]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Many DAB stations also broadcast in mono.  In contrast, DAB+ uses the newer [[AAC+]] codec and FM HD Radio uses a codec based upon the [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] standard.

Before DAB+ was introduced, DAB's inefficient compression led in some cases to "downgrading" stations from [[stereophonic]] to [[monaural]], in order to include more channels in the limited 1000 kbit/s bandwidth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalradiotech.co.uk/articles/Mono-is-the-new-stereo-on-national-DAB.php |title=Mono is the new stereo on national DAB |work= digitalradiotech.co.uk |accessdate=2009-01-03 |date=2006-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital radio, such as DAB, DAB+ and FM HD radio currently often have smaller coverage of markets as compared to analog FM, radios are more expensive, and reception inside vehicles and buildings may be poor, depending on the frequencies used. HD Radio shares most of these same flaws ([[#Criticisms|see criticisms below]]). On the other hand, digital radio allows for more stations and less susceptibility for disturbances in the signal. In the United States, however, other digital broadcast technologies than HD radio (such as DAB+) have not been approved for use on either the FM or AM band.

===HD Radio versus DRM===
[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM 30) is a system designed primarily for [[shortwave radio]] with compatible radios already available for sale. DRM 30 is similar to AM HD Radio in that each station is broadcast via channels spaced 10&amp;nbsp;kHz (or 9&amp;nbsp;kHz in some regions) on frequencies up to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz.  The two standards also share the same basic modulation scheme (COFDM), and AM HD Radio uses a proprietary codec. DRM 30 operates with any of a number of codecs, including AAC, Opus and HVXC. The receiver synchronization and data coding are quite different between HD Radio and DRM 30. As of 2015 there are several radio chipsets available which can decode AM, FM, ([DAB]) HD Radio DRM+ and DRM 30.

Similar to HD Radio, DRM allows either hybrid digital-analog broadcasts or pure digital broadcasts, DRM allows broadcasters to use multiple options:
* Hybrid mode (digital/analog) - 10&amp;nbsp;kHz analog plus 5&amp;nbsp;kHz digital bandwidth allows 5-16 kbit/s data rate;
* 10&amp;nbsp;kHz digital-only bandwidth confined to +/- 5&amp;nbsp;kHz of the channel center allows 12-35 kbit/s;
* 20&amp;nbsp;kHz digital-only bandwidth using +/- 10&amp;nbsp;kHz (including half of the adjacent channels) allows 24-72 kbit/s.

[[DRM+]], a different system based upon the same principles, operates in the VHF band with 100&amp;nbsp;kHz digital-only bandwidth which allows 700 kbit/s data rate.

Actual DRM bit rates vary depending on day versus night transmission ([[groundwave]] versus [[skywave]]) and the amount of bits dedicated for error correction (signal robustness). For AM stations DRM offers a growth path for broadcasters. Unfortunately DRM shares many of the same flaws as DAB and HD Radio technology: the hybrid mode has shorter broadcast distance compared to an analog AM signal; poor reception inside vehicles and buildings; and interference with adjacent channels when using the 20&amp;nbsp;kHz mode though in all-digital mode the signal fits inside the designated [[channel mask]].

Digital Radio Mondiale is an open standards system. HD Radio is based upon the intellectual property of iBiquity Digital Corporation. 
The United States utilizes [[Digital Radio Mondiale|DRM]] for HF or "Shortwave" broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usdrm.com/drm_news4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021131/http://www.usdrm.com/drm_news4.html |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }} DRM Usage in The United States&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acceptance and criticism==

===Awareness and coverage===
According to a survey dated August 8, 2007 by Bridge Ratings, when asked the question, "Would you buy an HD radio in the next two months?" 1.0% responded "yes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bridgeratings.com/press_08.08.07.HDvsInternet.htm |publisher=Bridge Ratings |title=HD Radio vs. Internet Radio: Which is Radio's Future? |date=2007-08-08 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216004432/http://www.bridgeratings.com/press_08.08.07.HDvsInternet.htm |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[broadcast engineer]]s have expressed concern over the new system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904032637/http://www.stopiboc.com/ |url=http://www.stopiboc.com/ |title=End The Radio Engineering Scourge That Could Mean Doom To AM Radio |archivedate=2011-09-04 |publisher=Stop IBOC Now! |accessdate=2016-07-03 |last=Savage |first=Bob}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted in September 2008 saw a small percentage of participants that confused HD radio with [[satellite radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/hd-radio-awareness-is-up-so-what.html |title=HD Radio awareness is up... so what? |last=Saghir |first=Ryan |date=2008-09-12 |work=Orbitcast |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104005750/http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/hd-radio-awareness-is-up-so-what.html |archivedate=2009-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many first-generation HD Radio tuners had insensitive tuners, which caused issues with reception quality. The HD Radio signal is 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;dB below a station's analog signal. In addition it has been noted that the analog section of some tuners displays inferior reception capabilities compared to older non-digital models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/7002/hd-radio2.html |title=HD Radio Undermined by Weak Tuners |last=Menta |first=Richard |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111052/http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/7002/hd-radio2.html |archivedate=2008-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since 2012 HD capable receiver adoption has significantly increased in most newer cars, and several aftermarket radio systems both for vehicles and home use contain HD radio receivers and special features such as Full Artist Experience. iBiquity reports that 78% of all radio listening is done on stations that broadcast in HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdradio.com/sites/default/files/stats-banner.png/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315162447/http://hdradio.com/sites/default/files/stats-banner.png |archivedate=2015-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an increasing number of stations switching to HD or adding subchannels compatible with digital radio, such as [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]] where many local radio outlets find a growing number of listeners tuning in to their HD signals, which in turn has benefited sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2015/02/21/boon-bust-hd-radio-comes-kasm-kvsc-stations-around-st-cloud-minnesota/23824175/ "Boon or bust, HD Radio alters Minnesota airwaves"] from ''St. Cloud Times'' (February 21, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Different format and compatibility standards====
Even though DAB and DRM standards are open-standards and pre-date HD Radio, HD Radio receivers cannot be used to receive these stations when sold or moved overseas (with certain exceptions; there are HD Radio stations in Sri Lanka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neth FM|url=http://www.nethfm.com/site/our-technology.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714165459/http://www.nethfm.com/site/our-technology.html|archivedate=2011-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Romania and a few other countries). DAB and DRM receivers cannot receive HD Radio signals in the US. The HD Radio system, which enables AM and FM stations to upgrade to digital without changing frequencies, is a different digital broadcasting standard. The lack of a common standard means that HD Radios cannot receive DAB format broadcasts of other countries and vice versa, and that manufacturers must develop separate products for different countries, which typically are not dual-format. Whereas the AAC ([[Advanced Audio Coding]]) family of codecs are publicly documented standards, the HDC codec exists only within the HD Radio system, and is an iBiquity [[trade secret]]. Similarly DRM and DAB are open specifications, while iBiquity's HD Radio specification is partly open but mostly private.&lt;ref name='Hardis PFR'&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| coauthors=| title=Petition for Reconsideration of Jonathan E. Hardis (Before U.S. FCC)| date=2007-07-09| publisher=| url=http://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/ecfs/retrieve.cgi?native_or_pdf=pdf&amp;id_document=6519550109| work=| pages=| accessdate=2007-10-29| language=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarification needed|reason=Needs clarification|date=September 2018}}

HD Radio does not use [[ATSC]], the standard for [[digital television in the United States]]. In the days of analog television, the low end of the FM broadcast band (87.7 to 87.9&amp;nbsp;MHz) overlapped with the audio subcarrier of analog television's channel 6, which allowed the audio of television stations that broadcast on that channel to be heard on most FM radios. In earlier days of television and radio, several television stations exploited this overlap and [[Channel 6 radio stations in the United States|operated as radio stations]] (a process that still continues with some low-powered stations, which are still allowed to broadcast in analog for the time being). Full-powered television stations were [[Digital television transition in the United States|forced to cease analog broadcasting]] in June 2009, with low-powered stations scheduled to cease analog broadcasting by September 2015. Because the digital television and digital radio standards are incompatible with each other, HD radios are not able to receive digital TV signals on the 87.7 frequency, eliminating the antiquated dual-medium compatibility of channel 6 television stations.

====Reduced-quality concerns====
Promotion for HD Radio does not always make clear that some of its capabilities are mutually incompatible with other of its capabilities. For example, the FM system has been described as "CD quality;" however, the FM system also allows [[multiplexing]] the data stream between two or more separate programs. A program utilizing one half or less of the data stream does not attain the higher audio quality of a single program allowed the full data stream. The FCC has declared "one [[free-to-air|free]] [[over-the-air programming|over-the-air]] digital stream [must be] of equal or greater quality than the station’s existing analog signal".&lt;ref name='FCC 2nd'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Second Report &amp; Order (U.S. FCC) | date=2007-05-31 | publisher= | url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-07-33A1.pdf |format=PDF| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-29 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (If the FCC discontinues analog simulcasting, each station will have over 300 kbit/s bandwidth available, allowing for good stereo quality or even [[surround sound]] audio together with multiple sub-channels, and to a lesser extent more freedom for personal FM transmitters to pair modern [[smartphone]]s, [[computer]]s and other devices to legacy analog FM receivers.)

The broadcasting industry is seeking FCC approval for [[conditional access]], that is, enabling the extra programs to be available only by paid [[subscription]] (on future models of HD Radio). {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[NDS Group|NDS]], a maker of digital media [[encryption]] technology, has a deal with iBiquity to provide HD Radio with an [[encrypt]]ed content-delivery system called RadioGuard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Skip | last=Pizzi | coauthors= | title=Subscription Radio Gets Real | date=2007-09-01 | publisher=Radio World | url=http://www.rwonline.com/pages/s.0054/t.8141.html | work= | pages= | accessdate=2009-01-03 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905144902/http://www.rwonline.com/pages/s.0054/t.8141.html | archivedate=2008-09-05 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NDS claims that RadioGuard will "provide additional revenue-generating possibilities".

A few existing FM tuners tuned to a channel broadcasting an HD Radio signal are prone to increased noise on the analog signal, called "HD Radio self-noise" ([http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/hdrsn.htm]), due to analog demodulation of the digital signal(s).  In some high fidelity FM tuners in quality playback systems this noise can be audible and irritating. A few existing FM tuners might require major internal modifications to the internal [[electronic filter|filter]]s ([http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/iboccer.htm]) or the addition of a post-detection filter ([http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/ibocfltr.htm]) may be required to prevent degradation of the analog signal quality on stations broadcasting with HD Radio.

====Reduced analog signal====
Radio stations are licensed in the United States to broadcast at a specific [[effective radiated power]] level. [[NPR]] Labs recently did a study of predicted HD radio operation if power levels were increased to 10% of maximum power as is now allowed by the FCC under certain circumstances, and found the digital signal would increase [[RF interference]] on FM. However the boosted digital HD signal coverage would then exceed analog coverage, with 17% more population covered in vehicles but 17% less indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.current.org/tech/tech0815hdradio.shtml |title=More power for HD Radio, more buzz on analog |work=Current |last=Behrens |first=Steve |date=2008-09-02 |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230020804/http://www.current.org/tech/tech0815hdradio.shtml |archivedate=2008-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====High costs====
The costs of installing the system, including fees, vary from station to station, according to the station's size and existing infrastructure.  Typical costs are at least several tens of thousands of dollars at the outset (including transmitter, diplexer or antenna/[[feedline]], and labor), plus per-channel annual fees (3% of the station's annual revenue{{cn|date=February 2018}}) to be paid to iBiquity for HD-2 and HD-3 (HD-1 does not have any royalty charge).  Large companies in larger [[media market]]s (such as [[iHeartRadio]] or [[Cumulus Broadcasting]]) can afford to implement the technology for their stations.  However, [[community radio]] stations, both commercial and noncommercial, cannot.  During mid-2010 a new generation of HD Radio broadcasting equipment was introduced greatly lowering the technical costs of implementing the system.

Current HD Radio receivers cost anywhere from around [[United States dollar|$]]50 to several hundred dollars, compared to regular FM radios which can sometimes even be found at [[dollar store]]s. 
Although costs have historically been higher for HD Radio hardware, as adoption increases, prices are lowering and receivers containing HD Radio are becoming more commonplace, especially as more radio stations broadcast in HD Radio.

==Programming==
Until 2013, the [[HD Digital Radio Alliance]], a [[consortium]] of major owners such as ABC, CBS, and iHeartMedia (then known as Clear Channel Communications), acted as a liaison for stations to choose unduplicated formats for the extra channels (HD2, HD3, etc.). Now, [[iBiquity]] works with the major owners of the stations to provide various additional choices for listeners instead of having several stations independently deciding to create the same format. HD1 stations broadcast the same format as the regular FM (and some AM) stations, and many of these stations offer one, two, or even three subchannels (designated HD2, HD3, HD4) to complement their main programming.

[[iHeartRadio]] is selling programming of several different [[music genre]]s to other competing stations, in addition to airing them on its own stations. Some stations are [[simulcast]]ing their local AM or lower-power FM broadcasts on sister stations' HD2 or HD3 channels, such as [[KMBZ-FM]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] simulcasting 610 [[KCSP (AM)|KCSP]]'s programming on 96.5-HD2. It is common practice to broadcast an older, discontinued format on HD2 channels; for example, with the recent disappearance of the [[smooth jazz]] format from the analog radio dial in many markets, stations such as [[WDZH]] in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] (formerly WVMV), [[WFAN-FM]] in [[New York City]], and [[WNWV]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] program smooth jazz on their HD2 or HD3 bands. Some HD2 or HD3 stations are even simulcasting [[sister station|sister]] AM stations.  In St. Louis, Missouri for example, clear-channel [[KMOX]] AM (1120&amp;nbsp;kHz analog and HD) is simulcast on [[KEZK-FM|KEZK]] FM 102.5 HD3. [[KBCO]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]] uses its HD2 channel to broadcast exclusive live recordings from their private recording studio. [[CBS Radio]] is implementing plans to introduce its more popular [[superstation]]s into distant markets ([[KROQ-FM]] into New York City, [[WFAN]] into Florida, and [[KFRG]] and [[KSON (FM)|KSCF]] into Los Angeles) via HD2 and HD3 channels.

On March 8, 2009, CBS Radio inaugurated the first station with an HD4 subchannel, [[WJFK-FM]] in [[Washington, DC]], a [[sports radio]] station which also carries sister sports operations [[WJZ-FM]] from [[Baltimore]]; [[Philadelphia]]'s [[WTEL (Philadelphia)|WTEL]] and [[WIP-FM|WIP]]; and WFAN from New York (though at some point, the WJZ-FM simulcast was replaced with a simulcast of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]] sister sports station [[KRLD-FM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbr.com/radio/22071.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311015752/http://www.rbr.com/radio/22071.html |archivedate=2010-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then numerous other channels have implemented HD4 subchannels as well, although with nearly 100% talk-based formats because of the reduced audio quality. For example, [[KKLQ (FM)|KKLQ]] in Los Angeles operates an HD4 signal and aired The Mormon Channel which was 99% talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdradio.com/stations/|title=Local HD Radio Stations|author=|date=|website=hdradio.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128043318/https://hdradio.com/stations|archivedate=28 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public broadcasting|Public broadcasters]] are also embracing HD Radio. [[Minnesota Public Radio]] offers a few services: [[KNOW-FM|KNOW]], the MPR News station in the [[Twin Cities]], offers music service [[Radio Heartland]] on 91.1 HD2 and additional news programming called [[BBC News]] and More on 91.1 HD3; [[KSJN]], the Classical MPR station in the Twin Cities, provides [[Classical 24]] service on 99.5 HD2; and [[KCMP|The Current]], on 89.3 in the Twin Cities, offers [[Wonderground Radio]], music for kids and their parents, on 89.3 HD2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/hd_radio/|title=HD Radio - Minnesota Public Radio|author=|date=|website=publicradio.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007140034/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/radio/hd_radio/|archivedate=7 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[KPCC (radio station)|Southern California Public Radio]], heard on 89.3 FM in [[Los Angeles]], offers a digital simulcast of its analog channel on 89.3 HD1 and MPR's music service [[KCMP|The Current]] on 89.3 HD2 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scpr.org/listen/|title=Listen|first=Southern California Public|last=Radio|date=|website=scpr.org|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005135806/http://www.scpr.org/listen|archivedate=5 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WNYC]] in [[New York City]] broadcasts a locally programmed, all-[[classical music]] service called [[WQXR-FM|Q2]], on 93.9 HD2. The service launched in March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wnyc.org/hdradio/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226060727/http://www.wnyc.org/hdradio/ |archivedate=2010-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 8, 2009, the format was moved to [[WXNY-FM|WQXR]]-HD2 on 105.9 when WQXR was acquired by WNYC as part of a frequency swap with [[Univision Radio]] for their former frequency. The programming on the WNYC HD2 channel now is a rebroadcast of WQXR in order to give full coverage of WQXR programming in some form, as the 105.9 signal is weaker and does not cover the whole area.

[[WMIL-FM]] in [[Milwaukee]] has offered an audio simulcast of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] on their HD3 subchannel since August 2009 as part of a news and weather content agreement between iHeartRadio and WITI. This restored WITI's audio to the Milwaukee radio dial after a two-month break after the digital transition; as a Channel 6 analog [[television station]] WITI exploited the [[NTSC#NTSC-M|87.7 FM]] audio quirk as an advantage in order to allow viewers to hear the station's newscasts and Fox programming on their car radios.

[[KYXY]], operated by CBS in [[San Diego]] on 96.5 FM and offers their HD-2 channel as one of the few 'subchannel only' independent Christian music based formats on HD Radio. Branded as The Crossing, it is operated by [[Azusa Pacific University]].

College radio has also been impacted by HD radio, stations such as [[WBJB-FM|WBJB]] which is a public station on a college campus offer a student run station as one of the multicast channels.

Some commercial broadcasters also use their HD2's to broadcast the programming of noncommercial broadcasters. [[Bonneville International]] uses its HD2 and HD3 channels to broadcast [[Mormon Channel]] which is entirely noncommercial and operates solely as a public service from Bonneville's owner, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. That network of eight HD2 and HD3 stations was launched on May 18, 2009 and was fully functional within two weeks. Also, in Detroit, [[WMXD]], an [[urban adult contemporary]] station, airs the [[contemporary Christian]] [[K-Love]] format on its HD2 band (the HD2 also feeds several analog translators around the metropolitan area—see below), due to an agreement between iHeartMedia and K-Love owner [[Educational Media Foundation]] allowing EMF to program WMXD's HD2. On a similar note, Los Angeles' [[KRRL]] 92.3's HD3 signal rebroadcasts EMF's [[Air1]] and in Santa Barbara [[KLSB]] 97.5, which airs K-Love on its primary frequency, rebroadcasts Air1 on HD2 though neither one support 'Artist Experience'.

In July 2018, as part of a projected one year experiment, [[WWFD]] in Frederick, Maryland became the first AM station to eliminate its analog transmissions and broadcast exclusively in digital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radiomagonline.com/blog/hubbard-testing-all-digital-am-on-wwfd "Hubbard Testing All-Digital AM on WWFD"] by Emily M. Reigart, July 16, 2018 (radiomagonline.com).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translators===
Although [[broadcast translator]]s are prohibited from originating their own programming, the FCC has controversially allowed translator stations to [[simulcast|rebroadcast]] in standard analog FM the audio of an HD Radio channel of the primary station the translator is assigned to. This also allows station owners, who already usually own [[Duopoly (broadcasting)|multiple stations locally]] and nationally, to avoid the [[rulemaking]] process of changing the [[table of allotments]] as would be needed to get a new separately-licensed station, and to avoid exceeding controlling-interest caps intended to prevent the excessive [[concentration of media ownership]]. Such new translator stations can block new [[LPFM]] stations from going on the air in the same footprint. Translator stations are allowed greater [[broadcast range]] (via less restrictive height and power limitations) than [[community radio|locally originated]] LPFMs, so they may occupy a footprint in which several LPFMs might have been licensed otherwise.

In addition to the controversial practice of converting the HD Radio-only secondary channels of a primary station into analog FM in areas where the primary station's signal can already readily be received, translators can also be used in a more traditional manner to extend the range of the full content of the primary station, including the unmodified main signal and any HD radio sub-channels, in areas where the station has poor coverage or reception, as is done at [[K202BD]] in [[Manti, Utah]], which rebroadcasts both the analog and digital signals of [[KUER]] from [[Salt Lake City]]. In order to do this, HD Radio may be passed along from the main station via a "[[bent pipe]]" setup, where the translator simply makes a frequency shift of the entire channel, often by [[heterodyne|heterodyning]] it through the use of an [[intermediate frequency]]. This may require an increase in [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in both the [[amplifier]] and [[radio antenna]] if they are too [[narrowband]] to pass the wider signal, meaning one or both would have to be replaced. [[Baseband]] translators which use a separate receiver and transmitter require an HD Radio transmitter, just as does the main station.  Translators are not required to pass through HD Radio, and the vast majority of existing translators which repeat FM stations running hybrid HD Radio signals do not repeat the HD Radio part of the broadcast due to technical limitations in equipment designed before the prominence of HD Radio.

==Receivers==

===Automotive and home/professional===
By 2012, there were several HD Radio receivers available on the market. A basic model costs around [[United States dollar|$]]50.

The list of HD Radio automotive receiver manufacturers includes [[Alpine Electronics]], [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]], [[Delphi Corporation]], [[Directed Electronics]], [[Dual (brand)|Dual]], [[Harman International Industries|Harman]], Insignia, [[Jensen Loudspeakers|Jensen]], [[JVC]], [[Kenwood Electronics|Kenwood]], [[Pioneer Electronics|Pioneer]], [[Sony]], and [[Visteon]].

Most car manufacturers offer HD Radio receivers as audio packages in new cars, including [[Ford]], [[Honda]], [[Hyundai]], [[Kia]], [[Mazda]], [[Subaru]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdradio.com/get-a-radio/new-car/subaru|title=Subaru|first=|last=Juan@HDRadio|date=9 July 2013|website=hdradio.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414234617/https://hdradio.com/get-a-radio/new-car/subaru|archivedate=14 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tesla Motors]], [[Toyota]],  [[Volkswagen]] and, [[Nissan]].

Home and office listening equipment is currently{{when|date=May 2015}} available from roughly a dozen companies, in both component tuner and tabletop models, including Audio Design Associates, [[Boston Acoustics]] (discontinued), [[DaySequerra]], [[Denon]], DICE Electronics, [[Directed Electronics]], Insignia, [[Jensen Electronics]], [[LG]] (discontinued), [[Marantz]], [[McIntosh Laboratory|McIntosh]], [[Onkyo]], [[Polk Audio]], [[Radiosophy]] (discontinued), [[Radio Shack]], [[Rotel]], [[Sangean]], [[Sony]], [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]], [[Visteon]], and [[Yamaha]].

===Portable===
Previously, portable HD Radio receivers were unavailable due to the early chipsets either being too large for a portable enclosure or needing too much power to be practical for a battery-operated device. However, in January 2008 at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas iBiquity unveiled a prototype of a new portable receiver, roughly the size of a cigarette pack. Two companies are currently making low-power chipsets for HD Radio receivers: Samsung,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiquity.com/press_room/news_releases/2009/1331|title=DTS and Ibiquity Digital Corp to Make the Drive Better with HD Radio Technology - DTS|author=|date=|website=www.ibiquity.com|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403083259/http://www.ibiquity.com/press_room/news_releases/2009/1331|archivedate=3 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] startup SiPort, acquired by [[Intel]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siport.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425053457/http://www.siport.com/ |archivedate=2009-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abiresearch.com/blogs/intel-acquired-siport-maker-of-digital-radio-silicon/|title=Intel acquired SiPort maker of Digital Radio Silicon|author=|date=|website=www.abiresearch.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portable [[Coby Electronics Corporation|Coby]] HDR-700 unit receives AM HD and FM HD stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cobyusa.com/files/manuals/HDR700_MN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708171854/http://www.cobyusa.com/files/manuals/HDR700_MN.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin Technology produced an HD Radio tuner designed to be plugged into the dock connector of an [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPod]] or [[iPhone]], with tuning functionality provided via [[software]] through the device's [[multi-touch]] display.  This product is now discontinued.

On July 12, 2009, [[Best Buy]] started selling a [[house brand]] portable unit, the Insignia NS-HD01, which was the second portable HD Radio to come to the general market and features FM-only playback and a non-removable rechargeable battery which charges via [[mini USB]]. Coby produced the first portable HD radio (HDR-700). The Insignia unit sold in 2009 for around $50, the least expensive receiver available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Darren |last=Murph |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/07/12/insignia-ns-hd01-first-ever-portable-hd-radio-on-sale-at-best-b/ |title=Insignia NS-HD01: first-ever portable HD Radio on sale at Best Buy |publisher=Engadget |date=2009-07-12 |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713195246/http://www.engadget.com/2009/07/12/insignia-ns-hd01-first-ever-portable-hd-radio-on-sale-at-best-b/ |archivedate=2009-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to be sold as of August 2018.

On September 15, 2009, [[Microsoft]] released the [[Zune HD]], which includes an HD Radio receiver within the media device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Joshua | last=Topolsky | url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/zune-hd-review// | title=Zune HD review by Engadget | publisher=Engadget | date=2009-09-17 | accessdate=2009-09-17 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922221816/http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/17/zune-hd-review | archivedate=2009-09-22 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Zune HD is now discontinued.

iBiquity was trying to get HDR chipsets into [[mobile phone]]s by 2012.

===Open Source Software-Defined Receiver (SDR)===
As of June 10, 2017, a project hosted on [[GitHub]] called ''nrsc5''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5|title=theori-io/nrsc5|author=|date=|website=GitHub|accessdate=14 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727215432/https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5|archivedate=27 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created to allow HD Radio reception via ''rtl-sdr''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtl-sdr.com/|title=rtl-sdr.com - RTL-SDR (RTL2832U) and software defined radio news and projects.

'''Harlem Children Society''' (HCS) is a [[non-profit organization]] that arranges for students from under-resourced and under-served communities to be placed as interns at academic research labs during a summer research program.  In addition to the lab experience, students receive a stipend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nysun.com/new-york/harlem-children-society-searches-for-the-einstein/81123/|title=Harlem Children Society Searches for the Einstein of the Bronx|work=The New York Sun|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participating institutions include [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], [[Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].

Students undertake their own research, which is presented during a street science fair in their own community, under the guidance of scientists. The students are able to pursue their scientific investigations during the following school semester in an after-school program.  Additionally, these students attend weekly lectures on a variety of topics ranging from incorporating science into communities to financing a college education, while also having the option to visit college campuses and to receive help preparing for the SATs.

==History and origins==
Satyajit Bhattacharya founded HCS on June 5, 2000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  By 2010, the program had expanded to 12 countries, serving more than 750 students.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2010/07/education-taking-science-into-the-streets/|title=EDUCATION: Taking Science into the Streets {{!}} Inter Press Service|website=www.ipsnews.net|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of their mentees in the United States, as of 2010, 40% are African-American, 26% are of Hispanic descent, and 16% are Native Americans.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

HCS aims to increase awareness in the sciences, medicine, engineering and mathematics.  It provides an opportunity for under-privileged high school aged students throughout to world succeed academically as well as in all other aspects of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stacey |first1=Georgia |title=Worms May Hold Clues to Neurological Disorders |url=https://www.livescience.com/11034-worms-hold-clues-neurological-disorders.html |website=Live Science |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Krueger |first1=Liz |title=Commemorating the 15th Anniversary of the Harlem Children Society |url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/resolutions/2015/j2958 |website=The New York State Senate |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=July 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
HCS as of the 2013 serves about 60 students from over 15 schools doing hands-on science research with over 20 mentors in more than 10 reputed institutions. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Program has three components: Students and research projects; seminars and training; and local, regional and national professional conferences and community science street fairs.  Family involvement and post-program follow-up provide students with support to plan their futures and mediate the transitions----academic, emotional, and social----to college and post-academic pursuits. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Depending on their interests and availability of recruited mentors, students are matched with a mentor willing to commit to the summer program.  These students enter the program at the beginning of the summer with an orientation, and spend about eight 25-hour weeks starting their research and some receive training in lab techniques and safety.  During the academic year, a fraction of the participating students put in 12–24 hours each month at their internship sites and attend weekly seminars when made available. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A fraction of the students stay committed to the program for at least two years, and are requested to work as part of HCS staff by Bhattacharya as volunteer interns with an unfixed stipend every year. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Highlights==
The Harlem Children Society has had a number of accomplishments:

*Almost 80% of the program's participants in 2006 were first or second generation immigrants to the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HCS Statistics|url=http://harlemchildrensociety.org/statistics.html|publisher=HCS}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=http://harlemchildrensociety.org generates an 'account suspended' error page.|date=November 2018}}
*As of 2009, 100% of the US students enrolled in HCS internships attended college.  Of those, over 20% went to Ivy League schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Taking Note: Harlem Children Society International|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/24144384|journal=The Science Teacher|volume=76|issue=1|pages=72–73|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Good housekeeping 1908 08 a.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Good Housekeeping]]'' is one of several [[periodical]]s related to homemaking]]
[[File:Title page of OUR HOME CYCLOPEDIA, printed 1889.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''Our Home Cyclopedia: Cookery and Housekeeping,'' published in Detroit, Michigan, in 1889]]
'''Homemaking''' is a mainly [[American English|American]] term for the management of a [[home]], otherwise known as '''housework''', '''[[housekeeping]]''', or '''household management'''.  It is the act of overseeing the organizational, day-to-day operations of a house or estate, and the managing of other domestic concerns. 
A person in charge of the homemaking, who is not employed outside the home, is in the U.S. called a '''homemaker''', a  term for a [[housewife]] or a [[househusband]]. The term "homemaker", however, may also refer to a [[social worker]] who manages a household during the incapacity of the housewife or househusband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/homemaker |title=homemaker - definition of homemaker by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Housework is not always a lifetime commitment; many, for economic or personal reasons, return to the workplace. In previous decades, there were many mandatory courses for the young to learn the skills of homemaking.  In high school, courses included [[cooking]], [[nutrition]], [[home economics]], [[family and consumer science]] (FACS), and [[food and cooking hygiene]]. This last one may underlie the tradition that a homemaker is portrayed wearing an [[apron]]. More recently, most of these courses have been abolished, and many youths in high school and college would be more likely to study child development and the management of children's behavior.

==Household tools==
{{main|Domestic technology|:Category:Home appliances|:Category:Cleaning tools}}
The method and function of housework are different in the industrial world and in other countries, with the balance of convenience, labor-saving devices and easier methods being in the industrial homemaker's favor. The reason for this is that mechanical [[invention]] has been applied extensively to different tasks of the home. Inventors have developed mechanical labor-saving devices not only for the shop and office, but also for the home. There are, on the market, thousands of household tools, devices and equipment for every domestic need. It only remains for the homemaker to choose between them.

Another reason for the great supply and demand for household labor savers in the industrial world is that the homemaker has to face the increasingly complex problem of scarce [[domestic help]]. With cheap labor, the need for the mechanical replacers of labor, or "mechanical servants," will not be keenly felt, however, the majority of homemakers perform their own household tasks. It is to this class of homemakers who are actively concerned in domestic work that the labor-saver and improved modern [[tool]] most appeal. The homemaker's time and effort are worth conserving by every means. Homemakers should, therefore, be eager to buy and use all the household tools that will save their strength and time and liberate them from household drudgery.

While some homemakers are "handy" with tools, the fact remains that most homemakers are unfamiliar with the different principles involved in mechanical tools and devices. The homemaker, however, is called to have knowledge of the principles of applied mechanics. Courses in school physics unfortunately leave a student with little practical knowledge that can be applied to domestic equipment. The gaining of knowledge concerning domestic tools may lead the homemaker to purchase good quality equipment, which may assist in saving time and labor.

==Housekeeping==
[[File:dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[vacuum cleaner]]]]
[[Housekeeping]] by the homemaker is the care and control of property, ensuring its maintenance and proper use and appearance. A [[home]] is a place of residence.&lt;ref name="defhome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/home |title='Home' - Definitions from Dictionary.com|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]] |accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a private home a [[maid]] or [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] might be employed to do some of the housekeeping. Housework is work done by the act of housekeeping. Some housekeeping is housecleaning and some housekeeping is home chores. Home chores are housework that needs to be done at regular intervals,&lt;ref&gt;Gove, Philip et al. 1961. ''Webster’s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language'' Unabridged. Springfield, Massachusetts: G &amp; C Merriam Company&lt;/ref&gt; Housekeeping includes the budget and control of expenditures, preparing meals and buying food, paying the heat bill, and cleaning the house.&lt;ref&gt;Ansley, Clark et al. 1935. ''The Columbia Encyclopedia in One Volume''. Morningside Heights, NY: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cooking===
{{main|Cooking}}
{{See also|List of food preparation utensils|Diet (nutrition)|Cuisine|Cookbook}}
Most modern-day houses contain [[Sanitation|sanitary facilities]] and a means of [[Cooking|preparing food]]. A [[kitchen]] is a room or part of a room used by the Homemaker for [[cooking]], [[food preparation]] and food preservation. In the West, a modern kitchen is typically equipped with a [[stove]], an oven, a [[sink]] with hot and cold running water, a [[refrigerator]] and [[kitchen cabinet]]s. Many homemakers use a [[microwave oven]], a [[dishwasher]] and other electric appliances like [[blender]] and convection [[cooker]] and automatic appliances like [[rotimatic]] and automatic cookers. The main function of a kitchen is cooking or preparing food but it may also be used for [[dining]] and [[entertaining]].

[[Cooking]] is the process of preparing [[food]] with or without [[heat]], making and selecting, measuring and combining ingredients in an ordered procedure for producing safe and edible food. The process encompasses a vast range of methods, tools and combinations of [[ingredient]]s to alter the [[flavor]], appearance, texture, or [[digestion|digestibility]] of food. Factors affecting the final outcome include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, [[tool]]s, and the skill of the individual doing the actual cooking.

The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, social and religious diversity throughout the nations, races, creeds and tribes across the globe. Applying heat to a food usually, though not always, [[chemistry|chemically]] transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, consistency, appearance, and nutritional properties. Methods of cooking that involve the boiling of [[liquid]] in a receptacle have been practised at least since the 10th millennium BC, with the introduction of [[pottery]].

===Cleaning===
[[Housecleaning]] by the homemaker is the systematic process of making a home neat and clean. This may be applied more broadly that just an individual home, or as a metaphor for a similar "clean up" process applied elsewhere such as a procedural reform. In the process of housecleaning general cleaning activities are completed, such as disposing of [[rubbish]], storing of belongings in regular places, cleaning dirty surfaces, [[dust]]ing and [[Vacuum cleaner|vacuuming]]. The details of this are various and complicated enough that many books have been published on the subject. How-to sites on the internet have many articles on housecleaning. Tools include the [[vacuum cleaner]], [[broom]] and [[mop]]. Supplies such as [[Detergent|cleaning solutions]] and sponges are sold in grocery stores and elsewhere. Professional cleaners can be hired for less frequent or specialist tasks such as cleaning blinds, rugs, and sofas. Professional services are also offered for the basic tasks. Safety is a consideration because some cleaning products are [[toxic]] and some cleaning tasks are physically demanding. ''[[Green cleaning]]'' refers to cleaning without causing pollution. The history of housecleaning has links to the advancement of technology.

Outdoor housecleaning chores include removing leaves from rain gutters, washing windows, sweeping doormats, cleaning the pool, putting away lawn furniture, and taking out the trash.&lt;ref&gt;Smallin, Donna. 2006. ''Cleaning Plain &amp; Simple''. Storey Publishing, North Adams, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laundry===
{{see also|Ironing}}
[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|left|A 1950s [[washing machine]]]]

[[Laundry]] refers to the act of [[washing]] [[clothing]] and [[linen]]s, the place where that washing is done, and/or that which needs to be, is being, or has been laundered. Various chemicals may be used to increase the solvent power of water, such as the compounds in [[soaproot]] or yucca-root used by Native American tribes. [[Soap]], a compound made from [[lye]] (from wood-ash) and [[fat]], is an ancient and very common laundry aid. Modern [[washing machine]]s typically use powdered or liquid [[laundry detergent]] in place of more traditional soap. Once clean, the clothes have been wrung out — twisted to remove most of the water. Then they were hung up on poles or clotheslines to air dry, or sometimes just spread out on clean grass.

Washing machines and dryers are now fixtures in homes around the world. In some parts of the world, including the USA, Canada, and Switzerland, [[apartment building]]s and [[dormitory|dormitories]] often have laundry rooms, where residents share washing machines and dryers. Usually the machines are set to run only when money is put in a [[Currency detector|coin slot]]. In other parts of the world, apartment buildings with laundry rooms are uncommon, and each apartment may have its own washing machine. Those without a machine at home or the use of a laundry room must either wash their clothes by hand or visit a commercial [[laundromat]].

A [[clothes dryer]] is a household appliance that is used to remove moisture from a load of [[clothing]] and other [[textiles]], generally shortly after they are cleaned in a washing machine. Most dryers consist of a rotating [[drum]] called a tumbler through which heated air is circulated to [[evaporate]] the moisture from the load. The tumbler is rotated relatively slowly in order to maintain space between the articles in the load. In most cases, the tumbler is belt-driven by an [[induction motor]]. Using these machines may cause clothes to shrink, become less soft (due to loss of short soft fibers/ lint) and fade. For these reasons, as well as environmental concerns, many people use open air methods such as a [[clothes line]] and [[clotheshorse]].

[[starch|Laundry starch]] is used in the [[laundry|laundering]] of [[clothing|clothes]]. Starch was widely used in [[Europe]] in the 16th and 17th centuries to stiffen the wide collars and [[Ruff (clothing)|ruffs]] of fine linen which surrounded the necks of the well-to-do. During the 19th century and early 20th century, it was stylish to stiffen the collars and sleeves of men's [[shirt]]s and the ruffles of girls' [[petticoat]]s by applying starch to them as the clean clothes were being [[ironing|ironed]]. Aside from the smooth, crisp edges it gave to clothing, it served practical purposes as well. [[dust|Dirt]] and [[sweat]] from a person's neck and wrists would stick to the starch rather than to the fibers of the clothing, and would easily wash away along with the starch. After each laundering, the starch would be reapplied. Today the product is sold in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol cans]] for home use.

==Maintenance==
{{main|Maintenance, repair and operations}}
Homemakers that follow [[predictive maintenance]] techniques determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach offers cost savings over routine or time-based maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted. Homemakers that follow [[preventive maintenance]] methods ensure that household equipment and the house are in satisfactory operating condition by providing for inspection, detection, and correction of incipient failures either before they occur or before they develop into major defects.

===Home maintenance===
{{main|Home repair|Home improvement|Home automation| Handyman}}
[[Home maintenance]] involves the diagnosis and resolution of problems in a home, and is related to home maintenance to avoid such problems. Many types of maintenance are "[[Do it yourself]]" (DIY) projects. Maintenance is not necessarily the same as [[home improvement]], although many improvements can result from repairs or maintenance. Often the costs of larger repairs will justify the alternative of investment in full-scale improvements. It may make just as much sense to upgrade a home system (with an improved one) as to repair it or incur ever-more-frequent and expensive maintenance for an inefficient, obsolete or dying system. For a DIY project, also useful is the established limits on  time and money investments before a repair (or list of repairs) become overwhelming and discouraging, and less likely to ever be completed.

===Lawn maintenance===
{{main|Lawn care | Gardening}}
Homemakers that have a lawn responsibility adhere to seasonal [[lawn care]] practices, which vary to some extent depending on the [[climate zone]] and type of [[grass]] that is grown (whether cool season or warm season varieties). Various recognized method used by homemakers in lawn care are observed in any area. In spring or early summer, homemakers seed, sod, or sprig a yard when the ground is warmer. In Summer lawn mowers are used at high cutting for cool season grass, and lower cutting for warm season lawns. In autumn, lawns are mown by homemakers at a lower height and thatch build-up that occurs in warm season grasses are removed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawn experts are divided in their opinions on this.&lt;/ref&gt; Homemakers do add sandy [[loam]] and apply fertilizer, containing some type of wetting agent. Cool season lawns are planted in the autumn with adequate rainfall. Lawn care in the winter is minimal, requiring only light feedings of organic material, such as green-waste compost, and minerals to encourage earthworms and beneficial microbes.

==Management==
Household management by the homemaker is the act of overseeing the [[organizing (management)|organizational]], financial, and day-to-day operations of a house or estate. It differs from [[housekeeping]], which consists of the physical maintenance and cleaning of a house.

Also common in the U.S are homemaking parties which involve a group of people doing household work instead of hanging out with their friends.

===House organization===
House organization or home organization includes interior design which is making the home aesthetically pleasing; and de-cluttering which is removing unnecessary things from the house.

====Interior design====
Interior design is making the home aesthetically pleasing. Its activities include arranging furniture,  having plants inside the house, and more.

====De-cluttering====
Household de-cluttering involves putting things in their proper place after they have been used.  "Cleaning up your mess" might involve removing glasses or eating utensils from the living room if you have eaten a meal there in front of the television.  If several people have done that over a few days and not removed their glasses, dishes and utensils from the living room, the living room is considered to be "cluttered" with dishes.  The dishes are out of place because they belong in the kitchen, washed and put away in the cupboards. That is the most common example of clutter in a modern American household.

There is another definition of clutter, which refers to having simply too many things and not enough room for all of it.  Sometimes as happens in Asian households, the items are necessary, but the house is simply too small, and ingenious methods are needed to organize everything so that unsightly clutter does not result.  However, removing unneeded or no longer necessary objects from a household or home is also an aspect of de-cluttering. Objects can be [[Gift|given away]] to friends or [[Charitable organization|charitable]] organizations, [[selling|sold]] as [[second-hand]], [[Recycling|recycled]] or [[Waste management|thrown away]].

Extreme forms of an inability to de-clutter is a behavioral aspect of [[compulsive hoarding]]. On the other end, a society that relies overly much on generating and then disposing of [[waste]] is referred to as [[throw-away society]].

===Household purchasing===
{{Main|Purchasing | Household budget | Shopping}}
Household [[purchasing]] refers to homemaker's attempt to acquire goods or services to accomplish the goals of the household. Though there are several households that attempt to set standards in the purchasing process, processes can vary greatly between households. Typically the word “purchasing” is not used interchangeably with the word “[[procurement]]”, since procurement typically includes other concepts. Home makers decide the market goods that the household will buy, such as the [[groceries]] which have been bought at a [[grocer]]'s.

Another important purchase handled by homemakers is the power source used for appliances. Home or other building heating may include boilers, [[furnace]]s, and [[water heater]]s. [[Compressed natural gas]] is used in [[rural]] homes without connections to [[plumbing|piped]]-in [[public utility]] services, or with portable [[Grill (cooking)|grills]]. However, due to being less economical than [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], LPG (Propane) is the dominant source of rural gas for natural gas-powered ranges and/or ovens, natural gas-heated [[clothes dryer]]s, [[HVAC|heating]]/[[air conditioning|cooling]] and [[central heating]]. The amount of usages is determined by factors such as [[natural gas prices]].

===Servants===
{{main|Maid|Butler|Domestic worker}}
Homemakers may manage household workers or "[[domestic worker]]s".

==Work strategies==
{{main|Household|Employment}}
In [[sociology]], ''household work strategy'' is the [[division of labour]] between members of a household, whether implicit or the result of explicit decision–making, with the alternatives weighed up in a simplified type of [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name="essex-pahl"&gt;[http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204011627/http://www.essex.ac.uk/Sociology/people/staff/pahl.shtm |date=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DivisionsLabour"&gt;''Divisions of Labour'' Ray Pahl (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a plan for the relative deployment of household members' time between the three domains of [[employment]]:
# in the ''[[market economy]]'', including home-based self-employment second jobs, in order to obtain money to buy goods and services in the market;
# ''domestic production work'', such as cultivating a vegetable patch or raising chickens, purely to supply food to the household; and
# ''domestic consumption work'' to provide goods and services directly within the household, such as cooking meals, child–care, household repairs, or the manufacture of clothes and gifts.
Household work strategies may vary over the life-cycle, as household members age, or with the economic environment; they may be imposed by one person or be decided collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-householdworkstrategy.html|title=Household work strategy|publisher=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Household production==
Homemaking is described by economists as "household production".   Household production has been defined as "the production of the goods and services by the members of a household, for their own consumption, using their own capital and their own [[unpaid work |unpaid labor]]. Goods and services produced by households for their own use include accommodation, meals, clean clothes, and child care. The process of household production involves the transformation of purchased intermediate commodities into final consumption commodities. Households use their own capital and their own labor."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ironmonger, D. |url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/mlb/wpaper/759.html |title=Household Production and the Household Economy |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date=2000-02-02 |accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goods and services created at the household level are generally consumed within the country within which they were produced, and hence contribute to "Domestic Consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/business-english/domestic-consumption|title=Domestic Consumption|publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wages for housework==
The [[Wages for housework|International Wages for Housework Campaign]] was a global, social movement co-founded in 1972 in [[Padua]], Italy, by author and activist [[Selma James]]. The Campaign was formed to raise awareness of how housework and [[childcare]] are the base of all industrial work and to stake the claim that these unavoidable tasks should be compensated as paid, wage labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James|first=Selma|title=Is Transformation Possible? They Say We Can't. We Must.|jstor=20838923|work=Off Our Backs|publisher=Off Our Backs. Inc|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demands for the Wages for Housework formally called for economic compensation for domestic work but also used these demands to more generally call attention to the affective labors of women, the reliance of capitalist economies on exploitative labor practices against women, and leisure inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nplusonemag.com/more-smiles-more-money|title=More Smiles? More Money|work=nplusonemag.com|accessdate=2015-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[List of home appliances|Many home appliances]] have been invented that make housework faster or more effective compared to before the industrial revolution.  These include:
* [[Washing machine]]
* [[Clothes dryer]]
* [[Dishwasher]]
* [[Sewing machine]]
* [[Vacuum cleaner]]
* [[Small electrics]] like the [[electric mixer]], [[blender]], [[toaster]], and [[coffee maker]]
* [[Microwave oven]]
* [[Refrigerator]], reducing the number of grocery trips or the amount of food preservation work to do

[[Utilities]] can potentially eliminate work like gathering and chopping firewood, shovelling coal, fetching water from outdoors, and heating cold tap water.

Historian Ruth Schwartz Cowan claims that homemakers in the 1800s performed about 50–60 hours of work per week, and that this is the same as the 1990s.  She says that labor-saving devices have been used to make the same amount of time do more work, such as by vacuuming a rug instead of sweeping it, or washing fabrics more frequently.  Modern parents also more frequently transport their children after-school activities, and doctors no longer make house calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines//epi1088.htm |title=No. 1088: Housework |website=Uh.edu |date=2004-08-01 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16269">An '''ideograph''' or '''virtue word''' is a word frequently used in political discourse that uses an abstract concept to develop support for political positions. Such words are usually terms that do not have a clear definition but are used to give the impression of a clear meaning. An ideograph in rhetoric often exists as a building block or simply one term or short phrase that summarizes the orientation or attitude of an ideology. Such examples notably include &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom]]&gt;, &lt;[[democracy]]&gt; and &lt;[[rights]]&gt;. Rhetorical critics use chevrons or angle brackets (&lt;&gt;) to mark off ideographs.

The term ideograph was coined by rhetorical scholar and critic [[Michael Calvin McGee]] (1980) describing the use of particular words and phrases as political language in a way that captures (as well as creates or reinforces) particular ideological positions.  McGee sees the ideograph as a way of understanding of how specific, concrete instances of political discourse relate to the more abstract idea of political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski, J. (2001).  ''Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robertson defines ideographs as “political slogans or labels that encapsulate ideology in political discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, [[Celeste Condit]] and [[John Lucaites]], influenced by McGee, explain, “Ideographs represent in condensed form the normative, collective commitments of the members of a public, and they typically appear in public argumentation as the necessary motivations or justifications for action performed in the name of the public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=xxii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideographs are common in [[advertising]] and political discourse.

==Definition==
McGee uses the term in his seminal article “The ‘Ideograph’: A Link Between Rhetoric and Ideology” which appeared in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref name=McGee&gt;McGee, M.C. (1980). The “ideograph”: A link between rhetoric and ideology. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 66'', 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He begins his essay by defining the practice of [[ideology]] as practice of political language in specific contexts—actual discursive acts by individual speakers and writers. The question this raises is how does this practice of [[ideology]] create social control.

McGee’s answer to this is to say that “political language which manifests ideology seems characterized by slogans, a vocabulary of ‘ideographs’ easily mistaken for the technical terminology of [[political philosophy]].”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;  He goes on to offer his definition of “ideograph”:  “an ideograph is an ordinary-language term found in political discourse.  It is a high order abstraction representing commitment to a particular but equivocal and ill-defined normative goal.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

An ideograph, then, is not just any particular word or phrase used in political discourse, but one of a particular subset of terms that are often invoked in political discourse but which does not have a clear, univocal definition.  Despite this, in their use, ideographs are often invoked precisely to give the sense of a clearly understood and shared meaning. This potency makes them the primary tools for shaping public decisions. It is in this role as the [[vocabulary]] for public values and decision-making that they are linked to [[ideology]].

== Examples ==
There is no absolute litmus test for what terms are or are not ideographs. Rather, this is a judgment that must be made through the study of specific examples of discourse. However, McGee (and others who have followed him) have identified several examples of ideographs or virtue words in Western liberal political discourse, such as &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[freedom of speech]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, and &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;. In each case, the term does not have a specific [[referent]].  Rather, each term refers to an [[abstraction]] which may have many different meanings depending on its [[context (language use)|context]].  It is in their mutability between circumstances that give the terms such rhetorical power.  If the definition of a term such as &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt; can be stretched to include a particular act or condition, then public support for that act or condition is likely to be stronger than it was previously.

By encapsulating values which are perceived to be widely shared by the community, but which are in fact highly abstract and defined in very different ways by individuals, ideographs provide a potent persuasive tool for the political speaker. McGee offers the example of [[Richard Nixon]]’s attempt to defend his decision not to turn over documents to Congress during the [[Watergate scandal]] by invoking “the principle of [[confidentiality]].” Recognizing that his refusal to submit to Congress could be seen as a violation of the "[[rule of law]]", Nixon pitted "the principle of [[confidentiality]]” against the “[[rule of law]],” despite the fact that these two ideographs would, in the abstract, not likely be seen as in conflict with one another.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt; Nixon, in an attempt to expand the understanding of “the principle of [[confidentiality]]” to cover his own specific refusal to cooperate with Congress, used the abstractness of the term to his benefit, claiming that right to confidentiality was the more central term.&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;

While the term has remained mostly in this sphere of academic [[rhetorical criticism]], some [[political consulting|political consultants]] and practitioners are becoming savvy to this art.

Ideographs appear in [[advertising]] and [[political campaigns]] regularly, and are crucial to helping the public understand what is really being asked of them. For example, “[[Social equality|equality]]” is a term commonly used in political discourse and rarely defined. It can refer to a situation in which all people have the same opportunities, or a condition in which social resources are distributed uniformly to different individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jasinski|first=James|title=Sourcebook on rhetoric: Key concepts in contemporary rhetorical studies|year=2001|publisher=Sage Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is the more commonly used definition in US history, according to Condit &amp; Lucaites, although in a socialist or left-leaning political state, the term may refer foremost to the distribution of social resources. Condit and Lucaites depict the racial facet of equality as the dominant meaning in an American context of political discourse, since 1865.&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Condit &amp; Lucaites|first=C.M. &amp; J.L.|title=Crafting equality: America’s Anglo-African word|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ideograph used specifically by U.S. presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush after the 9/11 attacks is &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;. The term does not have a clear or specific definition, but when applied to the context in the fear-stricken country after the devastating attacks in 2001, this term held significant weight and meaning to Americans all across the country. Kelly Long explores Obama’s discourse on the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; and states that “by developing an ideological justification for the conflicts that the United States was involved in at the time, Obama remedied much of the damage done by the Bush administration”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=90|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama justified the &lt;[[War on Terror]]&gt; by addressing the nation and saying that in order to protect the &lt;[[rule of law]]&gt; and &lt;democratic values&gt;, we must fight against &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt;.  Obama used this term to his advantage and made &lt;[[terrorism]]&gt; appear to be a common enemy and fighting back was the common cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=Kelly|title="Terrorism" in the Age of Obama: The Rhetorical Evolution of President Obama's Discourse on the "War on Terror"|journal=Undergraduate Review|date=2013|volume=9|issue=1|page=91|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/undergrad_rev/vol9/iss1/19|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the ideograph unified the country creating a sense of identity for American citizens, “defining what the nation stands for and against. The term divides those who are civilized from those who are uncivilized, those who defend economic freedom from those who would attack America’s way of life and those who support democracy from those who would disrupt it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winkler|first1=Carol|title=In the Name of Terrorism: Presidents on Political Violence in the Post-World War II Era|date=2006|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=2|edition=SUNY series on the Presidency|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNXc1s_BKSoC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=YOlgZgkKFn&amp;dq=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=carol%20winkler%20in%20the%20name%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marouf Hasian discusses how key ideographs representative of a society’s commitments change over time, particularly in the name of &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;, &lt;[[Social equality|equality]]&gt;, or &lt;[[privacy]]&gt; epitomized in [[eugenics]]. From the 1900s-1930s, Americans justified the restriction of reproductive rights based on medical, social, economic, and political considerations, but were appalled when the [[Nazis]] used some of the same arguments in their creation of the “perfect race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hasian|first=M.A.|title=The rhetoric of eugenics in Anglo-American thought|year=1996|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, GA|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rhetorical critics identify these terms as ideographs, political leaders viewed each other’s terms as "[[glittering generalities]],” as Lincoln first identified his opponent's words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lincoln|first=Abraham|title=Lincoln to Henry Pierce|url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/pierce.htm|publisher=The Abraham Lincoln Association|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to practitioners, [[marketing|corporate marketing]] and [[political consulting]] use key terms in this way, concentrating on the [[image]] and [[brand management|branding]] of terms. For example, [[Frank Luntz]] tests audience reaction to certain words or phrases using dial technology, a mechanism which instantaneously shows moment by moment reactions to speeches or presentations. This research has been extremely beneficial to his clients, as they can utilize ideographs as "trigger words" in an [[advertising campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luntz|first=Frank|title=Words that work: It’s not what you say, it’s what people hear|year=2007|publisher=Hyperion|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
There are three primary ways in which the concept of the ideograph is important to rhetorical critics.  First, it suggests a way of studying political ideology using concrete instances of language use.  By showing how looking at specific uses of key words and phrases in political language reveal underlying ideological commitments, McGee offers a concrete method for understanding the highly abstract concept of ideology.

Second, the definition of the ideograph makes clear that the [[rhetoric|rhetorical study]] of a term is different from a legal, historical, or etymological study of a term. Unlike other perspectives that focus on how a term has changed over time, a rhetorical study of a term focuses on the forces involved in the creation of these meanings. In short, a rhetorical study of a term is the study of the use of that term in practice.

This leads to a third key aspect of what the concept of the ideograph offers to rhetorical critics.  McGee notes that the study of a term must not, and should not, be limited to its use in “formal discourse.” Instead, the critic is much more likely to gain a better understanding of an ideograph by looking at how it is used and depicted in movies, plays, and songs, as well as how it is presented in educational texts aimed at children.  This moves the study of ideology beyond the limits of social philosophy or even political discourse as traditionally conceived (i.e., “great speeches by great men”).

==Cultural variability==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"An ideograph is a culturally biased, abstract word or phrase drawn from ordinary language, which serves a constitutional value for a historically situated collectivity."&lt;ref name="Condit &amp; Lucaites 1993 xvii"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There exists a culturally-specific understanding in each culture about what an ideograph means. Ideographs in rhetoric are culturally specific but recur inter-culturally; meaning the understanding of one ideograph can be used and interpreted differently across cultures.  The idea may be different from culture to culture, but this doesn’t mean some aspects won’t be the same in one or more cultures.  Such as the concept of [[femininity]] that exists cross-culturally to define ideas about women, yet one can expect these ideas from culture to culture.

==Critical use==
At the end of his essay defining the ideograph, McGee says that
	&lt;blockquote&gt;
“A complete description of an ideology . . . will consist of (1) the isolation of a society’s ideographs, (2) the exposure and analysis of the [[Synchronic analysis|diachronic]] structure of every ideography, and (3) characterization of [[synchronic analysis|synchronic]] relationships among all the ideographs in a particular context.”&lt;ref name=McGee/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such an exhaustive study of any ideology has yet to materialize, but many scholars have made use of the ideograph as a tool of understanding both specific [[rhetorical situations]] as well as a broader scope of ideological history. As a teacher, McGee himself made use of the ideograph as a tool for structuring the study of the rise of liberalism in British public address, focusing on ideographs such as &lt;[[property]]&gt;, &lt;[[patriarchy]]&gt;, &lt;[[religion]]&gt;, &lt;[[liberty]]&gt;. Other scholars have made a study of specific uses of ideographs such as &lt;[[family values]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, D. L. (1998).  The rhetoric of &lt;family values&gt;: Scapegoating, utopia, and the privatization of social responsibility.  ''Western Journal of Communication, 62'', 387-419.&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;[[Egalitarianism|equality]]&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Condit, C. M. &amp; Lucaites, J. L. (1993).  ''Crafting quality: America’s Anglo-African word''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have gone beyond the idea that an ideograph must be a verbal symbol and have expanded the notion to include [[photographs]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. L. &amp; Winkler, C. K. (1997). Representative forms and the visual ideograph: The Iwo Jima image in editorial cartoons.  ''Quarterly Journal of Speech, 83'', 289-310.&lt;/ref&gt; and objects represented in [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, M. P. (1996).  The cigarette as representative ideograph in the debate over environmental tobacco smoke.  ''Communication Monographs, 64'', 47-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Immersive design''' describes the activity of a new generation of designers who work inclusively across all story-driven media, from [[film]] and [[interactive media]] to live audience environments. Immersive designers deal simultaneously with virtual and dimensional environments and who and what they contain; and with time-based [[narrative]] and story space.

[[Alex McDowell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://websoles.com/ Design News - Reviewing fmx/08 Which Happened In Stuttgart, Germany - TAXI Design Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313055923/http://websoles.com/ |date=March 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=3631a5a1&amp;atype=news&amp;id=23257 &gt;&gt; VFXWorld / News &lt;&lt;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; coined the phrase 'immersive design' in 2007 in order to frame a new discussion around a design discipline that uniquely addresses story-based media within the context of digital and virtual technologies. Together McDowell and museum director [[Chris Scoates]] co-directed [http://5dconference.com/ 5D | The Future of Immersive Design] conference in Long Beach 2008, laying the groundwork for immersive design to be a distinct [[design|design philosophy]] and thus be subject to wider scrutiny, development and promotion. 5D has since become a forum and community representing a broad range of cross-media designers with its intent based in education, cross-pollination and the development of an expanding knowledge base.

Having only been actively promoted as a [[design|design philosophy]] to be discussed internationally in recent years, immersive design is very much in its infancy, but as a term it has already been appropriated for the purposes of describing design for narrative media and the process of [[Worldbuilding]].  The rapid rise and recognition of transmedia and virtual production emphasises the need for immersive design as the single most fluid cross-media discipline.

==Characteristics==
The immersive design process attempts to describe two simultaneous entwined tasks:
* To design intact worlds that are coherent, have an interior logic, contain history, geography, surface, metaphor, respond to and drive narrative, and allow an audience to be fully immersed in both environment and story. By definition an immersive designer is engaged in the embedding of story into environment, whether for passive or interactive media, in virtual or physical worlds. 
* To put in place a non-linear immersive design process that provides a fully collaborative, often digital and virtual production environment for creators and the work that they are creating.

Many in the industry believe that it is recent developments in technology that have enabled both of these aspects of immersive design to exist; technology consisting of design tools that create a virtual workspace (an intuitive three-dimensional design language and vision) that allows for non-linear workflows, broadening the opportunity of what can be created. However, others argue that both of these aspects have always existed, believing that recent developments in technology have simply allowed these aspects to fit more easily into conventional mainstream production workflow. In relation to this, [[Alex McDowell]] has commented that "It is probably true to say that the designer has always harnessed the best tools available, but that the potential of design tools based in digital technology and allowing for the interaction and manipulation of dimensional space fundamentally advances the craft." {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

One issue within the philosophical discussion of immersive design is how much immersive design should define itself by new technology, and by doing so, whether it narrows down its own possibilities as well as broadening them. [[Alex McDowell]] expanded on this by commenting "What is clear is that technology will keep changing, and that the designer must become increasingly adept and adaptative while remaining focused on the creative intent." {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Industrial management''', as a field of [[business administration]], studies the structure and organization of [[Industry|industrial]] companies. It comprises those fields of business administration that are necessary for the success of companies within the [[manufacturing]] sector and the encompassing services (primarily [[operations management]], [[marketing]], and [[financial management]]).

== Term industrial company ==
The term industrial company is generally applied to a manufacturing firm that – contrary to a crafts business – produces consumer durables in [[Factory|factories]] from raw materials in mass and serial production ([[division of labour]]) using modern manufacturing machines.

== History of industrial management ==
The precursor of the study field industrial management was [[factory]] management. It had a strong similarity with technical [[Business administration|management]] and was geared towards the engineering fields. Parallel to this, there was also a factory management that was more in the area of business economics. This dealt with the organizational questions of factory and [[office administration]] as well as financial [[accounting]], e.g. the factory [[bookkeeping]] and late also [[management accounting]].

The term and the contents of present-day industrial management were strongly influenced by the establishment of MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 (renamed the [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan School of Management]] in 1964 after its benefactor, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., MIT graduate and then-chairman of General Motors). MIT School of Industrial Management set itself the goal of educating the "ideal manager" through this (post)graduate management program.

== Course of studies ==
Graduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by [[corporate governance]], [[corporate social responsibility]] and [[sustainability]] topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.

Most graduate studies in industrial management are full-time [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.

Study programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.-]] programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and [[Vocational university|universities of applied sciences]] in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.

Indian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.

The '''International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History''' (abbreviated '''ICEAACH''', simplified Chinese: 东亚考古与文化历史国际研究中心; traditional Chinese: 東亞考古與文化歷史國際研究中心; pinyin: dōng yà kǎo gǔ yǔ wén huà lì shǐ guó jì yán jiū zhōng xīn) is an internationally recognized hub for [[Transdisciplinarity|trans-disciplinary]] research and [[public outreach]] in [[East Asian archaeology]] and [[East Asian culture|cultural]] heritage. As part of [[Boston University]]’s Department of Archaeology, the primary mission of ICEAACH is to advance the field of [[East Asia]]n archaeology and promote knowledge and understanding of East Asia’s rich cultural heritage.

== History ==
The International Center for East Asian Archaeology and Cultural History (ICEAACH) was established as part of Boston University’s Department of Archaeology in 1999 with a grant from the [[Henry Luce scholar|Henry Luce Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/about/ |title=About ICEAACH » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, ICEAACH has come to occupy a unique position in our field as a [[research institution]] specifically dedicated to promoting East Asian archaeology and cultural heritage. ICEAACH’s facilities, such as a major East Asian archaeology library, experts staff—paired with the resources of the Department of Archaeology, and home to one of the largest archaeology programs in the US—affords students, researchers, and the public opportunities found nowhere else in the United States. With strong ties to leading research institutions across East and Southeast Asia, ICEAACH has become an important [[collaborative hub]] for Western archaeologists pursuing East Asian research, and for East and Southeast Asian scholars and institutions seeking Western resources and expertise, broadening understanding of Asia’s place in [[history of humanity|human history]]. ICEAACH's unique position helps [[archaeologist]]s from around the globe transcend the cultural, political, and organizational barriers that have traditionally hindered research in East Asian archaeology.

== Programs in ICEAACH ==
With support from Boston University, numerous foundations, and a growing group of dedicated private donors, ICEAACH provides a wide range of important resources and programs, including:
* A publicly accessible research library with over 10,000 volumes on East and Southeast Asian archaeology and related fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/library/ |title=The ICEAACH Library » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] programs on Asian archaeology in Boston University’s Department of Archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/archaeology/academics/ |title=Academics &amp;#124; Archaeology Department |publisher=Bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* International research programs, ranging from the emergence of [[agriculture in East Asia]], [[climate change]] and its impact on [[hunter-gatherer]] populations in East Asia, [[ethnicity]] and state formation, and the development of [[bronze metallurgy]] to archaeological applications of remote sensing, [[paleoethnobotanical]] research, the Southeast Asian maritime trade, and heritage management and antiquities legislation.
* [[Survey (archaeology)|Archaeological fieldwork]] across eastern Asia. ICEAACH staff have excavated a 20,000-year-old cave in China with the world’s oldest pottery, and are searching for sites on the [[Yangzi River]] of the first [[rice farmer]]s. The ICEAACH is home to a project exploring the roots of the [[Shang Dynasty]] on the great flood plain of the [[Yellow River]], and discovering the lost Bronze Age [[Sanxingdui|city of Song]]. ICEAACH students have done fieldwork in [[Japan]], [[Mongolia]], [[China]], [[Cambodia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/projects/ |title=Research » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ARC/Base bibliographic database project: ICEAACH is advancing research across the field through our development of the international, collaborative ARC/Base, a new comprehensive, web-based, [[multilingual]] [[bibliographic database]] of Asian archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/projects/arcbase/ |title=The ARC/Base Project » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scholarly communication and the broad dissemination of research results through publications, conferences, and lectures, including the East Asian Archaeology Forum seminar series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/news/east-asian-archaeology-forum-eaaf-lecture-series/ |title=East Asian Archaeology Forum (EAAF) Lecture Series » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Visiting Scholar programs: ICEAACH hosts leading researchers and graduate students from across Asia who come to the center for long- and short-term stays. ICEAACH library facilities and the strength of our department in [[cultural heritage]] management are major draws, as are collaborations with ICEAACH staff and other Archaeology Department faculty and students.
* [[Public outreach]] programs serving a wide range of museum educators, K-12 school teachers, members of the media, and other groups to promote education and awareness about East Asia’s archaeology and cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/asianarc/library/educational-resources/ |title=Educational Resources » International Center for East Asian Archaeology &amp; Cultural History &amp;#124; Boston University |publisher=Bu.edu |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Book and Journal Exchange Program: ICEAACH sends thousands of books and journals on Western archaeology and related fields to academic institutions across Asia who do not have the resources to acquire such items themselves. We also receive in exchange research materials that are difficult to find elsewhere outside of Asia.

IGC country programmes are led by Country Directors working with dedicated Lead Academics, supported by locally based Country Economists. IGC country programme teams are based in the offices of think tanks or government bodies within the relevant country.&lt;ref name="theigc.org"/&gt;

IGC researchers include [[Esther Duflo]], [[Nicholas Bloom]], [[Rachel Glennerster]], [[Lant Pritchett]], [[John Van Reenen (economist)]], [[Nicholas Stern]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/asiaResearchCentre/people/bios/SternNicholas.aspx|title=Professor Lord Nicholas Stern|website = lse.ac.uk|publisher=[[London School of Economics and Political Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Karlan]], [[Edward Miguel]], and [[Maurice Obstfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theigc.org/people/researchers-directory/|title=Researchers directory | website = theigc.org|publisher=The IGC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country programmes==

For each partner country, the IGC supports a team of resident economists who respond to specific policy demands on issues of economic growth. This covers applied economic analysis, long-term research and policy engagement activities, as well as rapid responses to pressing policy questions.

The IGC [[Bangladesh]] programme was established in 2009. It is currently hosted in the [[BRAC University]] Institute of Governance and Development. The programme focuses on five areas of research: i) state effectiveness ii) firm capabilities iii) [[food security]] iv) [[infrastructure]] development, and v) sustainable [[urbanisation]] in Bangladesh. Professor [[Mushfiq Mobarak]] ([[Yale University]] and Professor Fahad Khalil ([[University of Washington]]) serve as Lead Academics for IGC Bangladesh. In 2014, IGC country researcher and former caretaker government adviser, Wahiduddin Mahmud addressed an IGC co-hosted  conference at BRAC University on the issue of dysfunctional governance in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = FE Report | title = Dysfunctional governance remains serious problem | url = http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/12/12/70638 | work = [[The Financial Express (Bangladesh)|The Financial Express]] | location = Bangladesh | date = 12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Ethiopia]] programme was established in 2010, in partnership with the Ethiopian Development Research Institute. IGC Ethiopia focuses on the following research areas: [[industrial development]], [[urbanisation]], developing [[agriculture]], [[youth unemployment]], and state effectiveness. In 2014 IGC Ethiopia jointly sponsored a small grants scheme for junior researchers with the Ethiopian Economics Association. In 2012, a study of youth unemployment in Ethiopia was conducted by the IGC which found that whilst unemployment in urban areas remains widespread, it has declined greatly since 1999. The same study also found that women have not benefited as much as men from reductions in unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Broussar | first1 = Nzinga H. | last2 = Tekleselassie | first2 = Tsegay Gebrekidan  | title = Youth unemployment: Ethiopia country study | url = http://www.theigc.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Broussar-Tekleselassie-2012-Working-Paper.pdf | format = pdf | id = 12/0592 | date = August 2012 |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has also projected revenue receipts for the Internal Revenue Department in Myanmar with its partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = IRD expects Ks 329 bn revenue from oil and gas sector | url = http://mmbusinessnews.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/ird-expects-ks-329-bn-revenue-from-oil.html | work = Elevenmyanmar.com | publisher = [[Eleven Media Group]] via mmbusinessnews.blogspot | location = [[Myanmar]] | date = 22 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Pakistan]] programme was initiated in 2010. it is based within the [[Lahore University of Management Sciences]] and is guided by Dr. Ijaz Nabi (Country Director), Dr. Naved Hamid (Resident Director), Dr. Ali Cheema (Lead Academic) and Dr. Asim Khwaja (Lead Academic). The programme currently focuses on five policy areas for growth – [[macroeconomic]] management, state capabilities, firm capabilities, [[urbanisation]] and [[energy]]. It is currently working closely with the governments of [[Punjab, Pakistan]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] on medium-term economic planning. Research funded by the IGC into the Pakistan football-making industry found that despite supplying firms with cost-cutting technology, take-up rates of the new technology were low due to misaligned incentives between workers and the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://finchannel.com/old/Main_News/B_Schools/130976_Pakistan's_football_factories_score_goal_for_innovation/|title=Pakistan's football factories score goal for innovation|last=News Editor| work =[[The Financial]] |publisher= Intelligence Group |date=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Columbia University | title = Economists use soccer balls to study the adoption of innovative technology | url = http://phys.org/news/2014-06-economists-soccer-balls-technology.html | work = [[Phys.org]] | publisher = Omicron Technology Ltd | date = 25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has also funded research into low tax collection in Punjab, and successfully instituted a 'pay for performance' scheme in Punjab that raised significant tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.brecorder.com/taxation/181:pakistan/1144073:incentives-could-raise-amount-of-tax-collection-new-igc-film/|title=Incentives could raise amount of tax collection: new IGC film|last=Recorder Report|work=[[Business Recorder]]|publisher=[[Business Recorder Group]]|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operates under a Memorandum of Understanding with the [[Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (Rwanda)]] which requires that it “produce demand-driven research outputs that strengthen the evidence base for policy-making relevant to Rwanda’s long-run growth”, with a focus on research and analysis under four main thematic areas: [[agriculture]], [[infrastructure]], [[macroeconomic policy]] and [[finance]], and [[trade]] and [[industry]]. The IGC participated in a Rwanda Research Roundtable in 2014 as part of its partnership with the Rwandan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = IGIHE Reporter | title= Rwanda advised to use evidences in formulating education policy |url= http://en.igihe.com/news/rwanda-advised-to-use-evidences-in-formulating.html |work=IGIHE |publisher=IGIHE Ltd | date = 28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A joint NAEB-IGC study on the Rwandan coffee sector found that Rwandan export revenues are affected by coffee washing stations operating below capacity, with the majority of the washing stations lacking funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Tumwebaze | first = Peterson |url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-02-25/186325/|title=Half of coffee washing stations operate below capacity- report |work=[[The New Times (Rwanda)|The New Times]]| location = Rwanda | date = 25 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Sierra Leone]] programme is based at the Centre of Policy Studies at the [[University of Sierra Leone]]. Its main areas of research are state capabilities, [[agriculture]], and [[governance]]. Research conducted by the IGC has found that the number of rice traders in some Ebola-hit areas of Sierra Leone has fallen by nearly 70% between 2012 and late 2014. The economic consequences of Ebola in Sierra Leone are continuing to be monitored by the IGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Staff writer|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30088818|title=Ebola outbreak: latest news in 15 seconds|work=[[BBC News]] | publisher = [[BBC]] |date= 17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Glennerster |first= Rachel |url=http://theconversation.com/how-to-plan-for-a-post-ebola-west-africa-33433|title=How to plan for a post-Ebola West Africa |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | publisher = The Conversation Trust |date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[South Sudan]] programme opened in August 2012. The programme is structured around three main pillars: responding to [[crisis]], [[natural resource management]], and addressing [[Remote and isolated community|isolation]], [[Agricultural diversification|diversification]], and [[job creation]]. The organization has published several studies regarding the oil sector in South Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Managing oil savings |url=http://www.theigc.org/project/managing-oil-savings/ | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theigc.org/project/institutions-and-the-oil-sector-in-south-sudan/|title=Institutions and the oil sector in South Sudan | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Tanzania]] programme was established in 2008 – the first in-country programme of the IGC. The Tanzania programme is headed by Country Director Dr. John Page ([[Brookings Institution]]), Lead Academic Professor Chris Adam ([[University of Oxford]]) and Senior Country Research and Policy Fellow Dr. Pantaleo Kessy ([[Bank of Tanzania]]). IGC Tanzania's office is hosted by the [[Bank of Tanzania]], and has so far focused on researching [[poverty reduction]], structural transformation, preparation for [[monetary union]], [[inflation]] and fiscal strategy. Other areas of research include firm capabilities, [[urbanisation]], and [[energy]]. Professor John Sutton, an IGC researcher, delivered the Gilman Rutihinda Memorial Lecture at the Bank of Tanzania and urged the country to integrate local firms into gas multinational supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kiishweko | first = Orton |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201406120207.html|title=Tanzania: Forum demands for more local content in gas industry |work=[[AllAfrica.com]] | publisher = AllAfrica Global Media | date = 12 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theigc.org/event/public-lecture-local-content-and-tanzanias-industrial-development-professor-john-sutton/|title=Public lecture: Local content and Tanzania’s industrial development (Professor John Sutton) | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Uganda]] programme has been hosted at the [[Bank of Uganda]] since it opened in 2012. Its priority areas include [[natural resource management]] and [[monetary policy]], the [[regional integration]] process, raising [[income]] and [[inclusive growth]]. IGC Uganda research has included analysis of integration of economic activity within the [[East African Community]], the evolution of [[public expenditure]] priorities in light of [[natural resource]] revenues, and the options and strategies for financing fiscal deficits within the country. IGC research showed that eight out of ten Rwandan farmers in the study are not willing to adopt fertilisers as they are perceived as low quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barungi | first = Mildred |title=Substandard inputs are hindering technology adoption |url=http://www.observer.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=35571 |work =[[The Observer (Uganda)|The Observer]]|publisher=Observer Media Ltd | location = Uganda | date = 18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC [[Zambia]] programme started in 2010. It established its country office in 2011, located at the Zambian Institute for Policy Analysis and Research (ZIPAR). The IGC has collaborated with the Zambian Ministry of Health to test recruitment strategies for health workers in rural areas, which have now been implemented and scaled up by the Zambian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = The Financial | title = Improving the recruitment of community health workers in Zambia |url= http://finchannel.com/index.php/world/georgian-news/health-beauty/item/37803- | work =[[The Financial]] |publisher= Intelligence Group |date= 16 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGC has also engaged with the Zambia Revenue Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Online user | title = ZRA collects K27m in taxes | url = https://www.daily-mail.co.zm/?p=18311 | work = [[Zambia Daily Mail]] | publisher = [[Government of Zambia]] | date = 26 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research programmes==

IGC research is focused within four research themes: state, firms, [[cities]], and [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theigc.org/research-themes/ |title= Research themes | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC '''state''' research programme looks at the role of the public sector in economic development. Within the State research theme, the IGC has worked on 364 projects and organised 33 events.&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.theigc.org/publication/our-work/ | title = Our work | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The state research programme is headed by Professor [[Oriana Bandiera]] ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), Professor Henrik Kleven ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), Professor Eliana La Ferrera ([[Bocconi University]]), and Professor Gerard Padro i Miquel ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]).

One IGC state project run by [[Raj Chetty]] ([[Harvard University]]), Nasiruddin Ahmed ([[BRAC University]]), Ghulam Hossain (Chairman of the Pakistani [[National Board of Revenue]]), Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak ([[Yale University]]), Aminur Rahman ([[University of Virginia]]), and Monica Singhal ([[Harvard University]]) looked at how social recognition can be used to increase value-added tax revenue in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="mushfiqmobarak"&gt;{{cite web | last = Mobarak | first = Mushfiq |title=Tax compliance and social acclaim |url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/XwvGdsQDgePOLD6SFGXSTI/Tax-compliance-and-social-acclaim.html |work= [[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] | publisher = [[HT Media]] | location = India | date = 15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers sent letters to inform firms that their tax compliance behaviour would be shared with other firms in their cluster in a subsequent letter. They hypothesised that this intervention may spur voluntary tax compliance by allowing firms to be recognised by their neighbours and peers. They found that in areas of low tax compliance, where less than 15% of firms paid any VAT the previous year (in 2012), the peer recognition treatment had no significant effect on tax payment rates. However, in areas where at least 15% of firms had paid VAT in 2012, firms who received the peer recognition treatment were 3.4 percentage points more likely to make a payment in the post-intervention period&lt;ref name="mushfiqmobarak"/&gt;

The IGC '''firms''' research programme seeks to understand the forces that determine the productivity of firms. Within the Firms research theme, the IGC has worked on 293 projects and organised 25 events.&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt; The IGC’s Firms research programme is headed by Professor [[Nicholas Bloom]] ([[Stanford University]]), Professor Tavneet Suri ([[MIT Sloan School of Management]]), Professor Christopher Udry ([[Yale University]]), Professor Eric Verhoogen ([[Columbia University]]), Dr Greg Fischer ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]), Professor Imran Rasul ([[University College London]]), Professor Andres Rodriguez-Clare ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), and Professor Christopher Woodruff ([[University of Warwick]]).&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt;

An IGC firms project in [[Sialkot]], [[Pakistan]], one of the world’s top producers of footballs, found that employees in factories producing footballs resisted a new technology that limited waste and improved efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Cronin | first = Brenda | title = How automation fell flat in the world’s soccer-ball capital |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/04/28/how-automation-fell-flat-in-the-worlds-soccer-ball-capital/ |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] | publisher = [[News Corp]] | date = 28 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found a new way to cut the footballs' pentagon panels from sheets of [[rexine]], and they provided football manufacturers with a new cutting pattern and new cutting tools to implement the new design.&lt;ref name="newseditor"&gt;{{cite news |last = News Editor | url= http://finchannel.com/old/Main_News/B_Schools/130976_Pakistan%27s_football_factories_score_goal_for_innovation/|title= Pakistan's football factories score goal for innovation | work =[[The Financial]] |publisher= Intelligence Group | date = 30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While one of the largest companies in the city quickly adopted the new technology for almost all its production, few others followed suit. Based on further investigation, the researchers conjectured that take-up was slow because employees were resisting the new technology. Cutters were paid per piece, with no incentive to reduce waste, and were concerned that the new die would slow them down and reduce their incomes.&lt;ref name="newseditor"/&gt;

The IGC '''[[cities]]''' research programme explores the challenges of urbanisation in the developing world and the potential of cities to act as drivers of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bale | first = Jo |title=From cities to states |url= http://www.lse.ac.uk/alumni/LSEConnect/articlesSummer2014/fromCitiesToStates.aspx | website = lse.ac.uk | publisher = [[London School of Economics]] | date = Summer 2014 | quote = Jonathan Leape, new director of the International Growth Centre at LSE, explains the four research themes that will help power development in 15 countries across the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGC’s cities research programme is led by [[Edward Glaeser]] ([[Harvard University]]) and Gharad Bryan ([[London School of Economics and Political Science]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/rappaport/events-and-news/audio-and-video-clips/developing-world-cities-promise-and-challenge|title=Developing world cities: promise and challenge | website = hks.harvard.edu |publisher= [[Harvard Kennedy School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45 projects and nine events have been funded through the IGC cities programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theigc.org/research-themes/cities/|title=Cities | website = theigc.org |publisher=The IGC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IGC '''[[energy]]''' research programme analyses the role that energy plays in shaping the growth of developing countries. Within the Energy research theme, the IGC has worked on 55 projects and organised four events.&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt; The energy programme is headed by Professor [[Michael Greenstone]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]) and Professor Nicholas Ryan ([[Yale University]]).&lt;ref name="theigc.org1"/&gt;

==Events==

The IGC holds a number of [http://www.theigc.org/events/ events] throughout the year with the purpose of discussing a wide range of economic growth-related issues, sharing the findings of its research, and stimulating policy debates within the IGC’s four thematic focus areas: cities, energy, state effectiveness, and firms.

IGC events focus on combining research and policy and feature speakers from IGC‘s network of researchers and policymakers from Africa and South Asia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42956">An [[architectural style]] is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable and historically identifiable.  A style may include such elements as [[wikt:form|form]], method of [[construction]], [[building materials]], and regional character.  Most [[architecture]] can be classified as a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society and are documented in the subject of [[architectural history]]. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. A style may also spread through [[colonialism]], either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. After a style has gone out of fashion, there are often revivals and re-interpretations. For instance, [[classicism]] has been revived many times and found new life as [[neoclassicism]]. Each time it is revived, it is different.

[[Vernacular architecture]] works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes little account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded by new technology and national building standards.

==Chronology of styles==
{{Expand list|date=March 2011}}

===Prehistoric===
Early [[civilizations]] developed, often independently, in scattered locations around the globe. The architecture was often a mixture of styles in timber cut from local forests and stone hewn from local rocks. Most of the timber has gone, although the earthworks remain. Impressively, massive stone structures have survived for years.

===The Dark Ages===
The European "Dark Ages" are generally taken to run from the end of the [[Roman Empire]], around 400 AD, to around 1000 AD. Relatively little is known of this period, but Christianity (spread by the Romans) was already making a significant impact on European culture, and the Romans left a technological and social legacy.

===Medieval Europe===
The dominance of the Church over everyday life was expressed in grand spiritual designs which emphasized piety and sobriety. The Romanesque style was simple and austere. The Gothic style heightened the effect with heavenly spires, pointed arches and religious carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zyHqAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA75 Robert Stuart (1854), ''Cyclopedia of architecture: historical, descriptive, typographical, decorative, theoretical and mechanical, alphabetically arranged, familiarly explained, and adapted to the comprehension of workmen'', A.

===The Renaissance and its successors===

1425-1660. The Renaissance began in Italy and spread through Europe, rebelling against the all-powerful Church, by placing Man at the centre of his world instead of God.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Leinwand, ''The pageant of world history'', Prentice-Hall, 1990, page 330&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic spires and pointed arches were replaced by classical domes and rounded arches, with comfortable spaces and entertaining details, in a celebration of humanity. The Baroque style was a florid development of this 200 years later, largely by the Catholic Church to restate its religious values.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7jzT0qcJu1MC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Jackson J.

===Neoclassicism===
1720-1837 and onward. A time often depicted as a rural idyll by the great painters, but in fact was a hive of early industrial activity, with small kilns and workshops springing up wherever materials could be mined or manufactured. After the Renaissance, neoclassical forms were developed and refined into new styles for public buildings and the gentry.

===Revivalism and Orientalism===
Late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Victorian Era was a time of giant leaps forward in technology and society, such as iron bridges, aqueducts, sewer systems, roads, canals, trains, and factories. As engineers, inventors, and businessmen they reshaped much of the British Empire, including the UK, India, Australia, South Africa, and Canada, and influenced Europe and the United States. Architecturally, they were revivalists who modified old styles to suit new purposes.

===Modernism and other styles contemporary with modernism===
1880 onwards. The Industrial Revolution had brought steel, plate glass, and mass-produced components. These enabled a brave new world of bold structural frames, with clean lines and plain or shiny surfaces. In the early stages, a popular motto was "[[Ornament and Crime|decoration is a crime]]". In the [[Eastern Bloc]] the Communists rejected the [[Western Bloc]]'s 'decadent' ways, and modernism developed in a markedly more bureaucratic, sombre, and monumental fashion.

The following list includes societies that have been identified as [[matrilineal]] or [[matrilocal]] in ethnographic literature.

"Matrilineal" means property is passed down through the maternal line on the death of the mother, not that of the father.

The Akans of Ghana, West Africa, are matrlineals. Akans are the largest ethnic group in Ghana. They are made of the Akims, Asantes, Fantis, Akuapims, Kwahus, Denkyiras, Brongs, Akwamus, Krachis etc.

"Matrilocal" means new families are established in proximity to the brides' extended family of origin, not that of the groom.

Note: ''separate'' in the marriage column refers to the practice of husbands and wives living in separate locations, often informally called ''[[walking marriage]]s''. See the articles for the specific cultures that practice this for further description.

In a number of islands, including Lesbos, Lemnos, Naxos, and Kos, matrilineal succession to real property was the rule at the end of the 18th century A.D. The facts were reported by an English traveller, John Hawkins, who wrote: "In the large number of the islands, the eldest daughter takes as her inheritance a portion of the family house, together with its furniture, and one third of the share of the maternal property, which in reality in most of these cases constitutes the chief means of subsistence; the other daughters, when they marry off in succession, are likewise entitled to (a portion of) the family house and the same share of whatever property remains. These observations were applicable to the islands of Mytilin (Lesbos), Lemnos, Scopelo, Skyros, Syra, Zea Ipsera, Myconi, Paros, Naxia, Siphno, Santorini and Cos, where I have either collected my information in person or had obtained it through others."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mediated quasi-interaction''' is a concept in [[communication science]] that describes a monological interaction between people, which is oriented towards an indefinite range of potential recipients.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson,1995&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a fundamental asymmetry between producers and receivers.&lt;ref name="DavidHesmondhalgh"&gt;David Hesmondhalgh,2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Mediated Quasi-Interaction are television, radio and newspapers and other forms of mass media.

== History ==

The concept was developed by sociologist [[John Brookshire Thompson]], a professor at the [[University of Cambridge]] and a fellow of [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]. The concept is first documented in his book “The Rise of Mediated Interaction”, which was published in 1995 in Cambridge, UK. Thompson developed a [[conceptual framework]] for the analysis of the forms of action and interaction created by the media. He wanted to focus the types of interactional situation created by the [[mass media]].&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt; He also wanted the analytical framework to examine some of the interactional features of the social relationships established by the media.&lt;ref name="Thompson_a"&gt;Thompson 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

He created the concept in part of his theory of interaction. The 3 steps theory consisted of Face-to-Face interaction, Mediated Interaction and Mediated Quasi-Interaction. Face-to- people share time and space, since they are co-present and mediated interaction the sending of the message and its reception are separated in time and space.&lt;ref name="Wouters"&gt;Wouters,2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic premises and approach ==

Mediated Quasi-interaction is monologicial in character and involves the production of symbolic forms for an indefinite range of potential recipients. Mediated Quasi-Interaction creates a certain kind of social situation in which individuals are linked together in a process of communication and symbolic exchange. It is a structured situation in which some individuals are engaged primarily in producing symbolic forms for others who are not physically present, while others are involved primarily in receiving symbolic forms produced to whom they cannot respond, but with whom they can form bonds of friendship, affection or loyalty.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated quasi-interaction is based on social relations established by media of mass communications.&lt;ref name="TerhiRantanen"&gt;Terhi Rantanen,2005&lt;/ref&gt; With mass media being impossible to be genuine interactivity, Mediated quasi-interaction is simulated interaction. It is typical for the mass media to try to simulate [[interpersonal communication]] and to personalize their communication (ex. Call-ins).&lt;ref name="PekkaIsotalus"&gt;Pekka Isotalus,1998&lt;/ref&gt; Another focus of Mediated Quasi-Interaction is also on its space-time constitution. It is described as a separation of contexts with extended availability in time and space.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

Mediated Quasi-Interaction can also be combined with other interaction such as [[dyadic communication|face-to-face]]. For example, people can sit in a room together and have a discussion while they are watching television. In a similar relation, a television program may involve face to face interaction with a panel and an audience, although the program remains primarily a form Mediated Quasi-Interaction.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

The '''Miroslav Krleža Institute of Lexicography''' ({{lang-hr|Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža}} or '''LZMK''') is [[Croatia]]'s national [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] institution. Based in [[Zagreb]], it was originally established in 1950 as the national lexicographical institute of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. It was renamed after the Croatian writer and its founder [[Miroslav Krleža]] in 1983.

== History ==

The institute was founded in 1950 as the Lexicographical Institute of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia (''Leksikografski zavod FNRJ'') and was renamed the '''Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute''' (''Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod'', '''''JLZ''''') in 1964.

Its longtime director was [[Miroslav Krleža]], with [[Mate Ujević]] as the chief editor. It was based in [[Zagreb]], with branches in [[Ljubljana]] and [[Belgrade]].

After Krleža's death in 1981, the institute was renamed as the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute "Miroslav Krleža" (''Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod "Miroslav Krleža"'').

Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], it was renamed to its current name in 1991, becoming the national lexicographical institute of [[Croatia]], situated in 26 [[Frankopan]] Street of Zagreb.

== Publications ==
The institute employs numerous scientists in many areas of expertise and issues general and specific [[reference work]]s as well as [[map]]s and [[travel guide]]s. Some notable works started or completed by the institute:

* ''[[Encyclopedia of Yugoslavia]]'' (''Enciklopedija Jugoslavije'') – 1st ed. in 8 volumes (1955–71); 2nd ed. with only 6 out of the planned 12 volumes released (1980–90)

'''Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery''' ('''NOMAD''') is a 3-channel [[spectrometer]] on board the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) launched to [[Mars]] orbit on 14 March 2016.

NOMAD is designed to perform high-sensitivity orbital identification of atmospheric components, concentration and temperature, their sources, loss, and cycles. It measures the sunlight reflected from the surface and atmosphere of Mars, and it analyses its wavelength [[spectrum]] to identify the components of the [[Martian atmosphere]] that may suggest a [[biosignature|biological source]].  The Principal Investigator is Ann Carine Vandaele, from the [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]], Belgium.

==Overview==

NOMAD is one of four science instruments on board the European ExoMars TGO orbiter. This spectrometer consists of three separate channels: solar occultation (SO), limb nadir and occultation (LNO), and ultraviolet and visible spectrometer (UVIS). The first two channels work in the [[infrared]] (2.2 to 4.3 μm); the third channel (UVIS) works in the UV-visible range (0.2 to 0.65 μm), which is able to measure [[ozone]], [[sulphuric acid]], and perform aerosol studies.&lt;ref name='IVRA'&gt;[http://mars.aeronomie.be/en/exomars/nomad.htm ExoMars NOMAD instrument.] [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]]. Accessed: 13 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NOMAD home'/&gt; Measurements are carried out during solar [[occultation]], i.e. the instrument points toward the sunset as the orbiter moves toward or away the dark side of Mars. It also measures in [[nadir]] mode, i.e. looking directly at the sunlight reflected from the surface and atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name='NOMAD home'&gt; [http://exploration.esa.int/mars/48523-trace-gas-orbiter-instruments/?fbodylongid=2187 ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter Instruments - NOMAD.] [[European Space Agency]]. 4 November 2016.

==Objectives==

NADIR will map the composition and distribution of Mars' atmospheric trace gases and [[isotope]]s in unprecedented detail. The specific objectives are: &lt;ref&gt;[https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=2016-017A-02 Nadir and Occultation for Mars Discovery (NOMAD)]. NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive. Accessed: 18 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*search for signs of past or present [[life on Mars]].
*investigate how the water and geochemical environment varies
*investigate Martian atmospheric trace gases and their sources.
*study the surface environment and identify hazards to future [[Human mission to Mars|crewed missions to Mars]].
*investigate the planet subsurface and deep interior to better understand the evolution and [[planetary habitability|habitability]] of Mars.

To achieve these objectives, NOMAD covers a spectral region from UV, visible, and infrared that that reveals the signatures of the following molecules and isotopologues: 
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;OCO, &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;OCO, C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), CO (including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CO, C&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (including [[Semiheavy water|HDO]]), NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, [[ozone|O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] (including &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D), C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO, HCN, OCS, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HCl, HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S.&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt;

In particular, the detection of the different methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) isotopologues (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;D) will be key to help determine whether they are of geological ([[Serpentinite|serpentinisation]], [[clathrate]]s) or a biological source.&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt; In addition, NOMAD can detect formaldehyde ([[Formaldehyde|{{chem|H|2|CO}}]]) which is a photochemical product of methane, as well as nitrous oxide ([[Nitrous oxide|{{chem|N|2|O}}]]) and hydrogen sulfide ([[Hydrogen sulfide|{{chem|H|2|S}}]]) which are potential atmospheric [[biosignature]]s.&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt; SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a gas related to volcanism may reveal present or recent [[Volcanism on Mars|volcanic activity on Mars]].&lt;ref name='Patel 2014'/&gt;

The '''National Agrarian University''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Universidad Nacional Agraria'', '''UNA''') is a public university in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org.ve/docs/wrt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2542:nicaragua&amp;catid=210&amp;Itemid=757 UNESCO: Lista de universidades en Nicaragua]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.edu.ni/index.php/universidades?pid=56&amp;sid=62:Universidad-Nacional-Agraria-UNA Universities members of the CNU]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Agrarian University has its roots in the National School of Agriculture ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Escuela Nacional de Agricultura''), established on May 25, 1917. It was incorporated in 1986, by presidential decree, into the [[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]] as the Institute of Agricultural Sciences (ISCA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.una.edu.ni/index.php/institucional/resena-historica Reseña histórica de la UNA]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the ISCA faculty at the National University became an independent entity; the National Agrarian University, with four faculties:

* Faculty of Agronomy (FAGRO)
* Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment (FARENA)
* Faculty of Distance Education and Rural Development (FED-DR)
* Faculty of Animal Science (FACA)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24912">'''New literacies''' generally are new forms of [[literacy]] made possible by [[digital technology]] developments, although new literacies do not necessarily have to involve use of digital technologies to be recognized as such. The term "new literacies" itself is relatively new within the field of literacy studies (the first documented mention of it in an academic article title dates to 1993 in a text by David Buckingham).&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, D. (1993) Towards new literacies, information technology, English and media education. ''The English and Media Magazine,'' Summer, pp. 20–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Its definition remains open, with new literacies being conceptualized in different ways by different groups of scholars.

For example, one group of scholars argues that literacy is now [[deictic]], and see it as continually and rapidly changing as new technologies appear and new social practices for literacy emerge. (Leu, 2000). This group aims at developing a single, overarching theory to help explain new literacies (see, for example, Leu, O'Byrne, Zawilinski, McVerry, &amp; Everett-Cacopardo, 2009; see also, below). This orientation towards new literacies is largely psycholinguistic in nature. Other groups of scholars follow a more sociocultural orientation that focuses on literacy as a social practice, which emphasizes the role of literacy with a range of socially patterned and goal-directed ways of getting things done in the world (see, for example, Gee &amp; Hayes, 2012; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2011; Kalantzis and Cope 2011).

Accompanying the varying conceptualizations of new literacies, there are a range of terms used by different researchers when referring to new literacies, including ''21st century literacies'', ''internet literacies'', ''[[digital literacy|digital literacies]]'', ''new [[Media literacy|media literacies]]'', ''multiliteracies'', ''[[information literacy]]'', ''ICT literacies'', and ''[[computer literacy]]''. In the ''Handbook of New Literacies Research'', Coiro, [[Michele Knobel|Knobel]], [[Colin Lankshear|Lankshear]], and Leu (2008) note that all these terms "are used to refer to phenomena we would see as falling broadly under a new literacies umbrella" (pg. 10).&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (2008). Central issues in new literacies and new literacies research. In J. Coiro, M. Knobel, C. Lankshear, &amp; D. J. Leu (Eds.), ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 1–22). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly recognized examples of new literacies include such practices as [[instant messaging]], [[blog]]ging, maintaining a [[website]], participating in online [[Social network service|social networking]] spaces, creating and sharing [[music video]]s, [[podcast]]ing and videocasting, photoshopping images and [[photo sharing]], [[E-mail|emailing]], shopping online, [[digital storytelling]], participating in [[online discussion]] lists, emailing and using [[online chat]], conducting and collating online searches, reading, writing and commenting on [[fan fiction]], collaborating on and writing encyclopedic wikis, processing and evaluating online information, creating and sharing [[Mashup (digital)|digital mashups]], etc. (see: Black, 2008; Coiro, 2003; Gee, 2007; Hunter, 2014; Jenkins, 2006; Kist, 2007; Lankshear &amp; Knobel, 2006; Lessig, 2005; Leu, et al. 2004; Prensky, 2006).

==Definitions: at least two 'camps'==
The field of new literacies is characterized by two theoretically distinct approaches that overlap to some extent. One is informed by cognitive and language processing theories such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[psycholinguistics]], [[Schema (psychology)|schema theory]], [[metacognition]], [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]], and other similar theories. This orientation includes a particular focus on examining the cognitive and social processes involved in comprehending online or digital texts (see for example: Leu, 2001; [http://www.readingonline.org/newliteracies/leu/ Leu, Kinzer, Coiro, &amp; Cammack, 2004]; Coiro, 2003; Coiro &amp; Dobler, 2007). Donald Leu, a prominent researcher in the field of new literacies, has outlined four defining characteristics of new literacies, according to a largely [[Psycholinguistics|psycholinguistic orientation]] (see: Leu et al., 2007). First, new technologies (such as the internet) and the novel literacy tasks that pertain to these new technologies require new skills and strategies to effectively use them. Second, new literacies are a critical component of full participation—civic, economic, and personal—in our increasingly global society. A third component to this approach is new literacies are ''deictic''—that is, they change regularly as new technology emerges and older technologies fade away. With this in mind, "what may be important in reading instruction and literacy education is not to teach any single set of new literacies, but rather to teach students how to learn continuously new literacies that will appear during their lifetime."&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} Finally, new literacies are "multiple, multimodal, and multifaceted," and as such, multiple points of view will be most beneficial in attempting to comprehensively analyze them.&lt;ref name=Leu/&gt;{{rp|43}} This orientation makes a distinction between "New Literacies" and "new literacies" theories. Lower case theories are better able to keep up with the rapidly changing nature of literacy in a deictic world since they are closer to the specific types of changes that are taking place and interest those who study them within a particular heuristic. Lower case theories also permit the field to maximize the lenses that are used and the technologies and contexts that are studied. This position argues that every scholar who studies new literacy issues is generating important insights for everyone else, even if they do not share a particular lens, technology, or context; and that this requires a second level of theorising. New Literacies (capitalized), it is argued, is a broader, more inclusive concept, and includes common findings emerging across multiple, lower case theories.  New Literacies theory benefits from work taking place in the multiple, lower case dimensions of new literacies by looking for what appear to be the most common and consistent patterns being found in lower case theories and lines of research. This approach permits everyone to fully explore their unique, lowercase perspective of new literacies, allowing scholars to maintain close focus on many different aspects of the rapidly shifting landscape of literacy during a period of rapid change.  At the same time, each also benefits from expanding their understanding of other, lowercase, new literacies perspectives. By assuming change in the model, everyone is open to a continuously changing definition of literacy, based on the most recent data that emerges consistently, across multiple perspectives, disciplines, and research traditions. Moreover, areas in which alternative findings emerge are identified, enabling each to be studied again, from multiple perspectives.  From this process, common patterns emerge and are included in a broader, common, New Literacies theory. From this orientation, proponents argue, this process enables a particular theorization of New Literacies to keep up with consistent elements that will always define literacy on the Internet while it also informs each of the lower case theories of new literacies with patterns that are being regularly found by others.

The second approach to studying new literacies is overtly grounded in a focus on social practices. According to [[Colin Lankshear]] and [[Michele Knobel]] from this "social practice" perspectives, "new literacies" can refer to "new socially recognized ways of generating, communicating and negotiating meaningful content through the medium of encoded texts within contexts of participation in [[Discourse]]s (or, as members of Discourses) ".&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). pg. 65. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective "new" refers to the presence of two dominant features of contemporary [[literacy]] practices. The first is the use of digital technologies as the means of producing, sharing, accessing and interacting with meaningful content. New literacies typically involve screens and pixels rather than paper and type, and digital code (that renders texts as image, sound, conventional text, and any combination of these within a single process) rather than material print. The second defining feature of new literacies is their highly collaborative, distributed, and participatory nature, as expressions of what [[Henry Jenkins]]&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2006). Fans, bloggers and gamers: Exploring participatory culture. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; calls engagement in [[participatory culture]], and Lankshear and Knobel&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2006). New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning  (2nd ed.). New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to as a distinctive ''ethos''.

==Research in new literacies==
Research within the field of new literacies is also diverse. A wide range of topics and issues are focused upon, and a broad range of methodologies are used.

===Online research and comprehension===
One aspect of new literacies that has attracted researchers' attention is school-age children's online research and comprehension. Specifically, researchers are interested in finding the answers to questions such as how reading online differs from traditional print-based reading. Donald Leu, Julie Coiro, Jill Castek, Laurie Henry, and others attempt to understand how students become adept at reading online to learn and how students acquire the necessary skills, strategies, and dispositions required to do so. Initial work in this area referred to online reading comprehension&lt;ref name=Leu&gt;Leu, D. J., &amp; Zawilinski, L., Castek, J., Banerjee, M., Housand, B. C., Liu, Y., &amp; O'Neil, M. (2007). What is new About the new literacies of online reading comprehension?. In Secondary School Literacy: What Research Reveals for Classroom Practice (Chapter 3, pp. 37–68). Retrieved from http://teachers.westport.k12.ct.us/ITL/wkspmaterials/NCTE%20chapter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, the construct "online research and comprehension" is being used since this more precisely describes the type of reading being described in their work.&lt;ref name=Leu2&gt;Leu, D. J., Kinzer, C. K., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Henry, L. A. (2013). New literacies: A dual level theory of the changing nature of literacy, instruction, and assessment. In Alvermann, D.E., Unrau, N.J., &amp; Ruddell, R.B. (Eds.). (2013). Theoretical models and processes of reading (6th ed.). (pp. 1150-1181). Newark, DE: International Reading Association. Available at: http://www.reading.org/Libraries/books/IRA-710-chapter42.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leu and colleagues, the new literacies of online research and comprehension is a process of problem-based inquiry using information on the Internet. It includes the skills, strategies, dispositions, and social practices that take place as we read online information to learn and is based around five practices: "At least five processing practices occur during online research and comprehension: (1) reading to identify important questions, (2) reading to locate information, (3) reading to evaluate information critically, (4) reading to synthesize information, and (5) reading to communicate information. Within these five practices reside the skills, strategies, and dispositions that are distinctive to online reading comprehension as well as to others that are also important for offline reading comprehension (Leu, Reinking, et al., 2007)."&lt;ref name=Leu2/&gt;{{rp|1164}}

===Online fan fiction and adolescents===
Recent research in the field of new literacies has focused on [[fan fiction]] on the internet, especially those stories published online by adolescents (see for example: Black, 2008; Thomas, 2007; Jenkins, 2006). Online fan fiction websites, such as [[FanFiction.Net]], are spaces where fans of all ages, but especially adolescents and younger school-age fans, are able to use these new [[information and communication technologies]] (ICTs) to write and craft fictional stories based on their favorite characters in popular media such as movies, television, and graphic novels. Adolescents are participating more and more on these kinds of sites, not only engaging with "pop culture and media, but also with a broad array of literate activities that are aligned with many school-based literacy practices"&lt;ref&gt;Black, R. W. (2007). Digital design: English language learners and reader reviews in online fiction. In M. Knobel &amp; C. Lankshear (Eds.), ''A New Literacies Sampler,'' pp. 115–136. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of course, adults are just as able to spend time in such online environments—and they do. However, it is interesting to consider that young people were born into a digitally rich world, and thus could be seen as "digital natives", and therefore interact with the online environment in a fundamentally distinct way than an older generation of people, so-called "digital immigrants".&lt;ref name=Hansford&gt;Adlington, R., &amp; Hansford, D. (2009). Digital spaces and young people's online authoring: Challenges for teachers. ''Australian journal of language and literacy, 32''(1, 2).&lt;/ref&gt; As digital natives, adolescents "use the online world to share, evaluate, create, report and program with each other differently to digital immigrants," and they engage easily and readily with new digital technologies such as instant messaging, file sharing songs and videos, and post all kinds of 'texts', stories, photos, and videos among them.&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; A central characteristic of digital natives is their "desire to create."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt; Digital natives are engaged in "programming to some extent, whether it be by including a piece of HTML code that personalizes a MySpace page or creating a Flash animation. They are creating web pages, blogs, avatars and worlds; and, in stark contrast to digital immigrants, digital natives readily report and share their ideas."&lt;ref name=Hansford/&gt;

===Video games===
[[James Paul Gee]] described [[Video game|video gaming]] as a new literacy "in virtue of the ways game design involves a multimodal code comprising images, actions, words, sounds, and movements that players interpret according to gaming conventions".&lt;ref&gt;Coiro, J., Knobel, M., Lankshear, C., &amp; Leu, D. J. (Eds.) (2008). ''Handbook of new literacies research'' (pp. 251). New York: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gee notes that game players participate in their game's world as a form of social practice, especially in real-time [[Strategy video game|strategy games]] in which players can compete with each other to build on land masses, for instance, and in which they can shape and convey their virtual identities as a certain kind of strategist. Video games continue to use new digital technologies to create the symbols players interpret to encode and decode the meanings that constitute the game.&lt;ref&gt;Gee, J. P. (2008). ''What video games have to teach us about learning and literacy, revised and updated''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Many ways in which students learn literacies, increasingly, are happening outside of school rather than inside of school.

Other researchers have expanded the body of knowledge about video games as a new literacy, particularly as they relate to classroom learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerber|first=H. R.|title=From the FPS to the RPG: Using Video Games to encourage reading YAL|journal=The ALAN Review|year=2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Squire&gt;{{cite book|last=Squire|first=Kurt|title=Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age|year=2011|publisher=Teachers College Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (see for example: Lacasa, Martinez, &amp; Mendez, 2008; Sanford &amp; Madill, 2007). In one study,&lt;ref name=Lacasa&gt;Lacasa, P., Martinez, R., &amp; Mendez, L. (2008). Developing new literacies using commercial videogames as educational tools. ''Linguistics and Education, 19.''&lt;/ref&gt; researchers examined how video games, supported by discussions and dramatic performances in the classroom, can contribute to the development of narrative thought as demonstrated in written compositions in various contexts. Namely, the researchers engaged primary school children in activities designed to teach them to tell, play out, and write stories based on the most popular video game in their classroom, ''[[Tomb Raider]]''. Although it was a challenging process at times, researchers discovered that the use of new digital media such as video games actually "complements the use of other written or audiovisual methods [in the classroom] and permits the development of multiple literacies in the classroom."&lt;ref name=Lacasa/&gt;{{rp|103}}

==The classroom==
It has become clear to many researchers in the field that new literacies research has important implications for the classroom. Kist (2007), for example, observes how new literacies can be used in classroom settings—from the use of rap music to anime to digital storytelling, there are already instances of teachers attempting to blend new literacies with traditional literacy practices in the classroom.&lt;ref name=Kist&gt;Kist, W. (2007). Basement new literacies: Dialogue with a first-year teacher. ''English Journal, 97''(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Kist asks: "Can new literacies indeed 'fit' into how we currently 'do' school?" Kist notes that "the new literacies instruction that does exist often comes only out of the fortitude of lonely pioneers of new literacies."&lt;ref name=Kist/&gt;{{rp|44}}

Knobel and Lankshear (2011) argue that if educators and prospective teachers engage in blogging, or participate in "[[affinity spaces]]" devoted to practices like fan fiction, video game-playing, music and video remixing, photosharing, and the like, they will better understand how new literacies can better be integrated into worthwhile classroom learning.&lt;ref&gt;Lankshear, C., &amp; Knobel, M. (2011). ''New literacies: Everyday practices &amp; classroom learning'' (3rd ed.). pg. 255. New York: Open University Press and McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leu, Coiro, Castek, Hartman, Henry and Reinking (2008) have begun to explore the use of a modified instructional model of reciprocal teaching that reflects some of the differences between offline and online reading contexts. In an instructional model known as Internet Reciprocal Teaching, each student has his/her own laptop with access to the Internet and students work in small groups to facilitate interactive group work and discussions about strategy use.  In addition, Internet Reciprocal Teaching with online informational resources (as opposed to narrative texts) and strategy instruction on both the common and unique processes by which students navigate through multiple and different texts, rather than the reading of one common text. Teachers and students model their choices about which links are most relevant to a group or individual question through think-alouds. They discuss how to efficiently locate information within different kinds of websites, how to synthesize ideas across multiple texts and media, how to make judgments about the quality of the information and the author's level of expertise, and how to best represent the answers to their questions. Responsibility for monitoring and effectively using these strategies to solve online information problems is gradually released to the students  using an instructional scheme with three phases: Phase 1 includes direct, whole class instruction of basic skills and strategies of Internet use; Phase 2 includes group work and the reciprocal exchange of online reading comprehension strategies by students with their peers; and Phase 3 includes online individual inquiry units, sometimes with collaborative efforts involving other students in other classes, perhaps even in other parts of the world, and periodic strategy sessions with groups.&lt;ref&gt;Leu, D. J. Jr., Coiro, J., Castek, J., Hartman, D. K., Henry, L. A., &amp; Reinking, D. (2008). Research on instruction and assessment of the new literacies of online reading comprehension. In C. C. Block, S. Parris, and P. Afflerbach, (Eds.), Comprehension instruction: Research based best practices. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Students "are the first generation to be global publishers to access the raw material of information and to create refined knowledge products for application.  They understand the social skills of working with people who they will never meet face to face.  They also understand that they need to take more responsibility for managing their own learning.  They do not see the boundaries of school as a solid wall.  They see school as a global communications center."

The '''Office for Budget Responsibility''' ('''OBR''') is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] that the UK government established to provide independent [[economic forecast]]s and independent analysis of the public finances as background to the preparation of the [[United Kingdom budget|UK budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=Osborne to give details of £6bn spending cuts next week |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally created in May 2010 following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|general election]] (although it had previously been constituted in shadow form by the Conservative party opposition in December 2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8401517.stm |title=Conservatives launch Office for Budget Responsibility |date=8 December 2009 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was placed on a statutory footing by the [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]].&lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/892/made/data.pdf |title=The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of a growing number of official independent fiscal watchdogs around the world.&lt;ref name="What we do"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/about-the-obr/what-we-do/ |title=What we do |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==

The UK government created the OBR in 2010 with the purported goal of offering independent and authoritative analysis of the UK's public finances. To that end it produces two 5-year-ahead forecasts for the economy and the public finances each year, alongside the [[Budget Day|Budget]] and [[Autumn Statement]]s.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

In its role in providing independent analysis the OBR has four main duties:&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Forecasts of the economy and public finances===
The OBR produces five-year forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year. The forecasts accompany the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor’s]] [[Budget Day - United Kingdom|Budget Statement]] and his [[Autumn Statement]] and they incorporate the impact of any tax and spending measures announced by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]]. Details of the forecasts are set out in the Economic and fiscal outlook (EFO) publications.
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2014/ |title=Economic and fiscal outlook - March 2014 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual Forecast evaluation report (FER) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/publications/forecast-evaluation-report/ |title=Forecast evaluation report - October 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published each autumn, examines how the EFO forecasts compare to subsequent outturns. The OBR has published briefing papers describing its approach to forecasting the economy &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Forecasting-the-economy.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 3: Forecasting the Economy |publisher=OBR |date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and public finances,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/briefing-paper-no-1-forecasting-the-public-finances/ |title=Briefing paper No. 1: Forecasting the public finances |publisher=OBR |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the macroeconomic model it uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Final_Model_Documentation.pdf |title=Briefing paper No. 5: The macroeconomic model |publisher=OBR |date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evaluation of the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets===
The OBR uses its public finance forecasts to assess the Government’s performance against its fiscal targets. The Government has set itself two medium-term fiscal targets: first, a fiscal mandate to balance the cyclically-adjusted current budget five years ahead, and second, a supplementary target to have public sector net debt falling in 2015-16.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |title=Budget Forecast: June 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]] |date=June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121015000000/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_188581.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Economic and fiscal outlook, the OBR assesses whether the Government has a greater than 50 per cent probability of hitting these targets under current policy. Given the uncertainty inherent in all fiscal forecasts, the OBR also tests how robust this judgement is by using historical evidence, sensitivity analysis and alternative scenarios.

===Scrutiny of the Government’s policy costings===
The OBR conducts scrutiny and analysis of [[HM Treasury]]’s costing of tax and welfare spending measures. During the run-up to the Budget and the Autumn Statement, the OBR subjects the Government’s draft costings of tax and spending measures to detailed challenge and scrutiny. These are then stated in the EFO and the Treasury’s policy costing documents with the OBR stating whether it endorses the costings that the Government finally publishes as reasonable central estimates. The OBR has published a briefing paper describing its role in policy costings and how they fit into the forecast process.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://cdn.budgetresponsibility.org.uk/27814-BriefingPaperNo_6.pdf |title=Briefing Paper No. 6: Policy costings and our forecasts |publisher=OBR |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assess the long-term sustainability of the public finances===
The OBR also assesses the long-term sustainability of the public finances. Its annual [[Fiscal sustainability]] report 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/fiscal-sustainability-report-july-2013/ |title=Fiscal sustainability report - July 2013 |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; sets out long-term projections for different categories of spending, revenue and financial transactions and assesses whether they imply a sustainable path for public sector debt. The [[Fiscal sustainability]] report also analyses the health of the public sector’s balance sheet using both conventional National Accounts measures and the Whole of Government Accounts as prepared using commercial accounting principles.

===Other functions===
In addition to these core responsibilities, the Government has asked the OBR to forecast the Scottish receipts for the four taxes that it plans to devolve to the [[Scottish Government]] from 2015 onwards; the Scottish rate of income tax, stamp duty land tax, landfill tax and the aggregates levy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/11/pdfs/ukpga_20120011_en.pdf |title=Scotland Act 2012|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OBR has published these forecasts since March 2012 alongside UK revenue forecasts. From autumn 2014, the OBR will publish similar forecasts for Welsh taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/294470/Wales_Bill_Command_Paper_-_English.pdf |title=Wales Bill: Financial Empowerment and Accountability |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Charter for Budget Responsibility was modified to include a new cap on welfare expenditure alongside the Government’s fiscal mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The welfare cap puts a limit on the amount that government can spend on certain social security benefits in the years 2015/16 to 2018/19. The OBR is charged with assessing the Government’s performance against the cap at each [[Autumn Statement]]. As part of this assessment, the OBR is required to produce a forecast for welfare spending in scope of the cap in its Economic and fiscal outlook. The welfare cap means that if spending exceeds a certain limit, then policy action must be taken, or the cap level must change, and Parliamentary approval must be obtained. The cap features a two per cent forecast margin above the level of the cap that allows for small fluctuations in the forecast without corrective action being required. The OBR is required to assess whether welfare spending above the cap is caused by movements in the forecast or by discretionary policy changes. The OBR has also been tasked with producing an annual report on trends in welfare spending.

The OBR undertakes a variety of research projects through the year. It publishes briefing material &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/publications/briefing-papers/ |title=Briefing Papers |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to inform the public about its work, and provides a same-day briefing on the public finances statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/category/topics/monthly-public-finance-data/ |title=Monthly public finance data |publisher=OBR |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Budget Responsibility Committee &lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; members and OBR staff also give talks and presentations at external events. Robert Chote has discussed the role of the OBR, and the difference that it made after its first three years in existence, in a lecture entitled Britain’s fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel on 9 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/Lecture_May-2013.pdf |title=Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel |author=Chote |date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities are summarised each year in its Annual Reports.

==History==
[[George Osborne]], the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] of the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition]] formed after the  [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], announced the body in his first official speech.  He criticised the economic and fiscal forecasts of the [[Premiership of Gordon Brown|previous Labour government]], and announced that the OBR would be responsible for publishing these independently of government in future.&lt;ref name=bbc-cutplan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685989.stm |title=George Osborne promises spending cuts plan next week  |date=2010-05-17|work=BBC News|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective underpinning its creation was to provide an independent assessment of national public finances before the coalition Government's emergency budget in June 2010, which outlined the size and pace of the fiscal consolidation plan inherited from the outgoing administration.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The role of the Office is to advise whether the declared policy of the Government is likely to meet its targets &lt;ref name="mixedreactions"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2010/05/mixed-reaction-to-office-for-budget-responsibility/ | title= Mixed reaction to Office for Budget Responsibility | publisher= ''Public Finance'' | date= 17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OBR was initially chaired by [[Sir Alan Budd]] who, along with Geoffrey Dicks and Graham Parker, formed the Budget Responsibility Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/speech-by-the-chancellor-of-the-exchequer-rt-hon-george-osborne-mp-on-the-obr-and-spending-announcements |title=Speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon George Osborne MP, on the OBR and spending announcements |date=17 May 2010 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budd had been a founding member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|MPC]]; Dicks was chief economist at Novus Capital and former chief economist of the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]; and Parker headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]’s public sector finances team. The remainder of the initial team comprised eight staff seconded from the Treasury.&lt;ref name="mixedreactions"/&gt; The initial team provided recommendations to the Chancellor on the role of the permanent OBR.&lt;ref name="Budget Forecast: June 2010"/&gt;

The OBR produced its first forecast for public finances shortly before the June 2010 budget with the second at the June budget incorporating the impact of newly announced measures. [[Colin Talbot]], Chair of Public Policy and Management at [[Manchester Business School]] and Treasury adviser on public spending, questioned the credibility of the new organisation. He said that the body could not be set up in time to judge the forecasts in the [[June 2010 United Kingdom Budget]]. In his opinion, the OBR would not be sufficiently independent of politicians or the [[Executive (government)|Executive]] to remove the politics from economic decision-making.&lt;ref name=mixedreactions/&gt;   The office made adjustments to its forecasts in the week before the June 2010 budget.  These were thought to be politically favourable to the coalition government and so cast doubt on its independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c3e077ca-8adf-11df-bead-00144feab49a.html |title=Late OBR changes shrank job loss figure |author=Chris Giles |journal=Financial Times |date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 it was announced that Budd would not continue in the role after his initial 3-month contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/7873605/Sir-Alan-Budd-to-leave-the-Office-for-Budget-Responsibility.html Sir Alan Budd to leave the Office for Budget Responsibility], ''Daily Telegraph'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/06/alan-budd-quits-government-spending-watchdog Alan Budd quits as government spending watchdog], ''Guardian'', 6 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reported "His departure was expected and Sir Alan had let it be known privately that he had never intended to serve as chairman of the OBR for anything other than a short period. His contract spanned the emergency Budget, leaving enough time thereafter to advise on the legislation needed to establish the OBR on a permanent basis."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/65ccae4c-88c8-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation on his successor had included [[Rachel Lomax]], [[John Gieve]], [[Andrew Dilnot]], [[Robert Chote]], [[Michael Scholar]] and [[Ruth Lea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/benedictbrogan/100046401/how-about-sir-michael-scholar-for-the-obr/ | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=How about Sir Michael Scholar for the OBR? | date=7 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/iainmartin/2010/07/06/ruth-lea-in-at-the-obr-pdq/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Ruth Lea in at the OBR PDQ? | first=Iain | last=Martin | date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, Chancellor George Osborne announced that [[Robert Chote]] had been appointed as the new Chairman of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC). The two other members of the BRC were Stephen Nickell, a former member of the [[Monetary Policy Committee|Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee]] and Graham Parker, who formerly  headed up the [[HM Treasury|Treasury's]] public sector finances team.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt; An Oversight Board was also created comprising the three BRC members plus two external members acting as non-Executive Directors.

==Governance==

===Budget Responsibility Committee===

The three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee (BRC) who are appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer following an appointment hearing at the Treasury Select Committee, lead the OBR. They have executive responsibility for carrying out the core functions of the OBR, including responsibility for the judgements reached in its forecasts. They are: [[Robert Chote]] (Chairman), [[Charlie Bean|Professor Sir Charles Bean]], Graham Parker CBE.&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Oversight Board===

The OBR's Oversight Board ensures that effective arrangements are in place to provide assurance on risk management, governance and internal control. It consists of the three members of the BRC plus two non-executive members, [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Burns]] and [[Christopher Kelly (civil servant)|Sir Christopher Kelly]].&lt;ref name="What we do"/&gt;

===Advisory Panel===

The OBR’s Advisory Panel of economic and fiscal experts meets regularly to advise the OBR on its work programme and analytical methods. Currently members come from the [[Bank of England]], the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], academia, and other bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=OBR names expert advisory panel |publisher=OBR |date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and related material==
The OBR’s formal rights and responsibilities are outlined in four documents:

•	The [[Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011]] &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt;

•	The Charter for Budget Responsibility &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_expert_advisory_panel_pn_23032011.pdf |title=Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update |publisher=HM Treasury |date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	The OBR/HM Treasury Framework document &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_framework040411.pdf |title=Office for Budget Responsibility and HM Treasury Framework Document |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

•	A Memorandum of Understanding between the OBR and government departments with which it interacts most frequently and closely: HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/wordpress/docs/obr_memorandum040411.pdf |title=Memorandum of Understanding between Office for Budget Responsibility, HM Treasury, Department for Work and Pensions and HM Revenue &amp; Customs |publisher=OBR |date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act &lt;ref name="The Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011 (Commencement No.1) Order 2011 SI 2011/8"/&gt; sets out the overarching duty of the OBR to examine and report on the sustainability of the public finances.  It also gives complete discretion to the OBR in the performance of its duties, as long as those duties are performed objectively, transparently and independently and takes into account the sitting government’s policies and not alternative policies. 
The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; outlines the OBR’s independence which includes complete discretion to decide:

•	The methodology underpinning the OBR’s forecasts, assessment and analyses;

•	The judgements made by the OBR in producing these outputs;

•	The content of the OBR’s publications; and

•	The OBR’s work programme of research and additional analysis.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

The Charter &lt;ref name="Charter of Budget Responsibility March 2014 update"/&gt; also specifies material that the OBR have to include in its forecasts and gives the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] the right to determine the length of the forecast horizon – subject to a minimum of five years. The Charter states that the Government remains responsible for policy decisions and costings and the OBR “should fnot provide normative commentary on the particular merits of Government policies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/293048/PU1643_Charter_budget_responsibility_update_web.pdf |title=Charter for Budget Responsibility March 2014 update, page 12, para 4.12 |publisher=[[HM Treasury]]|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also gives the OBR right of access to all Government information which it may reasonably require for the performance of its duties. Under the Memorandum of Understanding where it is not possible to reach agreement, issues may be escalated to the Chair of the OBR and the Permanent Secretaries as appropriate.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt; The Framework document sets out the OBR’s governance and management arrangements.
As a non-departmental body under the aegis of the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], the OBR is formally accountable to the [[Treasury Select Committee]] of the House of Commons. This accountability to parliament takes a number of elements:

First the four core publications the OBR is required to publish each year have to be laid formally before parliament;

Second, the [[Treasury Select Committee]] can call on the OBR to give evidence on its work at any time;

Third, the Treasury Select Committee has a role in determining the membership of the Budget Responsibility Committee. When a new member has to be appointed, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] names his preferred candidate following a formal application and interview process run by the civil service. The [[Treasury Select Committee]] holds confirmation hearings with the candidate and can veto the Chancellor’s choice.&lt;ref name="Britain's fiscal watchdog: a view from the kennel"/&gt;

== International coordination ==
The OBR is a member of the [[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network]] set up by the EU in September 2015.

'''Organisational semiotics''' examines the nature, characteristics and features of [[information]], and studies how information can be best used in the context of organised activities and business domains. Organisational semiotics treats organisations as [[information systems]] in which information is created, processed, distributed, stored and used. It benefits from the research of [[semiotics]] in various schools, and further develops its theoretical frameworks, methods and techniques for understanding, analysing, modelling, designing and implementing of information systems.

==History==

Organizational semiotics started around 1973 with [[Ronald Stamper]]’s seminal book on Information (Stamper, 1973), a book that was intended to be the first chapter of a book on information systems design called ‘organizational semiotics’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Featured as an interdisciplinary undertaking, researchers working in the community of organisational semiotics come from different backgrounds and work together on the theoretical and practical issues relating to organisational and technical problems. From the first international meeting on organisational semiotics in 1995, the community aims to develop the subject into a science of information systems, as claimed at the IFIP 8.1 Working Conference.&lt;ref&gt;“Organisational Semiotics: Evolving a science of information systems”, book edited by [[Kecheng Liu]], Rodney J. Clarke, Peter B Andersen and Ronald Stamper, with El-Sayed Abou-Zeid, 2002 {{ISBN|1-4020-7189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Conference on Informatics and Semiotics in Organisations is the flagship conference of the community of which [[Kecheng Liu]] and the Informatics Research Centre &lt;ref&gt; Informatics Research Centre, Henley Business School, University of Reading [https://www.henley.ac.uk/research/research-centres/informatics-research-centre/]&lt;/ref&gt; have been convening over the past years.

'''Penn State Mont Alto''' is a [[Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth Campus]]. It is located in [[Mont Alto, Pennsylvania|Mont Alto]], in south central [[Pennsylvania]], between [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] and [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]]. It incorporates the '''Pennsylvania State Forest Academy''', founded in 1903 by Governor [[Samuel W. Pennypacker]].

==Institution==
Approximately 1,200 students attend the school with more than 30% being over the age of 24. The majority of the student population at Penn State Mont Alto commute to classes, rather than live in the provided residence halls.

The campus is well known for its [[forestry]] and [[nursing]] majors. While many students elect to continue their education at University Park, Penn State Mont Alto does offer four-year degrees in business as well as English.

Today, Mont Alto offers four baccalaureate degrees and eight associate degrees, and serves nearly 1,300 students annually. The campus serves an additional 2,500 annually through its Continuing Education unit, with courses on campus, at the Chambersburg Mall and other sites.

==History==

=== Pennsylvania State Forest Academy===
[[Joseph Rothrock]], an explorer, botanist and medical doctor founded the academy to train men for service in the state forests.

In May 1903, [[Samuel W. Pennypacker]], governor of Pennsylvania, established the '''Pennsylvania State Forest Academy''' in Mont Alto. With the precipitous closure of the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]] in the same month, the new Pennsylvania school became one of three forestry schools in the nation, along with [[Yale]] and [[Biltmore Forest School|Biltmore]]. [[George Wirt]], the academy's first administrator, patterned the curriculum after curricula in [[Germany]]. All first year students were required to bring a horse with them to the academy until the late 1920s. The horses were used to fight forest fires in the [[Michaux State Forest]].&lt;ref name="ma.psu.edu"&gt;[http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/15737.htm Penn State Mont Alto: Interesting Mont Alto Facts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901081552/http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/15737.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/admissions/whypsu/student/forestrymontalto.htm Penn State Undergraduate Admissions - College as an investment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The yearbook of the Pennsylvania State Forest Academy was called "The Oak Leaf". It was published in 1914, 1920, 1923 and 1927, and may now be viewed online through the [[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]] along with other items documenting the history of this campus.&lt;ref name="Forestry Education in Pennsylvania"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libraries.psu.edu/about/collections/forestry-education-pennsylvania|title=Forestry Education in Pennsylvania {{!}} University Libraries|website=libraries.psu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Merger with Penn State ===

In 1929 the Forest Academy merged with [[Pennsylvania State University]], establishing '''Penn State Mont Alto'''. Students were adamantly opposed to the merger, and they protested by hanging two state officials in effigy.&lt;ref name="ma.psu.edu" /&gt;

The campus closed from 1943 to 1946 because the students and faculty were fighting in WWII.&lt;ref name="ma.psu.edu" /&gt;

In 1963, Penn State Mont Alto became a Commonwealth Campus.

In 1997, Mont Alto joined the Commonwealth College, and began to offer baccalaureate degrees.

==Overview of the campus==

===Residence halls===
Penn State Mont Alto offers three residence halls to students: Mont Alto Hall, Penn Gate I, and Penn Gate II.

*Mont Alto Hall offers traditional dorm life. All three floors of the building are broken up into an east and a west side, with only one gender belonging to a particular wing. Each room holds two people, although it is possible to obtain a single room given certain circumstances. The rooms are not carpeted, and lack a central AC unit. They do however, include a heater. Each resident is provided with a desk, a phone jack, an Ethernet connection, a dresser, and a closet. The "Microfridge", a combination microwave and refrigerator, is standard as well. Every wing of the building includes a bathroom that the entire hall shares, making for two per floor. Mont Alto Hall also includes a basement with washers/dryers and study rooms. This hall is a mere 4-5 minute walk from virtually anything on campus, with the exception of the Penn Gate dorms and other parts of the campus east of PA 233 (softball fields, etc.).
*Penn Gate II offers four-person suite living. Similar to Mont Alto Hall, the building is three stories tall. While halls themselves are not gender specific, each individual suite is. The four-person suite includes two spacious bedrooms as well as a bathroom that is shared by all four people in the suite. Each room is carpeted and also includes a central air conditioning unit. Penn Gate II is located east of PA 233, and is a fairly long walk (5-10 minute) to campus.
*Penn Gate I is a third residence hall offered at Mont Alto. Located directly adjacent to Penn Gate II, Penn Gate I was not in use during the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 school years due to low enrollment. However, it was reopened for the 2006-2007 school year. Penn Gate I offers a similar four-person suite living accommodation that is provided at Penn Gate II.

===Classroom buildings===
*Conklin Hall was originally built as a dormitory by students of the forestry school starting in 1909 and completed in 1911. The building is now home to the Student Center, Student Affairs offices and the archives.&lt;ref name="history.html"&gt;[http://www.psu.edu/ur/archives/intercom_2002/Feb7/montalto.html history.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The General Studies Building is where the majority of classes at Penn State Mont Alto are held. The three story brick building includes many traditional classrooms for lectures. The first floor holds an auditorium that is frequently used for special shows and speakers, as well as large lecture classes. In addition to the auditorium, the first floor holds the Learning Center, a place where students can go to study with a professional or student tutor. Several computer labs are held in the building as well.
*The Science and Technology building is primarily used for science courses at Penn State Mont Alto. In it, you will find several labs specific to different courses such as chemistry and nursing. Many general education courses are held in this building as well, particularly those with large class sizes. It was built in the 1970s.
*The Bookstore has a computer lab in the basement. Classes such as Computer Science and Management &amp; Information Systems are typically held here.

===Other notable buildings===
*Wiestling Hall is the primary building on the campus, located in the center of the campus mall.  Built in 1803, it is the oldest building in the Penn State system. Originally built as an iron master's house it has served as the campus dining hall, classroom and dormitory. The second floor of Wiestling Hall is home to faculty and staff offices. The third floor of Wiestling has never been renovated, and remains true to the 1803 design. This third floor is only accessible through two hidden entranceways on the second floor of the building. Local legend holds that Wiestling is haunted by a ghost named Sarah and by the ghost of Col. Wiestling, the first ironmaster who lived there. In 2004, Wiestling Hall was modernized and now it serves as the student building and houses the campus Student Government Association office.
*History has it that [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] spent time at Emmanuel Chapel before his raid on Harper's Ferry in 1859. Penn State Mont Alto bought the chapel in 1992 for $1 and reopened it in 1999.&lt;ref name="history.html"/&gt;
*The MAC (Multipurpose Activities Center) is the gym at Penn State Mont Alto. This building sports a few classrooms, a basketball gym, a weight room, a racquetball court, and a multipurpose room used for conferences, dances, and other occasions. Two tennis courts are located outside of the MAC as well.
*The [http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/montalto.html library at Penn State Mont Alto] includes a variety of books and research databases that serve faculty, staff, and students, as well as members of the local community. Any Pennsylvania resident may borrow items from the Penn State University library system.
*The most recent building to be added at Penn State Mont Alto was the Bookstore.
*The dining hall was built in 1968.
*September 10, 2014, Penn State Mont Alto opened its Veterans Center. The center was spearheaded by the Penn State Mont Alto Student Veterans Association (SVA) which received a $10,000 VetCenter Initiative grant from the SVA and The Home Depot Foundation partnership to refurbish the spring house on campus (built in 1905). It had previously served as a faculty lounge and mailroom. Now it has computers for Internet access and space for student veterans to study and gather.

==Arboretum==
The '''Mont Alto Arboretum''' is an [[arboretum]] located on the campus ({{coord|40.81004|-77.87744|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-PA|display=inline}}). It was established on [[Arbor Day]] in 1905, just two years after the founding of the [[Pennsylvania State Forest Academy]] in Mont Alto. According to the college, on that day students searched for native tree species not present on campus, and brought back more than 400 specimens (30 [[species]]). These original plantings were then augmented by seeds from other trees native to the United States. This arboretum continues to provide a training ground for students, as well as a research site for the development of new hybrids.

==Athletics==
Penn State–Mont Alto teams participate as a member of the [[United States Collegiate Athletic Association]] (USCAA). The Nittany Lions are a member of the [[Pennsylvania State University Athletic Conference]] (PSUAC). Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and wrestling; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, softball, tennis and volleyball.

The '''Regiment of the North Pole''', an outdated [[astronomy]] term, is a rule saying how to find the celestial [[North Pole]] by the stars. It was used in former centuries when, because of [[precession]], the star [[Polaris]] was much further from the celestial North Pole than it is now.

As at AD2000 [[precession]] [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], the rule would be: "From [[Polaris]], go directly away from the Pointers (βγ [[Ursa Minor|Ursae Minoris]]) by about 1.45 times the apparent diameter of the [[Full Moon]]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Reproductive immunology''' refers to a field of medicine that studies interactions (or the absence of them) between the [[immune system]] and components related to the [[reproductive system]], such as [[maternal immune tolerance]] towards the fetus, or immunological interactions across the [[blood-testis barrier]]. The concept has been used by [[fertility clinic]]s to explain the [[Infertility|fertility problems]], recurrent [[miscarriage]]s and [[Complications of pregnancy|pregnancy complications]] observed when this state of immunological tolerance is not successfully achieved. Immunological therapy is the new up and coming method for treating many cases of previously "[[unexplained infertility]]" or recurrent miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, H.  Immunity’s Pregnant Pause. [[Nature Publishing Group]].2002; 420: 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between mother and fetus==
{{Main|Immune tolerance in pregnancy}}
The fact that the embryo's tissue is half foreign and unlike mismatched [[organ transplant]], it is not normally rejected, suggests that the immunological system of the mother plays an important role in pregnancy.  The placenta also plays an important part in protecting the embryo for the immune attack from the mother's system.  Studies also propose that proteins in semen may help woman’s immune system prepare for conception and pregnancy. For example, there is substantial evidence for [[Pre-eclampsia#Exposure to partner.27s semen|exposure to partner's semen as prevention for pre-eclampsia]], largely due to the absorption of several immune modulating factors present in seminal fluid, such as [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGFβ).&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite web| author= Sarah Robertson|  title=Research Goals --&gt; Role of seminal fluid signalling in the female reproductive tract| url=http://health.adelaide.edu.au/og/people/robertsons.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/677CY45U2?url=http://health.adelaide.edu.au/og/people/robertsons.html| archivedate=2012-04-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SeminalPriming&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sarah A.

==Sperm cells within a male==
{{Main|Testicular immunology}}
The presence of anti-sperm antibodies in infertile men was first reported in 1954 by Rumke and Wilson. It has been noticed that the number of cases of sperm autoimmunity is higher in the infertile population leading to the idea that autoimmunity could be a cause of infertility.[[SPAG6|Anti sperm antigen]] has been described as three immunoglobulin isotopes (IgG, IgA, IgM) each of which targets different part of the spermatozoa. If more than 10% of the sperm are bound to anti-sperm antibodies (ASA), then infertility is suspected. The [[blood-testis barrier]] separates the immune system and the developing spermatozoa. The [[tight junction]] between the [[Sertoli cell]]s form the blood-testis barrier but it is usually breached by physiological leakage. Not all sperms are protected by the barrier because spermatogonia and early spermatocytes are located below the junction. They are protected by other means like immunologic tolerance and [[Immunomodulator|immunomodulation]].

Infertility after anti-sperm antibody binding can be caused by [[autoagglutination]], sperm [[cytotoxicity]], blockage of sperm-ovum interaction, and inadequate motility. Each presents itself depending on the [[binding site]] of ASA.

== Immunocontraceptive vaccine ==
{{Main|Immunocontraception}}
Experiments are undergoing to test the effectiveness of an immunocontraceptive vaccine that inhibits the fusing of spermatozoa to the [[zona pellucida]]. This vaccine is currently being tested in animals and hopefully will be an effective contraceptive for humans. Normally, spermatozoa fuse with the zona pellucida surrounding the mature oocyte; the resulting [[acrosome reaction]] breaks down the egg's tough coating so that the sperm can fertilize the oovum. The mechanism of the vaccine is injection with cloned ZP cDNA, therefore this vaccine is a DNA based vaccine.  This results in the production of antibodies against the ZP, which stop the sperm from binding to the zona pellucida and ultimately from fertilizing the oovum.&lt;ref name=Markert&gt;Markert U. Immunology of gametes and embryo implantation. Switzerland: Karger; 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another vaccine in investigation is one against HCG. This immunization would produce antibodies against hCG and TT. Antibodies against hCG would prevent the maintenance of the uterus for a viable pregnancy therefore preventing conception.
Another vaccine that is utilized is the peptide β-hCG that is more specific to hCG and a more rapid and effective response occurs in the absence of LH, FSH, and TSH.&lt;ref name=Markert/&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2012}}

{{Distinguish|Responsiveness}}
'''Responsive web design''' ('''RWD''') is an approach to [[web design]] that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tafreshi|first1=Amir E.

===Mobile first, unobtrusive JavaScript, and progressive enhancement===

"Mobile first", [[unobtrusive JavaScript]], and [[progressive enhancement]] are related concepts that predate RWD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Responsive Web Design |date=July 23, 2012|url=http://www.webhostdesignpost.com/webdesign/whatisresponsivewebdesign.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browsers of basic mobile phones do not understand JavaScript or [[media queries]], so a recommended practice is to create a basic web site and enhance it for smart phones and PCs, rather than rely on [[Fault-tolerant system|graceful degradation]] to make a complex, image-heavy site work on mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Mobile First|date=November 3, 2009 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Firtman"&gt;{{cite book|last= Firtman |first=Maximiliano |pages=512|url=http://www.mobilexweb.com/book|title=Programming the Mobile Web|date=July 30, 2011|isbn=978-0-596-80778-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement|date=February 3, 2009|url=http://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113064723/https://docs.webplatform.org/wiki/tutorials/graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement|archivedate=November 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=February 2010 |pages=456 |url= http://filamentgroup.com/dwpe/ |title= Designing with Progressive Enhancement |accessdate= March 1, 2010 |isbn= 978-0-321-65888-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive enhancement based on browser, device, or feature detection===

Due to the high volume of usage of internet on mobile devices they can no longer be ignored. In 2014, for the first time more users accessed the internet from their mobile devices than desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://allthewayupmedia.com/mobile-website/|title=Mobile Websites {{!}} All The Way Up Media|date=2016-10-31|work=All The Way Up Media|access-date=2017-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where a web site must support basic mobile devices that lack JavaScript, [[User agent#User agent identification|browser ("user agent") detection]] (also called "[[browser sniffing]]") and mobile device detection&lt;ref name="Firtman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSDD"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|publisher = Smashing magazine |title=Server-Side Device Detection: History, Benefits And How-To|date=September 24, 2012 |url=http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/09/24/server-side-device-detection-history-benefits-how-to/}}&lt;/ref&gt; are two ways of deducing if certain HTML and CSS features are supported (as a basis for progressive enhancement)—however, these methods are not completely reliable unless used in conjunction with a device capabilities database.

For more capable mobile phones and PCs, [[Comparison of JavaScript frameworks|JavaScript frameworks]] like [[Modernizr]], [[jQuery]], and [[jQuery Mobile]] that can directly test browser support for HTML/CSS features (or identify the device or user agent) are popular. [[Polyfill (programming)|Polyfill]]s can be used to add support for features—e.g. to support media queries (required for RWD), and enhance HTML5 support, on Internet Explorer. [[Feature detection (web development)|Feature detection]] also might not be completely reliable; some may report that a feature is available, when it is either missing or so poorly implemented that it is effectively nonfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sencha.com/blog/blackberry-torch-the-html5-developer-scorecard |title=BlackBerry Torch: The HTML5 Developer Scorecard &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Sencha |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305165051/http://www.sencha.com/blog/blackberry-torch-the-html5-developer-scorecard |archive-date=2014-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sencha.com/blog/motorola-xoom-the-html5-developer-scorecard/ |title=Motorola Xoom: The HTML5 Developer Scorecard &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Sencha |date=February 24, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213051238/http://www.sencha.com/blog/motorola-xoom-the-html5-developer-scorecard/ |archive-date=2015-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges, and other approaches==
Luke Wroblewski has summarized some of the RWD and mobile design challenges, and created a catalog of multi-device layout patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Mobilism: jQuery Mobile|date=May 17, 2011|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RWD&gt;{{cite web |last=Wroblewski |first=Luke |title=Rolling Up Our Responsive Sleeves|date=February 6, 2012|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=Multi-Device Layout Patterns|date=March 14, 2012 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1514}}&lt;/ref&gt; He&amp;nbsp;suggests that, compared with a simple RWD approach, device experience or RESS (responsive web design with server-side components) approaches can provide a user experience that is better optimized for mobile devices.&lt;ref name=RESS&gt;{{cite web |last=Wroblewski |first=Luke |title=Responsive Design ... or RESS|date=February 29, 2012|url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wroblewski|first=Luke|title=RESS: Responsive Design + Server Side Components |date=September 12, 2011 |url=http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andersen |first=Anders |title=Getting Started with RESS|date=May 9, 2012|url=http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/getting-started-ress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Server-side "[[dynamic CSS]]" implementation of stylesheet languages like [[Sass (stylesheet language)|Sass]] or Incentivated's MML can be part of such an approach by accessing a server based API which handles the device (typically mobile handset) differences in conjunction with a device capabilities database in order to improve usability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.incentivated.com/blogdetail/Responsive-but-not-completely-mobile-optimised/ |title=Responsive but not completely mobile optimised &amp;#124; Blog |publisher=Incentivated}}&lt;/ref&gt;  RESS is more expensive to develop, requiring more than just client-side logic, and so tends to be reserved for organizations with larger budgets. Google recommends responsive design for smartphone websites over other approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/ |title=Building Smartphone-Optimized Websites |publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many publishers are starting to implement responsive designs, one ongoing challenge for RWD is that some [[Web banner|banner advertisements]] and videos are not fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Matthew|last2=Koren|first2=Etai|title=The state of responsive advertising: the publishers' perspective|date=April 30, 2012|publisher=.net Magazine|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/state-responsive-advertising-publishers-perspective-4126330}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[search advertising]] and (banner) [[display advertising]] support specific device platform targeting and different advertisement size formats for desktop, smartphone, and basic mobile devices. Different [[landing page]] [[URL]]s can be used for different platforms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/adwords/certification/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;guide=23292|title=Google Partners Help|work=google.com|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] can be used to display different advertisement variants on a page.&lt;ref name="SSDD" /&gt;&lt;ref name=RWD /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://developers.google.com/webmasters/smartphone-sites/javascript JavaScript and Responsive Web Design] Google Developers&lt;/ref&gt; CSS tables permit hybrid fixed+fluid layouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-role-of-table-layouts-in-responsive-web-design--webdesign-10294|title=The Role of Table Layouts in Responsive Web Design|work=Web Design Tuts+|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first site to feature a layout that adapts to browser viewport width was ''[[Audi]].com'' launched in late 2001,&lt;ref&gt;Kalbach, Jim (July 22, 2012). [https://experiencinginformation.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/the-first-responsive-design-website-audi-circa-2002/ "The First Responsive Design Website: Audi (circa 2002)."] {{sps|date = October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created by a team at [[razorfish (company)|razorfish]] consisting of Jürgen Spangl and Jim Kalbach (information architecture), Ken Olling (design), and Jan Hoffmann (interface development). Limited browser capabilities meant that for Internet Explorer, the layout could adapt dynamically in the browser whereas for Netscape, the page had to be reloaded from the server when resized.

Cameron Adams created a demonstration in 2004 that is still online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Adams|first1=Cameron|title=Resolution dependent layout: Varying layout according to browser width|url=http://www.themaninblue.com/writing/perspective/2004/09/21/|website=The Man in Blue|date=September 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008, a number of related terms such as "flexible", "liquid",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G146.html|title=G146: Using liquid layout|work=w3.org|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "fluid", and "elastic" were being used to describe layouts. CSS3 media queries were almost ready for prime time in late 2008/early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-css3-mediaqueries-20090423/|title=Media Queries|work=w3.org|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethan Marcotte coined the term responsive web design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outseller.net/2015s-professional-responsive-web-design-offer-businesses/|title=OutSeller Group - Organize, Optimize, Maximize|work=outseller.net|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (RWD)&amp;mdash;and defined it to mean fluid grid/ flexible images/ media queries&amp;mdash;in a May 2010 article in ''[[A List Apart]]''.&lt;ref name=fluid_grid /&gt;&lt;!--ref name=EM /--&gt; He described the theory and practice of responsive web design in his brief 2011 book titled ''Responsive Web Design''. Responsive design was listed as #2 in Top Web Design Trends for 2012 by [[.net (magazine)|.net magazine]] after [[progressive enhancement]] at #1.

[[Mashable]] called 2013 the Year of Responsive Web Design.&lt;ref name="mashable_2013"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cashmore|first=Pete|title=Why 2013 Is the Year of Responsive Web Design|date=December 11, 2012|url=http://mashable.com/2012/12/11/responsive-web-design/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other sources have recommended responsive design as a cost-effective alternative to mobile applications due to its ability to house all of the code in a single website. Users and developers alike began realizing the benefits and importance of mobile-responsive designs as mobile use continued to rise. &lt;ref name="wesfed_2016"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Wes|title=Why mobile websites are important|date=December 6, 2016|url=https://www.wesfed.com/blog/why-mobile-websites-are-important/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This realization of importance was confirmed when Google made their announcement that search engines were going to reward responsive websites with increased rankings.

A '''root hair'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grierson|first=Claire|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=John|date=2002-04-04|title=Root Hairs|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243358/|journal=The Arabidopsis Book / American Society of Plant Biologists|volume=1|pages=e0060|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|issn=1543-8120|pmc=3243358|pmid=22303213}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or '''absorbent hair''', the [[rhizoid]] of a [[vascular plant]], is a tubular outgrowth of a trichoblast, a hair-forming cell on the [[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of a [[plant root]]. As they are lateral extensions of a single cell and only rarely branched, they are visible to the naked eye and light microscope. They are found only in the region of maturation of the root. Just prior to, and during, root hair cell development, there is elevated [[phosphorylase]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dosier|first1=Larry W.|last2=Riopel|first2=J. L.|title=Differential Enzyme Activity During Trichoblast Differentiation in Elodea Canadensis|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=64|issue=9|pages=1049–1056|language=en|doi=10.1002/j.1537-2197.1977.tb10794.x|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The root hairs are where most water absorption happens. They are long and so they can penetrate between soil particles, and prevent harmful bacterial organisms from entering the plant through the xylem vessels. They have a large surface area for absorption of water. Increasing root surface area aids plants to be more efficient in absorbing nutrients and establishing relationships with microbes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3243358/|title=Root Hairs|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=1|pages=e0060|pmc=3243358|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|pmid=22303213|year=2002|last1=Grierson|first1=C.|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cross-section of root hair cell: a roughly rectangular shape with a long, thin tail extending to the right and a nucleus at the top left.
Water passes from the soil water to the root hair cell’s cytoplasm by osmosis. This happens because the soil water has a higher water potential than the root hair cell cytoplasm. The function of root hairs is to collect water and mineral [[nutrient]]s present in the soil and take this solution up through the roots to the rest of the plant. As root hair cells do not carry out [[photosynthesis]] they do not contain [[chloroplasts]].

==Formation==
Root hair cells are outgrowths at a tip of the plant's roots. Root hair cells vary between 15 and 17 micrometres in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; They are found only in the zone of maturation, and not the zone of elongation, possibly because any root hairs that arise are sheared off as the root elongates and moves through the soil. {{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
Root hairs grow quickly, at least 1μm/min, making them particularly useful for research on cell expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Grierson|first1=Claire|last2=Schiefelbein|first2=John|title=Root Hairs|journal=The Arabidopsis Book|volume=1|pages=e0060|doi=10.1199/tab.0060|pmid=22303213|pmc=3243358|date=1 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Root hairs form an important surface as they are needed to [[Absorption of water|absorb]] most of the water and nutrients needed for the plant.
They are also directly involved in the formation of root nodules in [[Fabaceae|legume]] plants. The root hairs curl around the bacteria which allows for the formation of an infection thread through into the dividing cortical cells to form the nodule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mergaert|first1=Peter|last2=Uchiumi|first2=Toshiki|last3=Alunni|first3=Benoît|last4=Evanno|first4=Gwénaëlle|last5=Cheron|first5=Angélique|last6=Catrice|first6=Olivier|last7=Mausset|first7=Anne-Elisabeth|last8=Barloy-Hubler|first8=Frédérique|last9=Galibert|first9=Francis|last10=Kondorosi|first10=Adam|last11=Kondorosi|first11=Eva|title=Eukaryotic control on bacterial cell cycle and differentiation in the Rhizobium–legume symbiosis|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/13/5230|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=103|issue=13|accessdate=23 April 2018|pages=5230–5235|language=en|doi=10.1073/pnas.0600912103|pmid=16547129|pmc=1458823|date=28 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a large surface area, the [[active uptake]] of water and minerals through root hairs is highly efficient. 
Root hair cells also secrete acid (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from [[malic acid]]) which exchanges and helps solubilize the minerals into ionic form, making the ions easier to absorb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gerke|first1=Jörg|last2=Römer|first2=Wilhelm|last3=Jungk|first3=Albrecht|title=The excretion of citric and malic acid by proteoid roots ofLupinus albus L.; effects on soil solution concentrations of phosphate, iron, and aluminum in the proteoid rhizosphere in samples of an oxisol and a luvisol|journal=Zeitschrift für Pflanzenernährung und Bodenkunde|volume=157|issue=4|pages=289–294|language=en|doi=10.1002/jpln.19941570408|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Survival==
Root hair cells can survive for 2 to 3 weeks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/4piuz-b_6dgs/root-hair-cells/|title=Root hair cells|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then die off, at the same time new root hair cells are continually being formed at the tip of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. When a new root hair cell grows, it excretes a poison so that the other cells in close proximity to it are unable to grow one of these hairs. This ensures equal and efficient distribution of the actual hairs on these cells. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The act of re-potting or transplanting a plant can result in root hair cells being pulled off, perhaps to a significant extent, and such plants may therefore wilt for some time as a result.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19973">'''Sobhi R. Mahmassani''' ({{lang-ar|صبحي محمصاني}}, January 29, 1909 – September 10, 1986) was a Lebanese legal scholar, practising lawyer, judge, and political figure helped to build the legal and civic foundations of the then-nascent country of Lebanon, and whose writings on Islamic jurisprudence remain authoritative works on this topic for legal scholars and researchers.

== Personal life ==

Mahmassani was born in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] to Rajab Mahmassani and Aisha Khoja.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He and his three male and five female siblings pursued higher education.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} In 1940, he married Ismat Abdul Kader Inkidar, with whom he had four sons: Ghaleb (1941), Malek (1944), Maher (1947) and Hani (1956).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

With the onset of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1975, Mahmassani struggled to maintain his professional activities in Lebanon and overseas as a legal consultant and international arbitrator.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} After 1983 his activities slowed down as he was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]], of which he died in Paris, where he was pursuing medical treatment, on September 10, 1986.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

== Education ==

Mahmassani commenced primary and high school education in Beirut during World War I at the Preparatory School of the Syrian Evangelical College (now known as [[International College, Beirut|International College]]), a preparatory school for the American University of Beirut.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He graduated from the high school in 1924 with high marks, and was designated valedictorian of his class.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He pursued legal studies at the law school of [[University of Lyon]] in France from which he graduated with a License en Droit (law degree) followed by a doctorate in law in 1932.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He joined the school of law of the [[London University]] and obtained bachelors in law degree in English law in 1935. As a result, he was well-versed in both French (Latin) and Anglo-Saxon legal traditions.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani was fluent in Arabic, English and French; he also had a reading knowledge of German.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

== Legal career ==

Mahmassani started his judicial career in 1929, during the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate over Lebanon]], as a court clerk while he was still pursuing his higher education.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} He served as judge at progressively higher ranks in various locations of Lebanon until he became counselor at the mixed court of appeals in Beirut (in that period, higher courts were presided by French judges).{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Following the independence of Lebanon, Mahmassani became president of the civil chamber of the court of appeals and cassation of Beirut, the then highest judicial instance in the country.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani took early retirement from his judicial career toward the end of 1946 to start a professional career as a lawyer.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

In early 1947, Mahmassani founded a law firm in Beirut and became an attorney.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} That career continued until his death in 1986.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} During that period, Mahmassani was appointed to lead a number of international arbitrations, some in highly visible cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/20692245?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102766952983 Arbitral tribunal: award in dispute between libyan american oil company (LIAMCO) and the government of the libyan arab republic relating to petroleum concessions] ''International Legal Materials'', Vol. 20(1), American Society of International Law, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biicl.org/files/3939_1977_liamco_v_libya.pdf Case summary: Libyan American Oil Company (LIAMCO) v The Libyan Arab Republic], in ''Damages in International Investment Law''. British Institute of International and Comparative Law, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public life and political career ==

The Mahmassani family is noted for its contributions to public life. On May 6, 1916 ([[Martyrs' Day (Lebanon and Syria)|Martyrs' Day]]), Sobhi's first cousins Mohammad and Mahmoud Mahmassani were publicly executed in what is now called [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut]] by [[Djemal Pasha|Jamal Pasha]], the Ottoman [[wāli]] of Greater Syria, because of their nationalist activities.

In 1944, Mahmassani was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the founding of the [[Arab League]] in Alexandria, Egypt, in the capacity of legal advisor.

In 1945, he was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|founding of the United Nations]] in San Francisco, USA, in the capacity of legal advisor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unalebanon.org/UNALebanon/aboutus.html United Nations Association of Lebanon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105142/http://www.unalebanon.org/UNALebanon/aboutus.html |date=2016-03-04 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; His role was recognized in a 2013 exhibition at the [[American University of Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.aub.edu.lb/~webmgate/spring05/2.html Signs of Peace], ''Main Gate'', American University of Beirut, Spring 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahmassani contributed to the modernization of Lebanese legislation and the creation of state institutions through his participation in the higher committee appointed for that purpose by President [[Fuad Chehab]] upon his election as President of the Republic in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp |title=Profiles of Lebanon's presidents since independence |publisher=Lebanonwire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120060845/http://lebanonwire.com/0805MLN/08052502AGC.asp |archivedate=2013-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Lebanese general election, 1964]], Mahmassani was elected to a four-year term as member of the Lebanese Parliament representing the capital city Beirut.  He did not seek re-election.

In 1966, he was appointed minister of national economy in the Lebanese government presided by [[Abdallah El-Yafi]], a position he occupied until 1968.

== Academic career ==

In parallel with his professional legal and political careers, Mahmassani had an academic career that spanned from the late 1930s to the late 1970s.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He joined the faculty of the [[American University of Beirut]] in 1936 and continued until 1964; over which period he taught several courses, namely Roman law, the laws of the Arab countries and Islamic law.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Around the same time, Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of [[Saint Joseph University]] in Beirut where he taught the comparative legal systems of the Arab countries.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani was a founder of the [[Lebanese University]] and its law school in the early 1960s; he was thus among its first professors teaching Islamic law.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of the [[Beirut Arab University]] when it opened its doors in Beirut.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

Finally, Mahmassani taught law courses at the Military Academy in Lebanon. During a certain period, Mahmassani was lecturing at five universities.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

As part of his academic career, Mahmassani visited a number of countries to give lectures as a visiting professor (such as in the US, the Netherlands, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia) or as participant in international conferences (such as in the US, France, Italy, Egypt, Iraq). In particular, in the summer of 1966, he gave a series of lectures at the [[Hague Academy of International Law]] on International law and relations in Islam.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

He was elected as a Member of the Arab Academies of Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

As a scholar of [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Mahmassani was noted for being open-minded towards other cultures and faiths, and is frequently quoted in discussions of ''Liberal Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;Kurzman, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">'''Textile stabilization''' is a [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|conservation method]] used to stabilize weak points in textile pieces and prevent further degradation or damage to the fabric. 

== Methods ==
=== Localized and Overall Support ===
Fabric may be used to provide support for the garment by stabilizing weak sections or by creating a backing or lining for the piece. Darning may be utilized on coarsely-woven fabrics with localized areas of damage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treatment of Textiles|url=http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/TSG_Chapter_VI._Treatment_of_Textiles_-_Section_H._Consolidation/Stabilization_-_Non-adhesive_Methods|website=AIC Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Fabric Properties====  
*Should not cause damage through friction with the original fabric
*Be of similar or lighter weight than the original fabric.
*Match the original fabric with consideration of the loss of color or sheen
*Be of a tight enough weave to exclude dust if being used as a barrier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fabrics Used for Stabilization|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/fabrics_used_for_stabilization_from_aic.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Overlay ===
Translucent or sheer fabrics are used to stabilize the textile without altering its appearance. This is typically done using nylon netting, silk crepeline, or polyester Tetex. Overlay is generally applied to textiles too fragile to withstand localized stitching methods. Overlay materials may be stitched to a more stable backing fabric. 

== Materials and Techniques ==
=== Conservation Stitching ===
Careful stitching is used to secure stabilizing materials to the original fabric. 
*Whip Stitch
*[[Running stitch|Running Stitch]]
*[[Backstitch|Back Stitch]]
*[[Herringbone stitch|Herringbone Stitch]]
*[[Couching|Laid Couching]]
*[[Darning]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Stitching Guide|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/conservation_stitching_guide.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nylon Netting ===
Textile Conservators may use either heat set or bobbinet netting, both of which do not fray but are susceptible to degradation and reactions from light. Netting may be used together with a backing fabric. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservation Netting|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/conservation_netting.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Heat Set ====
*Available in a variety of colors
*Some varieties are very stiff
==== Bobbinet====
*Available in fewer colors, but is easily dyed
*Has a better drape than heat set netting or Tetex

=== Silk Crepeline ===
[[Crepe (textile)|Silk Crepeline]]  Silk is less sheer than nylon netting and is also susceptible to reactions to light, but may be used as an overlay technique as well as for patching specific areas and can be easily dyed. Because it can fray, the edges need to be hemmed, which can create less sheer areas. 

=== Polyester Tetex (Stabiltex)=== 
The least sheer overlay material, Tetex also has a sheen and is available in a selected range of colors which are not easily dyed. The material does not require hemming but is the most difficult to drape over fabrics. It is most often chosen for its long term stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hot Cutting and Applying Sheer Overlays|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/uploads/7/8/9/0/7890082/hot_cutting_and_applying_polyester_sheer_overlays.pdf|website=Museum Textile Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=November 2009}}

The '''tyranny of numbers''' was a problem faced in the 1960s by [[computer engineering|computer engineers]].  Engineers were unable to increase the performance of their designs due to the huge number of components involved. In theory, every component needed to be wired to every other component (or at least many other components), and were typically strung and [[soldering|soldered]] by hand. In order to improve performance, more components would be needed, and it seemed that future designs would consist almost entirely of wiring.

==History==
The first known recorded use of the term in this context was made by the Vice President of [[Bell Labs]] in an article celebrating the 10th anniversary of the invention of the [[transistor]], for the "Proceedings of the IRE" (Institute of Radio Engineers), June 1958 [https://books.google.com/books?id=3BLGWnmQJ9IC&amp;pg=PA21]. Referring to the problems many designers were having, he wrote:

{{Quotation|For some time now, electronic man has known how 'in principle' to extend greatly his visual, tactile, and mental abilities through the digital transmission and processing of all kinds of information. However, all these functions suffer from what has been called 'the tyranny of numbers.' Such systems, because of their complex digital nature, require hundreds, thousands, and sometimes tens of thousands of electron devices.|Jack Morton|[http://everything2.com/e2node/The%2520Tyranny%2520of%2520Numbers The Tyranny of Numbers]}}

At the time, computers were typically built up from a series of "modules", each module containing the electronics needed to perform a single function. A complex circuit like an [[adder (electronics)|adder]] would generally require several modules working in concert. The modules were typically built on [[printed circuit boards]] of a standardized size, with a connector on one edge that allowed them to be plugged into the power and signaling lines of the machine, and were then wired to other modules using [[twisted pair]] or [[coaxial cable]].

Since each module was relatively custom,  modules were assembled and soldered by hand or with limited automation. As a result, they suffered major reliability problems. Even a single bad component or solder joint could render the entire module inoperative. Even with properly working modules, the mass of wiring connecting them together was another source of construction and reliability problems. As computers grew in complexity, and the number of modules increased, the complexity of making a machine actually work grew more and more difficult. This was the "tyranny of numbers".

It was precisely this problem that [[Jack Kilby]] was thinking about while working at [[Texas Instruments]]. Theorizing that germanium could be used to make all common electronic components - resistors, capacitors, etc. - he set about building a single-slab component that combined the functionality of an entire module. Although successful in this goal, it was [[Robert Noyce]]'s silicon version and the associated fabrication techniques that make the [[integrated circuit]] (IC) truly practical.

Unlike modules, ICs were built using [[photoetching]] techniques on an [[assembly line]], greatly reducing their cost. Although any given IC might have the same chance of working or not working as a module, they cost so little that if they didn't work you simply threw it away and tried another. In fact, early IC assembly lines had failure rates around 90% or greater, which kept their prices high. The [[U.S. Air Force]] and [[NASA]] were major purchasers of early ICs, where their small size and light weight overcame any cost issues. They demanded high reliability, and the industry's response not only provided the desired reliability, but meant that the increased yield had the effect of driving down prices.

ICs from the early 1960s were not complex enough for general computer use, but as the complexity increased through the 1960s, practically all computers switched to IC-based designs. The result was what are today referred to as the [[history of computing hardware|third-generation computers]], which became commonplace during the early 1970s. The progeny of the integrated circuit, the [[microprocessor]], eventually superseded the use of individual ICs as well, placing the entire collection of modules onto one chip.

[[Seymour Cray]] was particularly well known for making complex designs work in spite of the tyranny of numbers. His attention to detail and ability to fund several attempts at a working design meant that pure engineering effort could overcome the problems they faced. Yet even Cray eventually succumbed to the problem during the [[CDC 8600]] project, which eventually led to him leaving [[Control Data]].

'''Ultraviolet astronomy''' is the observation of [[electromagnetic radiation]] at [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths between approximately 10 and 320 [[Nanometre|nanometres]]; shorter wavelengths&amp;mdash;higher energy photons&amp;mdash;are studied by [[X-ray astronomy]] and [[gamma ray astronomy]].&lt;ref name="cox2000"&gt;{{cite book

==Overview==
Ultraviolet [[Spectral line|line spectrum]] measurements ([[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopy]]) are used to discern the chemical composition, densities, and temperatures of the [[interstellar medium]], and the temperature and composition of hot young stars. UV observations can also provide essential information about the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]].

The ultraviolet [[universe]] looks quite different from the familiar [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] seen in [[visible light]].
Most stars are actually relatively cool objects emitting much of their electromagnetic radiation in the visible or near-[[infrared]] part of the spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation is the signature of hotter objects, typically in the early and late stages of their [[stellar evolution|evolution]]. In the Earth's sky seen in ultraviolet light, most stars would fade in prominence. Some very young massive stars and some very old stars and galaxies, growing hotter and producing higher-energy radiation near their birth or death, would be visible. Clouds of gas and dust would block the vision in many directions along the [[Milky Way]].

Space-based solar observatories such as [[Solar Dynamics Observatory|SDO]] and [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] use ultraviolet telescopes (called [[Solar Dynamics Observatory#Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)|AIA]] and [[Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope|EIT]], respectively) to view activity on the Sun and its [[corona]]. Weather satellites such as the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite|GOES-R]] series also carry [[GOES-16#Sun-facing|telescopes]] for observing the sun in ultraviolet.

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and [[Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer|FUSE]] have been the most recent major [[space telescope]]s to view the near and far UV [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] of the sky, though other UV instruments have flown on smaller observatories such as [[GALEX]], as well as [[sounding rockets]] and the [[Space Shuttle]].

[[Charles Stuart Bowyer]] is generally given credit for starting this field.

==Pike and San Isabel National Forests==
In the [[Pike National Forest]] and [[San Isabel National Forest]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]], the upper montane forest is also called the "moist forest", with the mixed coniferous below called "dry forest", and the subalpine forest above called "cold forest".&lt;ref name=WP/&gt; Stands may have a shade intolerant ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') overstory, and a shade tolerant Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'') or white fir (''[[Abies concolor]]'') understory.&lt;ref name=WP/&gt;

==Cascades Range==
===Lassen Volcanic Park===
In [[Lassen Volcanic Park]] at the southern end of the [[Cascade Range]], the upper montane forest is also known as [[red fir forest]].&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; It has less diversity than the mixed coniferous forest below.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; It occurs between {{convert|6500|and|8000|ft|m}}, consists of dense stands of red fir ((''[[Abies magnifica]]''), and has little understory and few animals.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; In the western areas that are more open, western white pine ((''[[Pinus monticola]]'') can commonly be found.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; Lodgepole pine (''[[Pinus contorta]]'') occurs in areas of thin soils.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt; Summer temperatures are low in the almost total shade of the red fir.&lt;ref name=LVPNPS/&gt;

==Sierra Nevada range==
{{See|Sierra Nevada upper montane forest}}
On the western slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range, upper montane vegetation can be found at elevations from {{convert|5500|to|7500|ft|m}} in the northern part of the range, {{convert|6500|to|8000|ft|m}} in the central part, and {{convert|8000|to|10000|ft|m}} in the southern part.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; On the eastern slopes, it is at higher elevations. Precipitation in areas of upper montane forest vegetation type is {{convert|35|to|65|ft|m}}, mostly as snowfall.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; Summer high temperatures range from {{convert|73|to|85|F|C}}, and winter lows are below {{convert|26|F|C}}.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; Growing season is about four months because of long-lasting, deep snow.&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt; Overstory trees are typically cone shaped to shed the snow, with characteristic trees including lodgepole ping (''[[Pinus contorta]]''), Jeffrey pine (''[[Pinus jeffreyi]]''), western white pine (''[[Pinus monticola]]'') California red fir (''[[Abies magnifica]]''), and Sierra juniper (''[[Juniperus grandis]]''), and typical understory trees and shrubs such as huckleberry oak (''[[Quercus vaccinifolia]]'') and red heather (''[[Phyllodoce breweri]]'').&lt;ref name=SNW/&gt;
